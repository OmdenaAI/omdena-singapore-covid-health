treat those still battling the infection two people infected with the novel coronavirus completely recovered after receiving infusions of blood plasma from survivors but experts are still cautious about the effectiveness of the treatment South Korean officials are expected to announce guidelines on using plasma therapy for virus patients there aren't any approved treatments for Cobra 19 but those who are those are for other diseases are being studied to see if they can be used researchers are also experimenting with new treatments remedies aveer is an antiviral drug that is undergoing clinical trials as a potential covert 19 treatment Singapore is taking part in the global phase 3 trial to see if the drug is effective in treating patients and the participants include Singapore's National Centre for infectious diseases together with the National University Hospital and Singapore General Hospital recruitment of patients for the trial started in mid-february Japan's National Center for Global Health and medicine and the US National Institutes of Health are partners in the trial now for a closer look were dried by associate professor David live from the infectious disease research and training office at NCI d thank you very much a professor live for joining us so let's look at this room de severe drug it's new is actually used for treating Ebola so tell us more about this drug and the test so it is not exactly new as you know it was developed for Ebola it was trial in four or five years ago and it failed as an Ebola drug and because of the ongoing Middle East corona virus it was actually tested in the laboratory and in animal models and was found to be actually fairly very effective in fact it was the most effective drug in the laboratory and in the mouse model so when when the copy not in hit us we were looking around for what clinical trials we can run and like most other experts this is the drug that we felt is a most promising so well how it works is essentially by inhibiting how the virus replicates so you've really got to give it when there's through the virus in your body and however it was actually very difficult to get into this drug and there's the reason for that at the start of the academic when you were first hit Kovac nineteen the the outbreak was mainly in China and this drop was not and is not in commercial production so the company basically provided China with most of the drugs and was very difficult to get onto it we were very lucky we have the mastic foundation we have economic develop in our get in touch it give you the company that makes it and we're able to nourish rouse so at this stage and we were quite lucky because of course at the start of the epidemic there weren't that many sick patients but as we know now as we every pass a thousand map we have more and more people getting sicker in intensive care and this drop has has so far been tested in 21 patients who are sick enough to be in intensive care in single professor like how many patients are you actually targeting to recruit in Singapore and altogether internationally the photo force so this particular drug is tested in two trials internationally a moderate drought for 600 patients and a severe trial for corner patients in fact as of about last week the severe trial completed recruitment worldwide we're able to get extension for access to these drugs for our patients so so far we have recruited 21 patients in the severe arm we were allowed initiate 25 but will now extend it to 69 so I'm very delighted I just got a news two days ago that we can continue to get access to this trap for sick patients in Singapore current 19 so that is indeed good news but professor Lee how are these patients selected how do you go about choosing who gets this drug so this time randomized control trial so they have very fixed right we're very clear criteria is not like anyone can get onto it and we also know that because we have been following our patients for for 11 weeks now about 40% our patients remain very well these are not the people than any treatment but about 50 just over 50% of patients will develop lung infections we call pneumonia and about half of these patients will develop a fairly severe pneumonia within oxygen so essentially this trial that gilja runs two trials the modern arm requires the presence of pneumonia and the severe trial requires the use of oxygen so and it has the usual criteria where the patients keep concerned myself good kidney good liver function luckily for this infection most patients only have lung failure from the pneumonia so we have been able to get most wishes and need him onto the trucks now these trials have not been going on for very long but can you share some of the preliminary observations so far now did the final results are not out yet but I've asked my colleagues who are helping this trial in Singapore General in Mission Hospital as well in my Convention Center ID because the key extra is actually open label that means the doctors know which arm the patient is allocated to all of my colleagues felt that the drug seems to work very well the patients improve very quickly those who oxygen also got off too quickly but a caution about about this observation because in the randomized control trial you only know the final result when all the data are analyzed and that is that is the time you'll know the answer we probably will know the answer in about slightly more than a month that's my estimate I can't keep up the good work thanks for speaking to us this evening associate professor David Lee senior consultant and director at the infectious disease research and training office at NC ID ,True,True,False,False

2,QhKiopuZbtg,CNA Insider,Is The COVID-19 Vaccine Safe For Me? Your Questions Answered,2021-01-08T12:14:56Z,"Singapore has made early purchases of three vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on January 8, 2021, the first member of Singapore's Cabinet to do so.

In this #TalkingPoint episode, co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong, director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH) Vernon Lee and senior vice president (Health Education & Resources) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Benjamin Ong answer questions on the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination programme in Singapore. 

00:00 Why did someone test positive for COVID-19 after taking the vaccine?
01:32 Can the vaccine cause cancer?
02:13 Will someone with health conditions like high blood pressure suffer worse side effects?
03:33 Could there be long-term health effects – like the ability to conceive?
04:12 Does the fast-tracking of vaccines mean that they are less safe?
05:05 The virus is mutating. Is there any point in getting vaccinated?
05:52 If I get severe side effects, will the Government help with my medical bills?

Public healthcare institutions, including hospitals and polyclinics, will start vaccinations for staff in January 2021. Vaccinations for vulnerable communities such as the elderly and those at greater risk of severe COVID-19 will begin in February 2021.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",we understand a nurse in california after taking the first vaccination shot was then tested positive for the virus it's the timing it's too short what do you mean by that that means your body needs some time to develop an immune response right after the first dose only so soon after she actually had the dose she picked up the infection and she may have actually been incubating at the time that she had the vaccination done so one shouldn't read this as though it's a vaccine failure you have to wait for the vaccine to work and it takes time that's the other point that's important for the public to understand for example the fisa vaccine specifically you need to take two doses three weeks apart and after the second dose it takes about one to two weeks for the full you know immune reaction to develop so that means a total of about four to five weeks okay after the first dose is given now in between that time that individual is still susceptible to of course exposure and and that's why it is important for us now in singapore for us to roll out this vaccination program okay because when you roll it out in you know a situation where you have you have an epidemic you have a lot of cases then the situation that you had mentioned in this person in the u.s may occur because you are trying to vaccinate while the virus is circulating it's much better to vaccinate when you have very little virus circulating such that if a virus should you know be introduced in the future you have a population that is immune and then you know um right sort of prevent any outbreak from occurring there are studies showing that the vaccine can cause cancer and also effects on our health so at this point there's no evidence that this vaccine will result in such a side effect i mean most of the side effects that we have seen from the studies of our mild side effects and also the one that is known which is the severe allergic reaction in people the mrna component itself does not incorporate into our human dna it uh in fact after about 48 hours just sort of you know dissipates in in the body and disintegrates so um there's no evidence at this point that there's any such concern i'm 73 i have high blood pressure i have diabetes and i have poor kidney function my concern is that i will get worse side effects than a healthier person i think annie has raised a very important point but it's precisely that particular group of individuals who are older that have the co-mobilities that she mentioned that tend to get more ill and tend to have a higher mortality and it's specifically this group that we hope will take it up and get vaccinated over in the uk after the vaccination is given the doctors a monitoring patients they have them stick around for a period of time 15 minutes they'll monitor them i mean is that something we plan to do as well minister for sure we will be monitoring very closely everyone who is vaccinated in fact the authorities are looking at data not just from singapore but they are monitoring data from the vaccination program everywhere in the world clinical trials when it did devise a vaccine quite a number of those individuals were in fact individuals with comorbid medical conditions because this are the target crew for the vaccines because of the complications and of the many millions of people who are vaccinated now you know in the uk the u.s and elsewhere there's a huge diversity in terms of you know age medical conditions etc so there is a wealth of data showing that you know the vaccine is safe it's impossible for us to know what are the three to five to ten year long term effects that it'll have like for example if and when i want to have kids will it be harder to conceive like any other drug vaccine we will have to of course monitor over the longer term to see if there are any rare side effects that might occur but at this point there's no evidence that for example ability to conceive would be an issue how concerned should i be about long-term side effects likelihood that there'll be long-term issues i think is very remote the place safe per se we have not recommended that if you are pregnant at present you will take the vaccine wait until after you deliver before you take the vaccine i guess one of the concerns is also because things have happened so fast there is concern that the vaccines may not be as safe as what was traditionally the actual clinical trials process all right the reason the companies have been able to shorten the process are twofold number one we are in a pandemic there's no shortage of volunteers wanting to come forward perhaps not in a country like singapore where the virus is you know not raging but in uk us there are no shortage of volunteers coming forward they all won the vaccine right now right and number two they have been able to get these trials going on a concurrent basis not trimming back not compromising but in parallel and therefore shortening the time so the entire process of validation testing trialling looking at the data has not been compromised a single bit but as we are talking about this a new strain came about what's the point of taking the vaccine yeah well mutations occur all the time so far as we can tell it seems like it probably would still work it's being actively tested and we'll know very soon because more than two three million people now in the uk and the us have received the vaccine one of our bioinformatics expert doctor sebastian morvis wrote he likens mutations to like the different number plate or color of a car the same make same model different license plate we see many of them all around the time and sometimes you know you might have a car with new tires it might you know be a bit more efficient move faster and so on but it's still the same make at this point there's no evidence that it has changed to another make another model another brand i'd like to know if the government would help to copy my medical bills should i get any severe side effects from it well that's a it's a very relevant concern in fact not just for a covet vaccine but for any vaccination program after we've authorized we've verified that safe and effective one can never rule out the possibilities of a very rare and serious side effect effect occurring it will be very rare but it may happen so we've been looking at this and we think that there is a possibility of putting in place a vaccination injury assistance program where the government comes in for such instances to help pay for the medical cost associated with it you ,True,True,False,False

Huang also added that less than five patients took part in a clinical trials and the results were only modest it is not a magic there's going to kill all diseases it is not a magic bullet that's going to treat all kinds of inflammatory conditions but however I think MSS can be improved in the way we isolate the emesis blow the MS es and enhance the potential of MSDS in future but this is something many scientists around the world including us are looking at to improve this in future for our patients the health ministry added that it will continue to work with local healthcare institutions and international partners to closely follow developments uncovered 19 treatment options the ministry will only adopt treatments backed by clinical data ,True,False,True,False

Launched on July 15, 1845, its comprehensive coverage of world news, East Asian news, Southeast Asian news, home news, sports news, financial news and lifestyle updates makes The Straits Times the most-read newspaper in Singapore.",[Music] employers should not make vaccination compulsory but may do so for staff in higher risk settings a british man seen in a viral video without a mask shows up at court today not wearing one and here it is the national day parade a theme song for this year i love it [Music] happy friday you're watching the big story i'm hariyan to demand you can subscribe to the street signs channel so you never miss a single episode the ministry of manpower national trades union congress and singapore national employers federation have issued a joint advisory on covet 19 vaccination in the workplace let's take a look at a few key points first employers should not make vaccination mandatory and they cannot terminate or threaten to terminate employees if they decline to be vaccinated but employers may require vaccination for higher risk employment settings and may state this requirement at the point of recruitment or advertisement for new hires for a closer look executive director of the singapore human resources institute elvingo joins me now welcome to the show alvin alvin when you spoke to olivia on june 15th you mentioned that there were ongoing discussions regarding guidelines on vaccination in the work setting and today we are seeing these guidelines how helpful are these for employers and employees right thanks for having me i think this new set of guidelines are really determined on the risk based metrics and together the tripartite partners have now provided a stronger guidance through the identification of certain jobs you know its unique working environment as well as the frequency of unnecessary interaction uh or exposure and classifying these jobs as what they call high risk employment activities or jobs and the other key guidance from the tripartite partners is that companies today now should they wish to do so can require a cov19 vaccination as a company policy for this high risk employment positions now as we recover and also on the top of that companies can also now recover cov19 related costs for example uh testing costs or cost of stay home notice accommodation incurred by the employer from employees uh so somewhat at the end or they decline vaccinations right and i think on the other hand itself it's also good to point out that under no circumstances should the employer terminate or threaten to terminate the services of an employee on the grounds of declining vaccination and can these guidelines be enforced alvin and remind us again what can employees do in the event that they feel they're being put in an unfavorable position due to the vaccination status right you know at the end of the day vaccination is still a very personal decision and i believe it's very strongly that employees still can have that right to actually decide for themselves what is best right however uh the new guidelines now allowed employers to include as i said mentioned earlier on a company-wide policy to require kovit-19 vaccination for employees right to work in high-risk positions you know on top of that uh employees themselves could actually also look into uh you know seeking help from the unions or from mlm for advice or or some form of assistance should they find themselves in any unfavorable positions but the bottom line here is that regardless of having that company-wide policy under no circumstances should an employer terminate or threaten to terminate the services of any employee on the grounds of declining vaccination i think that's the message is very very clear all right that employees should not be penalized because they still have a right to whether they want to take up the vaccination itself or not great points there alvin thank you so much for setting aside time to speak with me that was elvin go executive director of the singapore human resources institute private hire car drivers temperature screeners and those super form swap tests will soon be listed as public service workers and be better protected under harassment laws from next wednesday july 7th under the protection from harassment act those who abuse harass or dox these workers while they perform their duty will face double the maximum jail term of up to 12 months compared with the maximum six months when the victim is not a public service worker on to singapore's covet 19 figures three new cases in the community were reported today including one unlinked infection the two linked cases were detected through surveillance either community testing or when a person goes to a gp to seek medical attention seven other cases were imported with four detected when they arrive here and the remaining three developed coveted 19 during x-hn or isolation more details will be released tonight meanwhile thousands of people here who've had allergic reactions to the vaccines used in the nation's inoculation program will be offered synovic jabs by the government this is part of a study to understand the immunity offered by different vaccines st has learned that about 3 600 people who are allergic to the first dose of the mrna vaccines have been contacted and more than 1 400 have indicated interest in the program responding to as this queries the health ministry said it will work with the national center for infectious diseases to follow up with a subgroup of these people who have received the mrna vaccine followed by the cyanovac vaccine under research study on covate 19 vaccine immune response journalist haris baharudin is here to share more haris how did you find out about this study that moh is conducting thanks ian so what happened was that i was on social media as we sometimes go on to to look for our stories and i noticed that some some people had actually posted about this this study that was unfamiliar to me you know they said that they had gotten a message about potentially receiving this uh cyanoback vaccine so i i checked it was something that was not reported about before then i went to some of my editors and and they also said it was not something that sounded very familiar and and so we decided to to just ask moh for more details and that's when they they told us about this study that was going on and they shared the numbers and all that and harris what more has moh shared about this study so other than verifying that the study is actually going to happen or is it likely happening already they did share the numbers that jan you mentioned earlier and i suppose that following this we will find out more details about what the the study seeks to aim you know we're not sure about what the results will be yet but i guess we'll just have to wait and see i think one question that people will have on their minds after finding out about this study is is to know if the government is considering you know rolling out mixed doses of the vaccines and and how this would affect things how this would affect things like your pre-event testing you know at which which we had earlier reported that uh synovac backseat people who've been jets i know back will not be exempted from and aharis on that note we've also done another story as well that captured people's response to the news that people are upset about that has moh given any updates so to recap right what mmh had said is that vaccines only in the national vaccination program will be exempted from from your pre-event testing so this refers to the two pfizer biotech combination and the modern vaccines the cyanobac vaccine is not part of the national vaccination program as far as any updates are concerned on that front i'm afraid that there's not much beyond that for now we are still trying to find out how many people have been jabbed with sinovac so far uh we have some idea based on speaking to some of the clinics that that michaeli and i spoke to but other than that we don't have official figures yet i think having such figures would give us a good idea about how large this group is and from there we can go into discussions about what this would mean for you know the the other measures like pre-event testing for instance you know how would the records differ from for someone who has been jabbed with a sinovac as opposed to to the other two vaccines and how that would affect the kind of safety measures that they have to go through well thank you so much haris that was my colleague journalist haris baharudin in other kovat19 related news a british man who was filmed not wearing a mask on an mrt train in may was handed three charges in court today now arriving at the state courts building initially without a mask and putting on one when a security officer asked him to do so benjamin clean was charged with being a public nuisance

willing to consider a mandatory treatment order for his client offenders given an mto will have to undergo treatment to address their mental issues in lieu of jail term even as the national day parade returns to the float at marina bay this year singaporeans are still in for a treat as the celebrations are set to take place across the island while you can look forward to watching crowd favorites like the red lions the aerial display by the rsaf helicopters and fighter jets and fireworks displays in some residential areas the red lions are set to make their free fall jumps on august 7th and 8th the weekend before national day now those tuning in the parade and show segments from home will also be able to enjoy special effects on their televisions with their shows set to blend live performances and animated short films by local artists meanwhile this year's ndp theme song along with the parades logo and theme were unveiled today the song titled the road ahead tells the adversity singapore has faced throughout its history and about how the nation has overcome the odds the music video is the first of its kind to blend live scenes with animations for an ndp video as for the parade theme together on singapore spirit the ndp organizers say that it builds on lars's theme and as a reminder of singaporeans shared identity and how we have come together as one united people well stay on till the end of the show as we bring you a snippet of the music video and now for euro 2020 with just eight teams remaining who will be crowned champions of europe the quarterfinals kick off tonight with switzerland playing spain followed by belgium vs italy and tomorrow we'll see the czech republic take on denmark followed by england versus ukraine for more on the teams let's bring in sports correspondent david lee welcome back to the show david we are down to the final eight teams and the two surprises for me are switzerland and ukraine what do you think is this as far as they will go in the tournament oh well you're not wrong three of the four third place teams that qualify for the knockout rounds are still in the tournament and switzerland and ukraine are two of them along with czech republic of course and they have had to beat three group winners in france sweden and holland so yeah big surprises there and if it can happen once it can happen again you know and as i said before on this show miracles happen in the knockout rounds and switzerland will be looking for another one against spain last week they beat world champions france and they have to get past another world champion in the form of spain to make it to the semi-finals and they have only beaten spain once in 22 previous encounters and that was in the 2010 world cup group stage and incidentally spain went on to win the world title their first world title personally i think it's a it is a bridge too far for for switzerland because the spanish attack is clicking into gear at the right time and if even alvaro morata can score opponents are going to be in trouble furthermore the swiss will miss the ability and experience of granite chaka in midfield and the spanish could should see this one out ukraine on the other hand will fancy the chances against england even they if they also have beaten the three lions just once in the previous seven encounters england manager gareth salgade is right to say this is the most dangerous period for england the good news is raheem sterling is in great form and harry kane is scoring again they are not the prettiest sight to watch but who cares as long as they are effective so that's it david i cannot let you go without asking this will you be sticking to your prediction of an england italy final you can still change your mind okay i i think england have a clear path to the final if they cannot beat ukraine and then denmark or czech republic they don't deserve a chance to win only the second major trophy the other half of the draw is the one that is more stacked with italy playing belgium in the quarterfinals and this could turn out uh to be one that is very hard to call you know to be honest i wasn't particularly impressed with both teams in around 16 wins because i felt they were playing like they were scared of getting knocked out and not like the formidable teams that they are and this is understandable this could be the last or second last chance before next year's world cup for belgium to win their first international title through their golden generation that includes kibo kotwa yam vertonghen kevin de bruyne eden hazard and romelu lukaku on the other hand italy had been flying under the radar for too long before the tournament but not anymore they set a new national record of 31 matches unbeaten they have shown that other than a miserly defense they have attacking players such as andrea belotti and federico kiezer who can turn it on when it matters for my prediction to come true they have to beat belgium i just have to go with my gut and persist persist with with italy who were my pre-tournament picks maybe the experience of winning four world cups and one european championship as a nation will give them the extra edge that is required in these tight affairs and then they will have to spread it out again against spain possibly in the semi-finals but you know what we can predict all we want but you know it could turn out to be a switzerland ukraine final for all we know so you know we've just seven games remaining in this tournament and and you know the tournament has come to life let's just enjoy the quarterfinals first shall we well thank you so much david for setting us aside time to speak with us that was our sports correspondent david lee and those are our top stories for

7,XS77MmVZ_fQ,SPD Singapore,Speech therapy amid the COVID-19 situation,2020-11-18T07:35:01Z,"Our speech therapists have been providing remote support in the last few months amid the COVID-19 situation. They share here their insights, experiences and challenges adapting to this change in service delivery, as well as how they did so through innovation and technology. 

Big thanks to all speech therapists for their hard work and dedication in this time of change.

#speechtherapy #remotesupport #technology #innovation #covid19",in this segment we have gathered st's from all over spd to find out how they've been this covet season they will share with us some of the challenging experiences that they face during this period and more importantly how they've innovated adapted and learned from this experience it was a new take to to therapy something that's uh sort of unknown the decision started to happen very fast like how do we go with e concern and what should go with the e concern and having to wear a mask all the time i think it really affects our service provision as speech therapist because now we have trouble listening to what they're saying for the dsls program one of the most challenging part is that our program was suspended for a bit there were changes in the covet guidelines um like earlier in the year there was like the introduction of fhm leaf of absence etc so there were there was an increase in the number of students being absent from time to time when we had session schedule some of the changes that we faced was that we actually had to see children more often so instead of seeing the usual ones we ended up seeing them two to three times a week because we were only allowed to see it about four and just recently increased to six preschools each time uh i think the the trikipat was the boundaries like there was no more work and home boundaries uh what i found the most challenging was actually the technical difficulties learning about the technology for ourselves uh was another huge learning curve right in the beginning learning how to use airbeam to like share the ipad screen on the computer i think there was constantly innovation about you know where to put the camera you can do like um two different views how can you show your communication chat it was challenging because we had to work around they may not have devices we may not have like fire room for themselves for some of the more older clients we actually taught them step by step to um yeah to how to access the ipad what to play and then we find ways to okay how is it easier to design without having to sign in so at the beginning making sure that every child at least had access to a laptop had access to an ipad or something where they could do the sessions i think 3d printing is a bit tough because you can't physically be there to like control the environment the therapy procedures and materials need to be modified and adapted to accommodate for the lack of physical contact with the client we really have to make our activities motivating because it's like if the child felt very broad then it was it's very difficult for us to sort of like bring them back one of it is now using the home resources and also having to use things like picture matching games the amount of prep time that we needed and being able to scout for things one of the things that's good about study practice is also that because they are at home so the parents tend to be there also so they can see what you're doing but then you actually can't see what they're doing so you need somebody there to be like the interpreter and then you also need to train the parent how to do that which is something new for them given the nature of our epic clients they are very young they are not going to engage with us online so we went from working with the children to working with adults so we had e contacts with the parents um instead uh as a team um so that the st will work together with the teacher um or the site um to have meetings with parents because we are so used to having play-based routines in the classroom and the age range is so varied and it's all group based activities suddenly it's all one-to-one and i think that was the biggest transition of course parents also had their own challenges in terms of finding time and they were working and working from home so we had to think about very bite-sized activities that still targeted the children's goals that we could get the parents to demonstrate to us how to improve the activity or the strategy and then we could give life impact i felt that i learned a lot more about how the kids are doing it at home and how to support the parents better in all aspects i'm actually communicating way more parents so we do quite a bit of video calls and i also send them videos of their child during our sessions and also for homework as well what i need for them to complete with the new social distancing measures when school reopen providing in-class support for students is not allowed in the schools currently this period prompted me to really work very closely with the classroom teachers uh just to kind of like check in and also actually make me aggressively ask for their lesson plans so that i can see what curriculum topics they're teaching so that i can do a bit of revision with the kid and then check in with the teachers we did continue to have training so the one training that we do i see them here today for preschool teachers so initially it used to always be face-to-face so converting the materials to online platform [Applause] [Music] you

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",my friends keep saying which vaccine should i choose what are the real differences between the two vaccines essentially there's not much difference efficacy of both vaccine is about the same it's about 95 the fisa vaccine is two doses with 21 days apart the modern vaccine also requires two doses 28 days apart the main difference is that the dose of the two vaccines are different so pfizer is 30 micrograms modernist hundred micrograms so i took the modern vaccine does that mean that it is three times more potent than the pfizer vaccine no yeah it does not the difference in the dose is a very practical issue because they had to make a guesswork as to where the sweet spot for the dose of the vaccine is going to be pfizer narrow it down to 30 more than it narrowed down to a hundred i think in reality it's somewhere in between so what explains the gap between pfizer and modena the 21 days and the 28 days and does it matter it doesn't matter by and large the rule of thumb is that about a month apart is about right if you stretch it out a bit more it actually could be even better because you're giving the immune system time to learn the problem though is that people tend to forget to come back if you stretch it out what about side effects then does it mean that if it's a higher dosage you are going to get more side effects it does look that way at least in the phase 3 trial data where especially on a second dose the reaction to the side effects like tiredness the rate of fever and all that appears to be more common in the modern vaccine compared to the physical vaccine but we cannot be sure that it's entirely due to those what causes side effects to begin with it's our immune response to the vaccine the side effects is in some way a good sign that your immune system is reacting to the vaccine right but for those who did not experience any side effects the data is showing that you are still getting a good immune response why are we still seeing people who get infected after they have been vaccinated now what we're seeing are actually mutants mutants which are quite different from the original strand in fact it's like the syllabus that has been changed so now when i used to score 95 marks with this standard syllabus exams i do worse off because i is a totally different mutant it's a totally different syllabus but even if we went back to the original stream the efficacy was only 95 which means while the 100 people there are five of them will still end up with an illness but we understand that to be mild what i'm hearing a lot is people around me saying that you see you see you get vaccinated you still can get infected so what is the point of getting vaccinated changes from severe disease to a mouth disease and from mild disease to a asymmetric disease so our responsibility is not just about not falling sick with corvette 19 but it's also preventing the severe forms which require oxygen or requires intensive care because eventually you don't want to destroy your hospital and your health care system how long will my protection last overall about 30 of us will have very long lasting antibodies that will cope and the other 70 percent won't have enough antibodies it will fall with time or they never mount adequately and in those cases all the more you need to remind the immune system by going for a booster vaccine when you see the 30 percent whose immunity or protection may last for a long time what kind of time frame are we looking at we're talking about years at the least eventually i suspect we will all have to do a blood test for antibody levels when the antibody levels fall to a certain low level we probably have to go for vaccination again how exactly do booster shots work booster shots work by jolting the memory of the immune system antibody levels fall but when you do a booster shot you shoot the levels very very high in fact superman high when that happens you'll be able to fight the virus even if it was a mutant are the booster shots interchangeable meaning if i start off with modern i can take a pfizer booster if you think about the size of vaccinology you should be fine because you are stimulating the same protein again the same spike protein one good possible outcome is this we may be able to find good matches of different vaccines that will even exceed what we'll be getting all along with the traditional two doses of the same vaccines prof i think many of us are looking forward to the past [Music] whereby we need not have social distancing we can meet as many friends as we want and we don't have to wear masks is that likely to happen it's like looking into the crystal ball so we aren't really very sure but personally i don't see this happening for the next three to four years at least to achieve 80 vaccination of the population the countries around us will still not be anywhere near that so that means travel will still be limited for the large part [Music] exercising the day before my jab will boost my immunity and the efficacy of the vaccine true or false false the main reason is because some people when they do too much exercise the following day they may experience some discomfort from the strenuous exercise and that actually makes the immune system even worse than usual i personally experience quite a bit of soreness on my arm i was told that if i moved my arm a lot it actually helps through a vault that is actually true keeping the arm mobile helps to improve the blood circulation of the arm and prevents the joints from stiffening this one is my mom's favorite piece of advice drink plenty of water after the injection it will help true or false it is true and false okay apologies to mommy why we do advise a light snake and adequate hydration before the vaccine and adequate hydration after the vaccine but sometimes over hydration may cause swelling may cause a bloatedness to some people who are not so mobile it can even cause water retention so we advise to just eat and drink as what one would normally do not necessarily have to do in excess alcohol can affect my immune response this question is a little bit complicated to answer chronic alcoholism definitely will affect one's immune system and it will dampen a person's immunity but having a glass or two alcohol wouldn't affect a person's immunity or the vaccine's efficacy will poppings paracetamol before the jab help no it wouldn't the reason being is because we don't recommend taking medication without symptoms for those who really want to maximize the efficacy of the vaccine is there anything we can do yeah regular exercise and balance healthy diet and most importantly is adequate sleep that would be the best advice to anyone to boost the efficacy of the vaccine even just one night of good sleep the day before can really helps to boost one's immunity [Music] you ,True,True,False,False

10,QHgWoUg3uIA,Singapore General Hospital,Introduction to High Flow Oxygen Therapy,2021-03-02T07:47:25Z,,these are the types of high flow oxygen devices available in sgh first is the mr850 system that is used in the mica and micu the next is the evo2 system that can be found in the surgical hydes sicu and watt 68. these are the physiological benefits of high flow oxygen therapy there is a more reliable delivery of fio2 because there is less entrainment of room air due to the higher flow rates the higher flow rates also wash out the dead space in the nasal pharynx and result in less carbon dioxide rebreathing there is a small peak effect of about two to five centimeters of water and this helps with alveolar recruitment finally because the gas delivered is heated and humidified this leads to improved mucocilary clearance you can consider high flow oxygen therapy in patients with type 1 respiratory failure and a pf ratio of less than 300 there should be no co2 retention and no history of chronic respiratory failure if your patient fulfills any of the mentioned exclusion criteria they should not be started on high flow oxygen therapy and you should consider intubation instead for a patient who has been started on high flow oxygen therapy these are the signs of failure that you should look out for first are signs of persisting or worsening respiratory failure second hemodynamic instability and third neurological deterioration if your patient has been on high flow oxygen therapy for more than 48 hours and does not show signs of improvement consider if there is a need for intubation in this patient it is important to remember that high flow oxygen therapy is not an alternative to intubation prolonged high flow oxygen use despite failure of therapy can delay intubation and increase mortality it is therefore important to ensure that the patient selection is correct and to intubate early if your patient shows signs of failure this is how you initiate high flow oxygen therapy start with a flow rate of 60 liters and an fio2 of 0.6 adjust your fio2 to target an spo2 of more than 92 percent it is important to monitor your patients closely after initiating high flow oxygen therapy if there are signs of failure stop high flow oxygen therapy immediately and intubate your patient if your patient shows signs of improvement you can wean the fl2 gradually and maintain an spo2 above 92 percent the gas flow rate should only be decreased when the fio2 has been decreased to below 0.5 maintaining the spo2 above 92 you can consider weaning to regular oxygen delivery device when the flow rate is less than 40 liters the fio2 is less than 0.4 and the spo2 is maintained above 90 on these settings these are the parts of the nasal cannula you have the nasal prongs the fastener the head strap the tubing and a pendant first remove the fastener and place the nasal prongs into your patient's nostril secure the fastener and ensure that the feet is not make sure that you can put two fingers in between the patient's face and the strap when selecting the size of the nasal prong ensure that the nasal prong occludes at least 50 percent of the patient's nostril next we will wear the pendant for the patient this ensures that the circuit does not pull on the nasal prongs high flow oxygen therapy using the mr850 system these are the requisites that you would need for the high flow therapy first you have your different sizes of nasal cannulas you have s m and l two pieces of alcohol swabs the high flow circuit which consists of a humidifier a short tubing and a long tubing that has two different sides this side will be connected to the humidifier and this side will be connected to the patient there are two different colored wires one is a yellow heater wire and the other one is a blue temperature probe finally you will need a 3 liter water for irrigation bag this is how you set up the mr850 system first using the humidifier load it in onto the humidifier plate ensuring that there is a click and the humidifier is stable next remove the covering and also the humidifier line next take the short tubing that was in the circuit and connect one side to the air outlet and the other side to the humidifier using the long tubing take the outlet side connected to the humidifier your patient side will be connected to the high flow nasal cannula next take your 3 litre water bag and hang it on the pole and then we will remove the spike and spike the bag after the bag is piped ensure that the water is flowing into the chamber next is the connection of the temperature probe there is a small arrow on the temperature probe and it should line up with this arrow here when you put it in ensure that there is a click same goes for the yellow heater wire next we'll be connecting the probe itself to the circuit ensure that you use the three pin end and connect it to the back of the patient circuit now will be the connection of the temperature probe there are two ends this is the chamber probe that goes to the end of the patient circuit and this is the airway probe that is closer to the patient before you insert the probes ensure you clean it with an alcohol swab align the arrow on the chamber probe with this switch similarly for the airway probe that is closer to the patient clean it with an alcohol swab remove this cap and insert it this is how you would operate the heater plate there is an on and off button the mod button which consists of invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation as well as a silence button so first press and hold till all the values light up [Music] silence the machine as required next select the appropriate heating settings how you would change from invasive to non-invasive would be to press and hold till the light stops flashing at the intended settings there are two components that control the high flow oxygen therapy first is the air blender and the gas flow meter to select the fio2 or oxygen concentration that you would like to deliver you can use this dial here and line up this small arrow to the concentration that you would like to deliver controlling the gas flow would be by using the gas flow meter turn this knob here to determine the amount of gas that you would like to deliver and how you ensure that is by looking at where the center of the ball is high flow oxygen therapy using the avo2 systems these are the equipment that you would need nasal prongs you have the s m and l the avo2 circuit together with a humidifier the evo circuit has two ends this end is the machine n and this end is the patient n urinate and oxygen tubing flow oxygen flow meter and a three liter water for irrigation bag this is how you set up the evo2 first take the humidifier and ensure that it is in this setting load it onto the heater plate push down and slide the humidifier in there will be a click when the humidifier is loaded properly next is the connection of the patient tubing this is the patient tubing this side connects to the machine there are two pins here that needs to line up with this prong here put it in the blue flange has to be down to ensure that it is locked connect your oxygen tubing from the machine to the flow meter when connecting to the machine ensure that this is secured next connect the other end of the oxygen tubing to your flow meter finally you will need to spike your water back when you have spiked the water back ensure that the fluid is flowing and is filling up your heater humidifier this is how you would turn on the evo first press the power button till you hear the beep and that indicates that the machine is now turned on the machine will take a moment to calibrate the first display that would show would be on the disinfecting status only use the evo if the disinfecting status is in the green zone if it's in the yellow zone do not use it and get a different machine once that display goes away the machine will calibrate a second time once the machine is calibrated there will be three numbers that are displayed first would be the temperature second guess flow and finally oxygen concentration for you to toggle between the three settings there is an arrow button that is pointing to the right press it to select either temperature gas flow or oxygen concentration to go to the main screen press that arrow again for instance you would like to change the gas flow and there is a padlock symbol shown there this means that the settings are locked out to unlock the settings concurrently press both the up and down button together when you press and hold and the machine is now unlocked the settings will be flashing and you are able to adjust to the desired settings once you are done press back the right arrow so that it locks the settings again press it one more time to go to the main screen oxygen concentration for the avo2 is determined by the amount of oxygen that is bled into the evo system to increase the oxygen concentration increase the amount of oxygen that you are bleeding in the first component of cleaning would include using the water and the sponge stick place the water in the kidney dish open your sponge stick and wet the sponge stick next clean the elbow from the top and from the side ensuring that you do not clean the left hand port next you will need to connect the red decontamination tube to the elvo tool this side has the pins ensure that it is lined up with the prongs once connected ensure that the flange is locked next this end connects to the left side and this blue cap to the right side once the red decontamination tube is connected turn on the elvo again to start the decontamination process the machine will auto calibrate and start decontamination on its own when decontamination is in progress there will be a countdown timer that is displayed on the display screen once the decontamination process is over you will need to store the evo2 in its approved storage cover please ensure that you write the date that the machine was decontaminated finally cover your avocado you ,False,False,True,False

#COVID19 #SARSCoV2 #VitaminD","Kyle Allred: Dr. Seheult, you've advocated for 
vitamin D as a potential way to prevent COVID-19   infections to prevent severe COVID-19 infections. 
You've talked about this for a few months now   and over the past several months, the 
evidence continues to grow. There's more   and more publications in peer-reviewed 
medical journals about the possible   connection between vitamin D and COVID-19. 
So you've put together a presentation for us.  Tell us about what your presentation's all about.
Dr. Seheult: Yeah thanks, Kyle. So we've been   talking about vitamin D as a potential 
therapeutic agent for COVID-19 since   March, and since that time a lot of other people 
have become involved in looking at that agent,   as well a number of research studies have been 
done, and the purpose of this is to sort of look   at the evolution and the thinking of the use 
of vitamin D in COVID-19. So what we do is we   look back even before COVID-19 and what was the 
evidence for vitamin D in acute chest infections,  for instance influenza, and 
what was the data there?  And then we look at the epidemiological evidence 
for vitamin D as a therapeutic agent in COVID-19,   and then finally moving along to actual cases,
hospitalizations, and then we build up   with that hierarchy of evidence with 
vitamin D and COVID-19 to randomized   placebo-controlled trials, which of course 
are the gold standard for therapeutics. Okay, so let's talk about vitamin D. 
The first thing you've got to understand   is that vitamin D is not just a vitamin. 
Vitamin D is actually a hormone and if you   notice here by the structure you'll see that 
it is a steroid hormone, which means it can   go into the nucleus. It can go through membranes 
and make effective changes and, specifically,  the vitamin D receptor is a member of this   nuclear receptor/steroid hormone 
superfamily and so, as you can see here,   we have vitamin D going through the membrane 
and affecting a binding to the receptor   and then it actually goes into the nucleus, 
where it can affect transcriptional change.  This is really important. So this is not just 
some vitamin that you need to supplement with;   this is actually a hormone that changes the 
way your cells in the body actually behave. Kyle: Is this idea unique to vitamin D 
or does this happen with other vitamins? And in addition to that what what are some of the 
main differences between a vitamin and a hormone? Dr. Seheult: Good question. So, you know, a 
vitamin is actually a shortened version of a   vital amine, vital meaning you need it to live and 
an amine is a type of chemical compound. You know,   vitamin D is not even an amine. Of course it's 
vital, but it's not as if you need a certain   amount of this substance to just keep the body 
going and doing what it needs to do. No I mean   vitamin D is so much more complex than 
that. We used to think that vitamin D   was just involved in calcium regulation, and that 
is certainly true there's no question about that,  but vitamin D is so much more than 
that. It's a fat soluble vitamin,   which means it can pass through membranes 
without any problem. It doesn't need to be   regulated. It can bind with the receptor and go 
directly into the cellular portion, the nucleus   in fact, and actually cause or prevent 
transcription of RNA, and we've seen that there   are vitamin D receptors in numerous cell types, 
including  the cell types of the immune system.   So in that sense, it is a hormone but in another 
sense, you can only produce enough of this if you   have enough sunlight or if you're taking this in 
a dietary supplement form. You can't make this   without sunlight or getting a dietary form, so 
in that sense it is vital that you have it, and   in the loose sense it is a vitamin. So to get to 
your second question about hormones and vitamins,   hormones are something that the body uses to 
signal and to make effect changes throughout   the body. For instance, insulin is 
a hormone. Cortisol is a hormone. These things circulate through the body and they   have different effects on 
different target tissues. Vitamins are more along the lines of something 
that you need as a cofactor or something else to   get something to work, and so in that sense 
vitamin d is is certainly a vitamin because   your body needs it in order to live but in other 
sense, it's so much more than just the vitamin. So how do you get this vitamin D? I know this 
looks a little complicated, but bear with me. The key that you need to understand is that it's 
the 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D that's the active form,   and it says here that it does come from the 
kidneys, but in fact we now know that the   rate limiting step that puts that one hydroxyl 
group on is not just in the kidneys; it's also   in the immune cells, and it can actually 
put that on and have effective change in   your immune cells themselves. So let's 
talk a little bit about how this happens.   So there's basically two ways you can get vitamin 
D into your diet. You can either eat it through a   supplementation, swallow it, you can take pills, 
it's also found in fish oil, certain types of   mushrooms, egg yolks, and also red meat, or the 
majority of people get vitamin D into their system   from the sun. Why is that? Because ultraviolet B 
radiation penetrates down deep into the dermis,  where this cholesterol derivative is converted 
into pre-vitamin D3 and then finally into vitamin   D. Now that vitamin D3, after it's produced by the 
sun, goes to the liver and the 25-hydroxyl gets   put onto it. This species here, the 25-hydroxy 
vitamin D, is what we actually measure in the   blood. Whether you get it from diets or whether 
you get it from the sun, there's two ways of   getting it, but this is how we can measure it, 
and that's how you're going to see it measured   and reported in the rest of this presentation is 
25(OH)D. This is kind of like the storage product   in your body. It's fat soluble, it is stored in 
the fat, then when it's needed, it can either   go to the immune system where it's converted 
into 1,25(OH)2D, which is the active form,   or it can go to the kidney and it can be 
converted there to 1,25(OH)2D. Now the one   in the kidney is usually used for metabolism of 
calcium and phosphorus and things of that nature,  but there's a whole other area. 
In fact, they found many vitamin D   receptors in the leukocytes or the white 
blood cells, your immune cells, in the body. Now, the other thing you ought to know is that 
this 1.25()H)2D, which is the active form, can be inactivated when they put a hydroxyl 
group (""they"" being the 24-hydroxylase enzyme) can inactivate it by hydroxylatin 24 position 
could also do it here with 25 hydroxy from the   kidney as well. So this is the inactive form. 
There is some evidence and if you want more   information about this, look at COVID-19 update 
83 in our MedCram series, and you'll see that high   fructose corn syrup actually can accelerate 
this inactivation of both the 125-dihydroxy   vitamin D and also the 25-hydroxy vitamin D to 
the inactive form, so that's not to say that   other sugars with fructose couldn't do that, but 
that's what the studies showed that we presented   in update 83. So you may be supplementing, you may 
be out in the sun, but if you have a diet that's   high in high fructose corn syrup, and I'm not 
talking about fructose from fruits and vegetables,   but actually high fructose corn syrup, 
that is something that can cause problems   and you may not get enough 125 dihydroxy vitamin 
D. We'll put a link to that video number 83.   Okay, so you may ask, ""well what's the problem? 
I mean, if we just need to go out in the sun and   get plenty of vitamin D, why is this an issue?"" 
Well, the issue is that if you were to look at   recent studies that look at how often we 
here in the United States and, in fact,   around the world spend outdoors, it's actually 
pretty small -- 7.6 percent of the day we spend   outdoors. The problem is in the winter time, 
the sun gets up late and goes down early, and   also it's not as high in the sky as it should be 
to get that direct radiation of ultraviolet B,   and so it's coming at an angle. You don't get very 
good exposure and, in fact, for those people who   are living above the 35th parallel or living below 
the 35th parallel in the southern hemisphere,   this can be a very significant issue. The 
35th parallel, for those who don't know,   sort of runs through the middle of the United 
States. Now some suggest that this may be the   reason why we see an increase in viral infections 
in the winter time -- whether it's in the northern   hemisphere or the southern hemisphere, winter 
time is when you're having less sun exposure. Kyle: But couldn't this also be explained, 
could the increase in viral infections also   be explained, by just people spending more 
time indoors in close confinement? You know   windows closed and potential for spread that 
way, among other potential confounding variables? Dr. Seheult: Yeah, it certainly is possible. One 
of the things that goes against that though, Kyle,   is that for instance in the United States in 
the winter time, in California, for instance,   southern California, it rarely gets cold enough 
that you have to be indoors, but we still see an   increase in spike in influenza during that 
time. What is certain though in California and,   this is where the 35th parallel sort of runs 
right through southern California, is studies   have shown that if you live above the 35th 
parallel, you can't really get enough vitamin D   just by sun exposure in the winter time. So while 
it is possible that there could be confounders.   We're seeing the sunlight exposure correlating 
with the increase in infectious diseases. I   would note if you look at this graphic from 
the CDC in terms of statistics, we see that   in just the very months where we have vitamin D 
deficiency is where we have spikes and increases   in influenza, so we've got good data that shows 
that a major cause of vitamin D deficiency is   inadequate exposure to sunlight. Also have 
good data that we'll talk about that there   is an association between vitamin D and the 
BMI, and that patients with kidney disease,   just like we see in COVID-19 can 
lose vitamin D3 out of their system. We also have good data that for more than a 
century, vitamin D deficiency has been suggested   to increase the susceptibility to infections, 
and when you look at the extreme vitamin   D deficiencies, for instance in children with 
nutritional rickets, they also had an increased   risk of respiratory tract infections or RTIs, and 
as we talked about the seasonality of these RTIs   and low 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels during winter 
time has been suggested as the seasonal stimulus   for these infections, and if this is so, 
obviously this would be a major public health   factor. And as we talked about, vitamin D may 
play an increased role in calcium metabolism;   it may actually play a role as stimulation of the 
innate immune system and other immune functions.   As we talked about this VDR, or this vitamin D
receptor, has been shown to be present in myeloid   and lymphoid lineage cells, and these are the 
cells that are important in fighting off COVID-19, for instance, monocytes and neutrophils. We also 
got good evidence that shows that vitamin D may   enhance the expression of human cathelicidin, 
which is an antimicrobial peptide which is   of specific importance in host defenses 
against, specifically, respiratory tract   pathogens. So one of the things that you've got 
to understand right off the bat, and it makes a   little confusing, is that different parts of the 
world measure vitamin D or 25-hydroxy vitamin D   in your blood using different units, so throughout 
this talk you're going to see 25-hydroxy vitamin D   levels being reported in two types of units: 
one is nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)  the other one is nanomoles per 
liter (nmol/L) and, frankly, you're going to see both of those being used,   and I don't want you to get too hung up 
on these levels here because a lot of   different organizations have their own 
thoughts on what should be deficient,   insufficient, and optimal. This is really just to 
give you an idea about where those ranges exist. Sometimes historically they'll ask for 
your vitamin D levels to be higher if   they're treating heart disease or cancer, and then 
generally speaking, vitamin D levels greater than   100 nanograms per milliliter are just too 
high, and you have to be careful when it gets   into that range. Now some other places they'll 
measure in something called nanomoles per liter,   and actually if you just want a quick 
way of converting you simply multiply   by 2.5 and you'll get these numbers here, which 
are a legitimate way of measuring it, but not one   that we're maybe used to. But you might see it,
so just make sure when you see studies and   they report 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels that 
you're understanding what units they're using,   so you can make sense of it. Okay, so let's take 
a look at the evidence. We'll sort of start out   with observational studies and we'll end up 
with randomized prospective controlled trials.   So we knew very early on, this is a paper that 
was published back in 1985 looking at vitamin   D and age, and what we found was that as you 
get older, the ability for your skin to produce   vitamin D3 drops by more than twofold 
as you get up into the 70s and the 80s.   The other thing that we knew from a long time 
ago back in 2012 is that there is a difference   in terms of vitamin D and race or skin color. Here 
you can see the graph looking at different levels   of vitamin D. Here's less than 10 here's 11 to 
20, 21 to 30, and greater than 30. And these bars   simply represent white is white, black is 
black, and the gray are Mexican- Americans.  This is a study that was 
done in the United States,   and what you can see here in this observational 
study, greater than 30, which would be considered   to be adequate, the majority of that population 
is white. As we go down below 20, in this range,   that the people that make up the majority 
of this population are disproportionately   darker skinned people, so this is certainly a 
public health issue that needs to be addressed.  Another thing that we've known about for 
some time, for about 20 years at least,   is vitamin D and BMI. Of course, vitamin D is a 
fat soluble vitamin, and as such it's going to   be stored in the fat. And so if you have a lot of 
adipose tissue or fat, then you're going to have a   larger capacity to hold vitamin D, which means 
you're going to have less soluble vitamin D to   be used. This is a direct quote from this study, 
""because humans obtain most of their vitamin D   requirement from exposure to sunlight, the greater 
than 50 decreased bioavailability of cutaneously   synthesized vitamin D in the obese subjects could 
account for the consistent observation by us and   others that obesity is associated with vitamin 
D deficiency. Oral vitamin D should be able   to correct the vitamin D deficiency associated 
with obesity, but larger than usual doses may be   required for very obese patients."" Okay, so where 
are we right now with vitamin D supplementation?  Currently there's no international consensus. 
We know that supplementation of vitamin D can   help in terms of fractures. Now there are 
some studies that show that vitamin D may   be associated with increased risk of myocardial 
infarction, but in actuality those studies were   related more to calcium supplementation with or 
without vitamin D, so not a direct association.  The target for prevention of fractures is around 
30 to 40 nanograms per milliliter and that,   if you have levels greater than 150 nanograms per 
milliliter, that is associated with hypercalcemia.   So what do people say? There's some people that 
say you should take 4,000 international units or   less; some others say up to 10,000 international 
units. There's not really a consensus. There are   some recommendations from the endocrinology 
society, and we will discuss those. Okay   so let's look at the evidence of vitamin D 
insufficiency and deficiency and mortality   from studies that were done not on COVID, but 
prior to COVID, but still looking at respiratory   diseases. So here's an interesting study that was 
done looking at about 10,000 patients in Germany   with 50- to 70-year-olds. It was prospective, 
so that's definitely a positive for this study,   but it was an observational study, so they weren't 
intervening here, and look at the years for   follow-up: 15-year follow-up in these patients. 
So let's take a look and see what they did.   They measured these patients in Germany 
and looked at their vitamin D levels,   and you can see that here on the x-axis. So again 
this is in nanomoles per liter, so you have to   divide by 2.5 to get nanograms per milliliter, and 
generally they made some cutoffs here. This was at   30 and this here was at 50. And so 
they said if you're greater than 50,   then that's good. If you're in the middle portion 
that's 30 to 50 nanomoles per liter, then that's  sort of in the middle, and then here you've 
got less than 30. That's what they figured   as deficient, and then they just followed them.
They just watch them and they see what they did,   and they looked at the death certificates after 
15 years in these patients that started to die,   and they wanted to see what 
was it that they died from,   and this is what they found: those people that had 
vitamin D levels of greater than 50 had a better   survival in terms of respiratory mortality than 
those that had less than 30, and of course the 30   to 50 were somewhere in the middle, but definitely 
statistically significant in terms of vitamin D  levels predicting respiratory mortality. In 
fact, from the study, they said statistically   after adjustment for sex age and season of 
blood draw, school education, smoking, BMI,   physical activity and fish consumption, 41 percent 
of the variability in respiratory mortality during   this 15-year follow-up period was independently 
associated with 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels less   than 50. Well it's one thing to say that somebody 
with a specific value has a likelihood of dying.   It's quite another thing to say that number caused 
the patient to end up that way. So in other words   there's a difference between association and 
causation. That's the first thing that you learn   in medical school when you take epidemiology. So 
here is a great meta-analysis that's often cited,   and you should keep an eye on. It was published 
in the British medical journal and they did a   meta-analysis. They did a meta-analysis of 
many many different studies; they pulled   them together to see whether or not vitamin D 
supplementation in non-COVID patients. These   are patients that don't have COVID-19. These 
had regular respiratory diseases like the flu   and they wanted to see whether or not vitamin D 
supplementation improved mortality, and so they   looked at vitamin D supplementation. They looked 
at about 25 randomized controlled trials. These   are very good quality subjects and what they found 
was that vitamin D supplementation did reduce the   risk of acute respiratory illnesses. Let's take a 
look at that data, so here you can see all of the   different studies that were done in the randomized 
controlled trials. Did the studies say yes vitamin   D had a benefit or no vitamin D did not have a 
benefit? You can see those here on the right side   showed that there was no benefit or is actually 
worsening and those here on the left side show   that there was a benefit when they averaged all of 
the patients together in these studies they came   up with this final answer, here, which was less 
than one, which showed that there was a benefit.   Let me just quote to you from this study. It was 
very large study -- landmark study -- it says,   ""our study reports a major new indication for 
vitamin D supplementation: the prevention of acute   respiratory tract infection. We also show that 
people who are very deficient in vitamin D and   those receiving daily or weekly supplementation 
without additional doses experienced a particular   benefit. Our results add to the body of evidence 
supporting the introduction of public health   measures such as food fortification to improve 
vitamin D status particularly in the setting where   profound vitamin D deficiency is common."" So you 
can't really underestimate this study. I mean, it looked at 25 randomized controlled trials, put 
them in a meta-analysis, and it came up with this   as a final analysis. Here's another 
study. This one was done in Japan,   and it looked at a randomized trial of vitamin D 
supplementation to prevent seasonal influenza A   in school children, and this was done about 10 
years ago. There was 334 school children, each   of them were given either 1200 international units 
per day of vitamin D3, or they were given placebo   and the end point was looking for influenza A by 
doing nasal swab antigen testing, and what they   found over a winter season was that those subjects 
that got the supplemental vitamin D only had a   10.8 percent prevalence of influenza A, whereas 
those that got placebo had an 18.6 incidence   of influenza A, and the absolute risk reduction, 
simply the difference between those two, is 7.8,   which translates into a number needed to treat of 
13. That's a pretty darn low number, which means   that this intervention is pretty powerful, and 
you can see here the other related indices here   showing that it was statistically significant. So 
clearly here vitamin D supplementation in school   children -- these are children that would not 
normally necessarily be at risk for having vitamin   D deficiency -- but even in this population it 
was able to reduce the incidence of influenza A.   Okay, so let's talk about COVID itself 
and what we started to find out early on   in COVID-19 when we started to research this is 
some uncanny similarities between what COVID-19   look like from a biochemical standpoint and what 
vitamin D deficiency looks like from a biochemical   standpoint. Now this doesn't prove anything, but 
it certainly raises your eyebrows and you start   to look a little bit closer, because what we saw 
was that in both conditions IL-6 was elevated,   tumor necrosis factor alpha was elevated, gamma 
interferon was elevated in vitamin D deficiency   and also in COVID-19 late in the course. 
The Th1 adaptive response was also elevated   late in the course of COVID-19. We see both 
ACE2 expression reduced in both conditions   and a hypercoagulability in both, and so that 
gave us pause and started to see well maybe   vitamin D may play a role in COVID-19.
Kyle: Would you expect vitamin D deficiency to   also mirror other viral infections, or 
is this something unique to COVID-19?  Dr. Seheult: No, I think it could also 
mirror other types of infections we see this   during this time of year; we see increases in 
coronaviruses in general, rhinoviruses, we also   see it in in influenza. The one thing that we 
don't see in those other viruses, however, Kyle,   that we do see in COVID-19 is this hypercoagulable 
state. It's not as pronounced as we're seeing it   in COVID-19. There was a recent article that was 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine,   actually not recent it's been a couple of months 
now, that showed that in autopsies in patients   with COVID-19 compared to those who did not 
have COVID-19, there was a nine-fold increase   in blood clots in the lung tissue. So 
that is something that is very unique   and then when we started to look at the 
epidemiology of patients with COVID-19 again, more   eyebrows being raised, here's a pretty powerful 
study looking at 17 million, patients specifically   looking at about 10,000 COVID-19 deaths, and what 
do we see we see something really interesting.   If you look here at the age group this is nothing 
new. We know this that those who are higher in age   are more likely to die from COVID-19, and 
you can see here the higher in age we go,   the more risk there is in that category. We 
can see that male gender has some risk as well.   Here we see with obesity that as the obesity 
level goes up, the risk starts to go up as well,   and here we see again with ethnicity, as we start 
to compare to caucasian or white, that all of   these darker skinned races have increased risk 
for death in COVID-19. And if you will remember,   these are exactly the same three things that we 
saw put people at risk for vitamin D deficiency:   both elderly age, increased obesity, and 
darker skin color, and so one has to wonder,   now is this coincidental or is this something 
else that we need to investigate? Is it possible   that vitamin D may have a role in the 
mortality and morbidity of COVID-19?  Kyle: So that was a great chart that you just 
showed about different patient characteristics   and hazard ratios associated with 
those patient characteristics,   and I was impressed by it and then I looked 
closer and I saw that smoking status, specifically   current smokers was actually a negative risk 
factor. Presumably, these patients would have   better outcomes than non-smokers. That made me 
question the validity of this data, but what's   your thought on this? How can you explain that?
Dr. Seheult: Oh no i don't think it should   make you question at all. You know, early on we 
felt that it was the patients with lung disease   that were going to be the ones that were ending up 
in the hospital, but clearly that's not the case.   The type of people that we're seeing that are 
having severe reactions from COVID are the ones   with cardiovascular disease. This is a vascular 
inflammatory condition, not one that necessarily   hurts the lung from a respiratory standpoint. 
There's several explanations for this; nicotine   is is a known anti-inflammatory and of course it's 
through inflammation that COVID does its dirty   business. There's also well-known in COVID-19 -- 
uh sorry -- in smoking increases in nitric oxide.   ,Nitric oxide is a vasodilator so it may actually 
be beneficial in this sort of a situation.   Certainly not saying that we should go out 
and start smoking here, certainly because   there's other problems, but, Kyle, this isn't 
the first time that we've had a disease where   active smoking actually improves the outcome of 
the disease. I mean look at ulcerative colitis;   that's well known to have a more milder course 
in patients who smoke, but it's not a reason to   smoke, but it's not a reason to say that the study 
is incorrect. Well then it starts to get even more   interesting, because when you start to look at 
countries and you start to look at populations,   we start to see something quite interesting. If we 
look at the equator, which is right here at zero   degrees latitude, as we start to move away from 
the equator we start to have less direct sunlight,   and we start to see here that populations 
as a whole start to increase in terms of the   mortality rates, and let me just read you a quote 
from the study that was published here in just   April. It says, ""when mortality per million 
is plotted against latitude, it can be seen   that all countries that lie below 35 degrees North 
have relatively low mortality. Thirty-five degrees   North also happens to be the latitude above 
which people do not receive sufficient sunlight   to retain adequate vitamin D levels during the 
winter. This suggests a possible role for vitamin   D in determining outcomes for COVID19. There are 
outliers of course -- mortality is relatively   low in nordic countries -- but there vitamin 
D deficiency is relatively uncommon, probably   due to widespread use of supplements. Italy and 
Spain, perhaps surprisingly, have relatively high   prevalences of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D 
deficiency has also been shown to correlate with   hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and ethnicity -- 
all features associated with the increased risk of   severe COVID19."" And here is another paper along 
the same lines. This one published in May of 2020,   titled ""The role of vitamin D in the prevention 
of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and   mortality."" So this study looked at 20 European 
countries looked at specifically the average   vitamin D levels, looked at COVID cases and 
also COVID mortality, and this of course was   as of April of 2020. So they looked at these 
20 different countries and what they found was   an inverse relationship with this r and p value 
that showed that the higher the vitamin D levels   of that country, the lower the COVID-19 cases per 
million population. You can see there a fairly   straight line going through this plot. So once 
again, these are nanomoles per liter, so you need   to divide by 2.5 to get nanograms per deciliter. 
Now this is for cases, what about mortality?   Well they did the same thing for mortality and 
it was very very similar, so again mean vitamin D   levels that were very high had almost zero percent 
mortality, whereas those that were very low, like   around 40 to 50 in this situation, had a higher 
mean COVID-19 mortality per 1 million population.  Okay, well, what about these patients 
specifically? Here's a paper that was published in   nutrients, and it looked at 107 patients that were 
hospitalized in Switzerland, and what they did was   they looked at the vitamin D levels in those 
patients that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and   those that were negative for SARS-CoV-2, and what 
they found was that those that were negative for   SARS-CoV-2 had higher vitamin D levels than those 
that were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and this was   statistically significant, but of course again, 
this is an association and not necessarily a   causation. We see that it's associated with a low 
vitamin D level. It's possible that the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be causing the vitamin D levels to 
go down, and that was the subject of a letter to   the editor titled ""Vitamin D deficiency in 
COVID-19: Mixing up cause and consequence,""   and what they were able to show here in about 
nine subjects when they gave lipopolysaccharide   to healthy volunteers, which is another way of 
inducing the immune system, is that they found   that plasma vitamin D levels did in fact drop 
slightly, and if you look here at the scale it   was on the order of maybe about five points. 
They were able to show that when somebody has   an infection or is undergoing an immune 
response their vitamin D levels can drop   and so it is possible but this is a modest drop 
here. Something that we ought to keep in mind   as we go forward now of course the SARS-CoV-2 
infection may cause a vitamin D level to go down,   but only after you've been infected. What 
about those people that have had vitamin D   levels checked well prior to them getting an 
infection? Well here's a study that looked at low   plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels as an 
associated risk of increased COVID-19 infection,   and what they showed here they took 14,000 
subjects with at least one test for COVID-19   and a previous vitamin D, and what they found 
was that they had to exclude about 6,000 of   them because they did not have a former vitamin D 
level and so 7,800 of them had a test for COVID-19   and had a vitamin D level on record, and they 
were able to show that about 10 percent of these   patients had positive COVID-19 tests and about 90 
did not, so what did they show here? They divided   levels of vitamin D at around 30, and so these 
are the people that were low here on the left and   these are the people here that were normal. Notice 
that there was a big gap here, not a lot of people   who were elderly and had normal vitamin D levels. 
I found that very interesting, and when you look   at this scattergram, you'll see that the majority 
of the patients were actually in the lower amount,   so they were less than 30. So this is not like an 
insignificant or rare problem. So this flow chart   may look confusing at first, but if you look at 
this the point, is it's just a tiny amount of the   normal vitamin D levels that make up a 
portion of the positive SARS-CoV-2 population.   Here is another article as well from Israel that 
showed that low plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels   were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 
infection. This was a population-based study,   again looking at baseline vitamin D 
levels not ones that they were obtaining   after they developed COVID-19 or had a COVID-19 
test, and what they showed when adjusted for age   and demographics and comorbidities that vitamin 
D levels of 75+ compared to less than 75 had a   significant difference in terms of whether or 
not these patients would have either a SARS-CoV-2   infection or a COVID-19 hospitalization. In other 
words, if it was less than 75, they were 1.45   times as likely to get an infection and almost 
two times more likely to get hospitalization. So   again this is in nanomoles per liter, so you have 
to divide by 2.5 to get nanograms per milliliter,   and here is yet another link between vitamin 
D deficiency and COVID-19 in a very large   population, this time looking at 52,000 matched 
to 524,000 controls that was matched for sex,   age, and geographical location, and what they 
showed here, this bell-shaped distribution in red   are the SARS-CoV-2 positives and of course, 
everybody else in gray, and there's definitely   a shift to the lower values of vitamin D and 
here in females, it even made a bigger impact,   the lower levels were definitely associated with 
SARS-CoV-2 positivity. How do you explain that?   yeah it's hard to say. Obviously, the 
differences between men and women are very,   very large in terms of of hormones and 
things of that nature, although it wouldn't   be surprising if they found out that it had to 
do with hormone levels. Recently they've been   releasing information about pregnant 
women in COVID and that pregnant women   have a increased risk of severity and of course 
pregnant women have elevated estrogen levels,   progesterone levels, and so the question is, 
why is that the case? We don't know, but it   could be that it's accentuated in pregnancy. 
Obviously when they're not pregnant, there is a   baseline elevation in estrogen. We're not 
seeing that in a baseline situation, but   it could affect vitamin D because vitamin D once 
again, just like estrogen, just like progesterone,   is a steroid hormone, so don't have a good answer 
for that at this point, and not to be outdone,   the United States also published theirs. This was 
a whopping study of almost 200,000 de-identified   test results from clinical laboratories looking 
at vitamin D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity,   and so when you look at this, overall you can see 
very clearly that vitamin D levels are inversely   related to SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate with 
the lower levels being associated with being   positive for SARS-CoV-2, and you can see that it's 
around 50 where it starts to take off and go up,   and when they looked at this to 
see whether or not something was   generating this -- any particular part of 
the country or age or anything like that -- they found that it really did not matter in 
terms of geography, that there was still the   same relationship as you went down in vitamin 
D levels, there was an increase in SARS-CoV-2   positivity rate, but interestingly, there were 
higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 in the northern region   of the United States, above the 35th parallel, 
whereas in the central and southern states,   it was relatively low, but the relationship still 
existed. This also existed in terms of race,   so it didn't matter what race you were: if 
you had lower vitamin D levels you had an   increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, but 
again, the darker skinned races had a higher   risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity with respect to 
the white baseline. Here in this case in terms of   age, again it really didn't matter whether age 
was greater than 60 or less than 60, and here   ironically it was higher in the younger age, 
because we know that SARS-CoV-2 positivity is   more prevalent in the younger populations, 
but hospitalizations are more prevalent in   the older populations, and then of course again, 
it didn't matter whether you're male or female,   as your vitamin D levels go down your SARS-CoV-2 
positivity goes up again this is showing an   association, not necessarily a causation. Kyle: 
That data looks impressive when it's charted out,   and it looks like there's a clear correlation 
between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 infections,   but this is observational data, and you've talked 
a lot about in your COVID-19 updates about how   observational data is really 
limited in a lot of ways, and it   really needs to be backed up by randomized 
placebo-controlled prospective trials. Could it be   that people that have higher vitamin D levels 
are also the people that are more likely   to take better care of themselves in 
general? They're more likely to get outside,   maybe they're healthy enough to actually get 
outside and get some natural sunlight. Maybe   they are people that are engaged enough in their 
own health to actually take vitamin D supplements,   eat a healthy diet in the first place.
Dr. Seheult: Well on the surface it's   certainly possible. Yeah those 
people in the middle class who   have the ability to get outside are probably 
the ones also that are going to take time   and take care of themselves, but you know 
you also have to take into consideration   that this study is looking at everybody, not just 
those who go outside because they choose to go   outside, but those people who go outside because 
they have to go outside, because they're laborers,   because that's part of their job. They have 
no choice but to go outside and I would say   that those probably outnumber those that go 
outside by choice, because it's a health issue   and even those patients who probably aren't taking 
care of themselves as well as middle class people   might be doing, they also, it seems as they fit 
into the same data, have an improvement as well,   and here is another study that was published this 
time with 105 patients that were hospitalized with   COVID-19, and what they wanted to look at here was 
progression. So of 105 patients that were admitted   with COVID-19 type symptoms, they found that those 
that were negative represented about 33 percent   and those that were positive represented 66.7 
percent, and as you can see here the average   vitamin D level was lower in those positive 
SARS-CoV2 patients and higher in the negative   patients. So here, ostensibly, they're having the 
same immune reaction, because they're coming with   the same symptoms, but in this situation it is 
this group that is SARS-CoV-2 positive, and they   have lower vitamin D levels. Now when you look at 
that and break it out and you see if their levels   were less than 30 or greater than 30, those that 
had greater than 30 had lower peak d-dimer levels.   Why is that important? D-dimer is considered to be 
a risk factor for getting blood clots in COVID-19.   Also if you'll notice here that is the higher 
vitamin D levels here that had a lower incidence   of ventilator requirements. Okay so what does this 
study show? It shows that potentially vitamin D   levels are associated with a worse outcome or 
worse course of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital.   Here's another study looking at the very same 
thing in terms of vitamin D levels in the   hospital and outcomes, and you can see that when 
they divided the patients between vitamin D, less   than 12, which is pretty low versus greater than 
12, you can see here that the survival probability   in these patients when they set it to 12 was a 
huge difference in terms of survival probability.   When they changed it to 20, you can see also there 
was still a difference in survival probability,   but not to the same degree, and of course they 
followed them out for about a hundred days in this   trial. So once again, vitamin D levels seem to be 
associated with a worse progression of the course   of COVID-19 in the hospital. Okay, so up to this 
point we've been talking about how vitamin D is   associated with bad outcomes, but that doesn't 
say necessarily that it's the cause of the bad   outcomes. You have to be very, very careful 
when you say that something is associated with   something, because it could be due to any number 
of co-founders, right? It could actually be that   SARS-CoV-2 reduces the vitamin D level and we've 
shown that that's the case acutely at least,   but not necessarily chronically. It could be 
that there's another factor that's causing both   a susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and also 
a vitamin D level, and so if you just change the   vitamin D level, that won't necessarily make the 
SARS-CoV-2 any better, so we have to establish   then by doing a randomized controlled trial or 
interventional trials to show that if you give   vitamin D to somebody who is either pre-COVID or 
in COVD, that you can get better outcomes, and   that's exactly what they tried to do here in this 
Spanish study that was published just in October   of 2020. It is titled the ""Effect of calcifediol 
treatment and best available therapy versus best   available therapy on intensive care unit admission 
and mortality among patients hospitalized for   COVID-19: A pilot randomized clinical study."" So 
what is calcifidiol? This is important for you to   understand what that is. Calcifediol is the 25-
hydroxy vitamin D3. This is not what you normally   take as a vitamin D supplement, because when 
you take a vitamin D supplement, it has to be   metabolized in the liver as we mentioned and have 
the 25-hydroxyl group put on it. Here, calcifidiol   already has the 25-hydroxy group on it, so it 
doesn't need to be metabolized, it's ready for the   one hydroxylase enzyme to activate it and for it 
to be used. So it kind of speeds up the process,   and in this situation what they did was they took 
patients with COVID-19 and randomized them to  not receive calcifediol. So this is the 
placebo group, or receive calcifediol,   this is the intervention group, and what they 
found was that in the calcifediol group, and so   just so you're aware that they gave them a pretty 
high dose on day one, then they gave it to them a   few days later, and then again on day seven. What 
they found was that in the intervention group,   only two percent of those patients went to the 
intensive care unit, whereas in the placebo group   50 of those went to the intensive care unit. Now 
something you should understand is that this had   a total of 76 patients in it. 76 patients is not 
that much but I know that they are planning on   doing a much bigger clinical trial with about 
a thousand patients, and here is another study   that is really interesting because at least here 
I guess in France what they do is every two to   three months, they give about 80,000 international 
units of vitamin D in these nursing home patients,   so when these nursing home patients started 
to be admitted to the hospital with COVID-19,   they asked the question: did this patient get 
this 80,000 units within the last month or has   it been longer than a month since they got it? And 
for those patients that had gotten it within the   last month, they had a much better survival than 
those that had gone further than a month out, and   this was 66 patients in this cohort, so sort of a 
quasi-experimental study, because of the situation   that these patients were in. Some have been given 
recent vitamin D supplementation and some hadn't,   and when they looked at that, there was a 
statistically significant difference, as you   can see here, p of 0.002. Well here was another 
study. This was a multi-center, double-blinded,   randomized control trial and interestingly here, 
they looked at 240 patients, which is not small,   but what they did give them was on admission a 
whopping dose of 200,000 international units of   vitamin D3 or placebo, and what they wanted to see 
if there was any difference in clinical outcomes.   Well if you look here over on the right you'll see 
that the blue group was the intervention group.   That was the one that received the vitamin D, 
and you can see that there was a statistically   significant increase in their circulating 
25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in the placebo   group. There was no difference, and so despite the 
fact that their circulating levels of vitamin D   went up, there was no differences in clinical 
outcomes including mortality or ventilator days.   A couple of criticisms of the 
study is they only gave one dose,   and why is that a criticism? Well if you 
look at that original British Medical   Journal meta-analysis that we talked about 
at the beginning of the video, they made a   point of saying that it was basically repeated 
doses on a daily basis or on a weekly basis,   not bolus dosing, that seemed to help. The 
second criticism is that even in medications   that we give that we know work like antibiotics 
and bacterial infections, we don't just give   one whopping dose of antibiotics and hope that 
they improve. The other thing was that this was   given rather late. Remember that the vitamin D3 
has to be metabolized in the liver to the 25- hydroxy vitamin D, and that can take some time 
as well. The most recent study that's come out   though was this one from India titled ""Short term, 
high-dose vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19   disease: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial."" 
This is also known as the shade study and here   they looked at 40 COVID-19 positive patients and
here they gave 60,000 units daily for seven days   and they gave 24 patients placebo, so the total 
here was 16 got the intervention, 24 controls got   the placebo, and in terms of their outcomes, they 
were looking at how many of them were SARS-CoV-2   negative by day 21 and were there any biomarker 
reductions, and so the results were that 62.5   percent versus 20.8 percent were SARS-CoV-2
negative by day 21 in the intervention group,   and those that got vitamin D and fibrinogen, which 
is a surrogate for inflammation was significantly   decreased in the intervention group as well, 
and while we're on the topic of critically   ill COVID-19 patients and inflammatory markers 
here's a study that was just published in November   looking at just that with vitamin D levels you see 
here that there was a group A that was admitted to   a hospital. These were basically people who were 
asymptomatic for the 12 days. These patients were   admitted to the hospital, but to an isolation ward 
not because they needed hospitalization and group   A are those asymptomatics that were there for 12 
days with no symptoms, and there was a total of   91 of those patients. The B were those that were 
admitted to the intensive care unit; there's about   63 patients of those a total of 154 in the study; 
you can see here those patients with greater than   20 nanograms per milliliter of vitamin D were 
much more prevalent in the asymptomatic group, and   those that had serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels 
less than 20 were predominant here in group B,   and we can see that those patients that had low 
vitamin D levels had significantly higher il-6   had almost statistically significantly 
higher tumor necrosis factor alpha, and   had higher serum ferritin levels, which is also 
a surrogate for inflammatory markers in COVID-19.   Secondary endpoint was low vitamin D levels 
in fatality rates, and there was a really big   difference between those that had low vitamin D 
levels and those that had normal vitamin D levels,   and this led the authors to state this: this 
all translates into increased mortality in   vitamin D deficient COVD-19 patients. As per the 
flexible approach in the current COVID-19 pandemic   authors recommend mass administration of vitamin D 
supplements to populations at risk for COVID-19.""   So what about it? What about supplementation 
of vitamin D? Are you taking it seriously? Well   even before COVID-19, certain countries were 
taking this seriously and here's a review that   was done out of Helsinki, Finland, titled ""Vitamin 
D fortification of Fluid Milk Products and Their   Contribution to Vitamin D Intake and Vitamin D 
Status in Observational Studies."" There's a number   of different countries and they have different 
approaches. For instance, in Finland, the type   of fortification in their food is voluntary, 
but as it turns out, everybody's doing it, and   so it's as if it were mandatory in Norway. It is 
voluntary in Sweden. It is mandatory in Canada. It   is mandatory, however, in the United States. It's 
voluntary, so some manufacturers of fluid milk,   acidified milk, and cultural milk, and even 
yogurt, do put vitamin D in those foodstuffs.   However, in Ireland, they do not and this is what 
one of the commentators on the Irish longitudinal   study on aging had to say about vitamin D in their 
study. They say Ireland does not have any formal   vitamin D food policy. We practice a voluntary, 
but not mandatory food fortification policy   where food manufacturers can decide to fortify 
or not their food products with vitamin D. The   vitamin D status of those in Ireland is lower 
than either the United States or Canada, who   have systemic mass vitamin D food fortification. 
However, vitamin D deficiency is not inevitable   in older adults in Ireland and the ability to 
have sufficient vitamin D status year-round   is an achievable goal that many countries 
meet. For example, another European country,   Finland, which is at a much higher latitude and 
therefore receives less sunshine than Ireland,   has virtually eliminated vitamin D deficiency 
in its population with rates of less than one   percent. This is due in part to a successful 
food fortification and vitamin D supplementation   policy and educating the public and medical 
practitioners on the importance of vitamin D.   This vitamin D success story demonstrates 
what could be achieved in Ireland.   It can happen in other places as well. Okay, 
so when it comes to supplementation, let's see   what the guidelines are. This is the endocrine 
society clinical practice guidelines that were   published back in 2011, and of course we'll give 
you a link to this in the description below.   And if you look under the heading, recommended 
dietary intakes for vitamin D for patients at   risk for vitamin D deficiency, and you go on 
down to the bottom, you'll see here, under 2.6,   their recommendations. And let's go over what 
those recommendations are as you can see,   unless you're a child then basically what they're 
saying is that 4,000 international units a day   for anyone greater than 8 years of age is the 
upper limit for supplementation with vitamin D   without medical supervision. So another 
question is exactly what are they worried about?   What is the frequency? What is the relevance 
of vitamin D toxicity? Well to get a better   understanding of that, we go to a publication 
in Frontiers in Endocrinology out of Poland,   and in this article, it states that the 
Endocrine Society and the Institute of Medicine   have both stated that vitamin D toxicity is 
extremely rare, and that concentrations usually of   25-hydroxy vitamin D have to exceed 150 nanograms 
per milliliter, which is 375 nanomoles per liter,   and not only that, there has to be increased 
calcium intake, and so because it's very rare.   It's led them to state that they believe that 
vitamin D is probably one of the least toxic   fat soluble vitamins, much less toxic than 
vitamin A, and a researcher, Didenkov, looked at   20,000 serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D samples 
at the Mayo Clinic from 2002 to 2011 to look   and see whether or not there was actually any 
evidence of vitamin D toxicity, and out of those   20,000 only one patient with a 25-hydroxy vitamin 
D concentration of 364 nanograms per milliliter,   which is a whopping 910 nanomoles per liter, 
was diagnosed with hypercalcemia. Similarly,   another researcher looked at healthy adults in 
a clinical setting that were receiving 50,000   units of vitamin D2 every two weeks, which is 
approximately equal to 3,300 international units a   day for up to six years, and their concentrations 
were only 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter   and they had no evidence of vitamin D toxicity. 
This also goes along with a study in Canada   where they researched Canadians taking up to 
20,000 international units of vitamin D3 per day,   and they had significant increases of 25-hydroxy 
vitamin D concentrations up to 60 nanograms per   milliliter, but again without any evidence of 
toxicity. So it looks as though based on that   data that supplementation is relatively 
safe, but how much should you supplement,   and does it make a difference about your BMI? 
Well, this was an interesting article that was   published titled, ""The Importance of Body Weight 
for the Dose Response Relationship of Oral Vitamin   D Supplementation and Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin
D in Healthy Volunteers."" In relation to this   study, they took 17,000 patients and looked at 
vitamin D levels, and there was a wide range   of vitamin D levels in this population 
anywhere from four nanograms per milliliter   to 158 nanograms per milliliter, and people were 
supplementing anywhere from nothing to 55,000 international units a day, and what they found 
was pretty interesting. They found that early on   supplementation per thousand international 
units brought up people's levels pretty quickly,   but then as the amount of supplementation started 
to go up, the levels started to go up more slowly,   such that in the first thousand units that 
you take as a supplement, each thousand units   would increase the level in your 
blood by 4.8 nanograms per milliliter,   but if you got up to the 10,000 range or the 
50,000 range, even 15,000 to 20,000 range,   1,000 units would only raise it up by 
about a tenth of that, or 0.4 nanograms   per milliliter, so in other words down here, a 
thousand international units when taking a low   amount would raise your level by 4.8 nanograms per 
milliliter, but if you're already taking a large   amount, each additional increase by a thousand 
international units would only raise it by about   a tenth of that, so you can see that there is 
definitely a non-linear relationship there.   Furthermore, BMI also had a lot to play in 
this as well. So for those that are normal BMI,   and that by definition is less than 25, and 
then you have overweight, and that is 26 to 30,   and then you have obesity, which is 30 plus. What 
they found in comparison to a normal BMI was,   first of all, generally overweight people were 
on average three nanograms per milliliter less   in terms of their serum vitamin d, and that obese 
patients were eight milligrams per deciliter. Now   it it gets even more complicated there, because 
what they found was that it took more vitamin D   to get them up to a regular level than would be 
expected if they were overweight or obese. In   fact, their recommendations is that for people who 
are overweight they should take 1.5 times what is   normally recommended to get their vitamin D levels 
up, and for those that are obese, have a BMI of   greater than 30, it actually is 3.0 times as much, 
and that might be related to the fact that vitamin   D, of course, is fat soluble. So there are a lot 
of things to take into consideration and this is a   moving target. Also take under consideration 
the fact that currently we are moving into   winter months, but again these all need to be 
parsed with the season and weight and age and   all of those sorts of things that we talked about. 
Now while this is a distribution of vitamin D in   Germany. I'm sure it's not very different 
from what it is here in the United States,   and as you can see 50 millimoles per liter 
is really on the low side, and that would   correlate with about 20 nanograms per milliliter. 
So you can see here how significant that severe   deficiency in 25-hydroxy vitamin D can 
be. There is a number of people that are   at deficiency based on this. I feel not only is 
there a role for all of us to be taking vitamin D   supplementation at least during the winter months, 
but I also feel strongly that practitioners in the   hospital may want to look at this in terms of 
their treatment of patients in the hospital.   Now I do not have randomized controlled trial data 
yet, conclusively, that shows that this works,   but if we look at the risks of vitamin D 
supplementation and the potential benefits,   I think the benefit-to-risk ratio is high.
Dr. Fauci himself is supplementing with vitamin D,   and while there are certain groups of people that 
should be very careful with supplementing with   vitamin D, such as patients with sarcoid or other 
granulomatous diseases, or patients with renal   issues, without discussing at first with their 
doctors, I do see a role for supplementation,   especially in this winter season when COVID is 
running rampant. I can't tell you as an individual   how much vitamin D to take, because I'm not your 
doctor, and I'm not here to give you medical   advice, but I am still taking 5,000 international 
units daily, and when I had my levels checked,   when I was taking 2,000 international units daily, 
my level was only 48 nanograms per milliliter,   and I am living in sunny southern California. I 
plan on making more videos about what I am doing,   and what I think we should all be doing in terms 
of protecting ourselves from COVID-19. Please   share this with as many of your loved ones as 
possible, because I think this could potentially   be beneficial in our fight against COVID-19, and

can cause heart attacks and strokes blood clots are becoming a common complication with coffered 19 cases scientists are trying to understand why specialists at Hamburg Forensic Medicine Institute are examining the bodies of deceased coronavirus patients for clues cause of death coronavirus Hamburg Forensic Medicine Institute has been in high gear since the outbreak of the pandemic Institute director Klaus Peschel and his team have performed almost 200 autopsies on kovat 19 victims more than any other German state at first Disease Control Agency the rubber cult Institute advised against the exams saying it would endanger medical scientists something crucial pushed back against best we know that aerosols are dangerous that's why we have special exhaust systems and we wear protective clothing it's a matter of course for a pathologist or a forensic medical scientist we asked professor crucial if we may film during an autopsy a clinic camera team captures footage through the window crucial says the researchers learn more each day for example that many of the deceased had a unique type of pneumonia with tissue bleeding that victims brains were almost always altered by inflammation and that coronavirus was found on eye tissue we took samples of almost every tissue in all these cases we're trying to comprehend what happens in the muscles or inside the liver in the weeks and months ahead many more results will be recorded which will greatly expand our understanding of this disease enormous fighting done the scientists screen all of the bodies and take CT scans in a new study they say that thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms were frequently found in the deceased something intensive care medics have already suspected this finding has direct implications for future treatment this has changed the guidelines especially in the way that the blood clotting system and the formation of thrombosis are specifically in focus and more intensive precautions are being taken so the thrombosis and embolism don't form of adavi just from Poznan and balloon leakage in the high number of autopsies confirms earlier results on average the victims were 80 years old and most of them were men all of them had severe pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure heart attacks or organ damage but we can now speak to Professor Clements Ventnor he's an expert in infectious diseases from Munich's Schwaben hospital and the first doctor to treat coronavirus patients in thanks so much for joining us can you just explain in simple terms if possible the relationship between blood clots and coronavirus so we know that coronavirus can induce inflammation not only in the lungs but also in the blood vessels there are specific receptors even in the inner side of these vessels we call them endothelium and we have done recent research showing us that this inflammation in the endothelium can activate platelets so trauma sites and by activation of platelets you get you know clumps and the blood we call it micro emboli and so these things then can just stop the blood from flowing and this can be a pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis or on the line we also might have real severe prongs that parts of the lung are profuse anymore they have also been reports of clusters of younger cava 19 patients suffering strokes is that likely related to some sort of clotting resulting from the virus that's that's our thinking at this point that this is in line with this clotting disorder defect in Kovach 19 so also the brain is supported by many vessels and there are some hints that a big vessel is just perfusing the brain also I have these changes the inner walls so the in Atheneum is infected you know and by this clots just shuts in the brain and so this is then the clinical sign of a stroke for the patient I mentioned at the start that you treated the first coronavirus patients here in Germany has your understanding of the disease drastically changed since then to the point where you would perhaps treat them differently yeah in the beginning we just thought it's just a simple virus infection like the flu I mean why we have learned during the last week's and also you know Muncie in Germany that the major problem what covered 19 is the we call it a hyper inflammation so this kind of inflammation as a secondary event in covered 19 so this tells us that besides you know applying heparin very liberally to our patients also drugs or locking this inflammation like it's an is-6 receptor antagonist very complicated word it's an it's an antibody it's called toxiel it's AMA this antibody for example we have some hope that this inflammation can be blocked but there are other drugs and this is a thing change in a way we treat or correct 19 patients long days well thank you very much for your time professor Clements Bendtner from UNIX fobbing hospital thank you very much indeed and now it's your chance to ask the questions our science Carl how long do microscopic droplets containing Tsarskoe v2 remain in the air I touched on this question once a few weeks ago but it's time to answer it again as we now have more data on whether or not stars co2 might be what's often called airborne we know the virus is transmitted by larger droplets that come out when you sneeze or cough but what about the tiny droplets called aerosols that you emit all the time when you speak could they also transmit the infection a new study indicates that they might using extremely sensitive lasers the researchers tracked aerosols emitted by test subjects speaking and detected at least a thousand tiny droplets a minute that if those people had been infected could possibly have contained virus and those droplets remain floating in the air for eight to fourteen minutes we don't know how many viruses it takes to make someone sick but the work says at least in enclosed spaces probabilities are high that infected people could transmit the virus simply by speaking loud the testing was done in the lab of course and not under real-world air circulation conditions so there are some caveats but the study I think is likely to have an impact on health policy how long does the virus last on your clothes a well-known study from last March found the corona virus was detectable for up to 24 hours on cardboard which in terms of its absorbent qualities is similar to many types of textiles um most experts I read are therefore taking 24 hours as a ballpark figure for clothing as well but before you start stuffing your entire wardrobe in the washing machine you should know those tests were done with pretty high virus concentrations in the lab in the real world you're unlikely to be exposed to those kinds of levels so in general the experts say you shouldn't worry too much about your clothing providing a path for infection could kovat nineteen be linked to the collection of bat guano used as fertilizer I love this question because it took me by surprise I'd never thought about it as a possibility bat guano the animals dried feces is widely used as a fertilizer in Asia and other parts of the world and it's also an ingredient in some traditional Chinese medicines and large-scale studies in the past have isolated hundreds of different corona viruses from from bat drop so could the first infections in this pandemic possibly be linked to the guano trade doesn't seem like a completely unreasonable speculation to me but there's there's no clear evidence for it and without that it's just one speculation among many [Music] how science correspondent Derrick Williams there and finally a new disease calls for new ways of teaching how to treat it and at least one method gets extra points for following social distancing guidelines have a look at this doctors in Taiwan a using virtual reality to learn how to handle covered 19 equipped with goggles and control sticks they're able to test skills and learn from mistakes without risking their own health or without a teacher physically present here's a trainee practicing how to take a medical sample from the virtual patients throat [Music]

17,y6h8TIxeg1g,Doctor Mike Hansen,12 COVID Autopsy Cases Reveal the TRUTH How COVID Patients Dying - Doctor Explains,2020-05-14T15:45:04Z,"12 COVID Autopsy Cases Reveal the TRUTH How COVID Patients Dying - Doctor Explains

In all 12 COVID Autopsy cases, the cause of death was found within the lungs or the pulmonary vascular system. Those who did not die of large pulmonary emboli died of extensive inflammation, meaning pneumonia with ARDS. In these COVID Autopsy cases, the lungs were wet and heavy, much like a saturated water sponge. The lung surfaces often had a distinct patchy pattern, with pale areas alternating with slightly protruding and firm, deep reddish-blue Hypercapillarized areas. This indicates areas of intense inflammation, with endothelial dysfunction that can be seen at the microscopic level. When they look at the lungs' slices under the microscope, they found diffuse alveolar damage in 8 COVID Autopsy cases. Specifically, they saw hyaline membrane formation, tiny clots in the capillaries, capillaries engorged with red blood cells, and other inflammatory findings. All these findings represent ARDS. They also found lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, infiltrated these areas of infiltration.  This fits the picture of viral pathogenesis.

https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003

They also looked at the pharynx of these COVID patients, meaning in their throat. The lining of the throat, or mucosa, was hyperemic, meaning very red and irritated. At the microscopic level, they saw lymphocytes invading there, which is consistent with a viral infection. In one COVID case, a COVID patient had lymphocytes invade his heart muscle, findings that are consistent with what we call viral myocarditis. More than half of the COVID patients in this study had large blood clots. One-third of the COVID patients had pulmonary embolism as the direct cause of death. All the others died of intense inflammation in their lungs related to pneumonia with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Recently, studies show that about 1/3rd of COVID patients with severe COVID have blood clots. In another study of 191 COVID patients, half of those who died had clots, compared with 7% of survivors. And levels of D-dimer that were greater than 1000 µg/L were associated with a fatal outcome. So it's pretty clear now that the COVID has caused many clots to form in moderate to severe COVID disease.

How is this happening? 
It's likely a combination of reasons that have to do with downregulation of the ACE2 receptor in the lung alveoli, with a subsequent shift towards having more angiotensin II in the lungs, and less angiotensin 1-7 and 1-9 in the lungs, and when this happens, this leads to more cytokine storm with more inflammation, more constriction of pulmonary arteries, and more clots that develop. That, in turn, leads to more endothelial dysfunction in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. Also, there is evidence that the virus attaches to the ACE2 receptors of those endothelial cells that line those capillaries, which further propagates inflammation and clotting. And in the cytokine storm that develops there, RANTES, a chemokine, binds to the CCR5 receptor of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, and that causes those lymphocytes to infiltrate those areas of inflammation, and in doing so, further contributes towards the inflammatory reaction. This is why we are seeing low levels of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in severe COVID. Endothelial damage can also lead to the development of antiphospholipid antibodies, and these antibodies are bad because they trigger blood clot formation. That’s why COVID patients who have clots with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome need to be on blood thinners. 

11 out of the 12 COVID patients in this study had underlying heart disease and were obese. These are known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction and are known risk factors for COVID.  So the big takeaways from the findings in this study are that most people who die of COVID are primarily lung problems. Either related to inflammation with ARDS and/or blood clots.

Antiphospholipid syndrome might be a commonality among patients with thrombosis in COVID patients.

#covid #covid19 #autopsy","before I say anything I just want to say that if 
you are squeamish you might not want to watch this   video because there will be some pictures of 
lungs that have a blood clot in them and other   organs of the body and my opinion is nothing that 
bad but I wanted to give you a warning regardless   this video is a follow-up to my last video which 
is called what doctors are learning from autopsy   findings of COVID patients just after I published 
that video not even a day later this study came   out published in the annals of internal medicine 
which I'll put a link in the description below   and what makes this study such a big deal is 
that it's the first study that looked at this   many autopsies of patients who died of COVID not 
only do they do complete autopsies but they use   CT scans to scan the entire body for blood clots 
all 12 of the deceased had tested positive for   SARS coronavirus - by means of rt-pcr now I want 
to say something not everyone on this planet is   going to get COVID for those who do get the virus 
80 percent of them will have either mild or no   symptoms roughly 15 to 20 percent of them will 
have pneumonia roughly 4 percent will develop   ARDS or a few respiratory distress syndrome and/or 
shock with multi-organ failure and about 1 percent   will die of the infection when I'm in the ICU and 
someone dies it's obviously horrible sometimes   autopsies have to be done irrespective of family 
consent when it's a legal matter rarely depending   on the circumstances we ask family's permission to 
do an autopsy most families decline the option for   autopsy but during this pandemic it's especially 
important for autopsies to be done because they   often provide incredibly valuable information 
especially when we still know so little about   COVID especially when it can present in so many 
different ways so in this study that was done in   Germany autopsies were mandated for patients 
who died of coded and to the families of those   victims of COVID my condolences and we're 
still trying to figure out why some people   do so poorly when they get the virus while others 
do just fine and then there's everyone in between   the point of this video is not to scare people 
the point is to learn about the disease and to   ultimately benefit from that learning with 
the hope of developing treatment options in   ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality in other 
words to save lives and by making this video the   goal is to educate myself and others about what 
we're learning and getting the medical truth out   there to the public so in this study there were 
12 patients total nine men three women and the   median age was 73 all patients had some type of 
pre-existing medical condition most of them had   obesity and/or underlying heart disease such as 
coronary heart disease some had type 2 diabetes   hypertension peripheral artery disease asthma 
COPD initial lab tests revealed elevated levels   of d-dimer lactate dehydrogenase meaning LD H 
and C reactive protein or CRP all of these are   nonspecific markers of inflammation there is also 
mild thrombocytopenia in some patients meaning low   platelet counts this isn't an unusual finding in 
patients who are critically ill they also looked   at levels of viral RNA using rt-pcr studies all 
twelve patients had the Stars quarter virus to   RNA in their lungs nine out of the twelve had it 
in their throat and six had in their bloodstream   in five patients they had viral RNA in other 
tissues like heart liver brain and kidney not   only did they have the virus there but the levels 
were higher in those tissues compared to the blood   here's a picture from a different autopsy that 
was not part of this study where the virus was   actually visualized in the kidney using electron 
microscopy so what is this telling us it tells us   that the virus is binding to those h2 receptors 
in those organs so in some people who dive COVID  they had the virus in other organs besides the 
lungs but and this is a big but they did not die   as a result of that virus being in those different 
organs they died as a result of lung complications   also an important takeaway from this is that all 
twelve had in their lungs and nine out of the 12   in their throat so when you go to do a throat 
swab with someone who has COVID the virus might   not even be there and that's just another reason 
why you can get a false negative test okay so they   also did post-mortem CT scans of these patients 
which demonstrated mixed patterns of reticular   infiltrations in severe dense consolidations in 
both lungs this CT scan is a patient with covid   pneumonia in erred yes not from this study 
that we're talking about now but basically   demonstrating the exact same thing both lungs have 
extensive consolidations ground-glass opacities   which represent an extensive inflammation these 
are also known as pulmonary infiltrates and you   can see the difference compared to a normal 
CT scan of the chest which doesn't have any   pulmonary infiltrates in four cases out of the 12 
massive pulmonary embolism meaning massive blood   clots in the pulmonary arteries was the cause of 
death in another three cases out of the 12 they   had blood clots in their large veins of their legs 
meaning DVT without having pulmonary embolism so   in six of the nine men they had clots in the veins 
that surround the prostate gland in all 12 cases   the cause of death was found within the lungs or 
the pulmonary vascular system meaning within the   pulmonary arteries for the ones who didn't die of 
having a large pulmonary emboli they died of the   extensive inflammation within the lungs meaning 
pneumonia with ARDS in these cases the lungs were   wet and heavy much like a sponge that is saturated 
with water the surfaces of the lung often had   a distinct patchy pattern with pale areas 
alternating with slightly protruding and firm   deep reddish blue hyper capitalized areas this 
is indicative of areas of intense inflammation   with endothelial dysfunction that can be seen at 
the microscopic level when they look at slices   of the lungs under the microscope they found 
diffuse alveolar damage in eight cases out of 12   specifically they saw hyaline membrane formation 
tiny clots in the capillaries and capillaries   that were engorged with red blood cells and 
other inflammatory findings all these findings   represent ARDS they also found lymphocytes 
a type of a white blood cell that infiltrated   these specific tissues this fits the picture of a 
viral pathogen ASIS they also look at the pharynx   of these patients meaning the throat the lining of 
the throat where the mucosa was hyperemic meaning   very red and irritated and at the microscopic 
level they saw lymphocytes invading there as well   again which is consistent with a viral infection 
in one case a patient had lymphocytes invade his   heart muscle findings that are consistent with 
what we call viral myocarditis in other words the   heart muscle had evidence of viral infection more 
than half the patients in this study had large   blood clots 1/3 of the patients had pulmonary 
embolism as the direct cause of death all the   others died of intense inflammation in their lungs 
related to pneumonia and ARDS recently there's   been studies showing that about 1/3 of patients 
with severe COVID have blood clots another study   of 191 patients with Kovan 19 half of those who 
died had clots compared with 7% of the survivors   and levels of d-dimer that were greater than 
1,000 were associated with a fatal outcome so   it's pretty clear now that stars curve to virus 
is causing a lot of class to form and moderate   to severe COVID disease but how is this happening 
it's likely a combination of reasons they have   to do with down regulation of the h2 receptor in 
the lung alveoli with a subsequent shift towards   having more angiotensin 2 in the lungs and less 
angiotensin 1:7 and less in angiotensin 1:9 in   the lungs and when this happens this leads to 
more cytokine storm with more inflammation more   constriction of pulmonary arteries and more 
clots that develop that in turn leads to more   endothelial dysfunction in the capillaries that 
surround the alveoli also there's evidence that   the virus attaches to the ACE 2 receptors of the 
endothelial cells that line those capillaries   which further propagates inflammation in clotting 
and in the cytokine storm that develops there   Randy's Okemo kine bind to the ccr5 receptor 
of cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes and that causes   those lymphocytes to infiltrate those areas of 
inflammation and in doing so further contributes   towards the inflammatory reaction this is why 
we're seeing low levels of cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes   and severe COVID endothelial damage can also lead 
to the development of antiphospholipid antibodies   and these antibodies are bad because they trigger 
the formation of blood clots and that's why   patients who have clots with the diagnosis 
of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome they   need to be on blood thinners also 11 out of the 12 
patients in the study had underlying heart disease   and were obese these are known risk factors not 
just for cardiovascular disease but also known   risk factors for endothelial dysfunction in our 
known risk factors for COVID the endothelium is   more susceptible to damage based on cardiovascular 
risk factors such as men age 45 or older women   age 55 or older smoking high blood pressure high 
cholesterol diabetes obesity and lack of physical   activity so the big takeaways from the findings 
in this study is that most people who die of kovat   it's primarily a lung problem either related to 
inflammation with ARDS and/or blood clots even   though blood thinners are not a cure for kovat per 
se they do have the potential to save lives the   hard part is figuring out who is likely to develop 
clots and who should we give blood thinners to and   which blood thinners should we give and should 
we give high doses of blood thinners or just the   low-dose prophylactic doses to further complicate 
matters it's often hard to diagnose blood clots in   hospitalized patients even before COVID came along 
usually it's easy to diagnose large blood clots in   the veins of the legs meaning DVT by doing an 
ultrasound of the legs even though ultrasound   isn't a hundred percent accurate the way we 
typically diagnose pulmonary emboli is by getting   a CT scan of the chest while at the same time 
giving IV contrast and this is called a CT angio   or CT a of the chest the downsides of doing this 
well there's several one you have to transport a   patient to the CT scanner and sometimes patients 
aren't stable enough to do that to you risk   spreading the virus to others in the hospital by 
transporting that pay and this will also require   more PPE use 3 CT scans require larger doses of 
radiation for giving someone IV contrast has some   risks such as the risk of serious allergic 
reaction in the risk of causing some kidney   damage on top of that the CTA of the chest can 
only visualize bigger clots so you might not see   the small clots that are there right now more and 
more hospitals are giving high-dose blood thinners   to COVID patients who have severe disease even 
if they haven't been diagnosed as having blood   clots but what about patients without moderate or 
severe Kovich should they take a blood thinner or   maybe a low dose blood thinner or should they take 
an antiplatelet medication like aspirin either 81   milligrams of aspirin or 162 milligram dose or 325 
milligrams os-- or should the general public take   a low dose aspirin like 81 milligrams in order to 
help prevent blood clots from forming if they do   get COVID or should it just be certain people in 
the population who are at higher risk of getting   severe COVID should they take aspirin these are 
the questions we don't know the answers to at   this point it's going to take a lot of studies 
to answer these questions because not only do   we need to know that there's a benefit in doing so 
we have to know that these benefits will outweigh   the risks such as the risk of bleeding and then 
there's all the other drugs that are being looked   at right now and randomized control trials we 
should start seeing some of these results pretty   soon what we do know is that in order to improve 
the capillary endothelium and also to minimize   your chances of having severe disease if you 
were to get COVID you want to do several things   this includes exercise eating healthy getting 
good sleep minimizing stress not smoking what   about vaping generally not good either but not as 
bad as smoking too much alcohol not good either   have your medical conditions under control 
whether that's diabetes high blood pressure   COPD asthma allergies whatever the case may be 
now what about vitamin D probably a good thing   but that's a whole nother topic which I should 
make my next video on because there's a lot to   say about that and possibly other vitamins too

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] more than 26 million infected around the world hundreds of thousands have died that's a world war type of scenario world war casualty figures the first case of covet 19 emerges in uhan china in november 2019. in january 2020 singapore confirms its first case of the novel coronavirus the fight against what will become a global pandemic is about to get tougher and last much longer than healthcare workers can even imagine overnight we saw three times more singaporeans coming to our screening center my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited wart we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases i didn't sleep that day how do i feel one word sums it up tired tantoxing hospital is one of singapore's largest multidisciplinary hospitals next door under the sea management is the national center for infectious diseases which officially opened its doors just four months before the biggest public health crisis in the recent history of the city-state over the course of eight months in 2020 both will screen a total of more than 35 000 people for covet 19 and award thousands of infected cases almost every single staff member will be pulled into the war on the virus and it starts like this on the 30th of december there was reports from china that there were clusters of atypical pneumonia happening in muhan and the cost of it is unknown that signals that there could be something unusual happening and it's something that we need to watch closely for dr angela chao heads the department of clinical epidemiology at ncid one of its tasks is to look out for data on infectious disease trends around the world so every day they were monitoring for diseases very closely and receiving influenza and it also tells you where the countries the areas where there are active transmission or even users three days after the news from china singapore begins to screen all inbound travelers from uhan although the cause of the outbreak there is still unclear ttsh and ncid go into full outbreak mode it was never in any point in time in doubt in our mind that it would spare singapore professor leo eason was at the forefront of singapore's fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in the early 2000s which claimed 33 lives two of them were her colleagues at ttsh a very painful experience taught us that our systems need to be ready in the sas aftermath the hospital developed a comprehensive outbreak playbook every staff is assigned a role to play in event of an outbreak and hospital-wide drills are conducted at least once a year planning is an essential part of our state of readiness it makes an outbreak a known unknown realistically speaking dr ang hao who joined the hospital shortly before the sars outbreak now leads its emergency department which is singapore's largest and busiest emergency department has a long established history of running screening for outbreaks during peacetime we already screened partners yellow fever monkey pop ebola plague lassa fever and now kovid 19 this is new working closely with dr ang is dr charmaine manawas who develops the instructions for healthcare staff to screen patients there was a particular period where we had to screen for certain provinces in china so of course everyone isn't versed on where the provinces are so that's why they put the map here once we pick up a travel to these certain countries than they are triage to the fever area four days after screening begins ncid opens its first outbreak award to isolate suspect patients margaret soon is its nursing director with almost 30 years of experience the initial cases definitely is with a lot of anxiety because we know very little we also could tell the staff very little it's a tense period on january 8 chinese officials identify a new coronavirus that's related to sars and mers as the cause of the epidemic a day later its genome is made public scientists in singapore begin their race to develop a test kit among them is a team comprising staff from ttsh and the agency for science technology and research so when the first case arrived we could use our own in-house detection kits to be able to make the diagnosis in china the virus has spread from wuhan to other parts of the hubei province people begin to die from the infection and medical workers are contracting the disease in the line of duty in singapore ttsh isn't taking chances with the safety of its staff its infection control team ensures that everyone from doctors to cleaners is properly trained and equipped to protect themselves [Music] these strict protocols have been meticulously developed over the years by dr brenda aung another sars veteran the role of infection control to limit the spread between patients and also to try and prevent transmission to healthcare workers even contractors are mask fitted [Music] over the rest of january cases emerge elsewhere around asia on january 23rd the same day the chinese government put cities in hupei under lockdown singapore confirms its first case a 66 year old chinese national from uhan who is awarded at the singapore general hospital the day after case number two is confirmed this time at ncid it was actually a tourist from ohan so of course she couldn't quite remember where she's been what she's done finding out where she'd been and who she'd met is the job of dr chao's team in the weeks to come the role of thorough contact tracing will become even more apparent as more is learned about when and how infected persons transmit the virus from the point when they are symptomatic we look back one incubation period so 14 days the history can go back like two three weeks a lot of time to slowly joke their memories to recall where did you go with your daughter you know here i think who have rather active social life that is definitely good it's just it's a bit more challenging when you're trying to do the contact racing um to know exactly where are the places that you went to and what times you went as more close contacts of infected patients are identified the screening load at the emergency department increases ttsh decides to activate the dedicated infectious disease screening center ncid it was a very busy chinese new year for a lot of people not because we were going around celebrating furniture had to be moved in computers had to be set up we actually managed to cut two days off the activation time more nurses are also needed to triage and swap patients we have to draw nurses from various areas including nurses from operating theaters the clinics our nurse educators some of them volunteered actually the whole kang phong is involved so this is my night shift let's go and have a look a nurse at the cardiology department is one of the volunteers we practice and we do the swap on each other i tell you you won't think about do it again so far all confirmed cases here have been travellers from china singapore will restrict entry to all new travelers who've been to mainland china in the last 14 days regardless of nationality but on february 4th the inevitable happens a cluster of infections emerges from a chinese medical hall serving tourists from china the four cases signal the start of communities spread in singapore it also sparks a change in the definition of a suspect case to anyone with recent close contact with travelers from china taxi drivers tour bus drivers people who worked in tourist attractions or hotels and airports casinos they were all flooding in today it was three times more than what we saw the day before the task of making sure they stay ahead of this massive search and demand falls to this place [Music] welcome to the command center of tandoxing hospital this is where we have visibility of the entire operations industry hospital and the national center for infectious diseases this military-inspired command and control center is the first of its kind in a local healthcare facility it's overseen by dr jamie lim the hospital's chief operating officer the screen gives us visibility of the supplies that we have at the screening center how many patients do we have at that point in time we use colors to depict status when it crosses a certain threshold it either turns yellow amber and then the next threshold will be great we don't want to be reactive but we want to be ahead of the signs and sickness on that pivotal night of february 4th c3 system triggered an alarm in a span of 24 hours we open up an additional five words we had to open 100 bids within a day that was really stressful there's just a lot of coordination to making sure that the medications are there lyndon is there but when the bits fill up quickly with suspect cases who present as clinically well the team proposes a new strategy [Music] ncid clinical director sean vasu keeps the health ministry updated regularly we proposed to the ministry a swap and send home strategy where patients who do not in hospital care would receive that diagnostic test an adequate amount of medical leave to go home and self-isolate to the results come out within the next 8-24 hours at home these patients are closely monitored by the surveillance team to see if they develop symptoms those who test positive are brought in straight away by ambulance for admission to ncid we have also trained up our data analysts our biostatisticians pathologists our psychologists they were helping us with phone surveillance soon as the patient load increases as many as 50 staff are roped in to call more than 500 people a day as part of surveillance and contact tracing efforts another team working round the clock in the background is the department of laboratory medicine led by dr patha day we very quickly had to go to 24 7 operation from normal office hours right now i'm labeling the samples that we will be extracting for the next round of extraction they are another crucial link in the chain racing to provide timely confirmation of whether a suspected case has been infected or not even a negative result enables the doctors and nurses to discharge patients and free up beds for the new incoming suspect and confirmed cases almost every half an hour there will be samples coming in my busiest night throughout the night from 8 30 to the next morning 8 30 i didn't even have time to rest it was continuous running of samples [Music] the team uses the test kit developed by scientists from ttsh and a star made available to hospitals on february 6th and it comes none too soon [Music] the next day singapore raises its disease outbreak response system condition to orange alert level the disease spreads easily among people but is contained and not widespread visitors to hospitals will now have to fill in declaration forms and have the temperature taken staff are redeployed here from other departments to make this possible and as a safety measure the hospital cuts down on elective surgeries and closes some clinics i came from a acupuncture clinic a business office health department some staff like dietetic technician collis yap now work twelve hour shifts instead of normal working hours at fps is very draining my family members always remind me why i do this and why is it important thank you very much for coming on a saturday other medical staff are directed to support the screening center and outbreak warts obviously we needed more manpower the whole hospital had to cut down and leave and off days in fact i was planning for my honeymoon but i got cancelled and i came back to ncid to care for my patients but on social media accounts are shared of ambulance drivers and nurses being shunned on public transport and in public areas this paranoia however triggers the unexpected an overwhelming flood of love and encouragement for healthcare workers so we've received a lot of stuff from kids and from the public so this one is from little footprints preschool um look they have the babies uh these are the babies footprints and then the older kids wrote us letters so it's very heartwarming [Music] patients too express their gratitude mrs jung spent most of her 18 days in ncid under intensive care [Music] oh [Music] meanwhile the virus continues to spread in the community and new clusters emerge but the infection rate remains low compared to countries like italy and to some it looks like life could soon return to normal in singapore i suppose to the public that may seem like a loud period but that that silence was very worrying for us [Music] countries other than china go into lockdown and who declares covet 19 a pandemic [Music] we knew that it was a matter of time before we see the second wave we didn't know how big the second wave was going to be so we made a decision with the ministry to set up a tentach just outside the screening center if ever there is an overflow of patients coming in for screening the lab is also trying to ramp up its capacity from 500 to 800 tests a day with more staff and equipment but its efforts are hampered by a global shortage of reagents on march 21st singapore reports its first covet 19 deaths the icu team is no stranger to dealing with mortality but handling death from covet 19 is different what usa is outside the ico world what we see is the reality and the sickle cell patient unfortunately we do lost patients despite every effort we put they still pass on that was very very difficult for the families because none of them could come and see and you had to tell them over the phone what was happening and that your father or mother brother sister was was likely going to die you can imagine this is my love once i would actually want to hold their hand to see a proper go by we do have a relative actually funded during the video call we just feel a bit helpless yeah but we try our best to do what we can to help the patient and the family everybody does that yeah in the icu well spain is now emerging as a new hotspot for covet 19. by march 22nd the death toll worldwide from covet 19 is more than 11 000 and in singapore infection numbers have crept back up mainly from imported cases for the first time ever singapore closes its borders to tourists and short-term visitors the next day dr jamie lim's fears come true we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases we actually had to open tentach until 3 a.m at night with a lot of patients having to wait a little bit longer so that was a struggle i i didn't sleep that day this search in cases is due mainly to students and travelers returning home from countries going into lockdown what's it why suddenly so many patrons yeah then oh yeah we just chong mao we are 80 people if there's a job to do then we just do it ncid immediately enacts its plan to expand the number of bits in the outbreak wards so let's move to 5f okay we will go down to level 2 the capacity here at baseline is 330 bits we can expand the capacity to 586. the rooms in this building are designed in such a way that we can double stack or in some rooms triple stack but many of the bits are also being taken up by infected patients who are recovering well and in the clinical team's view can be cared for outside the hospital setting at the national level the decision is made [Music] there was a turning point in outbreak in terms of our isolation strategy this is where clinical data informs policy we knew that clinical presentation certain demographics about the patient their age and their medical history which means that we can now have younger coveted 19 cases being taken care of in the isolation facilities and most of them would recover without significant complications over a month three more community isolation facilities are set up all these are all like kind of draw plans already increase flexible it may not be already in your drawer plan but you must have a system where it is flexible enough so that it becomes situation based and we can still respond effectively on march 29th a porter who transports patients in ncid is confirmed to have contracted covet 19. an outbreak within its walls would be any hospital's nightmare it happened to ttsh during sars when some 100 staff visitors and patients were infected following exposure to the virus in its warts but this time nearly 20 years later the hospital came prepared to the fight and despite the more infectious nature of covet 19 the stringent measures from personal protection protocols to staff surveillance have prevented disease transmission so far now i can do it again everyone who enters into ncrd wears this tech all patients and staff within ncid wear a real-time tracking device which allows the staff surveillance team to quickly trace people who are in contact with the porter you can just open up all of them so you can actually see all of them have been in contact with every other people it provides granular level of visibility of where each patient is and where each staff is so this is the floor plan it shows this portal's movement history on this date the information helps ncid to identify staff at risk of contracting the virus and to quarantine them to stem a potential hospital cluster you could say this is big brother watching you but just say there's a friendly father hospital observing people again for staff a lot of safety happens as of september 13th 10 staff from ttsh and ncid have contracted covet 19 but none in the course of their work but elsewhere in singapore a time bomb is about to go off the coronavirus has been quietly spreading among migrant workers this was the dormitory with the bangladeshi workers dayden before he tested positive for the virus meanwhile though nowhere at the levels of countries like the us or italy the number of unlinked community cases has crept up on april 3rd prime minister lee sien long announces that singapore will go into circuit breaker mode closing schools and many workplaces we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period because this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus we do not want to wait for a situation where the cases rise sharply and then we get overwhelmed the streets of singapore have never been quieter but the scene at ttsh is very different [Music] each day up to 300 migrant workers come here to be screened the basic difference is that the migrant workers are unable to self-isolate because they live in a dorm we will have to hold them until the swab results are out if the patient is negative then they have to be transferred to a clean dorm if the swab results are positive then they may be admitted or they may be transferred to isolation facility on april 20th singapore sees 1400 new cases of covet 19 the highest numbers so far in a single day the majority of them are migrant workers i remember coming to work and overnight my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited what because we have to increase our capacity just to cope with this increase of infection cases it was then that we saw some of the most sick patients it was a emotional period for me personally because the patients that we see are usually fit young construction workers they had to be hospitalized for quite some time [Music] only i think about my family plus how to say my life i can i can continue my life i also very very my inside very question mark really daily new cases of covet 19 remain high throughout april and ncid warts are almost fully occupied again triggering its plan to expand into ttsh my name is nadia i'm an assistantness creation here in sandboxing and i'm a nurse working in the kobit award this is the first time when we have both covet patients and business as usual patients in the same building the first thing that we have to do is to make sure that the pathways are segregated that includes mapping of the rules and locking down the leaf or the kobe pathway so these are the two areas that is actually designated to nurse our kovid patients so let's go six general awards there are converted into outbreak wards one what is actually allocated to be the clean area the first shift is like you go in right it's not even five minutes you are like wet everywhere and then you feel like so stuffy and then you have this like fainting spells like you cannot breathe so well every cubicle there will be three big exhaust fans this actually to create negative pressure because the cubicle doesn't have an extra glass doors or an extra room finally after eight weeks of circuit breaker the rate of infection starts to slow with the reduced covet 19 patient load the additional outbreak warts at ttsh are no longer needed but for one department there is no easing up in fact our workload on microbiology for pcr has gone up a lot more it's doubled to cope the department hires additional staff and acquires new equipment that simplifies the testing process there's people who need to be cleared to go back to work like school teachers goods delivery drivers essential goods like groceries and so on the emphasis has shifted to screening which is a good thing which is part of reopening covid19 will eventually become the new normal respiratory virus that we will test for every year just as swine flu h1n1 on july 14th the lab makes a mistake a confirmed case of covet 19 has been found to be wrongly diagnosed due to a mix-up of test samples at the tantoxin hospital's laboratory to ensure that a mistake like this doesn't happen again the lab has automated its patient registration process i've got a thousand specimens to process even if we tell them take your time do they know there are patients waiting at the end of this and they want to do their best so we've had to try and manage all of that the psychological as well as the physical demands while the hospital still isn't going back to 100 business as usual it has managed to resume some elective surgeries and open certain clinics other inpatient warts have also continued to run all this while compared to sars when ttsh was designated the central treatment hospital enclosed to all non-sars patients in an outbreak people still come in with a heart attack people still break their leg and they need treatment emergency surgeries will still carry on we run essentially two hospitals tantoxin as the business as usual and ncid as the outbreak center with the same team of doctors nurses and administrators can you just page for me if there is any problem i will be in the office okay um nipping did not really reduce the illness patient ratio either at bau side and also at ncid side we deliberate plan for the ratio to be at one is to four especially because we think that adequate stuffing is important for both patient and staff safety but the months-long fight has taken a mental and emotional toll on staff and the war with covet 19 is a long way from over there's one day my husband actually come back from work having high fever i'm not scared for myself i really scared for my love once and what i don't want is because of me he got covered there is actually something really made me emotional at that period i realized that running the screening center takes a lot of effort and each of the different family groups contribute so much um [Music] yeah it's been tiring this one sorry [Music] everybody has been pulling together responding to this terrible pandemic you do a fantastic job not just during the pandemic you do a fantastic job all day every day i'm tremendously proud of my colleagues they are marvellous they are kind-hearted and you know they they really give the best in their care i think so far singapore has coped reasonably well and that again is the work of the entire healthcare system the ability to respond to the challenge however i think we shouldn't be complacent because i think the road ahead is still long and windy you ,True,True,False,False

24,upY8keSCBeY,Loyola Medicine,COVID-19: Warning Signs of PTSD from COVID-19,2020-06-09T15:44:39Z,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stressful, scary and even traumatic time for many. Loyola Medicine psychologist Elizabeth Simmons, PsyD, discusses how ongoing uncertainty, fear and grief may cause an acute distress disorder, and if prolonged for more than one month, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

COVID-19 survivors, individuals who have lost a family member or loved one to this disease, and/or front line health care and other essential workers, are most at risk for a stress disorder. Dr. Simmons outlines the symptoms to look for, how to take care of yourself during this time, and how to seek help when necessary.

For more information on scheduling a virtual visit or in-person appointment, visit https://www.loyolamedicine.org/virtualcare or call 888-584-7888.",right now this is a very stressful time for everyone in a variety of ways due to the Cova 19 pandemic and it can even be more so than stress a traumatic experience we're all facing quite a bit of uncertainty and fear there can be grief and loss we need to consider some of the mental health conditions that can arise following a trauma or in the midst of a trauma so those primary reactions would be acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder acute stress disorder happens usually within the first month of the trauma and then after about a month those same symptoms become post-traumatic stress disorder there are particular groups that we want to be aware of at this time that are of higher risk so we're really being mindful of Cova 19 survivors people that work in health care positions or other essential workers who are consistently exposed people that work in long-term care facilities or nursing homes here are some warning signs that you may be experiencing an acute stress reaction or post traumatic stress disorder symptoms you are avoiding situations or places or people that remind you of the traumatic event they may also have nightmares or distressing dreams or even flashbacks where you feel like the event is happening again changes in mood and cognition you may be more quick to frustration or irritability the first thing to do is to be aware of your emotions to label what you're feeling to identify that it's fear that it's sadness additionally it's really important that we take care of our bodies right now so this is everything from eating regular meals trying to maintain a regular sleep routine regular exercise and getting outside also we want to connect with other people the social support that we receive from other people our protective factors against PTSD so we are all very resilient in the face of profound loss or stress and not everyone who goes through a trauma or a traumatic experience will develop PTSD but we need to be aware that having PTSD is not a weakness and it is treatable when you notice that you're really struggling with these symptoms we would recommend reaching out to your primary care doctor who can get you connected with a referral to a mental health specialist Loyola Medicine is taking every precaution to keep you safe from Cova during procedures and physician visits everyone entering our facilities is screened for kovat symptoms and provided with a mask all patients undergoing a surgery or procedure are tested for covin prior to the surgery or procedure we are following the CDC's standards for increased cleaning especially on high touch surfaces and we are continuing safe distancing measures whenever possible thank you for entrusting Loyola Medicine with your healthcare needs ,True,False,True,False

Speaking as part of a series of national broadcasts where Cabinet ministers discuss Singapore's post-COVID-19 future, Mr Teo said a ""bleak outcome"" is not a foregone conclusion, but Singapore can hold its own - ""only if we are strong, successful and united at home"".

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia","dear fellow Singaporeans and Friends it was only five months ago when news of the kovat 19 virus first emerged what began as a localized public health emergency has since become a global crisis the pandemic has disrupted the international system and brought about far-reaching changes that will reverberate for a long time affecting our daily lives and our livelihoods for example we won't be able to travel abroad as easily as we used to for business or leisure new standards for public health and personal hygiene are here to stay in many instances the changes have sped up trends that were already there for example many more companies and workers have moved online irreversibly changing the way we do business work or shop this will impact the way companies compete and countries trade with each other working from home also means people can do the same job not just from home here but even from home in some other country this can open up more working opportunities but also intensify competition for everyone covered 19 has also accelerated pre-existing geopolitical trends the us-china rivalry has intensified global supply chains have been upended in quite a few countries social divisions have grown starker fracturing social and political stability this has in turn filled a wave of nativism and protectionism countries are acting unilaterally to protect their own short-term interests as a result international organizations like the w-h-o a handicapped as they seek a coordinated global response these developments are threatening the international system and global order which for more than 70 years has provided opportunities for all countries to grow peacefully generations of Singaporeans have grown up believing that globalization and open markets are part of the natural order of things we can no longer assume that this is so today I will talk about the challenges Singapore will face and how we intend to uphold our political and economic standing in this world I will also outline how the government will build greater resilience as we prepare for this new more uncertain world and take care of all Singaporeans how countries respond to the pandemic will shape the post kovat 19 world what will happen to our system of international cooperation with intensified strategic competition can the leading powers still cooperate sufficiently to overcome global challenges will the world slide back to protectionism will it become a technologically and economically bifurcated world a bleak outcome is not inevitable what each country does together with like-minded partners can make a difference the kovat 19 crisis will affect all of us it should motivate all countries to come together to build a more cooperative world rather than become a reason to divide us pursuing narrow self-interest can leave all of us worse off while enlightened self-interest means working together for a better outcome for everyone there is so much to do caring for the sick protecting frontline workers discovering effective treatments and vaccines ensuring the day is enough for all and after the pandemic subsides it will be a long road to economic recovery we need new international protocols gradually and safely resume cross-border exchanges beyond that we need to update reform and strengthen the global trading system to reflect the new realities integration and trade are always far better than isolation and conflict we hope that the major powers will exercise leadership to help the world overcome covet 90 this will set the tone and lay the foundation beyond covet 90 for a renewed open United and inclusive world then humanity can address important shared challenges that require collective global action such as violent extremism nuclear proliferation cybersecurity future pandemics and climate change no single country big or small can solve these problems on its own in this changed world some things will remain unchanged Singapore will always be a small multiracial country surrounded by bigger neighbours located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans exposed to external forces beyond our control Singapore wants to be a good partner and contribute to a harmonious region we will continue to actively promote close ties and good cooperation with our ASEAN partners especially Indonesia and Malaysia not least to tackle covet 19 together we are working closely with Malaysia during this outbreak on the cross-border flow of people and goods as a gesture of solidarity we donated maths test kits and ventilators to Malaysia Indonesia and other ASEAN countries we are also working closely with ASEAN and other key partners to curb the transmission of the virus and to limit the economic fallout on our region at the same time we must deal constructively with the bilateral issues that inevitably arise between close neighbors we will try our best to resolve these issues and achieve a win-win outcome while protecting Singapore's interests and until we can resolve them we must manage and contain the bilateral problems so that we can work on wider areas of cooperation for mutual benefit we also reach beyond our region to make ourselves useful to the world even during this pandemic we are working with key partners to keep supply chains open connected and resilient at the WTO we participate actively to promote trade by updating the rules to suit the digital economy in a world where creating protecting and using knowledge is increasingly important a Singaporean mr. Darren Tang was recently elected to be the next director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization this is the first time that a Singaporean will be leading a UN agency as a small island state we continue to contribute to global action to tackle climate change in March we submitted our updated nationally determined contributions and our long-term low emissions development strategy to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change these are all key issues that will determine the shape of the world to come while we call on the major powers to exercise leadership to strengthen international cooperation small countries also do have a voice and the agency to act thus while the world's largest economies have the g20 smaller and medium-sized UN member states including Singapore have come together to form the 3G of global governance group this 30 member grouping provides inputs to the g20 making global discourse more diverse and inclusive Singapore also founded and continues to lead the forum of small states at the UN to give its members a stronger collective voice the 11-member comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership or CP TPP had its origins in the p4 agreement between gu9 Chile New Zealand and Singapore the ASEAN countries are the core of the regional comprehensive economic partnership RCEP which brings us yen and its FTA partners together these are examples where smaller countries have been able to seed ideas act and draw in larger countries to foster wider cooperation and we will continue to play an active role in this arena to play such a constructive role on the world stage and to protect our national interests we require an able and agile foreign service our Ministry of Foreign Affairs together with other government agencies work hard to help Singapore chart our path in the world and create more opportunities and space for Singaporeans this has now become even more important with the global changes brought about by kovat 19 Singapore can hold its own in the world only if we are strong successful and United at home only then can our diplomats speak with a credible voice only then can we prevent adversaries from manipulating opinions and inciting discord within Singapore only then can we offer something of value so that others want to work with us we can face the world outside with confidence only if we are strong inside the kovat 19 crisis has been a stringent test of our ability and resolve to tackle challenges at home dealing with it has required an unprecedented whole of nation response we established the multi ministry task force in January to coordinate this the MTF has had to make difficult decisions amidst uncertainty and incomplete information as the world struggled to understand this new silent fast-moving and virulent threat the crisis has stretched our resources and capacity but we have been able to orientate adapt and act rapidly as the virus came upon us in waves each wave required us to develop and deploy novel measures to slow down the spread and contain it with patience and perseverance and support and cooperation from everyone we have brought down the number of cases in our general community we have also stabilized the outbreak among our migrant workers we are now carrying out a deliberate plan to test and clear every migrant worker living in the dormitories so that they are well and can safely resume work as a result we can now begin to restart activities gradually and safely taking all the needed precautions that Minister Lawrence Wong described in the previous broadcast as we emerge from the pandemic we will need to build a more resilient Singapore which can respond quickly and effectively in a more uncertain world let me touch on three aspects of our resilience Crisis Response economic resilience and social resilience first coffee 19 has highlighted the importance of building reserves and resilience to respond to unexpected crisis we need not just financial reserves we also need able and experienced people organizational capacity and operational agility when covered 19 struck we could draw on the knowledge expertise and capacity in our healthcare system built up after our sales experience and we could tap the SAF to rapidly build up our contact tracing capacity as we did during SARS but no two crises are the same and tackling kovat 19 especially the outbreak in our migrant worker community has been a major challenge we had heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in our migrant worker dormitories early on unfortunately these turned out to be insufficient because the virus was far more infectious and SARS on 25th March we recorded zero cases in our dama trees just ten days later on 4th April when the number increased 26 cases we acted decisively to isolate the dama trees however the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dama trees meant that in a fortnight by 20th of april we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dama trees we had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and it started to build them we accelerated these plans and scale them up adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April at the peak on the 12th of May we were caring for close to 20,000 patients in our community care and similar facilities this is more than the total number of bits in all our public acute hospitals put together we mobilize resources from across our public service government linked companies and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities health care volunteers step forward to help Mendham this is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our health care system and putting lives at risk this has been a tremendous effort the operations are still ongoing to bring the dormitory situation fully under control but the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the people about two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered kovat 19 was not a mission that our SAF and home team had specifically prepared and trained for but they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days to support their mo m and mo h colleagues who are already on the frontlines the JTF played a critical role by establishing a command control and information system deploying forward assurance and support teams to all the dama trees to look after more than 300,000 workers and supporting mo hitches overall medical support plan every day as many as 1,000 patients had flowed into and through our care facilities every one of them needed to be individually tracked tested monitored isolated while infectious move safely to the right places and given the right treatment over the past two months I worked closely with many of our officers and tracked closely the work that they are doing I would like to thank every one of them for the extraordinary and selfless contributions it is a massive task and our officers from our entire whole of nation team are doing a tremendous job the clear lesson for me is that in peacetime we need to plan on facing the unknown and build deep reserves of people and capabilities so that when we face a crisis we can act decisively and respond flexibly and rapidly second we need economic resilience in the immediate term this means dealing with a direct impact of kovat 19 on our livelihoods and supply chains thus far we have managed to maintain our food and essential supplies through stockpiling diversification and self production these would not have been possible without the industrial capacity and economic resilience that we have built up over the years keeping Singaporeans informed daily and dealing with the crisis in a transparent systematic and thorough way has further strengthened Singapore's reputation for trust credibility and transparency in the eyes of international investors this will stand us in good stead we have faced and overcome such challenges before in 1967 during the early years of our independence the British announced that withdrawal of their troops from Singapore overnight we stood to lose 20 percent of our GDP and 70,000 jobs out of a citizen population that was only half of today's this was a permanent structural loss not a cyclical downturn but Singaporeans fretted our teeth rolled up our sleeves and moved ahead we invested in education and infrastructure open ourselves to the world and promoted new industries shipbuilding and repair electronics and tourism we are far more resilient today than in 1967 and better positioned to create new markets businesses and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost my colleagues will be elaborating on our economic resilience recovery and growth programs in the coming days every crisis strains our social fabric the trauma of Independence edged deeply in the minds of Singaporeans the need for harmony unity and solidarity it begins with our children education for all gives every Singaporean the opportunity to build a better life and share the fruits of our progress high quality affordable public housing provides all Singaporeans a hope and a stake in our country's future ethnically integrated HDB neighbourhoods foster racial and religious harmony we have drawn on these deep reserves in times of crisis for example after the September 11th attacks in 2001 we face the terrorism threat together and did not allow tensions and suspicions to divide our society similarly we supported one another and came through the Asian financial crisis SARS and the global financial crisis together covet 19 is an even bigger test I'm heartened to see many acts of kindness care and compassion from Singaporeans and our friends living here they acknowledged and help take care of our migrant workers and they helped look after those who are more vulnerable among us regardless of race or religion we all share common humanity what we do in a crisis reflects who we are and the values which motivate us as a people and as a nation Corbett 19 is not the first crisis we are faced nor will it be the last as a small country we are more exposed and vulnerable than others in our short history we have repeatedly faced and overcome crises about once every decade some more serious than others the cop in nineteen pandemic is the largest and most complex I have encountered in more than 40 years of public service we have responded to covet 19 as one nation mobilizing our financial reserves our public services our crisis response capacity and our social capital Singaporeans have stepped forward to do our part helping others in need keeping ourselves and others safe during the circuit breaker we have avoided the fissures that have divided some other countries visions that have hindered their ability to respond properly and cost them lives and livelihoods the multi ministry task force is overseeing our national response to covet 19 a new generation of ministers civil servants health care professionals home team and SAF officers are taking the lead for many this is their first major crisis The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of the older cabinet colleagues and consulted widely within and outside the government over the past few months I worked very closely with them we speak daily and exchange views freely they have stepped up to the task work together as a team and lead from the front this is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore what we have built as a nation our solidarity our resolve and our resilience gives me confidence that we will overcome the current crisis and any future challenges to build a stronger and better Singapore together thank you and good health to you and your families ",True,True,False,False

https://t.me/cnalatest",[Music] attention all medical stuff for children for the first time we gain unprecedented access into Singapore's largest children's intensive care unit working in the ICU even if your feet are paddling furiously underwater you have to still be able to perform efficiently this week some of these complications can be fatal parents and doctors confront impossible dilemmas have to wait lease benefit versus the risk chicken we can really be ambitious totally well before we can actually do the excavating [Music] nine-year-old Marcus has been admitted into the children's ICU one minute he was on a soccer field and the next he was in an ambulance with intense chest pains Marcus's heart rhythm is completely out of whack he needs to be watched round-the-clock or he could collapse anytime collapse means he's hot basically stops beating there's not enough blood flow to support any of his vital organs it's almost like what we call cardiac arrest he is dead at the time of the cardiac arrest only at the Children's ICU Kim Marcos received the critical care that he needs so Marcus's main condition is myocarditis which is an inflammation of the heart muscle this is probably a viral infection and a virus has gotten to the heart and causing damage and injury to the heart muscle this contract when this flu myocarditis carries risk of the death of approximately 25 to 30 percent I was shocked because I didn't realize that was so critical from just usual chest pain and then into the spirit you tell me that okay is a viral infection how can a viral infection be so detrimental and it attacks the heart and basically he just collapse just asking you know how did it happen where did happen nobody can answer that question even the doctors can't answer that question and we really don't know how [Music] three-year-old alia has childhood leukemia four rounds of chemotherapy have left alia neutral clinic a condition where her white blood count is low over the past week the CICU doctors managed to keep a bloodstream infection at bay but now a cut in her anus is threatening to blow up into another deadly infection [Music] [Music] I don't see any flower right now the doctors must decide whether to escalate intervention by creating a stoma bag which collects stools from her intestines instead of her anus to keep the perianal wound clean the decision for audience stormer creation was actually a very very challenging decision to make a new trophy was very long her immunity is very weak and also her ability to clock her blood is also very very very bad so putting this factor together the risk of performing an operation such as Tama creation actually post very high risk [Music] one day after being admitted into the CICU Marcuse's blood pressure plummets this and his erratic heartbeat are warning signs that Marcus is in danger of multiple organ failure his heart function was deteriorating in front of the eyes to a point where the Hat was hardly moving at all five different machines allow me to nurses are calling you when doctors saying something your patient is clinically deteriorating in front of you and having to process all those inputs and information and formulating a plan it is challenging to remain calm and all hell breaks loose yeah I think other movements the doctors must make a quick decision whether to hook Marcus up to a heart-lung bypass machine that could save his life but it is an extremely high-risk procedure because we're drawing all your blood out and we're running it through an external device with external shootings any time black comes out of your body at once the clot and the problem when we return black back is if there's risk of protein the clots may also travel into the bloodstream and one of the Western petitions are that we'll get a stroke or you can take [Music] nine-year-old Marcus is at risk of a cardiac arrest and the doctors make the call to hook him on a heart-lung bypass machine called ECMO or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation the moment the doctors caught me he has to be moved to be supported by ignore what's already telling me oh my god there is a high chance that I'll lose him just moments after the doctors completed the procedure Boston actually told me that his heart stopped beating so that was really scary for a mom - yeah [Music] at that time he's totally sedated and paralyzed so there's nothing much I can do except to really just pray that you will come back Marcus is now relying solely on a machine to pump blood around his body we were very thankful that we put in the mo as early as we did because if we had waited any longer Marcus's life would have been in danger luckily the machine is keeping Marcus alive but nobody can tell when or even whether Marcus's heart function would return I mean it's just a bet nightmare that I hope no parents have to go through olia has been on intravenous nutrition for the last two weeks to avoid exacerbation of a perianal infection it's been a while since she's eaten anything orally but her wound still hasn't healed doctors has managed to overcome the infection with antibiotic but it looks like the Battle of meander they still walk away on a fever Otto coming down is - hanging down there we don't really know where is the end of all these infections I think to make the question easier for you is should we do stoma opening in exchange of earlier feeding and also easier okay if our Lea's parents still don't agree to the surgery a Lea may have to be on intravenous nutrition for up to a month which could lead to liver damage and further infections you have to wait these pregnancy versus the risk which is 20 to 30 percent chance men stolen may have some complications talk to your husband talk to the family and they make a decision that's not is all like the chain reaction is a cascade event you can't say whether this is - to tell whether the everything country people but that's what happened to oncology patients order factor will come together and you just had to make the best decision you can considering all the factors [Music] with the discussion just now I have to make a very fast decision by tomorrow whether we are opening the stoma for all you guys get your three [Applause] [Music] today dr. Chen is checking on Marcus [Music] he detects a weak pulse that's good news after 48 hours of not beating Marcus's heart is slowly regaining strength [Music] the possibilities tribal refugee center policy so as the skinless you just feel uncomfortable is it okay [Music] too much the important things in your neck and in your mouth okay these are important ones the one on your head and all that you want to move is Rafi today is day seven of ECMO a VA ECMO which is most significantly complicated by rhythm problems he has underlying Harlow his other problem is that of likely hospital acquired pneumonia for which we have not been able to isolate any microorganism in terms of the etiology of what buck is causing it every time I received a piece of good news I will hear other complications and other ways they are involved so that's the difficult part for me because decide walking one step ahead and then you know back down back streets that because there are other risk involving other complications despite the antibiotics Marcus's lungs are still infected by a bacteria which has led to a full-blown pneumonia doctors now have little choice but to put Marcus through an invasive procedure again we had to do what we call a bronchoscopy for him which is surgery as a small fiber-optic scope that we pass through his breathing tube basically to look for any secretions that we can help to clear to help open up his lungs better but what was supposed to be a straightforward procedure has uncovered complications yet again [Music] the doctors are doing a bronchoscopy to treat Marcus's pneumonia they managed to clear the mucus plugs caused by the infection but during the procedure the doctors also found blood clots in his lungs some of these complications can be fatal for example blood clot formation within the ECMO circuit [Music] Marcus has been relying on a heart-lung bypass machine called ECMO to pump blood through his body the longer we keep patients on ECMO the higher the complications associated with it when there is a clock and if the club moves to the palm I basically auto-shutdown the system so you can imagine if it auto shuts now where Marcus is relying heavily in 500% on the machine that's going to just basically a nice life people dry so is your anymore I of you know it's just the truth [Music] and informative um the doctors need to make a decision when and should they remove the ECMO machine which is keeping Marcus while the doctors deliberate on the next course of action sin Lin's parents have to decide on their daughter's fate [Music] it's listen okay ding Sharna his wife want their daughter to go home soon to do that they need to remove her from a ventilator which delivers oxygen to her lungs but nobody knows if cynllun can survive the process known as extubation after your own after feasible activism if she's do this on Sunday then we wish to proceed my dear will come from home and they're in if we delay sometimes also on prolonged ventilation day the muscles itself also may be deconditioned okay [Music] mucus secretion and sunland's lungs are blocking her air passage but the three-year-old is too weak to cop out the phlegm she's born with spinal muscular atrophy or SMA a genetic disease that weakens her muscles progressively and the longer she is on the ventilator the faster her muscles decondition the chances of her being able to excavator successfully is about to miss fifty fifty percent don't you me and my wife decide is painful where she see us [Music] Papaji mom okay ding Shan and his wife now confronts the dilemma if cynllun struggles to breathe when they removed the ventilator should they resuscitate her and hook her on the machine yet again or do they let her go the problem was when we tried to come off our breathing support she felt that first time and with the discussion with the parents we put her back on breathing support she had a first trial of extubation to Friday spec for which she had multiple D situation and after discussion and parents we intubated her after about one and a half days there was on last last Sunday difficult decision for parents is really do we use the full might of medical technology to support her but knowing that it is still at this present moment with what scientific advancement we have have no cure for her underlying condition dr. mom was saying that this around here she looks more higher as compared to the previous time when when we do the excavation make she was saying that by looking at the machines reading she seems to require more energy to actually prefer her owner do I continue to subject her to my invasive support being in a hospital being the ICU having vines and tubes and things poked into her or do I say enough is enough and we should allow touchable naturally I think parents dilemma is really that she always looks so much better and obviously responds so well once we get the children will be better if next week then we do excavation give us some time to yes maybe meantime we can call my office to see whether when maybe to let them know that this distance is a bit different from the previous hospitalization ready this afternoon they are making molds of sin Lin's hands and feet it would be a final momento for if the inevitable happens [Music] in case singing can sustain no account this exhibition is actually not successful then we maybe time that we we have to decided to actually maybe to let let her let her go [Music] in preparation for the extubation the doctors moose in list to an isolation room to give her family privacy [Music] maybe [Music] you always [Music] [Music] ,False,True,True,False

https://bit.ly/seismiktv",how painful exactly is the swap test it's not the most painful but oh my god it was okay it's only like three seconds that's three seconds it's like getting poor water up your nose or wasabi yes i know it looks like we're crying but that's because the swap can cause a lacrimal reflex which causes you to involuntarily tear up if they sit right if you're tearing means it works okay that means the swap is where it needs to be but where exactly one second [Music] well first there are two types of swap tests that moh recommends there's the car and gold standard diagnostic test the rtpcr test which requires a nasal and throat swap with samples sent to a lab okay good and there's the antigen rtk which only requires the nasal swab and results are produced within the hour though antigen rtk is much faster and cost effective the test is not as sensitive as the rt-pcr and can often result in a false negative there's also the antibody rtk that requires a blood sample but that one's not recommended as a result can often be inaccurate okay so where does the swap go it's like someone pinching the inside most swaps aim for the virus's preferred hiding spots in a nasal pharynx located about seven centimeters straight back into the nose or in the turbinate area about 2.5 centimeters inside the nose so where can you get tested and how much would it cost there are plenty of private and public hospitals and clinics mmoh has listed which you can find on their website oranges currently at columbia asia there's a person in my condo that got it and so i'm just gonna go get a check i went for a swap test because i live and i work in a red zone area we apparently get some sort of discount so it was initially supposed to be 500 bucks but now it's only 309. malaysians only need to fork out one ringgit at public hospitals to get tested and foreigners would be charged within a hundred to two hundred ringgit anyone can also get tested at a private hospital in the 300 ringgit range how long will it take for the 42 days as we battle a third wave of cases please please please just stay at home whenever you can and follow the sops because honestly that really is the best way to curb the covet 19 spread if you happen to have any covet 19 symptoms or was in a red zone area or a possible contact of a positive case please self-isolate and monitor any possible symptoms and go get tested there is really nothing to be afraid of and honestly it makes you feel like you know you've done some good for the people around you wear a mask wash your hands and share this to your family and friends to give them a peace of mind for if they ever need to get swapped yay she did it ,True,False,False,False

Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost/","-For weeks, New Yorkers cheered
and clapped for the city's
healthcare workers. The doctors, nurses and EMTs who have faced down the pandemic
are hailed as heroes. But many have never felt
so afraid. -Life at the end of this --
hopefully we'll all make it -- Life at the end of this
will be very, very different. -The good thing is that the team
is strong and sticking together and keeping our spirits up, but this is going to wear
heavily on everybody. -You know, how are our EMTs,
our paramedics, our nurses, our doctors,
our hospital staff, you know,
the morgue technicians, the funeral directors who have
dealt with so much death, more than anybody
should ever deal with -- how are we gonna be
after all this? -You may be working in
a situation where your job is to save lives and you fail and fail
and fail to save lives. They die in ways that start
to wear you down to the point that you don't feel like you're
a good doctor or nurse anymore. You want to give up
on your career. You may hit a point of feeling
so much grief, you're in despair. -Mental-health experts like
Rita Brock have a term for this experience. They call it ""moral injury."" -So, when we're in
moral distress, it means that
our whole relational system and our entire body systems
are at risk of breaking down because morality is core
to being a human being. So it's a serious affliction. It's a deep kind of suffering. If you don't address
the suffering, it can impact people's lives
for a very, very long time. -There are certain instances
that are traumatic and that will stick with me
for the rest of my life, and this was definitely
one of them. -For cardiologist Sanjum Sethi, the hardest part is not knowing
how to help his patients. -The reality is is that
there was multiple people that were so critically ill
and that, no matter what we did, we couldn't seem to -- we couldn't seem to turn
the corner on this virus. It really is relentless because
you will make modifications to their care and support them, and then the next day
or a few hours later, things are worse again. -And when patients die,
they die alone. -A big part of
critical-illness care is interaction with families. And now, the families were
removed from the equation, and that's really tough. -When you work so hard and you
do such amazing work, but the outcomes aren't good
at all in so many cases, and when the threat level
is so high but you have to keep coming
and charging into work every day in fear
of what may happen to you or what you may do
to your family, that same level of anxiety just
reminds me absolutely of my days on the front lines
of Desert Storm, Desert Shield. I feel like I'm
absolutely closer to death now than I was even on
the front lines of Desert Storm. -Rocky Walker is
a military veteran and a chaplain at Mount Sinai
Heart Hospital. -We've had several colleagues
that have actually passed away from this COVID pandemic. They contracted this doing
the very thing that we're doing, and what a terrible sacrifice, and this COVID pandemic
is going to end some day, some day soon, hopefully,
and we're going to win. But even after we win,
the ones who have been lost, they don't come back. And that's just terribly hard. -Even in normal times, many healthcare workers
are under enormous strain. -So, before COVID hit,
we knew that about 40 to 50 percent
of healthcare professionals had substantial symptoms
of burnout, that they were much more likely to have burnout
than other US workers. -Lotte Dyrbye is a leading
researcher on burnout. -Physicians and our trainees
are sometimes very reluctant to seek care for emotional
or mental-health problems because of potential
ramifications to medical licensure or ability
to get malpractice insurance or short-term disability
or long-term disability and even getting
hospital privileges. -One of my colleagues said
there's a morning meeting in her facility, and there's the morning check,
and ""How's everybody doing?"" And everybody says,
""Oh, we're doing fine,"" but some of them
are not doing fine. And they don't feel
that they can say, ""I'm freaked out of my mind here
about what's going on and I'm so afraid that something's
gonna happen to my family because of my professional
role there."" -As the first wave
of coronavirus cases subsides, clinical professor Greg Hinrichsen says
healthcare workers need help. -There's a certain amount
of sucking it up, saying, you know,
""We got the mission and we're gonna
carry it through,"" and that's beautiful
and that's what we need and for which we need to be
so grateful to people who are
in those circumstances. But some people also need
a space to privately say, ""This is just all too much."" -I worry that there are gonna be
physicians and nurses that don't choose to continue
doing clinical medicine after this experience. -In hospitals around
the country, doctors and nurses are doing what they can
to support each other. -We're all actively
looking for signs of stress from our co-workers. We call it a buddy system here, and everybody is looking out
for yourself and looking out
for the person next to you because people
won't always speak up, and what we don't want is someone to be suffering
in silence and suffering alone. That's the last thing
that we want. ",True,False,True,False

Yet it's a different story for a critically-ill COVID-19 patient who has been in the ICU of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan. 
In helping the patient turn over, medics have to pay attention to every part of his body since he has a breathing machine, an ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation), a catheter and many other tubes and machines attached to him. Sometimes, it requires seven experienced medics just to attend to one patient.

33,Wy6xtIRAVAY,Global News,Coronavirus outbreak: Is a 'mental health pandemic' coming after COVID-19?,2020-04-16T16:13:50Z,"While countries around the world continue to mobilize to contain the spread of COVID-19, mental health experts say we can’t lose sight of an equally alarming issue: 

The long-term mental health impact the coronavirus pandemic is going to leave on society.

Strict health measures put into place by countries to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus gave individuals little time to prepare for, or even process, all the consequences that this would lead to: job losses, economic collapse, and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships.

Emanuela Campanella dives into why we should be paying attention to mental health and the impact it may have long after the pandemic is over. 

If you or someone you know is in crisis and needs help, resources are available. In case of an emergency, please call 911 for immediate help.

The Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention, Depression Hurts and Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) also offer ways of getting help if you or someone you know may be suffering from mental health issues.

#GlobalNews #mentalhealthcoronavirus",while countries around the world continue to mobilize to contain the spread of Cova 19 mental health experts say we can't lose sight of an equally alarming issue the long-term mental health impact the pandemic is going to leave on Society what I think we're facing here is a very traumatic event for a lot of people it's a it's a traumatic societal event for people and one thing that we know about trauma is that while it's happening you do whatever you can do to survive you bear down and you just get through it which is what we're all trying to do right now I think that we're still very much in the trauma phase the act of trauma phase of this pandemic but what happens after physical distancing measures are lifted what comes after the pandemic is over and people are able to get back to whatever their normal may be there's going to be residual stress depression certainly financial pressures learning how to re-engage with the world in this new way that's going to be difficult for a lot of people and those are exactly the kinds of risk factors that lead to increasing rates of depression anxiety and even suicide the rapid spread of the pandemic gave little chance to prepare for or even process all that has happened in terms of job losses and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships Maggie who is a student at McMaster University who suffers from a generalized anxiety disorder I shut down because I don't know what to do I'm not prepared for this I was I did not run run a rehearsal of the situation in my head it's exhausting to not worry because it is practically impossible for me to not worry henyk says for those already suffering from anxiety and depression the pandemic could be exasperatingly r symptoms he is also concerned for those who have never suffered from any mental health issues in the past and are now facing a life disruption without fully digesting the long-term impact this may have on them a large body of scientific studies show that there is a close relationship between indicators such as unemployment mental health and suicide research out of the Great Recession of 2008 reveals that a 1% increase in unemployment was accompanied by a 1% increase in the rates of suicides in the u.s. henyk explains there is a peak and a valley response in our nervous system when faced with trauma right now we are at a peak in which we are engaging with the immediate threat of the pandemic you go into survival mode which can be very taxing on a person's mental health and in fact it doesn't actually let you think through or process what's happening to you it's only interest is in getting and keeping you alive and keeping you safe once the pandemic is over there will be a valley in which we recover from that threat but the problem is going back to baseline without support can take a lot longer than we may think after the threat passes henyk says people can start to retreat or fall into depression or find many other ways of dissociating themselves with the trauma they experienced it can really become almost an infection on its own some people stay stuck either way at the top of that peak or they stay stuck down at the bottom or anywhere in between not everybody returns to baseline and that's where we become concerned about mental illness in Canada we currently have a universal medical care but things like psychotherapy which henyk says has proven to be an effective treatment for mental health problems generally isn't funded publicly henyk says the federal and provincial governments need to step up to make sure proper treatments and programs are funded so as many people as possible have access when in need adding that everyone including employers will have to play a role I think it's important for employers in particular to realize when we start to loosen some of the restrictions that we're currently facing that this needs to happen slowly that we can't go back to the way the world was overnight as for Maggie she says she already knows she won't be able to go from 0 to 100 right away I hope that was the buyer is slowly dying down my social supports like psychiatrist counselor therapist will out get those supports back slowly and help me with my current fears and uncertainties thanks for watching to stay up to date on the latest breaking national and international news be sure to subscribe to our Channel where we also dig into big issues around the world in our weekly series global news explains ,True,False,True,False

35,ttjtB6uiDN4,INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOANALYTICAL ASSOCIATION,"Trauma, fear, and panic in times of Covid 19",2020-05-18T17:20:32Z,@INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOANALYTICAL ASSOCIATION,and as you all know the effects of trauma are exceedingly variable people vary in their response to what is called trauma and so it depends very much on the resilience of inner psychic capacities so clearly this must have something to do with the internal modalities that process our psychical input of the external reality now I have past described these internal modalities briefly as two simultaneous and ongoing processes experiential modalities that are essentially based on two opposite factors in one of them we experience self and other as fused and merged as together as connected which also has to do the experience of feeling alive and connected and then the other modality we feel an experienced self and other as separate from each other which gives rise to a different kind of experience in the interest of brevity I have sometimes refer to these two as being and doing because they lead to something of that nature but the essential point is the merge on the one hand and the separateness of self another on the other now studying trauma in various contexts such as bereavement loss the Holocaust in its aftermath terrorist attacks and so on I find that what is essential in trauma or what is essentially traumatic can be described as the interruption or breakdown of this experience of aliveness connectedness and going on being of feeling oneself together with merged and connected with oneself and with the other and when this breaks down it leads to the negative of this experience namely rather than being we are confronted with an experience of non-being which you may think of as the experiential manifestation and expression of the death Drive now not being affects our psychological faculties and capacities in many ways it affects our thinking or reality testing our capacity to plan but most of all it really undermines and causes for a loss of our symbolic capacity and symbolic thinking and simulation the ability in the capacity to symbolize depend very much on this ability or capacity to connect with another and essentially with a third that encompasses both us and other because then the symbol as a meaning not only privately but communally so rather than the symbolic capacity we are met with the ascendency or domination of something that can be described as uncivilized real or concrete now so much for some attempt to describe the effects of trauma in general I'd like to focus now on communal trauma what happens in community Rama communal trauma first of all represents an attack on this capacity for being connected together with the longing part of something that is essentially greater than ourselves it could be the family community the nation society religion and ideology or what have you but it is it rests on this disruption of this capacity to belong I want to remind you of an example that Freud uses in his paper on food psychology which is an interesting one he talks about an army unit that falls apart under some kind of external danger what we might easily call a traumatic experience now Freud argues there that it's not the external danger that causes the unit to fall apart what causes it to fall apart is the disruption of their lipid in all kinds as he calls it and their identification and togetherness with each other in the unit and the loss of leadership the example that he uses is the apocryphal story of Judith and Holofernes and Judith as you know murdering whole foreigners who is a command of the army and then the entire army fleets now regarding trauma they offer through these two lenses if you will like in beyond binocular vision experiential dimensions on the one hand and the group dynamics approach on the other I think we can identify these two things as the central factors in community Rama the loss of the connectedness of the being dimension and the decline or loss of leadership one result of such a process would be that values and norms become undermined when this feeling of connectedness and so on it takes place one of the first things that are attacked and destroyed is the common adherence to and sharing of values and norms as well as the connection with a benign enlightened authority and leadership and this leads quite often to group in institutional or organizational paranoid regression and even to the ascendency of social corruption and you may think of the current rise under the conditions of the seclusion and the lockdown during the corona pandemic there's been a rise of in family aggression and of child abuse has been reported another result would be a tray greatly increased need for togetherness with others this Kovach nineteen social distancing and lockdown has led to a tremendous need for connectedness and consider all the lots of groups and the zum meetings and the tremendous relief expressed by people throughout these meetings it's been quite quite an experience to greet each other even if it is just on the on the screen there's also been an idealization well-deserved idealization emissary of the medical professional medical teams which i think has something to do with the need for leadership and for heroes that one can look up to now let me say something before I close it's about how this affects the analyst and the patient a communal trauma is a trauma which both analysts and patient have been doer together they're both endure the same trauma it's a terrorist attack an earthquake or a kovat 19 both are victims and the survivors of the same collective trauma and so the usual loneliness of the analyst of which we don't tend to speak very much but it's something that does exist this loneliness tends to be exhausting ated and under such conditions the analyst may feel a great need for a comradeship and this comradeship may lead to a connection with other analysts but it may also lead to needing the comradeship with the patient and the other isn't so I think this situation presents us with a great challenge a real challenge the challenges will will this undermine what we call the transference will it change the setting or lead to an abandonment of the usual analytic stands and roll with our traditional setting be forever changed perhaps even abandoned I think these are very important questions that we are looking at we're beginning to study and that will need a lot more work to pursue but obviously what we need is to exercise compassionate understanding while maintaining the analytic role and actually I think this can be described as the analysts leadership function thank you thank you very much very interesting we'll move on to our next presentation at this time I'd like to introduce dr. Mario Carini he is the co-founder of the associate associate co me ill no doe in Turin Italy he is a psychiatrist and a psycho analyst a member of the Italian psychoanalytic Society the IPA and also the International Society for the psychoanalytic study of organizations thank you go ahead please Mario thank you I'm so glad for being here and my presentation would be about spaces and symbols of fear were focusing on fear on this kind of emotion and the way it is experienced and dealt with by individuals group and societies or large groups well in in I'm sorry but I have to read them because my English is not perfect epidemics are not just a health problem they also imply social cultural political financial and also psychological processes which require complex multi-dimensional approach he said being a terrible memory of the past plagues they have recently also become a present nightmare a source of individual and collective fears so much harder to bear in that they symbolically represent all the unseen or disavowed and security complexity and vulnerability belonging to our current life in this first globalized world as well as the archaic anxieties and the nameless terrors belonging to every human beings early childhood experience it short an epidemic of fear first the fear of contagion is a fear of the invisible something that is among us but cannot be seen because it is too little like virus Oh too big like the spreading worldwide of a pandemic or too familiar but somewhat uncanny the this remind me the Freud's concept of English some familiar but uncanny like air water food the next-door neighbor or worse our friends and our beloved ones as the enemy is among us or even one of us the paranoid defenses tend to transfer the epidemic of fear and even more of confusion into an epidemic of mass suspicion toward the other as a plague spreader this role is for the moment taken for instance by the sacred Chinese laboratory's well I think that some such paranoid transformation of mourning may well serve to fight the depressive view of human frailty and also a related fear of abandonment while conspiracy theories that are spreading worldwide involving the idea of malignant omnipotent organizations acting in the shadow may offer some reassuring even though somewhat delusional certainties if confronted with the discouraging evidence that face it with this such storm maybe there is nobody at the helm well in the case of kovat 19 a totally new disease there is also the fear of the unknown or they unpredictable but it this rise is a difficult for me at least difficult psychological question where the fear is more triggered by what is completely unknown or by what is somehow deeply known but still unbearable and therefore impossible to think and articulate I have in mind the concept of the bolas concept of unthought known well in order to try to manage such a processes like this Corbett 19 pandemic involving anxiety fear and panic for thousands or even millions of people we we need to better understand these human emotions namely the way they arise and develop what may enhance or mitigate them what are their psychological and social dynamics which defense mechanism they mobilize and how do they impact on individual and group behavior as well as on organizational functioning some useful distinction in my opinion would be first between normal and pathological fear where the former however useful for survival might prove unbearable and the latter as a disguise and expression of internal dangers is generally inaccessible to evidence reasoning or reality testing second between psychological defenses like repression projection or denial working on an individual basis to keep fears out of the mind and social defenses like authoritarianism escape goating or intergroup fight flight dynamics that try to remove them from collective consciousness may be something that as well was talking about talking about communal trauma third between the distinction between defense and protection well the latter as a container for primitive anxieties also on attend at an institutional level to protect individuals and the environment from their potential damages such as stress mass panic and social paranoia well the first shield against all fears is the mother later on the family or its social and organizational equivalents the government the health care the mass media as long they can remain able to listen and to concern that is to act as a good enough mothering system well a better and scaring discovery now from the current covered 19 p.m. pandemic is that we all are orphans namely we are both motherless and fatherless because all social institutions turned out to be unable to offer a maternal protection maybe an idealized maternal protection against a threatening world as well as a paternal guidance oriented by a shared reliable knowledge another point could be the space dimension of this epidemic of fear and it's symbolic elements for example social distancing a sensible strategy for reducing the risk of contagion ended up establishing in the collective mind a configuration of outside versus an inside while these two spaces are now experiencing as competitors and therefore cannot be easily integrated as a result outdoor life squares and beaches nightlife and restaurants travels abroad all these symbols of freedom seem unable to negotiate with lockdown homeland rhetoric taking refuge in domestic spaces or the or in the inner world which tend to represent safety when primitive fears are overwhelming and split become dominating the outside may turn to be a bad place a bad place because there we have the viruses the strange of the enemies at the door while people isolated in a good inside space may feel protected by their family or tribe by daily routines personal beliefs and biases although this safe isolation may become an anti-social Drive leading first to withdrawal and mistrust then to exclude ostracism or even persecution of the scapegoated other one could could also argue that there are also transitional spaces bridging the gap between inside and outside from international relationships to house windows and balconies line' and also the digital space with a smart working e-commerce new media but we cannot escape from conflict and the be valence and the evidence that closeness and intimacy may become a risk squares fill it with crowds may host a rebellion against Authority or simple a mindless denial of dangers homes with partners or families have been forced to stay together or at a time often in narrow spaces may turn into places inhabited by growing stress intolerance and even violence outburst the same balconies where people were singing together and applauding health care workers showed other people shouting insults against an infected neighbor who was being taken to hospital and at the end for concluding what second alysus might help us to achieve now and to maintain as a good-enough of vaccination against an epidemic of fear would be could be essentially awareness and think ability an attitude combining the courage to face a frightening truth with the capacity for thinking a collective mental space to work through those fears by means of what could be encoded passions and the negative capability namely by developing a kind of weak thinking and a deeper understanding of the problem rather than resorting to action to a strong set of how-to prescriptions or too impulsive and mindless actions driving by fear and its defenses well after all what we need to learn from the experience of the pandemic is how reimagine human relations beyond this manifest collapse over cultural nip attends by taking time to pose make sense and connect and then act better together thank you thank you very much Mario thank you we'll move to our third speaker dr. Zachary Greene dr. Zachary green is a professor of practice in leadership studies at the University of San Diego nonprofit Institute he is also the co-founder and director of Group relations international I'll leave it at that and us to hear from you is a curry thank you thank you very much Harriet and I really appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this panel I'm not a part of your organization and I recognize that I'm a guest here I represent a perspective from organizational development and from 30 years of being a practitioner of group relations study also directing a number of conferences in that respect so what I'm going to be presenting is psycho dammit dynamically informed as opposed to purely psychoanalytic there will be elements of it that will be familiar to you but they will also be borrowing from other disciplines what we're going to do now is we're going to look at a slide that will help you sort of navigate where I'm going with this and what I did along with my colleague David McCallum who's a Jesuit priest and also dr. in terms of his PhD in terms of human development we looked at what was going on early in the pandemic before the infection rates became what they are in the United States and we began to wonder what might be a pathway out of this and what might this look like and what did we understand about our own behavior at a collective level much is what Shmuel already spoke to and then in mario spoke to as well is that what we began to look at is the social defenses that were emerging but what we decided to do was look at this at the individual level and the collective level concurrently and so what you have here is a sort of model that was adapted from the wonderful work of Suzanne Cook Gruyter who is a leadership scholar who said that there is a pre conventional conventional and post conventional capacity of thinking behavior in human development and so what we did is we decided that there's a pre contagion contagion and post contagion mirroring of that same process pre contagion meaning that before the number of cases in a particular context began to emerge the kind of attitudes and defenses that are used in the face of that then when the contagion erupts and that's where the orange curve represents is then what kinds of things begin to happen then and then as we begin the end of the process and the potential re-emergence what do we see as post contagion in terms of the kinds of social defenses so that's the short version of it what is important is that I will be presenting it as if it is linear but in reality there are all kinds of regressions and loops and interlocking and concurrent elements and what we're also going to be doing in a moment is asking you at each of the pre contagion contagion and post containment stages is to do a quick poll because we're trying to find out if the kind of naming that we're giving to these stages makes sense and whether they are visible in your context so let's do the first three in the pre contagion what we believe is the process is one of ignorance indifference and denial and by that what we mean is that the ignorance is a kind of primitive sort of splitting off of the process and so that one can deny that there is any element of this present in our current context through this there's an indifference that pushes this out of consciousness and in doing so there has this feeling as if this is not my experience and then of course as there begins to be more and more presence of the virus in one's context then the initial response is more primitive and one of denial so our quick question to you is that which of these have been characteristic of your particular context and we'll give you about 30 seconds to a minute to respond and you can click right now few more seconds okay let's see it work where you are with it okay what we're seeing is that amongst you who took this poll is that denial is one that you saw very strongly in your particular context in the United States what happened was that there was a great deal more of a propensity towards indifference and then the denial showed up so that's very helpful now let's go back to the slide and let's talk about what happens once we continue so what begins to happen is that as the contagion begins to increase the nature of the defense's begins to change what we have here is contamination and then David and I already know that that's the wrong name for it but what we do know is that once the contagion begins to enter into a new context there's a wish to blame and therefore the need to project that blame onto someone some person some group to say that you are responsible for my contamination in addition to that in terms of individual collective process as Mario already alluded to then there's also a propensity to look at some other who was previously a friend a colleague a co-worker as a potential for our form or source of that contamination and so that project process becomes incredibly powerful as the number of of infections increase as restrictions begin to happen as shelter-in-place orders come into being then the panic ensues and that panic is because of the real emergent of the death drive and the concern that this is not something that is no longer out there but something that really can be located in me and it becomes a collective process that get then in different countries in different ways goes into all kinds of behaviors that are meant to protect one in the face of the pandemic but in reality are simply defenses against it what my friends and I have recognized is that in our more undefended moments each of us have moments of somatization and have this sort of like sense of fear that this is happening to us now we also recognize that there is this because of the level of of isolation a kind of return of the repressed in many kinds of ways where in the isolation then we have this confrontation with aspects of ourselves that are day to day life what perhaps have us defend against then the next part of that is then ok this is all happening the panic didn't solve this but now there's chaos there's a need to find order and then absent routine absent of being sheltered in place with people with whom provide a sort of nurturing and holding experience for us then what we begin to do is then try to find a way to organize and integrate this but this is not just at the individual level the collective attempts to try to find some way of organizing this experience until which time is there is something often external as as mario alluded to the idealization of government or grooves or processes as mother someone who can hold us and provide us that sort of mirroring that everything is going to be okay in the failure of that then we also have to find this containment for ourselves so now we're going to do the second pole so the second pole is on these four of these which of these have you seen in Europe context contamination panic chaos and it containers was written first okay so let's see contamination panic what is the actual language so that you know what the fourth one is supposed to be panic chaos containment okay let's just go with that let's go with the poll as it is recognizing that we'll have to add don't use the last containment place oh yeah I see what I did I misread I misread it my own call a little anxiety on my part mm okay let's see our result ah what we see is the chaos yes absent some sense of order absent some sense of knowing that this can fall into a routine we see the chaos showing up and then what we have is too often the failure of containment and the failure of sense of that there's some objects some group some way of being able to work with this that's fantastic thank you and now the final set when this paper was written there was nothing in the United States that suggested that we were going to re-emerge from that as a matter of fact Los Angeles County which is just north of me has been told that they will have shelter in place for an additional three months well some parts of the world are emerging this isolation then leads to the potential of two different expressions the isolation can really lead to a sort of a depressive mode if you will that begins to emerge for some but for others there's a sublimation a movement of this into activities that sort of bind the anxiety but really our underlying expressions of that anxiety but there are also these moments of patients as well as altruism that are beginning to show up which I do believe are authentic responses to the that same anxiety but they are not as well developed as well formed as more primitive defenses so in the isolation those are the potential but also in this isolation is the grief and mourning and the devastation that will then be a reckoning for all of us not only in terms of the individual level but also what we've done to the planet and how that's understood and the emergence will then allow us to see that more boldly and then a lot of people are writing about the potential of renewal David and I some question of whether that's actually going to happen oh whether they will simply be a regression to some false sense of normalcy sort of an illusionary state so then we're gonna pull you again and ask you in your context which of these three are you singing if any you okay thank you and let's see the results yes the question of renewal is one that we share I my co-author David McCallum really are wondering about the human capacity to not only repress but to regress to previous ways of functioning there is a potential of some emergence but the the blend of what isolation represents is very powerfully present as we begin to re-emerge into the world so let's close that and we can go back to my slide and so this as I said before is not a linear process of this is a working paper but what we do is offer it to you as a way of thinking and then how the collective process and the individual process are functioning concurrently and how we can then perhaps better understand our pathway forward thank you thank you very much Zachary thank you all it's really been an unusual opportunity I think well you introduced us to inner psychic capacities as determinative of level of trauma taken us from there to communal trauma and Mario you took us to the symbols and spaces of trauma and this tension between inner and external and how potentially chaotic and traumatizing that is and Zachary you've shown us that this is a process you've reminded us I think not only that it's a process in general but that we are right now but still at the beginning of is still longer and we're very much still in isolation as opposed to understanding what the future holds so I would like to ask you if you have something to say to each other and then we'll open it to questions from the audience I'm sure there are many questions do you have a thought that you'd like to hear with one of your fellow panelists and the rest of us Shmuel I wanted to talk to you about the communal trauma because one of the things that we're working on right now among my colleagues is that we're talking about a concept that we're calling intersectional trauma whereas there is an indeed the shared experience of what you're calling communal trauma but there's also a wondering about the historical trauma especially certain group roots carry and how this is activated by the collective trauma then people who've experienced their own personal trauma and then the vicarious trauma and so that how all of these are happening at the same time and then one cannot locate themselves in this because they don't know which one is activated because one expresses the other do you have some thoughts on that well first of all certainly that that's quite true and I think you know rather than the other the other side of that coin would be not the difficulty of finding oneself in it but actually the preference for finding oneself in it because this kind if I understood your description it's kind of come this kind of communal historical trauma can often be something which unites people and becomes part of their identity I mean I can easily think in our Israeli context of the Holocaust as a combining I identifying trauma I think there are other groups that share this actually of a mikvah volcan I think has talked about that kind of root trauma and so I think you know there there must be two sides to that coin and therefore my preference would be if you look at the individual you'd have to ask why or what is it in him or in her that makes it difficult for him to share in that common trauma you know why is he in a way feeling the outsider and on the other hand you can ask the group why do they need to maintain this trauma is their collective identity you know just one other thought in a conference that I did once there was a large group of Serbians and it was amazing that what holds them in some strange way together is a battle that took place in I think 14 something and that they won and they defended Europe because they defeated the Turks then they stopped them and that is the basis of their identity to this day but nobody knows about this but within the group of course it's very powerful so it works both ways I would think we slightly disagree on this on one element of it because what we are looking at is that in terms of the history of enslavement that this collective trauma then is activated the the kinds of oppressions and then there's enactment and the acting out of a collective level of denigrating the other in such a way that then what we are facing is not only the collective trauma but also the legacy of the enslavement and so that these two things are coming together and then we're we're having an experience of being hit by both at the same time so yes it is a form of identity but it also can put be put into the larger context a bigger challenge so what will happen I think you're saying that this larger trauma has a historical and the current impact on the social identity the entire yes Mario would you like to comment on this yes I have this an association that came to my mind the some week more or less ago I read a post on a social media where somebody asked it whether this pandemic could be considered like psychotic general phenomenon a psychiatric problem not just affecting people that may be mental mentally ill but a kind of spreading of a psychotic confusing state of mind the chaos in Zachary Mordo I think it was a 43% the polling underlined under this State of Mind particular and I would like to connect it with what well were describing talking about community as an attack on the capacity of connectedness in my in my view is this is something to do with the beyonds concept of a tacit link attack to a linking in a sense that may be an attack on linking happens at mind level individual mind level and an interpersonal level and in the communal or societal level and the in the mind in the group in society the lack of connection is maybe not just an isolation but a fragmentation of the not only of relationships but also on the well done job the way to see they see the world and its meaning the future there are some people that say oh well it will be all like before or after when we emerge in a sense some people says no it won't be nothing like before or it will be all challenges and I think that these are two way mmm could cutting the links between a feeling of confusion that I don't think is psychotic I think this is more fact psychotic saying unsure of what is going to happen something that reminds me of if I remember well Donald Meltzer say of delusion of clarity of thinking about an Italian is different well and so I think that we a part of the question of identity trauma trauma I think that this trauma is a destruction of the way to see reality because reality has to be not interpreted on on the base on the previous basis but happy has to be discovered again we we don't know what will happen after renewal maybe isolation maybe the syndrome of the hut I say that somebody says you know after when all is over I stay at home forever some some people I don't think they are mad but they they are talking like this well this is what hoping to think Mario your thoughts about cutting the links make me think about a sort of from a psychoanalytic point of view a regression to the paranoid schizoid position that so many are in in this setting of uncertainty and where as one of you spoke about the idealization of the medical people and the frontline workers there is at the same time a denigration and a actually a level of violence they've been exposed to there have been murders of doctors because they received as the carrier of this invisible threat so you know on both sides of that splitting people are in an intensely aggravated state of mind yes I think that this this point of idealization of health care workers I I saw from the back I talked about the balconies from the workers people clapping the hands for our heroes the I don't know if in in other country there is the same imago of the health care workers in here close to the hero we have the Mart here to be an hero you you cannot survive you must die in glory on the field as a brave warrior against the virus against the enemies with against the plague spreaders but you must die if you don't if you do not die and my colleague in hospitals or in other healthcare places are already scared of what they are going to pass after the the end of the pandemics they are nearly sure they will be no more no longer applauded but instead the accused insulted byah said and may be taken in front of a judge to respond to all the death and I think that in mind in my mind there is a comment you know in Italy we have a special state that is named in Vatican and where the Pope inside the actual Pope I discovered that had made a psychotherapy for forever one one or two years with a woman an analyst Union and so I think that he no psych analysis better than the church you cannot meet but he said one say he was the Pope was been drawn on a wall of Rome like a Superman in the frying with his white dresses just like a Superman in a sense and the journalist asked him but what do you think about this well I don't like this kind of image representing me I don't like it at all because if I remember well Freud said that behind any idealization there is a denigration I think that this is what we should be prepared to face I would like to start moving to the audience questions the first one I have here is the United Nations warned about a massive psychological crisis due to the Cova 19 pandemic if countries do not pursue measures what do you think of this what measures should be taken into taking into account the idea of communal trauma I think our our question is asking us to think a bit more concretely pregnant about actions the government's might take given your insights I think I just want to comment on that because I've been thinking about this now for the last few minutes that one dimension that we have not really touched on and it is connected with these things in the real world is the political and I think this question addresses that level and you know it's it's really very difficult to jump from psychological psychoanalytic group relations kind of insights to the political level I don't know if the merrier was just telling us about the Pope having met psychotherapy if that would have helped you know there was once I think was in the United States when greens and said that we have these this president on the couch and everything is going to be solved I don't think we can really say very much on that but I think it comes back to the leadership issues that I've touched on which is that there is you know this is where the political and the psychological come together the leadership in these various countries my own and I think the others as well it has not been a model in a way of what I call a an enlightened authority an authority that can perhaps to to use Mario's expression act both maternally and paternally and and provide a container so where does one get that politically is of course not for me to say but it is that kind of leadership if it does if we can get it politically that would be I think a very important factor in getting out of this country I agree with you Shmuel because I think that the political didn't mention of this is understated in terms of its psychological impact and how many people are vulnerable to more totalitarian kinds of thinking because of this in the wish of having some object who can provide solace and sense of safety amidst the chaos but I want to link this to one of the things that Mario spoke about is that I believe that we are experiencing an epidemic of fear that is as pronounced as the epidemic of the virus itself and that has psychological implications and on a practical level many psychological organizations in the United States are beginning to provide services pro bono to individuals and communities as a way of responding to this I know that in Italy that there has been a strong push for psychotherapists to do the same thing because in addition to the responses to the medical issues the stress that has been put on families and children and as you alluded to Shmuel the kinds of aggression that then gets placed in a family when that holding environment is not sufficient really does mean that there is going to be a need for all of us to step up to that process and the days to come addressed both of you the sort of grassroots level about your own I'm unmuted no no you've agreed thank you the two of you have addressed the grassroots level and the higher level I was glad to hear you speak about leadership as an important part of the political smoke because the leaders who are combining science and empathy with structure predictability and calm are having a far greater effect than those that want to engage in the kinds of things a curry was describing in pre contagion as denial difference which are only sort of facilitating the aggressive outbursts I'd like to tell you the next question which is related confine has arisen as arisen confinement has promoted a lot of aggression towards governments for the perception that they are disturbing ones freedom how does this relate to trauma you haven't thought about that Mario how does what comes to my mind is just a small concept the conflict between freedom and safety and on another level what has been worded out by many people in Italy I may be I think worldwide as the dilemma should we die for the virus or should we die for hunger or mmm economic ruin back down and I think that one point a dramatic point is that is there is no clear answer to this question of this conflict or a third view I think to continue with this the I think the question also in a way touches on something which I I thought was quite remarkable because it came up at least in - I think of three of the presentations certainly in my own and Mario's about the and what you said Harriet about the the rise of paranoia which i think is one of the effects of the communal trauma because of the breakdown of the the integration really of the individual and the the group and the external Authority so I think the the question really points to the difficulty that people have been accepting government instructions which are supposedly are there could be helpful but the attitude towards them might be paranoid so distrust sealing mistrust and so on so I think whether whether those instructions are correct or not is a different question but I am saying is that this psychological way in which they are met is often one which stems from this kind of paranoid breakdown that you were referring to the the regression to the paranoid schizoid which is one way of putting it or you know the breakdown in terms of norms and values where the way I put it on the social level and so on there is no no trust and what Authority has to offer in what do you suggest make me think that this is a special kind of regression a kind of regression in the service of avoidance and what I think could be mainly avoided is the feeling of the unescapable feeling that there is a collapse of an omnipotent and we are confronted we all are confronted not with a traumatic event coming from outside but from the inside perception that we all are we our groups institutions and societies are all vulnerable when I see vulnerable I don't mean weak also the stronger thing may be vulnerable and sometimes stronger people are more vulnerable because they are not supposed to be tired to have doubts or to need help and they are charged and overloaded with many people problems so vulnerability is the disco I think but I maybe we have no not enough mental space to hold this vulnerability one quick piece before we go to the next question but there is the possibility of the depressive position and the possibility of the reflection that can come from the depressive position that allows for the potential of a more adaptive response to the trauma but we will see I'm not seeing much of that but that's a possibility the question is how do we reach that position yes yes and how do we communicate a sense of containment that that allows for thinking I thought the negative capability that Mario referred to and the sort of the capacity to we're being calm enough to sink and plan rather than act immediately and so important I'm going to read the next question and are I want to say to our audience that our administrative help has requested that you might try to write shorter questions I don't know if that's realistic because this is a very complex situation to communicate that so here's the next question for the panel as analysts and patient are both involved in the communal trauma is there a way to work in analysis taking into account the notion of trauma while it is currently happening and even more when many analytic diets are living in different ways of isolation we'd like to take this up this takes us back to the analytic setting I must say yeah you know I briefly I would say it's it's a very very interesting and difficult issue of course I wrote something about that response or in the wake of the Gulf War where we had that experience and I don't want to elaborate the lists here but there are situations in which we find ourselves as analysts without patients in a situation that is absolutely traumatic in terms of the external capacities and my conclusion first of all for myself under those conditions was that why if I cannot care for my patients then I cannot see them that is if the external trauma is such that my need to be with let's say family my own family to be protective of them and so on which can happen if you have to run to a shelter you know or a nice lady under such circumstances I would have to say I cannot really continue to work but on the other hand if the external situation is such that one can continue to work as I think the present situation actually is with all the changes in the setting then the analytic situation can go on and remarkably actually in my experience it does go on where the the patient and the analyst continue to work not as if nothing has changed but in a focus on what the what is troubling and what has been troubling and continues to trouble both of them so I do think it's quite possible to pursue that even though our usual external setting has been under attack because you know we also have the internal they will turn the light setting that we carry with us and that very often our patients carry within them as well well we referred earlier to groups of very different sizes the diet in the consulting-room the family the people on the block the city the nation I was wondering if you could say something about the positive effect of a group as many analysts are fine peer consultation groups very helpful at this time in order to keep their analytic mind intact as their faith the same trauma as their patients so this is a sort of what is the positive impact of the group absolutely you know I think I refer to it in terms of this the capacity or the need to feel connected so that the group when it exists and when it provides this kind of nurturance that is so needed to the feeling of being connected rather than being disconnected isolated and so forth so forth the the breakdown that I think all three of us spoke about about the attacks on linking the cane capacity to think I spoke about the incapacity to symbolize and so on the need for a third so these groups have been tremendously helpful and it's no accident that they are jumping now or you know flourishing up all over the place because they are so important and they allow us to really continue to feel our professional identity and belongingness to this professional end to what we do through this common commonality that the group can provide so it's a brilliant untie traumatic medication it's the antidote I'm gonna move to our next question would the panel please comment on the impact of culture on the response to kovat nineteen yes I've been doing quite a bit of work in this area and have held a number of other panels on that question because we're noticing a very different response and more collectivist answers than those that are much more individualist because so much of tradition and identity and collectivist cultures are about the connection of one to another and whereas the individualist cultures are more concerned about the questions of isolation the lack of liberty and what we're beginning to run into and this is beginning to express itself very powerfully and potentially violently in the United States is how these two different perspectives are really clashing with each other that I as an individual have my rights and my liberty but the collectivist cultures are saying then how do we assure that the group remains cohesive and what is beginning to happen in that clash is different orientation to how we must respond in this moment so I would be interested in the other panelists perspectives on that is Flo Mario you want to address that from from another perspective in a sense because I went to witness witness and experienced a strange experience I had with my patients in these last days or weeks one is more personal is a feeling of being a child that is afraid of being abandoned it in a sense that the analyst in think may be depending on the patient coming to the sessions and paying and I can feel something that is I don't know if it's a transference or a countertransference but the the the fear of being abandoned by the patients and I don't think that this is particularly or for this moment but it was more evident but another point that I experienced it I think it could be interesting is that now as ever in the past my patient begins the session or during the session express a concern for my health for me it's true I am a baby boomer generation so I know that I'm fragile in a sense frail but they express I think in a real way a concern occupation for my being my well-being my my being in good conditions and I don't think my feeling was not that they want to be reassured that I am on the on the place that I am holding the the analytic function but they are alive really alive or as I thought we could say being being being alive being well and being awake and so I think that this could be something that can be exported in the general in the social attitude the preoccupation for the other don't is not so important who the other is if is if he's below this upper if is your son or your parent if a leader then don't don't ask you what what the government may can make for you but ask what you can make for the government you know an aspect of culture that you bring up Mario is also the vulnerable and the older members of a culture and cultures differ in their level of respect for their there's so many aspects of culture that we might consider ranging from that you know that so often gets turned into ageism sexism LGBTQ issues child ism you know and it is such an important time I think for psychoanalysts to speak out regarding the implications of that attitude they're devastating for the culture and the social environment and I think your presentations have helped us see what we could educate people about what we could predict what we could help them see I I think it's been really great to hear from you here's the next question could you elaborate on the difference between social violence provoking trauma and the pandemic as provoking trauma that make sense difference between social violence provoking trauma and the pandemic provoking trauma you want to start small or you want me to start well I just say they were briefly I think it would again come back to the question of what is traumatic in the trauma right so you know I don't want to elaborate on that again so I'd rather hear from you Zach right because I think that they're actually concurrent processes because I think that the trauma is any kind of disproportionate experience that is disruptive to the psyche and that is going to be for some people this experience of the pandemic is that kind of disruption and it is distinct in what it is doing in terms of people's responses to it because of the level of disruption that it has and the differentiated level of disruption that has based on a person's life circumstance before the shelter in place orders gotten got implemented and also it has something to do with the cultural variables what we're seeing is a disproportionate impact of the Medical Outcomes health disparities based on culture and so that does add to a sense of trauma so what I think is important to understand especially as we're working with our patients around this is that their experience of the trauma related to the virus is going to be differentiated and we'll have some of the same components as a as one that comes from physical and social violence I may I add to the something I'm thinking of Mario's presentation where he defined the invisible virus the invisible enemy and social violence usually has a target whether it's justified or not and the pandemic trauma is you know related to something we can't see and we really won't know if it matters if we take off our shoes when we come in the door you know very little things every day so I think there is a different level of trauma is presenting I'm sorry okay the virus is presenting and and the sort of an object aim disruption as well because of that and disability I think you're really speaking to that area thank you I wanna add to what we were saying before all of which i think is true but I would just want to add to that one's inner capacity again pre virus or pre social violence or whatever to feel connected and alive because I think that on an intra psychic level will determine whether or not the experience which maybe are a horrible experience but the question is would it be traumatic and I keep looking out for that point because I think somehow we have been using trauma not in this panel necessarily but in general in our culture and even in psychoanalysis it is somewhat old Salem since so the trauma loses its specificity you know and any everything that is terrible and adverse and a calamity is a trauma but I think you were talking before about the cultural difference between the individual and the collective oriental cultures now that's very important you see but it's important because it represents also an inter psychic position of being more connected or less connected with others so the vulnerability to trauma would be greater in the individualistic ones it is I'm going to move to the next question of late the Indian government has suggested that people should learn to live with the koban 19 as there's no easy and fast way to get completely rid of it in this context what is likely to be the new normal for people while maintaining their psychological well-being this made me think that the same recommendation as the Indian government has been said by many scientists worldwide and also in Italy where I live the National Institute for healthcare said that we should be prepared for a long time not to live inside the pandemics necessarily or the emergency but to live with with the virus also in condition of relative safety or security and but we must be prepared to live with and I think that this may be an important lesson not just for the general attitude for being responsible for instance because if we live and we have some raw level of the virus in around we should be prepared to leave also with a sense of responsibility towards the other and not to make nor to to crowd the beaches or the streets as if there would have no danger longer but I think that this symbolically may represent the possibility of learning how to live with a sense of vulnerability again I use this term because I think it's what comes to my mind - living with one's own and our general as human vulnerability no society and get rid not of the virus but of this sense of of NEPA tensor the what would kind of new global and new liberation or what else then I think that money is important but also human lives and we should negotiate between and unions I introduced this question how can we think of childhood in these moments of confinement childhood in terms of trauma in terms of normal development as mario was speaking i was thinking that living with kovat 19 is probably as best we know different for the elderly than the very young however the very young in isolation are not developing in ways that we're familiar with as long as the isolation lasts so it is how can we think of childhood in these moments of confinement we don't have any child Alice here no no but I killed Rijn at home and I could it is having a dramatic impact on their development I have a son who was looking forward to going to college this fall and having his graduation and the sense of loss and and what that's going to mean and I'm already imagining psychologically what it's going to represent in terms of those sort of rituals to have lost them but I did a panel just yesterday on the welfare of children and a lot of what the commentary was about was that there is this disruption in the developmental process of children and as a consequence of that this will be something that they will be integrating for the rest of their lives and it's something for us to think about as well anything further you'd like to say let's uh if not I'll move on to the next question I I mean there are many things we could say about the socialization of children it will be spending so much more time on-screen than they already were and the the need for us to advise and pay attention to parents and teachers and how to you know continue to provide a lively environment for children to develop empathy to have the physical contact that they need and so forth it is a it is a matter of great concern and that's what although there's a great difference between war neurosis and new symptoms related to confinement in the Kovan 19 panda Mia may we talk about confinement neurosis or a quarantine neurosis related to the addition of external reality well I think you know that's an interesting question I would defer answering that until somebody comes who I can actually understand or diagnosed as having a confinement neurosis in other words I don't think I can I can project this at this point on a general level you know we talked about when we coined the phrase war neurosis this was nothing anticipation but it was after people had actually suffered the impact of combat fatigue and war neurosis so we would need to see after this is over over whichever way it will be over as Mario suggested will there be such a neurotic pictures that will Center in some way around this confinement now I can begin to imagine maybe you know maybe something but it's it's quite difficult we we do have a sense of fragmentation around a sense of self that comes from the absence of being able to relate in a way the absence of touch and what that is doing especially for people who are sheltered in place right now of the differences in the kinds of holding environments in which people reside I think all of those are contributing to a set of symptoms that were beginning to see but how that's going to define itself indeed it's too early for us to know thank you you know we have just two minutes and I'll tell you a question that's come up that we can all be thinking about and that is how can we think of no is there where did it go excuse me has kovat 19 any positive effect on psychoanalysis I was asked by an IPSec candidate a few weeks ago but no I was told that the pandemic is a mortal threat to psychoanalysis my own vehicle was psychoanalysis has never been more needed and that the more we have opportunities like this to talk with one another and reach the public the better off the public and also the profession will be because we have so much to offer since we have just one more minute I'm going to move to the next slides that we have in the background before thanking the panel we'd like all of you who are attending to remember that there are more resources and information at the IP a website that's WWI P a world and when you go there prominently displayed will be this orange box and it will take you to many helpful resources finally I'd like to announce the there we are the upcoming webinar there'll be another webinar next Friday at 12:00 to 1:30 Argentine time this webinar will be in Spanish it's English title is other nests values and care in times of Kovan 19 and the panelists Virginia Unger Park a bruise Fernanda Ordos and the moderator of Louie al hundred Nagi so we have come to the end of today's webinar I can't thank the panelists enough zachary Merle and Mario and also our audience thank you very much for your participation and for your excellent questions we will have a record of them and look forward to thinking more about your questions and hopefully at some point with you thank you very much thank you

36,HYanhlwD778,Demystifying Medicine,Children's Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-10T21:00:13Z,"Mental health is inclusive to all, however, this video covers the effect of the pandemic on children and youth under the age of 12. Although children may be unable to fully grasp the concept of their mental health and wellbeing, restrictions posed by public health protocols have taken away aspects of their life, just like any other member of the community. We urge you to keep watching this video for some insight on home safety, transition to online learning, nutrition and exercise, the impact on special needs children, video games, and many more environmental factors that impair a child’s mental health and physical perception of the world around them. We also provide an outline of a prominent resource developed by SickKids called CARD. This system allows parents and caregivers to make a personalized system for children to make their routine during the pandemic a little less difficult.

were while we simultaneously try to adapt to this new normal the pandemic has affected our lives in numerous ways but it is imperative that we focus on our mental health many people have reported about the fear and uncertainty about their own health the health of their loved ones their financial situation and job outcomes as well as tackling social isolation through following public health protocols mental health is inclusive to all age groups and should leave no one behind in terms of spreading awareness with this being said have you ever considered the effect that covid19 has had on children we could say that children are unable to fully grasp the concept of their mental health and well-being but the pandemic has taken away aspects of their life just like any other member of the community we urge you to keep watching this video for some insight on the mental health of the children within our communities and how you as a parent guardian or any type of caretaker can help to ease their experience although there are many factors to address children are particularly vulnerable due to their limited understanding of the current pandemic because of this many of them are also unable to physically and mentally escape the harms of the situation as they have little to no coping strategies and it is hard for them to communicate their feelings easily unlike adults although their understanding is minimal children can pick up on unverified information through social media or word of mouth as adults communicate which can aggravate mental distress and feelings of uncertainty as misinterpretation is bound to happen children are also in a continuous and critical period of development as they require special care in order to preserve and promote their mental health which has been primarily affected by a drastic change in routine the suppression of all class activities and learning as well as a shift to an online schooling has led to the creation of an isolated learning environment essentially schools are responsible for providing structure to a child's daily activities many articles have postulated the importance of physical activity during the quarantine as it is associated with a decline in symptoms of anxiety and depression research has also argued that schools play a primary role in providing a consistent daily calorie intake to ensure that children are getting their nutritional needs yet amidst the pandemic these essential needs have been significantly decreased a nationwide study in canada conducted by the international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity found that children and youth were actually less active played outside less where more sedentary engaged in more recreational screen time and slept more in comparison to before the covid19 restrictions but special needs are extremely vulnerable to the psychological impacts that come along for example shifting to an online learning environment has disrupted their daily routines and therapy sessions children with autism or neurocognitive disabilities are more likely to show problematic behaviors such as irritability aggression and social withdrawal online learning has also led to a decrease in assistance to these children as parents cannot replace special education teachers there is also a lack of technology to assist with this transition in addition to that social distancing and its effects are extremely new and difficult to understand especially for children that are experiencing developmental and intellectual delays for these reasons spreading awareness of the mental health of children with disabilities needs to be done on a global scale it is also no surprise that the pandemic causes parents and caregivers to become fearful of their own concerns research shows that fear can be contagious as children are sensitive to the emotional state of the adults that surround them to make matters worse parents are also unable to alleviate the stress through familiar mechanisms that were established prior to the pandemic such as visiting family and friends or going on excursions such as watching movies or dining out the process of isolation also imposes more constant contact between parents and children with this being said not all homes are safe places for children to learn or play due to exposure to various types of abuse during quarantine abuse complaints can actually decrease in frequency as there are limited ways for children to flee from perpetrators as schools usually act as an avenue for children to report issues regardless the frequency of children experiencing abuse at home may increase due to continuous contact with perpetrators in quarantine additionally browsing on online social media platforms and lack of supervision over the internet access has also increased vulnerability to online offenders attempted fraud and sexually inappropriate content due to these circumstances issues such as deteriorating performance aggression and regression may escalate these are all examples of environmental impacts that impair a child's mental health and physical perception of the world around them despite any of the negative impacts the internet has been a critical tool for children and youth in learning entertainment and even social interactions since the start of the covet 19 pandemic in particular research has shown that video games offer a temporary escape from real life but they also provide a fair amount of social engagement one of the greatest digital game distributors known as steam reports that since the pandemic started the number of users has increased significantly this report indicates that weekly users has increased from 19 million to 23.5 million although it is generally believed that video games have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of children recent high quality research by the journal of clinical psychological science shows the effects of video games on mental health and well-being is very small video games can help children and youth to fill in the empty gaps by interacting with their friends through online gaming additionally during the pandemic many children do not have enough physical activity so it is recommended to mix physical activities with video games there are active video games that kids can use which can be very helpful while the outdoor movements are restricted for example christopher alexander a professor of video games at ryerson university in toronto says video games can be positive activity during the time of self-distancing if we can take the time to discover the types of games that are best for you so what can you do to help your child during this pandemic there are several avenues of support that can be offered for children to ensure that their mental health is being addressed in this video we will cover the card system provided by the hospital for sick kids for parents and caregivers this system provides strategies that parents can play to help their children cope with stressful situations card is an acronym that stands for comfort ask relax and distract the comfort aspect involves talking to your child about what they can do to cope with their anxiety try to empower your child to overcome their negative thoughts by saying things like you are stronger than you feel also be sure to validate your child's concern by saying things like it's okay to be upset some other things that can be done specifically during the pandemic include limiting exposure to the media and news being mindful of the conversations that you have around family members and creating daily routines that give your child predictability and control next by asking questions your child is given an opportunity to open up some questions you can ask your child include what questions do you have or how are you feeling or what are your friends saying about this and lastly what fun things can you do today thirdly by relax this means to do things that you and your child enjoy to help them feel more secure and connected this can be done by listening to a mindfulness or relaxation activity together practicing positive self-talk or engaging in an enjoyable physical activity lastly a great thing to do is distract try to talk about things that are important to your child such as sports or dancing or art some great activities include reading books watching movies playing board games working on puzzles or even helping your child with their homework using card you can make a personalized system for your child to make their routines during the pandemic a little less difficult and hopefully this benefits your mental health in return because mental health as we said earlier is inclusive to all take care of yourself and don't forget to subscribe and share this video with anyone else that may need some advice during this time of need ,True,False,True,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",updating tonight's top stories singapore to have four covet 19 vaccination centers up and running by the end of this month another four will be set up in february the health ministry says more will be progressively added at the same time singapore is to review vaccine data from chinese drug firm synovac before any possible rollout researchers in brazil are already reporting that cylovac is only 50 effective and for more professor dale fisher from the young lulin school of medicine joins us for more on this discussion professor the vaccination centers are they adequate in terms of numbers of location to vaccinate the population hi steve and orteli thanks for having me back um i i think you should uh it's also the uh the minister mentioned that it'd be poly clinics and and some gps would also be part of the program so so i think uh it's more about the target to vaccinate all singaporeans uh this year and i do think it's very uh realistic um singapore is very accessible uh there's no real geographic challenges we've got the technology to to manage the cold chain and and the data and and all the various steps along the vaccination uh pathway so so i think i think we can be confident that uh we're on a very uh realistic pathway so professor we know that uh you know more than six thousand people have already been uh vaccinated but in terms of hitting our target vaccinating everyone by the end of 2021 you see that uh see us being on target for that so again we're in a different situation in singapore we we obviously have control of the of the pandemic within our borders uh you really see countries like uk and u.s talking of targets because they've got that health emergency if you like so so there's good reasons that singapore's going forward uh with vaccination but i'm not so obsessed by targets of how many today how many this week it's more about ramping up the situation and gradually opening up more centers later the polyclinics and the gps it'll be incremental but as i just said i think the goal to vaccinate everyone this year is is uh is very realistic you do seem very confident in uh singapore's rollout uh researchers in brazil though are saying that china's sinovac vaccine's overall efficacy rate is much lower than earlier reported around 50 what does that imply and should we be concerned steve i'm actually more concerned about this drip feeding of information i think it's um it's quite ridiculous we've seen it going on for for so long um companies wanting to to give out good information phase one data phase two data but this uh different countries giving out different interpretations with no consolidation of the information no no verification my view of all this is let's just wait for the phase 3 data to run its course be published and then let's uh let's have a look at it um i i really don't care so much for for all these interim uh they're almost rumors sometimes um maybe it is less effective uh it's certainly uh made in a different way but uh perhaps it's got a specific role in a in a sub-population for for for instance so i'm really just waiting for publications in medically scrutinized journals and and then we have a thorough review of the uh of the data by authorizing bodies around the world and who and actually see uh what the role of of of these uh these vaccines are well in the meantime uh our minister lawrence wong has urged singaporeans to be vaccinated with uh an approved vaccine rather than you know hold out and wait for another brand what do you read into this message that he's trying to send listen i understand that people um are a little bit nervous they feel that it's been rushed out and there's plenty of opportunities for for bad press uh bad rumors anti-vaccination campaigns but really all the boxes for uh developing this vaccine have been checked um it's gone through the animal studies the phase one the phase two the phase three studies and authorization and scrutinization of data um normally when vaccines take longer it's because there's a lot of pauses along the way while companies go for more funding and things like that so i completely agree with what minister wong is saying it's hard to imagine getting a lot better than the than a vaccine with with a a very good safety profile uh 95 efficacy and and there's really no rational reason not to vaccinate and especially in singapore we're going to be conservative and not do it in the the groups we haven't seen the data on yet that's children pregnant women we're going to monitor people for 30 minutes afterwards to to look out for allergic reactions so really if if people want their old lives back and people want to travel we're not going to get there without hurt immunity so so i urge people to take the vaccine when when your turn comes um and uh and let's get on with this and just quickly you'll be doing likewise professor i'm scheduled for 8 40 on friday morning steve all right well all the best thank you very much for speaking with us this evening professor dale fisher from the young lulin school of medicine ,True,True,False,False

the company is no expense I just need to put in effort to train young people so I've approached some companies myself so some of them are prepared to take ten twenty one people from prepared to take 50 and I think we want to add it all up your University and polytechnics each of them have a few thousand industry contacts and they will also help reach out so you want to build up this traineeship pool so it's like a long internship at this time you get to do more work you will offer use something to get into to spend your year meaningfully you know right now it's just very very hard especially for this industry and we have mentioned that this virus may never go away so unless it is a job to me this was three minutes of trade uh so this actually means that the tourism industry is going to be very heat hot here because like travel as much so should I continue with these or should I switch okay I my advice is this you must be open-minded about something you must be stubborn about other things yeah well should you be open-minded about is the sector you get into yeah if not tourism another sector be open-minded about it don't be stubborn about it don't be just say I go and work you know HR in a hotel or nothing else and if they turned you down there you go no job you know so you must be open-minded manufacturing sector hiring HR where you consider you must be open-minded grab the opportunity whenever you have it because some of them are still hiring what should you be stubborn about you should be stubborn about your specialty what is it that you have learned in your current course that makes you strong in certain area and for us hospitality so within hospitality you must have done something could be empathy could be the way you treat people could be the way you work in teams could be the way you just able to deliver very good customer service wherever you speak to right so these are strengths that is not just needed in the tourism industry so be stubborn about that so if you are clear about your skill and your specialty you also find that you are more open minded in applying that skill in other contexts the IH ELLs have have come up with three modules for everybody so I will also advise if jobs is hard to get if you apply for traineeship and you still can't get the fall back is really take up some of this CET modules big modules that is a bit outside of your comfort zone yeah for example let's say you a new engineer right so you may want to take something that is art related you know so that you expand your repertoire and your skills base let's make you a bit more versatile you can do Advanced Diploma but more importantly is when you do Advanced Diploma what subject do you want what is the thing do you want to go into it must be able to add to your portfolio must add to your CV yeah there is this more important what are you thinking of okay whoever still don't know how to code in Python you want to spend your time meaningfully going that I have been trying to sign up for Python but I have not had time so something I really wish to do yeah something I really wish to do I think of it 19 is very unfortunate a fact that the whole world but like all crisis it will pass so you come into the job market at this time some say is unlucky some say is lucky and lucky because hot harder to find job lucky because when you are older and you look back this is a kind of experience that differentiate you know from every batch of graduates you are that graduate that come into covet 19 and you have a chance now to fight it and if you make use of your time well in time to come when you overcome it this is an extra story you can tell this an extra gem that can be in your CV and one of the best use of my time of your time do some social work yeah it doesn't pay but I wanted catch up with your work help one family with the old folk to deliver food and check in on the old folk from time to time and all this will be meaningful in time to come we will rebound we are bounce back and the labor market will start becoming vibrant again so I hope everybody take care of yourself send my regards to your family yeah okay stay healthy all right bye [Music] you ,True,True,False,False

Like fear, anxiety or stress. A little stress can be helpful. It can be the motivator that keeps us self-isolating or washing our hands. But constant or high levels of stress can negatively affect our mental and physical health. Taking care of our minds is always important, but doing so in the middle of a pandemic can be really tricky. Here are some tips and techniques to help us all get through this. Start your day well It can be tempting to reach for your phone or switch on the news first thing in the morning but starting the day with a simple mindfulness exercise, such as ‘Notice 3 things’, can help you check in with how you’re feeling and connect with your environment. Mindfulness is well known to make people feel calmer and cope better with stress. This quick exercise takes less than a minute. Before you get out of bed: pause and concentrate on 3 things you can see. For example, your patterned curtains, the blue sky or even just a lightbulb. Then listen for 3 things you can hear. The sound of cars passing by, a singing bird or the hum of your boiler. And finally, notice 3 things you can feel in contact with your body. Your PJs, bedsheets or even your cat. Get planning Although it’s tempting to stay curled up in bed - adapting and creating positive new routines can be helpful and keep you motivated. For example, in the place of what was your morning commute or a school-run: listen to a podcast or go for a walk Incorporating some form of exercise outdoors if possible, into every day is good for mental and physical wellbeing. And set aside time to speak to friends, family or work colleagues every day. Connecting with others releases feel-good hormones that help to relieve stress. Stay informed, not overloaded Although we are able to cope with some stress here and there, being constantly exposed to a rolling fear-inducing news-feed can impact your mental health Hearing upsetting or anxiety-provoking news triggers a stress-response in our bodies. Keeping informed is important, but managing your social media and information intake will make a big difference to how you feel. Try to limit the time you spend listening to, watching or reading things about the outbreak Turn to one or two reliable sources for news and check them just once or twice a day to stay informed. If feelings of anxiety spring up in your day, try a breathing technique, such as box breathing. Concentrating on and controlling your breathing is a scientifically-backed way of making you feel calm. Box breathing is quick, easy and can be done anywhere. Breathe in deeply, through your nose, for a count of 4 Hold your breath for 4 Breathe out completely, through your mouth, for a count of 4 And hold your empty breath for 4 Then repeat 4 times Getting ready for bed Good quality sleep makes a big difference to how you feel. But feeling worried or anxious can make getting to sleep difficult. You could set a coronavirus news curfew, so you don’t watch or read anything to do with the outbreak after 7pm and aim for a regular bedtime. You might also find it helpful to: avoid caffeine before bed, Not eat or drink too much late in the evening Have a warm bath and keep screens out of your bedroom. If getting to sleep is proving tricky, you can try ‘the body scan’. This simple exercise helps you to relax both your mind and body, and with practice - you might find that it even sends you off to sleep. Whilst you’re lying in bed or resting, take your attention to your feet. Relax and soften them into the bed as much as possible. Then scan up your body, moving to your ankles. Release any tension and soften them into the bed. Once they feel relaxed, move up further to your calves, then knees, thighs and so on. Keep moving slowly up your body, all the way to your  head, softening and relaxing every muscle along the way. We hope these simple daily steps will help. Take care. ",True,False,True,False

Brazil India's overtaking Russia and likewise most of the deaths a US and Brazil at this stage this is the global EPI curve you can see the major contribution in in orange which is the the Americas so that includes the US and Brazil driving most of that the green one the Southeast Asian region contains India and and the one you can hardly see down the bottom as the brown one which is the western Pacific area which is which is where we are and you can see there that what we've got is around 200,000 cases a day now so that gets you up to you 1.3 1.4 million a week deaths are around 5,000 per day so here's just the the five day moving average of the three main countries and you can see as I've shown in previous weeks that the US have done this extraordinary turnaround with 30,000 cases a day coming down to 20,000 and now up to 50,000 and some of these days are actually 60,000 Brazil may be plateauing off in in terms of its cases I'm not sure I'd think schools probably still out on that one but in India as is fairly fairly relentless this is the epic curves by region and particularly you can see Africa is having about 15,000 cases a day with a relatively low death rate the America is still going up with with with their death rate there or two or three thousand per day eastern Mediterranean seems to have flattened off Europe is a story of many different countries obviously and and and this is being maintained now really by by Eastern Europe if you like and as Western Europe as has come down so this is being maintained by by by other countries Southeast Asia this was the Indian catch up in in death reporting this was the China catch up on death reporting so in in the western Pacific region we're running at very very few deaths and in cases in the sort of two thousand three thousand I'm not going to go through every country this week I'm just trying to make it a slightly shorter session in just for the for the scheduling reasons the the big talk of the town is is Australia of course they've been coming out of lockdown for for for a couple of months now never really quite quite got fully back to normal before this this spike and this is this is all happening in Melbourne so Australia's had about 9,000 cases altogether there's there's 106 deaths there's about 160 to 190 cases a day in Victoria and and this is what's prompted prompted a re lockdown but it's a fairly focused one in Melbourne with particular attention to some tower blocks of largely migrant underprivileged people so it's a it's quite similar to a to a dormitory situation I think obviously there's some particular nuances this seems to have started when there was a security guard who was working in one of the quarantine hotels became infected and they or the whole the whole Melbourne cluster seems related to that so it really just takes one infection-control breach and and Milburn's back in lockdown so it's it's quite different across the states and they've even for the first time in 100 years shut the border with New South Wales Philippines is is the other story it's it's at around 42,000 cases with with 1300 deaths this is probably not so real this this coming up they had a testing backlog so they had a lot of samples for for some months and and and they caught up once with that improving testing capacity so I don't think that's a surge in cases most of their cases about half of them are in metropolitan Manila there's a spike in spike in cases and deaths in Cebu City and and hospitals describing being being overwhelmed there's some slum areas I think in in Cebu City and and they're they're really having trouble getting contact tracing and all the conventional outbreak responses happening they're testing positivity rates five point seven so that could be a bit better as well Japan this little spike here is is is now up to 200 cases on some days and and that's that's related to some nightclub outbreaks in in in Tokyo career just doing this nice little rumble along which I've I'm a big fan of I think this is this is your perfect Debbie curve the Korean one so India 675 thousand cases and almost twenty thousand deaths in in total testing positivity rate of 8% so so that this really is just just fairly relentless as I've said before it's it's fairly heterogeneous some some places not so badly affected but but others have got I've got major problems there's a shutdown in in an area of Kerala and as well as that Mumbai was having problems so so but but actually it's not all bad news I this this came I came across this with this place it's called the Dharavi slum and and this whole effort became the the Dharavi mission mission Doral via was called so this is an area and and hello and I know we've got a lot of people from India that the tune in to us so so hello to all of you and I hope I've got this story right but there's about there's about a million people that live in this area which is two square miles and they've had all together you can see this newspaper on June 30th said they had two thousand two hundred and sixty-eight cases in in April they had four hundred and ninety in in May they had about twelve hundred so so June was another thousand but but obviously it's peaked in in in early June and look at these cases in in July so so it's absolutely stunning that they could they could control this outbreak in this setting and and they did it with good old-fashioned outbreak response they took over schools and halls and sports facilities and and develop quarantine areas they were doing about they did about twelve thousand tests in total and with a mobile testing unit so so a good story I mean I guess this is still still dry kindling so it's it it could take off again but nonetheless it's a it's a good story the other area I thought I might just have a look at because we've never really spoken about this is his parts of of Eastern Europe and and and this came came across Greece is is doing remarkably well right three and a half thousand cases a hundred ninety two deaths but you can see that they're rumbling along and about maybe 20 cases a day now and many of those are actually from from Serbia so you can see Greece here Serbia not far away and there's there's been there's problems here you can see this it's got a beautiful second wave shape to it as soon as they unlocked all the the the efforts they had in in May this resurgence came back and apparently this is a media reports are of a poor case and that will under reporting of cases and deaths so so Greece's shut the borders to two to keep out these areas you can see the other areas with North Macedonia and Romania Bulgaria or all the curves are really going the wrong way so but interestingly with Serbia it was one of the ones that is allowed to go to the EU you'll remember they've the EU has declared 15 countries that can go there and UK has also declared countries that are allowed in without the 14 days quarantine and Serbia is one of those so so I think this is something to watch the Serbian testing positivity rates about five just over five percent so and as I said I'm not going to go through all the countries this week I'm just going to be a bit more mindful of time but just to to make the point that we're seeing a lot more focused lock downs now Lester lockdown on June 30 so you can see there there's London those Birmingham so Lester's Lester's here so it's right in the middle of the of the country and and they got to not a lot of thing it was around 500 cases of we're having so so anyway this this got locked down and you can see where we're back to those familiar beer streets what else there's also one in Spain this and if there's anyone that wants to criticize my pronunciation go for it the the Syria region of Li a de lis either and so that's that's over here and this area this is La Marina in in Galicia which is a beach resort so they're both been locked down so you get increasing cases clearly people are looking to have a much smarter shutdown it'll be a better shutdown shouldn't really be in the playbook but unfortunately once you get overwhelmed or you're heading towards overwhelmed hospitals overwhelmed public health systems you can't do the contact tracing anymore you testing capacity is is used up then you then you really got no choice so that's and probably earlier is better if you if you're seeing the trend this is a focus lockdown as I say in Melbourne these are the the blocks and there's though there were about 3,000 people across these blocks that will lock down now they've they've done a lot of testing some of them are are really quite negative so they've unlocked them and just put them on the melbourne lockdown and they've got different scales of lockdown so nonetheless that's what's happening in melbourne and for those of you don't know it's right down the the the southeastern corner of australia and you can see the live lockdown i heard someone on the it's actually all the all the problems are around here much more inner city but i'm not sure how they arrived at where the borderline would be but i know this this people are the people on this side of the water and not as happy as the people on this side of the water who are not on lockdown and of course india and don't even ask me to pronounce that but anyway it's in it's in kerala they've called this a triple lockdown and triple lockdown really it's it's interesting because there's been some other Indian towns sort of lockdowns and and they call it this triple one so so level one is sort of general containment it just stops movement of of all people in the area so you can see the area here and so there are there are checkpoints and there's there's closed roads as there might be an area where there's only one Road in and one Road out and there's barricades and police on on the other roads so so they're really trying to stop total movement then there's the movement of the specific within a specific geographical area and those areas might have had cases they might have contacts there this sort of quarantine zones so there's an extra special sort of lockdown for those areas and then lockdown three is is really at that household level where there might be contacts and there's extra special attention paid to to those so it's it's an interesting concept I certainly don't have any problems with it it's it's I guess a smart lockdown so back over to Singapore now here's out the three curbs I show every week imported cases remain negligible community cases well there's a little blip but we we would have expected that you can see it's still around twenty a day and the dormitory residents are slowly making their way down linked versus unlinked so you can see there's these are the linked cases and these are the the unlinked cases Green being being being gnf work permits so so the yellow ones are the Singaporeans and permanent residents so but the main point is there's been a little blip up I think it's a blip we can definitely tolerate but but where it takes where where it goes is is is the question and we'll have more answers to that over the next weeks and months and the final slide again this is where we sit in Singapore at the moment there's there's one one lost my mouth you know there's there's one case in ICU there's 214 in general Ward's across the country so that's that's been fairly flat in in care facilities or all the isolation facilities that have been built are starting to become underutilized I think we got to 20,000 beds to bed capacity so so that's coming down and the total of total number of deaths we haven't had a death for a little while now so thanks David back to you great deal thanks very much I want to remind you to send you questions in the country where you're watching via the Q&A tool at the bottom of your zoom screen again and it's my honor to have the opportunity to introduce our guest expert tonight dr. Cornelia Qi she is head and senior consultant Department of psychological medicine National University Hospitals senior consultant and director women's emotional health service and head in clinical senior lecturer department of psychological medicine young rule in School of Medicine National University of Singapore the title of our talk this evening is mental health issues surrounding COBIT 19 over to you Cornelia alright hello everybody everybody thank you so much for tuning in today I practice psychiatry at the National University Hospital for the last 20 years so I was here when SAS h1n1 and MERS hits Singapore I remember was a really dark time because as you know many of those who are affected with healthcare workers and you actually had some some of our best and our brightest passed away due to stylist morale was really low and I think our mental health was really affected we learned a lot from that and the other virus outbreaks over the years but it's clear that they haven't completely prepared us for this virus well we've learned a lot about its physical effects on the human body we are only just beginning to see how it affects the mental health of us as individuals and as species but there's so much to mental health during this pandemic that can I can only skim the surface so I decided to divide my talk into four different sections for the direct effects of Kovach 19 our population response to disasters what we can do as a population and personal mental health strategies okay so of course there are direct effects from health anxiety for 1:7 for others and when we it was becoming clear that that this virus was spreading among the population we were asked to reduce the number of cases so that we would have fewer patients coming to the the hospital and we need enough have really worried about that because we had a lot of psychiatric patients who who were deathly scared of coming to the hospital also the if you recall there a lot of fear of unknown aspects of how the virus spread and what its characteristics were and I think I was a lot more of that at the beginning although even now I think that it's still controversial whether or not the virus might be spread by an airborne root so there's still quite a lot of things that we are still learning then we had the effect from the lockdown or circuit breaker measures that they were called in Singapore and indirectly and this is one one of the things that's going to be having great impact on us is the financial and economic implications of unemployment difficulty with with one's business or maintaining one's home okay and then in what happened in Singapore is that Singapore school shifted to full home-based learning for two months well yes for two months first it was home based learning and then they went into school holidays so suddenly parents of young children had to cope with the kids being at home and since some of them were also working from home they had to juggle both the kids homework and supervising them as well as doing they are trying to do that work so I still remember I had a patient come in and the first thing she did the moment she came in was to burst into tears that was awful she had three kids under under nine and it was the rolling all over her and she was trying to do her work and she was she's just in tears okay so there are a lot of things that happens when when we're trying to do things at home and when we have a lot of distractions and there's no no boundaries at all really okay next I wanna shift gears a little bit and talk about direct early effects on people who actually get Kove in nineteen well the majority may well be asymptomatic but we do know now that there's a phenomenon called silent hypoxia where patients can have very low oxygen saturation levels without too much discomfort and for these patients because they're in a constant hypoxic state they could be having direct effects of that on their brains and therefore presenting with confusion or odd behavior so maybe that's something we need to look at also what some of the studies are coming up with is that there appears to be an awesome ear or the inability to smell in a majority of patients and this is something that I think we've got to look out for because it's one of those under rates that disabilities or problems that patients may have which we we don't give as much credit to compared to sales among with blindness or hearing impairment more on that later so it started became becoming quite clear that neurologic features were a part of the the picture when you had a severe infection so for patients who were in the hospital due to a RTS a large proportion of them had agitation some more had confusion and a post discharge about a third was still affected also after the the results of the recent trial that showed that dexamethasone might be helpful for severe infections we do know that steroids are associated with a variety of psychiatric in presenting Asians maybe see insomnia elation depression and once in a while Frank psychosis so that's another thing that we will be looking out for for these patients in terms of late effects I'd like to make a comparison with SARS and MERS because these are the most recent corona viral attacks that we've had so studied by Rogers that came out in May this year showed that during the acute phase of the illness about a third had confusion depression anxiety and but four in ten with insomnia and after infection about three years later about 15 to 15 percent had depressed mood or anxiety about a third had traumatic memories but the good news was that you know maybe about 77% were back at work after three years so there is some lingering morbidity but some ability to get back to a level of function okay in terms of the direct and involvement of the brain this is this is something that is becoming pretty obvious a very recent study has shown that there's a definite neuronal damage in severe and post-mortem cases of Kovac 90 and that is something that we really need to look out for so perhaps what we do need to do is to follow up with non-coated 19 sufferers over the long term especially those who had a RDS or and into ICU to make sure that they are not having long-term effects more on their nightmares talking about about 50% of patients even if they are having very mild symptoms may have anosmia they may not actually notice it but on a sniff test actually most of them will have complete anosmia or a reduced ability to smell food and if this is long-lasting then this is really going to impact the ability to to enjoy one's food and that's something that's you do three times a day or so and more so that would really impact one's quality of life okay so in terms of very late effects it's likely that we need to look up for late neuropsychiatry syndromes and another thing which kind of made me think about is that in psychiatry where we know that schizophrenia is associated with viral illness viral exposure in utero and this was an early article in 1988 that showed that an unfinished birth cohorts we had a higher rate of individuals developing schizophrenia during the 1957 a to type a to influenza epidemic so I'm not saying that this is definitely going to happen about this it's for sure something that we need to watch out for especially given that the number of patients getting covered 19 is so high across the world okay now a little bit about health care workers so based on our experience in Singapore with previous viral epidemics we are much better prepared this time so this is a study that was done by Benjamin Town at all in Singapore surveyed early during the pandemic and showed that there was about 8% with depression 11 percent anxiety and about 6 percent pts symptoms and this compares well with 21 percent morbidity for those health care workers who were surveyed during sauce and a PDS symptoms which were higher okay almost interesting about this current paper is that if you were medical which they defined as a doctor or a nurse then your chances of having anxiety is actually half that then compared if you were non-medical so executives or perhaps the the cleaning staff or airline health so this is an interesting finding so we really should look into into this and just bear in mind that perhaps even though we make they may be frontline there are maybe other reasons for this increased anxiety okay what do we know we know that the health mental health of healthcare workers is much much worse when healthcare systems are overwhelmed and especially when they have to make distressing ethical choices such as do we admit a 40 year old or the 70 year old to our last date in Nice you what if that 40 year olds a drug addict versus if the 70 oh is a recently retired eminent professor of economics let's see so you know going back to philosophy and the trolley bus problem that they're just so many combinations and it's really difficult to have to make these these life and death decisions okay so for healthcare start had to had to do this in Italy during the height of their pandemic you can see that the pts symptoms are so much higher so much so many more post-traumatic symptoms and a higher rate of depressed mood and anxiety now going on to migrant workers so we have 300 23,000 migrant workers which are housed in dormitories so it's almost as if there are like a lower middle-income country house within a high-income country for the most part they live apart and socialized apart and of course with the with increase in numbers that exploded in Singapore they have had to be housed in CCF's and and special dormitories to try and contain the virus so how is it different for them of course they have to fear losing their jobs being deported having language barriers being separated from their family in some cases overcrowding and with it misinformation some of them actually very early on even thought that they were going to be shepherded onto a ship to be killed so the think to note that is that a lot of these studies actually may have been in some ways a convenient sampling or particularly special groups that that might have been easier to sample and they may not be representative of the poor and marginalized groups especially so groups that may not have access to social media or the internet or a stuck at home and we also have to think of social and economic health as being very closely related to mental health so for those who are abused the poor and those are special needs I think we do need to really look out for them next in terms of the population response to disasters this is a very well-known chart that shows that when there is a impact due to a disaster at first there is a heroic response and there is a honeymoon where there's a lot of community cohesion but what is clear is that inevitably there is a period of disillusionment especially if they are trigger events and this can happen for for quite a while so after a single event such as a flood let's say or an earthquake the disillusionment phase can come in months after and lasts for up to a year and then after the anniversary some reconstruction occurs however what happens is that with with this virus we are seeing repeater waves so what we are going to see probably is a prolonged disaster not a single event and it's going to have a very long mental health tale okay this is a little bit of a switch and this is it's been very interesting really just noticing how how on on one hand people get together and they really pull through but at the same time there's a lot of tribalism that it's constantly rearing its ugly it and I think this is for me as a psychiatrist not surprising at all it's no it's no coincidence that as children we are brought up learning about good versus bad and and and that there's always a black is a white an evil stepmother and a good princess and that's because we think in terms of black and white it's also well ingrained in the human psyche to think in terms of tribes so as an in-group it promotes bonding and it helps us to perform better with our in-group and to you know sort of be a bit suspicious of potentially hostile out groups and when that happens then it's very easy especially when we're stressed to move in this tribalism mode it's really important though to bear in mind that oftentimes when tribalism is rearing its head it's our limbic system or emotional brains that are coming in rather than a more rational neocortex so if you find yourself thinking very clearly that this I am I am right and you are wrong and try and put it push it through your down cortex okay we're going to mental health strategies for the population so this is Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs it's right for me little lots of people basically it's a it's a pyramid we're starting from the bottom you look at physiological needs such as food water shelter and sleep and then you move up along the knee the the levels of needs and finally becomes self actualized I just want to concentrate on the bottom three physiological needs they're unique because we have to keep returning to them followed by safety and security needs and then love and belonging okay so very importantly one must meet basic needs and I would include maybe the internet in in terms of physiological needs almost all right so what happened is on February 7th we all know that it's Singapore das kann Orange was declared and then suddenly everybody kind of rushed to the supermarkets and started hoarding on things such as daily necessities and toilet paper and this is really the panic that the basic needs were not going to be met yeah so I saw that two days later our prime minister actually had to come and reassure the population that there was really no need to worry about the basic needs and I think this was a very good step recognizing that there were these needs that really need to be reassured so in terms of tribalism it's often about fight or flight but in terms of what else we can do as a population the other coping that we can do is to tend and befriend and I'm so glad to see that in nationally a national care hotline has been set up such that if you are worried or stressed during this time you can actually call for help in the NHS we also have hotlines and support groups for healthcare workers and as well as for for staff just like to bring a little bit of a detour to this little town called Rosetta and the Rosetta effect so what happened was in the 1960s it was noticed that this little Italian town Italian American town rather and much lower cardiovascular mortality rates compared to the nearby towns and they realized that actually there's a very high social cohesion they shared the festivals and had a lot of informal networks those were often open the houses were closely spaced and neighbors would often pop over to each other and share food and gossip well what happened is that and they were followed up over 50 years and as the population and became more Americanized as I said well social cohesion went down and mortality rate started approaching those of the rest of the neighbor towns so I mean it's not just about physical health but I think in terms of the mental health of the town it also sort of went along the same way hmm so this is what a new HS has been doing for for the migrant workers looking after their basic needs as well as their social social needs as well and connecting with them and giving them information largely though in the dorms this this has been taken up by the NGOs so for example Health Service got a Tele friending service where volunteers who can speak the local language of the migrant workers will speak to the will speak to the the patients but at the same time getting supervision from volunteer psychiatrists so this is the paper on recommendations for improving the mental health of healthcare workers it's it's really not rocket science clear communications important adequate PPE so this was not not provided in some countries likely Singapore is not one of them adequate rest and practical and psychological support okay finally into the mental health strategies these are the things that we are prone to misinformation unpredictability social isolation and a lack of control so in terms of misinformation obviously we should have accurate information and I would just say why not go for the Goldilocks effect basically if you want your information make sure it is not too little not too much not too hot and not too cold okay next for mindfulness what is mindfulness meditation it can be defined as the focused awareness on the present in a non-judgmental way and if you remember this dramatic Thai boys who are stuck in a cave in 2018 with their soccer coach for I think it was for 18 days before they were all rescued and I think part of the reason they actually managed to survive was really because their coach taught them how to meditate and therefore they stayed calm they used up less oxygen and they were not panicking or you know just just losing it so this is a very important thing I think when we are facing situations where things are very uncertain and we can't really control things I mean what else can you do focus on the present so this reminds me oh yes so there is actually increasing evidence space for this being able to actually change our brains this reminds me of a birthday card I got some time ago forget about the past you can't change it forget about the future it's not here yet forget about the present I didn't get you one but seriously this is what I tell my patients if you have a very active brain that's really overthinking and worrying too much about the future all the time then you're prone to anxiety likewise if you're thinking too much about the past and really preoccupy all the time then you're going to be more likely to develop depression and this is where mindfulness comes in because now you can there's a tool for you to focus more on the present and change your neuronal networks to not overthink either into the future not the past finally oh not finally third thing social isolation so finding new ways to connect this is an interesting paper I found where they studied different regions in Italy and they found that the regions which had the highest spread of Kovac 19 also had the smallest household size and a higher number of nursing homes so in fact social connectedness was not a risk factor for spreading kovat 19 in fact it was the opposite okay lots of control so you generally for high-functioning adults we're used to a high level of control and now in this pandemic of the fields that we can't control many things so the best thing to do then is to focus on what you can control and in self-determination theory I found this good when you're choosing things that you can control think of things that you feel competent in that you can feel that you have some freedom in and which helps you feel related having said that if you're introvert then chances are you'll be happier with with hobbies that don't require so much relatedness so actually there are a lot of things that can be done and it's up to you to pick and choose something that actually makes you happy my other advice also would be to have as many tools in your toolbox as you can if you only rely on exercise for example and you're not allowed to exercise or you develop an injury and you have nothing else to fall back on then it becomes a problem so develop more Skills more hobbies and more ways of coping finally I think that there's another thing we can do and that's to choose gratitude so focusing on the things that we can be grateful for and there's there's more evidence coming in now that actually changes our brains as well so looking at the silver linings I think it's been very helpful my patients teach me a lot and actually I was quite surprised when I to feel my patients didn't actually feel that kovat 19 was a big deal they said well I'm at home now and I've always liked to be at home and now I'm actually normal and others were saying you know I can spend more time with my family or I can actually focus on the important things in life and that ends my talk thank you very much Thank You Cornelia we very much appreciate that time is short we do want you to send in your questions we're going to try to get to as many as we can let me start off with the question from Tana Lee hoon who states that lockdown measures have seen mothers having to juggle work from home and organizing their children's schooling from home what words of advice do you have for us yes I think we need to involve fathers more now a recent study that came out from the center for family and population research in NUS that showed that working mothers spend twice as much time than compared to fathers on weekdays so you know I think men can step up more excellent and there's a follow-up question do not I mean don't children benefit from having a loving parents at home with them during these trying times there's a lot of stress it's better than them being in a place where maybe people are a bit more impersonal such as where school oh yeah but you know schools an important place to socialize as well especially for teens yeah okay Kenneth you asks what's your professional opinion is to the ministerial task force decision to classify psychological services as non-essential during the circuit breaker period I got phone calls from my psychologist friends in private practice the night it happened is it what we're non-essential oh I had so many patients we're not doing well because they could not see that their counselors and their mental health practitioners in private I think that was a misstep policy okay I assume the the organisation the professional organizations in Singapore able to convey that message was sephorus lee and that's why that that was eventually reversed how do we in to bill individualize the message regarding the availability of mental health screening and mental health care to be more acceptable in light of the cultural religious and or ethnic group differences in how mental health issues are perceived this is gonna be a tough one it has to be a whole of society thing and you know I was just chatting with my foot my patient today and she's saying that can I get insurance if I if I if I apply for it now cuz I was I was denied it when I when I was hospitalized three years ago and I said you know honestly our local insurers are not really very enlightened and that is a tragedy it's it's got to be not just not just mental health advocates I think visions that keep on pushing the envelope so what is the what is the baseline rate of mental health issues in Singapore I know in the United States is around 17 to 20 percent and I know after after Katrina it went up to 55 percent the hurricane so what is our baseline rate baseline rate according to our single Singapore mental health study that was done a few years ago what depression anxiety if I'm not wrong at around five percent but that's not lifetime prevalence that was quite prevalence okay how would you compare the efficacy of face-to-face delivery of mental health mental health care versus virtual delivery well their pros and cons both ways if you if it's compared with no mental health delivery then it's definitely ideal but there are problems with mental health delivery via you know tele consult or video consult I think some of the nuances don't quite come across and suddenly if the patient might be at risk for self-harm or suicide then that could be a problem so we always have to make sure that the patient is likely to be safe before we start the console most countries do not have adequate mental health personnel to meet everyone's needs and as such the primary caregivers are often providing screening and mental health care you have a few simple tips for primary care providers who may be in a poly clinic with only 5 to 15 minutes with each patient certain minutes this is asking a lot I think that's a tough one I think sometimes it's about relationship and it's just showing that you care as a person and you're listening actually not not enough people listen so if you're able to listen I think that was that's a great help already we're doing more telling and incorporating that into our lives is there a looming crisis from social media reliance you mentioned earlier that that one of the basic necessities is the internet but does the reliance on social media cause us to have disintegration and socialization well I think this is a complex one human beings are are generally meant to be social and I think that the early studies generally showed that if you spend more time on social media than it was correlated with more mental health problems I think it's actually much more complex than that I think for some people it can be a real lifeline and I think society is evolving to to socialize and to reach out and to find very positive things using social media ething has asked what are the top three silver linings you see arising from kovat 19 for the mental healthcare sector if you can firstly the chance to simplify one's life so I used to travel very often and when I couldn't do that anymore I had to find books and then now I'm happily traveling to you know 18th century Russia or Japan in my mind that's one so simplifying I think the other thing is to get back to nature one of the things I really really enjoyed about the last day of the circuit breaker was how blue the skies were so I think getting back to nature is another one and the last one is I think on if you can connecting with the people in your house I've got two teenage girls and we taught that my husband I taught them mahjong and we had many happy evenings playing mahjong nice Joyce tio has asked a doctor Qi what stage of the disaster response chart is Singapore at now what can we expect in the delusion Minh stage so that chart is for a single event so what we're really doing is very uncharted - really and I think the disillusionment is just gonna go up and down with time and it's gonna be dragged out quite a bit mm-hmm okay and just last question is looking back in the last six months if you could have two wishes for mental health services or support in Singapore what what would you have in place now that maybe we don't I think maybe more more of a set up for for tele visits or tele consulting and the other thing would be just less stigma yeah thank you so much we're gonna where time is short over to you Dale that's quick okay so it's a slightly truncated version tonight David because I we predicted that we might might run out of time so I've just got got a couple tonight the first one the and Cornelia actually mentioned that does this whole business about is it airborne and and I've got a little story about drones in South Korea after that so so I think it will remember this picture this was in in the outbreak movie when Dustin Hoffman looked up at a at an event and said it's gone airborne and I think it's a hallmark moment in the movie and and I think that's what a lot of people think about but it's obviously a lot more complicated than that when so when we are considering whether something's airborne it comes down to the the size of the particle but as a rule of thumb if it's if it's under five microns in size that's five thousandth of a millimeter then it's capable of being suspended in air but but bigger ones bigger particles tend to be droplets that fall to the ground and that's whether the one to two meters comes from and it relates to the precautions we take when we say one to two meters when we say surgical mask is is adequate most of the time then then this is really the the presumption so so it is quite important to understand whether it is airborne or not so as I think most people would know there was a an article published in CID during the week and a letter also to the New York Times by the same authors claiming 239 people that had were wanting to put pressure on WH o to admit that it was that it was airborne so let me just take you through that the the people that wrote the letter though there were a few epidemiologists and public health people but but by and large they were their ventilation experts their aero engineers they work in laboratories and and look at air flow and and droplets and and suspended particles in the air and things like that so we're trying to work out if these particles can can spread long distances so you can see in this little graphic that obviously with generally a movement if it was suspended in the air that it could go really tens of meters so so they're in how do you prove it and you can do this two ways you can do this by epidemiologically and you can also do it viral aaja Klee now let's let's start with the epidemiologic side so we know that the vast majority of people that get covert get it from close contact and the and the reproductive number is generally around 2.5 now measles and chickenpox are the two famous viruses for for being airborne their reproductive number is you know 10 12 15 and that's because it's airborne it can go long distances and people can get the disease without having any close contact with someone with the disease so already that reproductive number is starting to give us some hints that that it's it's mostly droplet spread now there are there any examples of people that have got the disease with no contact now that's possible there's there's some publications of restaurants and singing events where where so many people got it indeed even super spreading events where you might argue that it must be airborne because it was a super spreader event and so many so many people got the disease and maybe singing does have the capacity to create these very small aerosols but unfortunately you can't remove the concept of fomites being contaminated so this is the environment so this is where we say when we're when we're deciding is on trans on transmission based precautions is it contact is a droplet is it airborne and we we generally go with the theory that it's contact and droplet therefore wash your hands keep your distance wear a mask particularly if you can't keep that distance so um did some of these super spreading events restaurants and singing events did they have environmental contamination and that's how the transmission happened and that we can't be a hundred percent sure of but this is one of the pieces of evidence cited by the the the airborne protagonists so so that would be be the first thing now we know it's never been cultured from an aerosol okay with the found PCR positive but it's never been cultured as opposed to other viruses which you can culture from the aerosols so therefore is it just fragments of the virus in in the in the aerosol we know that when we swab throats towards that the the end of the illness that we can't culture it but we can detect that the PCR can be positive and we can detect we can detect viral RNA so um that's an important point to know that it's actually never been cultured despite a lot of efforts having said that it's not easy to culture era sauce so so so that again is not a definite no it can't be aerosol spread so on so the the w-h-o has basically always said that we believe that it's mostly contact and and droplet spread we won't exclude that it could be aerosol spread but with that R naught and with that epidemiology and with the fact that we can't culture it or at least can culture it easily then then at best I would argue that that airborne precaution is is unlikely or is is a lower driver of the outbreak we know there's aerosol generating procedures so if you're having a tube put down your throat or dental work or something like that then that can generate aerosols um but outside of the hospital we really don't don't see it as a as a big driver although that what that's what all the fuss is about with with a school of thought being that it is a big driver it's definitely the arguments definitely not over yet but but that's where we stand and I hope that explanation helps people out there I just wanted to to go to to a video now so this is a very neat video that that I came across during the week it's it's in South Korea these are drones choreographed amazingly the the actual video is a little bit longer so thank you Joe for editing it to just capture the the key bits but I'll I'll hand over to you now Joe to show the video please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some things just make you speechless right yeah anyway the whole video takes 11 minutes the way they moved through all the the virus on the front of the masks and the the social distancing moving the two heads away on the hand-washing and then the thanks to health care workers apparently no one in Seoul knew that was happening they just they just did it so anyway I don't know I've turned into the video guy we've that's three in a row wasn't supposed to be it but I don't know what's gonna happen from one week to the next but anyway back to you David thanks alright thank you very much do that's superb yeah let me just provide a brief summary of tonight the key points we learned that there'll be a long mental health tale as consequences of Koba 19 due to the biologic effects of the viruses the virus and the drugs are used to treat it as well as social isolation and the economic impact this is having on us there should be more discussion an action to alleviate the disproportionate responsibilities of working mothers are experiencing compared to the working father's during this pandemic we learned that and finally foreign workers and health care workers are vulnerable to allay fear we should provide clear routine repeated messaging which is critical to their mental well-being adequate supplies whether it's PPE food or etc adequate rest and teaching encouraging mindfulness and self-determination it leads me now to thank our two speakers Dale as usual an excellent job and Cornelia we're so glad that you joined us tonight our speaker next week will be Professor David Patterson he's director of University of Queensland the Center for clinical research and consultant infectious diseases physician at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital the title of his talk will be treating kovat 19 reckless Cowboys versus the ivory tower academics sounds like it'll be entertaining there's a chatbox tool at the bottom of your screen we'd appreciate your feedback the chat box will be open for another ten minutes or so we welcome your comments and your contribution to mr. e pandemic song of the week until next week stay safe wash your hands and send us your suggested pandemic song of the week and after months of staying home with your family I'm sure you'll all smile when you hear the lyrics to pall thorns 2010 song I don't like

Covid-19 plagued the world for most of 2020, but at the end of the year, vaccines developed and approved at record speed started to become available for use. With the largest vaccination drive in history under way, what are the differences between the Covid-19 vaccines? How effective are they? What are the potential side effects of some of the vaccines, what are the dosage requirements and how will they get to you? Here’s what you need to know about the Covid-19 vaccine front-runners.

coronavirus that causes covid19 and while vaccines normally require many years of research and testing scientists in 2020 took less than a year to come up with defenses against the sars kovi ii virus what's the difference between the major covert 19 vaccines as of january 2021 at least six vaccines have been developed paving the way for the jabs to reach the arms of millions of people in mass vaccination campaigns other shots developed by china's kansano russia's vector institute and india's bharat biotech have also been rolled out for limited or early use in specific regions at the same time there are more than 60 vaccine candidates in clinical trials which is the final stage of research meant to assure safety and effectiveness the world health organization has stressed the importance of vaccine development to tackle the global pandemic that had infected 82 million people by the end of 2020 vaccines represent a major major light at the end of the tunnel but we have much work to do to make that a reality on november 9th 2020 pfizer bioentech made history by releasing preliminary data indicating that their coronavirus vaccine was over 90 percent effective this means that under optimal conditions there is 90 percent less infection among those with the vaccine compared with an unvaccinated group so how does that compare to the effectiveness of the other vaccine frontrunners [Music] these percentages are based on official efficacy data cynovac was expected to publish official figures about its vaccine in early january but the chinese company has already released phase 3 trial data showing 78 effectiveness the oxford astrazeneca vaccine has shown a range of effectiveness in different trials depending on how the shots were delivered but as pharmaceutical companies and research institutes published their research the coronavirus is mutating new strains have been found in south africa and the uk raising questions about whether the vaccines will continue to offer protection against new more contagious variants we have tested more than 20 virus variants with different type of mutations and the result was always that and that that the vaccine induces immune response which is so broad and that it attacks multiple multiple positions at in this virus protein and you have just to to calculate that 99 of this virus protein is not changed only one percent is or less than one percent is changed so the likelihood is high and that that the vaccine can deal with that vaccines are only approved by health authorities after research shows they are safe but the speed of the development of the covert 19 shots have some people asking if the side effects of the shots have been studied enough in general vaccines against most diseases have some small risk of side effects in limited cases the covert 19 jabs cause pain at the site of injection tiredness headaches muscle pain joint pain chills and fever but such reactions are rare and lasts no longer than a few days the u.s centers for disease control and prevention has confirmed at least 21 cases of serious allergic reactions to the vaccine made by pfizer bioentech after similar reports in the uk britain's medicine regulators advised anyone with a history of significant allergies to avoid the pfizer bio-intake jabs after vaccines are developed and approved the next major challenge is getting them into the arms of people around the globe the historic urgency and volume of doses needed pose unprecedented logistical challenges and drug makers around the world are boosting their outputs to full capacity china says it can produce a billion doses of vaccines in 2021 enough to inoculate most of the country's 1.3 billion citizens but china is also under pressure to meet demand from abroad for example thailand is expected to get about 2 million doses of cyanovac vaccines starting in february thailand is also looking at ways to produce vaccines domestically astrazeneca has already partnered with a thai company on a vaccine manufacturing plant that can produce 200 million doses a year but most of that output is destined for export countries also face the challenge of training enough health workers to administer the jabs some parts of india are running mock coronavirus vaccination drills to get local health officials ready for the real deal another obstacle is the temperature sensitive nature of some vaccines to maintain a shelf life of up to six months the pfizer bioend tech vaccine must be kept at a temperature of minus 70 degrees celsius moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees celsius major logistics firms have geared up with specialized vehicles and freezes to transport millions of doses of the vaccines to hospitals and other distribution sites around the world the oxford astrazeneca vaccine and russia's sputnik v can be stored at normal home refrigerator temperatures making them easier to transport and potentially more feasible for use in developing countries most vaccines have one thing in common they require two doses to offer enough protection the second jab is known as a booster shot meant to trigger long-lasting immunity the suggested timing for getting a second dose varies depending on the vaccine johnson johnson is testing a single dose vaccine which also does not require ultra-cold storage the u.s company plans to seek emergency use authorization for the shots in february experts say the vaccine would be a game changer since it could put less stress on healthcare infrastructure the largest vaccination drive in human history began in december 2020. the uk was the first western country to start a nationwide mass inoculation program on december 8th [Music] the european union has sealed six vaccine deals with moderna oxford astrazeneca pfizer bioentech and other drug makers but while the eu has secured access to 2 billion doses or enough for all 450 million people in the 27 member states there have been complaints about the slow rollout of the jabs [Music] without the purchasing power of high income countries low and middle income nations must leverage other means to acquire covert 19 vaccines some countries including peru turkey and indonesia have volunteered to host clinical trials in exchange for doses india has been able to secure a large number of doses by reaching manufacturing agreements with the vaccine producers many countries however are struggling to lay their hands on any vaccines at all the who is leading a global initiative for fair distribution of covert 19 vaccines known as kovacs the scheme aims to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses around the world including to developing countries by the end of 2021. while chinese authorities have promised that the sino-farm vaccine will be free in china there are reports from china that people have been spending as much as 400 yuan or about 60 us dollars for the vaccine pfizer bioentec set the official price for its vaccines at 19.50 per dose moderna had been looking to charge 25 to 37 us dollars per dose but those fees may ultimately be lower sputnik v has said its vaccine will be sold on the international markets for less than ten dollars per dose the eu is reportedly paying about two dollars for a dose of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine [Music] the coronavirus has plagued the world for more than a year and it has killed nearly 2 million people the hope is that the vaccines can contain the spread of the coronavirus around the world and that life can slowly but surely return to a new normal but while vaccines can greatly reduce the effect of the virus they do not guarantee a person is entirely safe from infection so until enough people are vaccinated to produce so-called herd immunity health experts continue to stress the importance of social distancing and that we continue to wear masks to protect ourselves our families and the world [Laughter] you

E-mail : kelvin@aventisglobal.com",okay a very good afternoon Sunday afternoon to everyone who has made some time to join us online this is a online webinar brought to you by Aventis School of Management and today we intending to share with you it well it's a little sharing on how do we cope with anxiety and stress during the common 19 situation it's also for us to share some details of our program with you and later on you will have the opportunity to ask questions about our program on social psychology and counseling with representative mr. Calvin I perform the main part of the online webinar I will be sharing with you a bit of what we know about commit 19 and how it has impacted individuals psychological health as a whole right so again this is not an in-depth academic analysis of the Cove in 1902 some global perspective and political considerations of things I think that's not the objective if you are here for that perhaps it's not correct that from its small just to this share how this situation has some very real impacts of on the psychology of individuals organizations and even be government themselves right so I think that's the spirit of the session today I'm gonna move on a little bit about myself my name is Anil I am a senior lecturer as well as a coach and I've been in the field of lecturing for about 10 years and also you know in the field of coaching as well as counseling so I've been with when this for the last five years previously I've run a drug rehabilitation center where I help recovering drug addicts as well as their family members to go through their recovery stage I was also in the National addictions Management Service that's a tertiary outfit in Singapore that deals with treatment of various types of addictions namely drugs alcohol gambling and gaming of course there are many other fringe addictions but these are the big four that we look at in Singapore and so if you'd see my mind my experience deals largely with people who are recovering from addiction in the school front I am a lecturer at many institutions both government and private institutions and currently I'm also with the Singapore University of Social Sciences where I do academic coaching so academic coaching in the sense of not tuition per se but both helping students understand their struggles that they are facing with school and also to see how I can better help them from a coaching counseling perspective to reach a better state of doing well and managing the challenges the multiple challenges that they have in life with regards to school and then the academic progress so that's a little bit about me I shall move on to my sharing today Oh as we speak some of you would have really gotten wind of the news and I've also seen some very cynical interesting comments online Oh Singapore you'd like to be number one right so finally you are number one and we are number one in Southeast Asia for the most number of Kobe 19 cases I think part of the reasons is is because the past few days we had sharp rises in numbers of between 500 to 900 plus numbers aside yes we do have close to about six thousand five maybe slightly more cases of in we have about 740 recoveries if you do a little bit of math that is slightly more than 10% and we have 11 fatalities from there but at the end of the day these are arbitrary these are number some people are very concerned about the quantitative aspects and I think with numbers it's usually a measure of how well a country is doing to manage the pandemic and so on now being too fixated on the numbers somehow blinds us to other aspects of the pandemic as a whole for instance once what's the coronavirus impact on food security yeah there was a very good article yesterday on food security in Singapore and how we have always taken that for granted but how do we review our food production for instance this is the impact of coronavirus on the economy for for obvious and all of us know that and we see how businesses are affected people losing their jobs some having to take pay cuts some having to adjust to working from home like many of us and and myself in fact even and if you think that all working from home well what's so difficult and it's good you don't have to travel to work you've got a bit more time with families and so on well at the micro level some individuals may tell you that's very hard to go school work or work itself with family some have kids running around some have elderly parents some could be in a small dwelling with seven or eight individuals and you know suddenly having to face the prospect of being with seven or eight individuals at home for an extended period of time is something that it's not whether it's it's a nice or not nice thing from a family perspective it's something that needs adjustments right and people may not exactly see them right similarly from a a country point of view if you look at Japan there were reports on how Japanese are struggling with working from home because all alone when it comes to work ethics and the idea of of respect of interpersonal relationship between employees and employers Japan places great pride in in working and somehow now they have to adjust their mode of working and it's not easy for organizations and process and so on to do it so these are just some examples of how a global pandemic could impact a country on on various levels and to just be fixated on on governance alone it's okay I mean we all expect that you know a good government would be able to tackle all sorts of crises but I think what's also more meaningful at least for for some of us in the social service sector is to see how the impacts of the pandemic has now trickled in many other areas of life and one area is on mental health of individuals as well as organizations and even the government themselves right so you see here from the screen that I've shared with you worries about the pandemic see more calls to mental health help lines and this is not just in Singapore it's also across other countries right so more people are calling in in order to speak to one over the line someone who's trained someone who's professional to share about perhaps their bouts of anxiety some physiological changes to them during this period and so on now of course there must be a reason why they're getting all this you know sudden spike in in society levels and those touch on that a little bit right so you could see here that you could have situations and families where even before coven 19 there are already incidences of abuse and you you can see how this abuse is going to get worse especially with more contact with the abuser in the homes right so again I'm not gonna get into this moral discussion like you know Oh be thankful you know that you have a nice home to be in during this pandemic and someone is else is suffering in the slums and so on and you have a happy family with kids running around and someone else is it's out there in a flag where you know they're abusers and and then they're gonna get up you so think about how this whole stay home thing is it's not working out for them yes we can always make that distinction people will always be more realistic about things and so on but I think the more objective thing to think about here is if we know that they are going to be such cases and there may be a rise in in family abuse victims then and what are we gonna do about it of course some of us are just you know commenters will be talk about it and so on but from from a services point of view how do we put in place interventions immediate interventions that allow us to you know maybe coordinate even with enforcement and so on to see how we could reach out to both I think he victims as well as the abuser so we we know for a fact that you know bullies for instance individuals who need help to not just the bullet or the wing tips in that sense and so this this was one area that came out about the expected rise in we abuse victims I think MSF it's very busy in this front right and and you see that domestic abuse need not only be physical it could be psychological right it could be sexual it could be emotional it could it could also be stress that people may have from mounting debts you know or the need to think about who's gonna pay the bills for the next 2-3 months and so on I'm getting but I'm gonna get to mine my key point here so just bear with me right so okay what how is this how does this all add up and also what what's causing all this it is a global pandemic it is a crisis some have compared this to to SARS and a lot of them compared based on again fidelity is number of cases how many days the schools were closed and so on sometimes the quantitative aspect of things are important I'm not denying that but if you look at the qualitative aspect of things I think you are able to uncover more and and that's what we try to do with some of our courses in in psychology we try to help students and prospective students to see the issue with a different lens right I've always I've always shared with my students whether it's in psychology sociology or international relations or security studies and sometimes they ask me so what's the hallmark of a good student in psychology what's the hallmark of a good student in insecurity Studies or political science I say in whatever you do it's not about your mastery of the concepts and the theories instead you think about it as pre and post meaning before you take on a course and before you have knowledge on on psychological principles and you encounter a particular issue in this case Co v19 how do you view it and after you have gathered some psychological knowledge you've gone through a course you are able to appreciate the concepts and the theories and you look at Kobe 19 again if you are able to see it differently from a psychological lens I think that's the true value of going for the cost it is not about getting is it's not about kneeling in and saying that yes conceptually I know everything does it help you to change your perspective about certain things are you able to see a situation differently and I think academically that's what we want to offer in our courses right it's to help individuals Park embark on a learning journey but also how how do you how do you measure the effectiveness of that learning journey how do you know if you have learned something is it based on you know rote learning memorization regurgitation getting good marks for the exams or is it applying is it forming a new wave is it appreciating how people may have different views and is it about being a little more open-minded to understand that the world is full of subjectivities right I think that's what we want to try to do so now in our programs now coming back to this I think the main reasons here and then and this is probably my take you may have read it from somewhere you may have your views I think this generally they're all very valid a pandemic like that but which may not be similar to say SAS because it seems to be worse now now if you think about his SAS was quite a while back so the gap between SAS and and covet 19 it's a good one 1517 years more and the very fact that it doesn't happen frequently means that the adjustment period for people is going to be really slow now that's I saw this as a as a whole now if you look at your situation okay I'm going to use myself an example and my mom for instance my sis and I had a hard time trying to help her to understand what's going on now part of the reason could be because my mom is not very educated and she's not like us so connected everywhere we go every day we thing and seeing it was a new number now and what's the rise in cases I don't think she's they're connected and engage and as such majority of people from our baby boomers grew that generation would take longer to try to adjust and enforcing them and said why you don't understand you don't understand it's not really gonna be very helpful for them in fact some level of patience could help now again I'm not gonna go into the discussion of all the naughty characters are who went sit on the floor passers deliberately define guidelines and so on my thing is empathize a little bit you know you gotta bring them in your arrest them because you're picking out the situation speak to them you know talk to them maybe help them to understand because I do think that boomers take a longer time to understand that the general population right so that's one it's about the lack of frequency of things like that happening so when you suddenly get a situation the mine is not exactly condition to change so quickly right and this is one problem with expectations or people and I do a lot of this with addiction and then clients or addictions right family members tend to be I understand why they're eager I understand why they're frustrated and so on and they say I'm not changing he went for counseling even for therapy why is he not changing and sometimes we need to politely tell them that hey you know you don't change overnight you don't change in the summer finger you don't make a change of decision yeah I want chicken burger and then now I want fish it's about an individual trying to adjust new ways of thinking new ways of feeling and new ways of doing right in psychology we talk about this very important relationship between behaviors ie actions the affections your feelings as well as your thoughts the cognition part of things you know and all these are related to to really understand why people do the things they do it's about trying to understand how they feel and think about things right so I always remember my neighbor she's still around probably downstairs don't meet her as much as oh it's last time maybe because she's just staying home or she's demented and she'll always see me and she'll ask me the same questions right how are you okay so pleasantries exchange and she'll ask me what are you doing I said I'm teaching oh and then she said why are you teaching and I say psychology and her eyes will light up and she says ah you can read my mind they cannot read your mind but I can predict your behavior I can roughly try to aggregate and explain why you're gonna do certain things you do or why you're done certain things you do so it's a myth to say that psychology is about mind-reading and fortune tellers and fortune-telling is it's not scientific and if you have a sixth sense and you can see goes good for you thank you you know but those are not exactly kind of you know the sensors that we couldn't look at right so I think with psychology here we can understand how covert 19's a stressor so as a social situation that's a stressor is creating very serious levels of uncertainty insecurity for individuals and this has translated into a type of fear you know very unprecedented fear it could be someone where encounters husband is three or four years older and not much recollection now he's 21 and boom well SAS is not really relevant to it because he has not been in it right so this new generation of a deeper level of fear is largely due to a sense of uncertainty as well as insecurity and if you think about it we're coming into maybe what the second one but it all started kind of in January there about if it stretches up to June July it's it's it's more than six months it's a bit chronic right so it's it's it's long term and people may not be able to to understand these fears and accordingly when you have irrational fears irrational worries certain types of behavior will follow but because this behavior behaviors are now guided by some irrational thoughts and irrational feelings that you have and so when you behave that way someone else looks at it and being seen as abnormal when it could be perfectly normal for you because it's respondent is in response to some thoughts and feelings that you have at the moment does not really characterize you know what am I trying to drive it I'm trying to say that these psychological impacts of such a condemning or a crisis for a matter it could even be war in some other countries where you know people get your traumatic incidences now these are very real just as much as workplace burnout is real and how we need to give attention to individuals who are recovering from workplace stress well here we're not talking about workplace stress although there could be a subset we're talking about stress from a pandemic so it's in crisis type of stress that individuals are are facing and not everyone has the same level of zillions but we have resilience but some of us may not know how to strengthen our resilience during this period right so if we don't then shouldn't there be more attention given to this area so that we can reach out to these individuals and perhaps offer them more platforms to be able to seek help them I do admit that there are many community services there are outlines even the ministries are getting some of their staff to be many some of these public hotlines where people can call and talk about anything but the aim is really to see how we can reach out because I think there is a recognition that there is a psychological implication of the pandemic but recently you may have also come across a debate that's going on because there was a ruling that psychological services were not considered as essential services so they're non-essential service I think the intention was ready to protect the practitioners as well as the patient because it's close contact nonetheless right the argument from the psychological fraternity or the counseling fraternity was that well you cannot deny the psychological impacts off of the pandemic please ensure that you make it an essential services because we don't know what's gonna happen if some of these individuals are denied treatment temporarily what's gonna happen to them at home and they may be even endangering your caregivers I mean granted these are all valid points and then we think about how this places psychological stress on your government but yes I know there are earning millions they're earning hundreds of thousands they've got the resources and so on now to be able to come up front and then to make such decisions okay do we convert the services back to essential what's going to happen does this threaten the security of others and so on this in itself you know the whole idea of decision making critical being able to stand by your policy decisions I guess these are these are also challenges that a group of people called the government would face and you know they did they do get into situations where they do face mental stress as well I think you would have read about the very elderly German minister who took his own life because he just couldn't deal with the challenges that the country is facing so that was quite sad to read and again we need to understand this from a point of view of how people are reacting to the crisis as a whole now having entered the context for you and helping you understand the psychological concerns how do we tackle this circuit breaker with say positivity right these are just some suggestions and I'm also sharing these suggestions in the sense of you know based on how certain services may offer themselves to to help individuals like that to improve their mental wellness right of course what works for an individual may be different some say I go for jokes I'm saying to skimboarding some say I do eating and watch Netflix and so on so it depends on how you take it now take full advantage of this time organize your time and set a certain schedule with activities set routines and and timetables that must be wondering why do you do that well think about normal life and when commit 19 is not in you you basically go through every day even though even though sometimes it gets mundane you go through everyday relatively successfully in terms of you know not freaking out and so on you do face challenges you do get stress you get tired but that's because almost every week you have a sort of routine and so you can adjust now with the pandemic and a crisis like that your routine is thrown upside down and you find it difficult to adjust right now certain things are beyond your control and then there's also uncertainty whether we will resume normal life or fifth of me well one thing you can do is is set up a bit of routines at home you know so that you are guided you've got something to look forward to conceptually it does help but give you a very simple example of how perception works if you got a bottle of 24 pills and you have to finish the course of antibiotics keep the last six fields red the first 18 pills white the chances of you reaching the red pills would be a lot higher because there is that milestone to reach right so if you don't have any routines you lace around I become day they become 9:00 in the long run it could have some troubles for you mentally so to speak find the ideal workspace if you are working from home a lot of people the men are my kids running around that neighbor's you know fighting these other guys the cars are holding and so on well see what works for you I understand that not everyone has the best and ideal situations at home right so maybe you could think of looking at how you could arrange that because when you are comfortable in your workspace you tend to be a bit more relaxed you can become okay some other points I thought the fourth point is very important and I just said a reminder of my phone and I say Oh Papa you know so calm and then after because we usually meet like once or once a week or once in two weeks and our favorite haka center john bursee sit there have some drinks have some food and then that's my interaction with him and this goes on for three four hours it's very consistent and suddenly now our routines are you know taken apart and I felt that while I am constantly engaging with people talking to myself on the screen sometimes as interaction if others what would be the older older folks go through I mean they have their own modes of entertainment but many of them have been detached from the community so stay in contact maybe helping them do a little bit of video calls getting them to use it more often you'll be surprised and they might tell you after a few rounds that hey I think this this works at least I can see you on the screen and so try to stay in contact with family and friends that's very helpful schedule rest breaks and and make them part of your day-to-day routine some people have too much rest time so depending on your situation you could find an interest or develop a new skill or I think a lot of people are doing that a lot have gone to cycling some have gone for you know jogging and so on some are doing a little bit of a slower brisk walk so they you know can be out there maybe don't have to wear a skid more people exercising some are doing online mood sessions with some are still keeping with your face online but quite a lot of things you can do online or with your phone for the better if you don't have that power PC and of course taking up a course and so on these are things that are very viable a lot of schools are now quickly adjusting to to online learning and then systems I in place yes you do hear about all the stories about security measures let me tell you on him I have used them from January until now I've got no one coming into the session showing me pornography pictures and telling me Anu please straight for us to see not here right but we had an encounter with that in the primary school so people get you know really alarmed and so on I mean I do understand if you understand them the theory behind security there's really no 100% guarantee of security all you need is a weakest link right so weakest link in one group but security measures are put in place so things like zoom can carry on you have a lot of other things like google meet microsoft team so these are all platforms and schools are I believe equipped by to ensure that the course runs smoothly and so on I'll share a little bit more if I can about how my online classes have gone and generally this there's a strong level of positive positivity from reg students okay so I think counseling understanding psychology these are some valuable skills that you may want to consider if you're intending to take up a course or learning something new or something of value and in fact even or to complement something that you do in your workplace a lot of my students come from everywhere I've got students from hey charm I've got students from finance I even have a guy who's in engineering and I say what are you doing here and this is that well I think what work is very stressful my boss is giving me more stress and I find it increasingly difficult you with my my stakeholders so I'm just trying to use this as a course to help me understand myself better and perhaps to improve my interpersonal relationships with other individuals I think that really captures the whole essence of trying to do to learn something and consoling and psychology yes we all want it to translate into some career options in the future sure but I think there are also more benefits I give her an example out of 10 students who meet me for the first time I asked them why do you do counseling or why'd you do psychology eight out of ten would tell me because I want to help someone because I want to go and be a counselor because I enjoy psychology I think it's interesting or you could be like my neighbor can you read my mind all those only two out of ten will tell me that I think psychology because I want to understand myself better we call them intrapersonal intelligence whereas the other would be more interpersonal but I think that interpersonal aspect is very important if you want to go and do conflict resolution you want to win in enhance your relationship others shouldn't you be able to understand yourself better first you wanna have better EQ isn't that doesn't that come from within right so I think some of these causes besides a career option have this to offer as well yeah so the program that we are gonna talk to you about and then you know if you have questions you can always direct them to to Kelvin we're looking at social psychology as well as counseling in this graduate diploma and you know just to give you some snippets off of each when we take when we talk about social psychology is very interesting right some people say is social psychology something like sociology but I can tell you that sociology and psychology are cousins and social psychology is a nice you know marrying of the to know a lot of people think that psychology is just you so I just want to study the individual he starts his feelings and his behavior very nice but if you tell me that the individual is someone who exists in a silo working on his own up in the mountain like a hermit not exactly right anywhere you go that individual needs to be understood in a context and this context refers to society this context refers to other people around you this context refers to the environment that is influencing your behavior and I think in social psychology we just really want to do just that we want to understand these social factors that influence an individual's behavior but because it's not enough to say that your behavior stems from your genetic disposition your behavior stems from your heritage three aspects and to adjust you it's only your minds working then that results in you behaving that way studies have shown the behavior is for instance have come on board and say that you know when you come into this world your mind is a blank slate and all behaviors are learned we learn these behaviors through the interaction with our environment right so it's impossible to discount the social aspects of how it influences our behavior right so for example in the course of social psychology what you see here is a list of topics that we do in that particular module perspectives of social psychology wonderful module we do it over a couple over weekend students I engage there's so much room of for them to share their views and and overall they they learn the key concepts in the body and of course they do their assignments they apply it and some still come back to me and say that here you know what I've learned in the Graduate Diploma was so valuable then when I go on to do something else or when I bring it back to work it was easy for me to apply and and then you know better understand situations that I face right so for example a question you know we we all have anger and why do some of us get aggressive and some of us don't it's always interesting and people would like to focus on those people who are aggressive it's like it's like in criminology right something else that I teach we are fixing that we're trying to find out why people commit crimes what are the reasons so fascinating it's so nice why don't you also ask the other simple questions why do people not commit crimes no one really asked them if you try to understand why people not commit crime it gives you an insight into why someone would commit crimes right so pretty much in social psychology we try to give students a critical perspective of things not just feeling them if concept concept consequences now when Lundy's regurgitate go for the exam do your best free heart God will do the rest it doesn't work that way it's it's about really trying to be immersed in the course and seeing how you can build on is you know what I call a a neck for thinking differently and I think some of our courses here allows you to develop that a little bit of counseling here some of you are very interested in this field you you know you probably see counseling as something that's engaging its value-adding it's something that's Noble and and you can help individuals who are in trouble lives and I I do agree with that and here we try to provide an introduction of some counseling types of course if you tell me you want to get into a greater specialization of counseling we do have a program in partnership with roehampton university from the UK currently we've just started one bench and we have you know students who took it and I'm taking one module with them and it's quite an interesting journey here so far they're getting hands-on counseling we're trying to assess them whether they're ready to do the counseling and once they're done with that first two initial modules they are their own and they'll be put on placements and so on it's a very robust program and this is something that you can consider after your your graduate diploma and I think Calvin and Hema would be in good stead to answer your questions on them sometimes of counseling techniques you've got direct counseling techniques where the the the therapist is largely in charge it's very directive towards the client in helping the client get out of his or her predicament or mess or confusion or distress if and if you like in non-directive approaches for example person centered therapy by this guy called Carl Rogers they prefer to rather they believe that individuals have that ability to get out of their situations on your own and to be you know self of us to be fully functioning individuals so the therapist role then is to facilitate and kind and and guide the client to discover their own solutions to their problems you may be thinking a crazy oh I give money and then you're supposed to counsel me now i console myself some people think of it that way but if you understand the the theories and the rationale behind person-centered therapy the counsellor is that the therapist is still in a way in charge but more more of trying to use an approach where it's it's more bottom up rather than top down and and once an individual is able to discover some solutions to their own problem of course with the help and kindness of a terror I tell you it what wonders because after the therapy session when they face other challenges in life whatever they learn in the counseling session is going to be very helpful for them in devising their own solutions in being resilient for example I think that's what we want to try to achieve in counseling and of course you have cooperative counseling techniques where it's a little bit of both so this is just some initial snip snippets you know if you are very interested in this I think we've got a good set of counseling programs lined up for you now just a little bit more about my take on on on things critical factors okay so we are still on the counseling part so how we want to avoid personal judgment clients and they sometimes come in they present you know very challenging life circumstances sometimes these challenges you look at here you get a shot I never thought these kind of challenges existed and if you don't experience that they are reality are you able to counsel them I think that's the question that we want to us of course from a conceptual point of view yes but I've always maintained to my students that counseling in books is not the same as counseling in theory it's quite similar to policing policing in books it's not the same of police it's not the same as policing in practice you can get a you know for for for law you can get a four person centered therapy and then practically when you face the client I think that's where the adjustment go it's just like a policeman right you go and see a situation you suppose whereas okay hey hold on when I take out my manual according to chapter the father would have run off you know you may be very good but in practice what you do so in counseling when you face the client and you deal with your challenges you realize that your biases your views your thoughts all these things have to be suspended because if you're doing it might even bring the client more harm right so we we do a lot of coaching in that India area trying to help students understand what counseling is really about what it it forms active listening and so on yeah so my little bit of my tape just to round up this part of things and I'm so glad that you know I'm looking at a participant rate those who came in y'all have not left I really appreciate you bringing in here spending one hour of your Sunday evening now I think individuals have to start normalizing anxiety it's it's perfectly fine to be anxious but I do understand that too much anxiety to a point where fear becomes irrational it's not entirely healthy and some of them may go on to need professional help as you would have seen based on reactions of some individuals who you know in a way lost it when we seem normalizing xiety we also need to recognize that our anxiety is being shared by others there are others who are also essential Assessors when we are able to accept that there's this level of anxiety out there I think it's easier for us to cope because then it doesn't become something that's abnormal or unique or peculiar to us in fact everyone else have that level of anxiety and we should try to understand one another right so normalizing something could sometimes be beneficial go easy on yourself I do understand you know I'm very empathetic I do understand that people have challenges that bills to pay job is uncertain some have lost their jobs and so on go easy on yourself try to seek help look out for community resources try to see you know if there are there people out there who may direct you to these resources some individuals may be too shy to go look for help and so on if at this point in time you have to settle for some something lesser go will be easy on yourself because there's really no point in being overly hard on yourself it can affect your mental health further ok again my disclaimer I'm not saying that this is easy it's always easy to say difficult to do and so I do understand that some individuals could find this situation a lot more challenging than than others kalla consoling crisis online you know something to their faith some look for help elsewhere I think I mean the sense of connection is very important because suddenly we feel disconnected from a lot of things and and this this whole stay home thing won't be surprised for some individuals is like the number of hours at home is probably equivalent to say maybe six months when they are working because some of us are just mainly out most of the time and we come back simply to present to our basic drawers above all you know mental health there's this mind-body connection some of you have read it if you're interested read up health psychology look up this guy called George Engle yin GTL 1977 George Engle talks about a biopsychosocial model of health in which he explains that health is not only physical health is also psychological health is also social and you see how these three domains interact with one another to give us this thing called wellness if you talk about well-being there's a lot more than just physical psychological and social well-being that's career well-being best you know you know career well-being there's community well-being with how integrated you are with your community so I think health is a broad range of things and you know apart from psychological health we we should also you know be mindful about our physical health and then we we do have that capability to perhaps increase our mental resilience on our problems now I just wanted to share a little bit so this is you can find more information about Aventis India courses right example then on social psychology and counseling as well as our master's program so it that's the website you know when Disney's are some pictures of of past students in our faculty who have taken the course and well many of them well you think all of them you'll see are working adults that come with them with this different experience and so on so I think the the learning curve as well as the learning opportunities for fellow classmates it's it's it's very it's rich it's not me we don't just have people from one particular industries right I just feel that the the environment is it's very healthy and very conducive for learning now of course here we have some information Kelvin is still in in the chat so I'm gonna pass it over to him very soon in the event that you have to run and you you need more information that's kelvins email Kelvin at Aventis global calm and that's his contact number and you're also able to download our brochures from the website that's given I'm just gonna leave this here for a while we have a group chat here so if you have any questions for us please let us know you you can type it out okay now if you find that you have to go and do something else the details that you see on your screen will be available and I think Kelvin who is also working from home will be on hand to respond to all your questions above all thank you for listening to me and yeah thank you okay over to some questions if you have for Kelvin and I um queen meow I'll take it offline with you Oh dropping email regarding um the cause details about that and I will pick that offline you have any questions for our new hmm yep so the cost fee subsidy since regarding oh good thing thank you for all the things it's very nice you're most welcome I've got a question here from Jessica oh how would we explain more to the younger generation so I'm thinking it as how do we explain the copy 19 situation to them Oh are you referring to - psychology as a whole yeah Thank You haps ah - good to see that you're on board as in do we hire if Jessica you referring to the explanation okay - Cove in nineteen year younger generation I I suppose you're referring to the kids the teenagers and children for example yeah I've got my nephew his 7 just went into premier one in January having a ball of time I mean back everyday excited they suddenly we tell him a you don't go to school I'm friendly so confused and he didn't understand everything that's that's quinion it's very hard to absorb he see people reading news he's not understanding I think you could explain to them slowly in terms of trying to explain not the very technical bits of things maybe explain to them that currently there's this health problem that's going on and it's not safe for people to go I think they do understand some of these basic things but also getting them to adjust to the fact that you know they may be they may not be able to have the kind of close contact with with others right and then they need to be sticking close with their families for the time being and then that everybody else is trying to also adjust I think with cases you can see me struggling a little bit with case typically I do admit it's a good question for Jessica it's probably hotter some teenagers are still quite ignorant of the issue they're still meeting up with people have been close contact I think that's where the education bill really needs to come in for this group of people unfortunately a lot of people also very sensitive if you if you cannot tell them what to do yeah it's hard to get true I do understand that the rebels in the Millennials sometimes they have you know very I mean how can we use and I know we say both choppa and and I think this is more serious if you look at the u.s. situation now we've got a bunch of Trump supporters who are diehard Republicans coming out in society to protest against staying home and they say you know look what you guys are up to there's no pandemic I think they're the real rebels but good thank you for your questions I okay yes any tips to share about cabin fever yes I think cabin fever it's a real thing we may not be seeing it now this is what today is the self so we're into a 13 day next Monday tomorrow will be two weeks probably by third weekend and for free you see some people getting very restless now I think here's the thing that many of us may be may not be appreciating we still can go out of the house and we still could be using some area within the vicinity although we're not supposed to loiter I think getting out of the house every day based on the schedule I see a lot of elderly doing it one hour in the morning one hour in the evening I think that helps because if you're just gonna stay cooped up I do the Cristina's point that cabin fever may become a serious problem and then some people may develop complications here question from Sam how can we help the older senior citizen cook when they require to stay at home and change the entire routine like what Christine shed on cabin fever yes I think I'll some older people those WOM a lot more outs we got two groups I want like to stay at home and and at TV and so on and they may have tightness and and leg pain and so on and so far so we try to encourage them to be out for exercise sessions and so on those who require to stay at home more and their whole entire routine of not being in the community and so on is out of action these are the individuals that are going to struggle a lot more right I think from an organizational point of view some of these elderly affiliated organizations or even places you know where typically the whole volunteer service and they provide activities for elderly I am not sure how they're gonna see the opportunities to engage elderly online this could be a challenge because not many of them may have their own devices if you don't know how to do some of this but I think that this really could be some engagement with getting the elderly people online for for some services or activities but it's going to be harder it's probably you know one you really have conceptualizing maybe some organizations are doing it ritual this should still be out although it's going to be difficult they can congregate and so on so they may feel that that sense of loneliness right so I think this point for the questions from Sam and Jessica and us reflect that Moyes is neither I think organizations have to step into device perhaps some activities if if the seniors are required to stay at home to each them so that they some level of connectedness and they don't feel too too out of it can you repeat the title or no Erica is not a book by George Engle but it's a it's a George Engle 1977 it's a bio psycho social model of health you can easily google this up he gives you a think on how health should be approached and and studied so that's something that we do yeah gamers they're pretty happy with being at home so they already have their own cabin even before Coby 19 well the deep able to help meet career change and three would love to work in hospitality yes I I mean if I'm going to if I'm going to or if we are going to see that that there is a predicted rise in the number of people who so seeking help or more organizations coming on board with which services today I even see how some services are going online I'm very very sure that in health care hospital even in community health or healthcare settings definitely there would be a demand for counselors and psychologists like so yes I think a mid-career changes definitely viable creamy war casualties yes those guys who have post-traumatic stress disorder by they'll be long-term effects from the pandemic I think even can give us family members who have lost their loved ones to do you know if you look at and Italy and Spain you know they don't even allow family members to come into contact not even during a time where the bodies were put and they couldn't even come in contact with the ash and so imagine that kind of heartbreak that is for for the families and I think yeah definitely needs to be counseling services from them and probably in the area of grief to help them to manage the grief that they are facing with the loss of a family member and it's gonna be an uphill task but probably direct them to a level of acceptance on the situation it's not going to be easy so that's Christina's point on counseling services for the effects on those who have passed on because of the virus oh yes Jay mr. Jadis parents to think about Homebase plea I like that them and learning for little ones while working from home children get restless very easily yeah because they can run around to release the energy okay yeah I think I think it's how comfortable people are about letting their kids you know I still my nephew who's 7 still goes down and and I think he knows every single pillow wall around a white day I see how come he's here every day I run run from one end to the block I come back and he just you're right they just wanted to release the energy and then the fact that grandparents now can't be close context or the stresses upon good thankful for that point hospitals for bachelor degree okay so Erica I'll leave this to the academia the coming and team to to advise you on on the requirements there okay what a session any more comments Calvin what do you think right anyone has any other thing you've answered most of them so anyways I thank you very much for the time no problem thank you very much and everyone thank you very much for your time as well so if anyone has any questions my name is um my name in numbers on the screen website as well so I don't know for sure give me a coin Simon drop me or whatever if you want more details or program so any once again thank you very much okay thank you thank you very much okay I'll in this session yeah sure thank you ,True,False,True,False

ado let me hand over to elena today elena over to you thank you very much christina really nice of you to kick start this important event and i'll welcome everyone disability is high on the diversity agenda and um it's for many companies health is one of the highest causes of disability in the world today and it causes companies billions of losses each year due to employee absenteeism lack of productivity and innovation the world health organization estimates that 10 of the global population suffers from some form of mental illness which means it's one of four of us is affected unfortunately stigma and taboo surrounds in mental health making it a poorly understood topic across the world and asia is not an exception fear and traditional beliefs prevail preventing many that are impacted by mental health issues from reaching out and receiving help that they need not seeing the apparent demand and not knowing how best to approach the sensitive subject unfortunately few companies today are addressing this critical aspect of employee well-being in their organization so to get us started and to set up the scene i would like to ask professor funk to share with us the landscape of the mental uh health sector in singapore and some of the common mental health conditions but particularly those that are increased over the recent years thank you elena i hope everyone can hear me um and i my slides are up okay i'm just gonna start off give us some background to what's happening and perhaps uh then we could leverage uh and speak on mental health and mental illness now the impact of this pandemic on mental health firstly has caused a lot of concerns because there's ex expression of the increased prevalence of illnesses and problems associated with economic recession job loss even family violence and abusive behaviors in lockdowns where people are kept at home at the same time there's concern that people because of that isolation may uh if they were emotionally unstable resorts to three sides this actually is data that uh we have in our institute looking at patients that we take care for at this point i don't think suicides are on the rise but suddenly we are monitoring the numbers and that's of concern at the same time uh the very providers of healthcare that are looking after our population are under tremendous amount of stress because this is a new virus we do not know how it works and what are the implications on life in general and there are risks and fears that people have so in fact in the study between singapore and india we compared the groups interestingly in india um you know depression and anxiety is slightly higher than uh in singapore where post-traumatic stress disorder was significant and i know it's a busy slide just just take my word for it it's quite significant and it's it's of concern uh certainly for us because workers if they are not able to manage themselves and uh suffering from some degree of stress would not be able to function and and truly in this study they actually showed that there's a higher um complaints of things like headaches throat pain apart from the the usual emotional aspects of insomnia tightness and lethargy and even anxiety alongside this process is what's happening in the world uh i had a quick scan of the literature this is a couple of studies one is in china where it looked at people returning to work well 10.8 percent of respondents suffered from ptsd or post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to work but returning to work did not actually cause an increase in psychiatric symptoms that means illness itself or mental illness didn't arise i'll talk to this a little bit later more executives are practicing hand hygiene and more workers avoided sharing utensils which is a good thing infection control measures were in place in fact another study this one looked at what's the real stress behind all of this it's actually financial stress this is the primary mediator for emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes so these are important points so what has happened since the pandemic the old normal this is what's happening in our hospitals number of admissions the hospital has been moderated the outpatient clinics the specialist uh outpatient clinics people were not coming forward as much emergencies were coming down because there was fear in the air this was in healthcare outside of healthcare i mean what our old normal was really meeting up and and um getting together in meetings and having collaborative face-to-face meetings had to change in fact digitalization working from home home-based learning for children and telly everything i mean we're having a webinar right which we would have been unheard of but we have a meeting in a room with lots of people it's changed it's changed the way we provided healthcare it's changed the way we've worked in our offices and and zoom is very well known i've used zoom so many times in the last i'm kind of over zoomed actually and it's a it's it's not a good thing so what is the mental health approach we have to take in this context first i want to talk a little bit about mental health because it's an area that is quite important and sometimes poorly understood now in the population and providers like myself as doctors and clinicians we are one end of what i call a pyramid the other are patients people who already have mental illnesses now mental health affects the general population what is mental health mental health is not merely an absence of illness it's actually a very overarching well-being concern now very often we are well we'd like to think that majority of us don't have much stress but some of us do and when stress increases we start to have this stress and we start to have problems these are mental health related issues on the other hand mental illness is slightly different this is a biological problem it's not a reaction to stress this very often have genetic um and and brain related abnormalities and they have to be treated by professionals that is about i think christina said or is it elena who said one and four i think in singapore the data is about less than one in one in five but um but it depends on where you do the prevalence studies and of course in mental illness there's mild illness and moderate illness and severe illness here in the institute of mental health we deal with mostly the moderate to severe illness so the percentage is much lower now what this slide actually shows is that there is you can have mental illness and you can have mental health issues they are not necessarily on the same dimension but they're in the same pyramid and severe mental health problems doesn't necessarily translate into mental illness the other piece of course is you can have a mental illness and be still in good mental health that means you are happy with your life your illness is under control very much like someone with diabetes or hypertension you're on treatment you're fine so it's important to understand the role of stress in this this is just a singapore mental health study looking at figures so one in seven is a lot lower than the one in four but that's our local data in singapore now what can we do what are the kind of services that are needed for our patients people with mental illness i think now because of infection control measures we need technology to enable the management uh and for um in the hospitals i think trying to manage trauma is important because post-traumatic stress disorder is very much associated with what's going on in and everyone's scared and frightened and fearful um and then of course there is the possible mental illnesses that may result from covet what we know of covet 19 is that we think it's a respiratory disorder actually it's an autoimmune it's a immune response disorder that causes an inflammatory process that can occur in the brain as well you're not sure on the mental health side of things there is need to provide firstly some guidance on health and how to seek help i think some of the other speakers on the panel will speak more on this but i just you know broadly say there needs to be both live support which is synchronous and asynchronous information needs to be available for the public so they know where to get help and what to do when they are in distress at the same time in the longer term i think there is importance to first train mental health professionals and even general health professionals to manage mental illnesses in general and reduce the stigma for the population at large psychological first aid and mental health literacy to understand mental health concerns do not necessarily translate the mental illness and what are mental illnesses in the first place to really manage issues like anxiety and depression as a whole in the workplace most of the issues are not around mental illness it is around mental health how do you manage stress because now there's a lot of changes in work processes working from home economic recession job loss social distancing and isolation is not a good thing if you don't meet your co-workers how would you feel as a team so you need to be able to manage emotions have coping strategies social support and social linkages within the workplace that's important how can you do that can you respect the safety dignity and rights of individuals but adapt and consider cultural aspects particularly in this part of the world be aware of infection control how to look after yourself and when to seek help when that is needed i went a little fast because i want to complete within the 10 minutes and i'm kind of done uh as an introduction to how we can support the workforce thank you very much i'm gonna stop the sharing thank you very much professor thank you um so what i'm recollecting is that um public and organizational education um has created an awareness around mental health and uh we can indeed uh go and find lots of information online and that's good because more understanding will facilitate our empathy and open-mindedness furthermore compassionate and compassionate communication could help those affected by mental health and bring them closer to those that can help so with that i'm turning to leanne a question to you are you seeing more people seeking help for mental health conditions and especially during circuit breaker how have the npos and charities been supporting its clients and beneficiaries uh especially during this period over to you hello everybody good afternoon i'm leanne from singapore association for mental health uh i'm happy to be with you here today to share a little bit uh on what we observe on the ground as a social service uh provider uh for mental health services um during this uh whole period of covic and circuit breaker we like many corporates um from the social service side actually do seek a lot of happenings in that sense to people uh and about their everyday uh daily life and their work life uh the experience they go mental health issues that come up as a result um simple association for mental health actually uh we have 10 services we started operation in 1968 and we have always been focusing on promoting mental wellness for all and our services range from community engagement education raising awareness about mental health issues to providing creative services to help people to manage their anxiety promote mental wellness and more importantly we also have rehabilitation services where we support people in recovery of mental illness so uh just uh to contextualize um some of the things that um daniel had shared um we all know that from the last 2016 survey one in seven um singaporean here would actually experience a mental health condition in their lifetime and um from a psychosocial perspective um we look at mental health as a continuum and um daniel has said that um being uh men having a mental illness does not necessarily mean that people have poor mental health and actually uh not having a mental illness does not also mean that we have uh good mental well-being so uh when we look at it uh from uh continuum uh at different point we could be experiencing a different kind of um feelings and emotional well-being on the green side on the healthy side we could be happy uh generally very satisfied with life and um meeting our aspiration and emotionally more balanced but sometimes when trouble takes place or stresses come in we could be in the yellow and the amber zone where we actually um our life can be a bit disturbed and there's more anxiety and we may not sleep well uh i'm sure you you can actually some of you may identify may be able to identify some of the symptoms that come about and uh it really depends on our coping strategies and uh how can we build our own resilience towards uh managing ourselves back to the green state yeah and if if um we move along and we don't take care of ourselves well and um do not know where are the resources to support us uh we can go into the raid state where we actually can become sick physically we can have very destructive lifestyle we cannot be functioning very well in our activity of daily living so that is a time of concern so uh in in this whole continuum um there are scales for us to actually uh look at where we are and often time um from our social service experience um we we we don't have a medical treatment so we we do a lot of psychosocial intervention uh to support people uh so this this are some of the ways we we help people understand um that um we need to take care of our mental well-being right um during this whole period um before we actually went into circuit breaker um we are already in dos corn orange in late february and um all the social service agencies uh in fact uh have to come up with our business continuity plan and uh we were already planning and uh to go into split team uh and in fact for singapore association for mental health we started uh going on trial speed team just before um circuit breaker kicks in on 7th of uh april and what happened was um it although we have plans we have preparation uh we had a lot of meetings discussion and preparation with staff uh actually we were quite affected by this uh circuit breaker the first phase because um the instruction is all services have to close except for um very very frontline services like uh residential homes so out of our tent service we only have one service that can fully remain open 24 7. that is our group home in bukit batu where we run a residential service for people in recovery so all the other nice services we have to immediately plan how to provide continually provide our service to our beneficiaries and community through remote means so it was very challenging for us because um we do not have all the hardware support at those in the initial juncture and uh when we acquire the hardware we may we do not have all the apps and software and it took us a while to get out the subscription of all this zoom and way backs up so and what happened was uh the instruction was very clear that due to the protective measure and uh uh safe distancing measures uh there's no way we could see clients and uh we have to actually uh refer services to uh other frontline that are allowed to or considered um white listed agencies uh that can actually visit cases so it was very tough and um what what happened was uh subsequently there was a reverse i would say not maybe not a reverse decision but uh moh has taken into consideration the feedback and um there was a um a new um advisory that allowed with exemption uh some exemption to some services so we managed to uh get some exemption and some of our services are listed as whitelisted agency and uh we could provide minimum on on-site support to our service recipient so our counseling services we could actually let some of our staff with minimum staffing go back to the center and we are able to see some high risk cases during those period yeah so during clear spirit uh even as we as a service provider try to adapt and change to using virtual means to provide consultations as well as sessions and activities with our service recipients um not all our service user could actually benefit from the remote services mainly we take it for granted that uh while we are ready you know people at the other end should be able to actually um enjoy what they usually enjoy during the on-site support uh but many of our clients actually do not have the hardware and they can't afford to do subscription um so we actually also face that challenge with with our clients who we want to support and also there are clients and beneficiaries who prefer not to do all this virtual um link up with us because their home environment is not suitable they are home condition and home buyer environment is not super and some of them are not used to this kind of arrangements where they felt that their privacy can be compromised especially if they have to do it in their house and there's not enough space and private space for them to do so so um so there is quite a lot of adjustment that we have to do um so we resort a lot to telephonic support and declines right okay just just a bit on what is seen on the ground which actually could be mirrored in in the survey national survey that uh carried out um one of the market survey company actually uh can show their survey results uh and i think it was published in the press and that uh actually a quarter one in four uh respondents actually expressed their that they are their mental health is not so good and uh one of our our partners uh silver ribbon they also carried out a survey of 500 over respondents and anxiety and mood issues also surface as a concern um uh i think everybody is also aware there's this national care hotline that was um launched uh on 10th of um april uh so shortly after the launch uh towards the end of the month uh in early may they have released this report to show that uh actually within a short span of time there is 6600 calls and out of this 6600 calls 40 percent actually uh need more support and uh these calls are diverted to uh social service agencies and other um community support agencies that provide more dedicated support to people with mental health worries and concerns um scss also have a chat board called bell the chat and they also see an increase during this period circuit breaker period of people assessing the web to to actually ask questions and seek help so i think it is also consistent that mutually people raise concern and have said that they are stressed and anxious and they need emotional support just coming back to our own uh singapore association for mental health our own service uh our counseling service has a toll-free helpline where our counselors um pick up calls from anybody in the community during this period between april to june uh compared to the same period in 2019 we have a 50 percent increase in callers and uh among the the callers that uh new callers uh we actually see almost 40 of um callers in the age band of 21 to 40 years old um this is pretty telling about the situation on the ground in that this would be the group of people who possibly are working adults and uh because of having to work from home uh because of the movement restriction um they have actually suffered more mental health concerns and um what surface is also 25 about 25 of them actually express or they are depressed they have an anxiety and mood issues uh very stressed during this period um and also they have also raised issues about relationship for example uh one of the caller actually said that during this period is very stressful and she wants to break up with her boyfriend and also family issues came up we have callers who call that they they um having a lot of conflict because of everybody being at home uh and um they are also those callers who are worried about their family members or friends who are expressing depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation and um the callers who are caregivers caregivers who are during this period is very stressed because um they are unable to send their children to child care nor are they able to send their seniors to day care centers for their rehab so it's elena i need to a little bit cut you um someone asked is there a phone number that you could share where um you know where people can call and probably we need another 20 seconds to close your section sure all right i will uh show some numbers and resources at the last slide okay so so i i think we are all aware that we all play uh wear many hats and now we are at the same time uh stressed with having to adapt to the challenges and move towards a a more um adaptive new normal uh so i'm just sharing i have two more slides just sharing some resources for employees uh and as well as for employers um tafette has some some guidelines on how we can actually uh be more mindful of our mental health concerns and issues and support employees throughout this period and there's also a workplace well-being work group comprising national bodies as well as uh corporates and uh jeffrey myset is also one of the company who is a part of this work group they have come up with an e-guide on managing the organizations and working with employees throughout this period smh has also partnered a corporate chancellor and we come up with a infographic and we have posted in our social media uh to share with people how actually this whole period of stress actually actually is a very good learning experience and we can turn it to very positive development for our own um mental well-being and we can become more resilient over time and um my last like is really to show um this is not exhaustive but these are some of the possible places where you can contact or your employee can contact uh if they need support yeah thank you very much it's really it's really pleasant to hear that many progressive organizations took the chance of corvette which is unfortunate chance yes uh they showed their resilience and uh showed a really good ways to advocate for those uh who need help and dispelling of the of their um issues around the topic and you've mentioned jeffrey which brings me amazingly well to uh to our next speaker jeffrey i know that you devote yourself patiently to supporting this big course and i know that you have a daytime job and uh sort of a another job of working for with the charity mindset that jardine set up please share with us how you've been supporting the mental health community and what what advices can you give to smes great uh can you hear me and hopefully you can be able to see my screen as well okay now not yet not yet i'm not sure why it's not coming through uh but it's okay let me try and see if i can share that once again there you go and is that coming true yes okay great thank you very much for your time and for inviting um mindset and myself to this i think you've heard from uh from daniel and from lian maybe just a little bit of background on mindset before i jump to the last couple of slides so mindset is the charity that the judy madison group has established about nine years ago and you're probably wondering why mental health when we started in 2011 this was a totally un interesting underserved area you would find a lot of charities focus on health on physical health on disabilities on children on education but nobody wanted to talk about mental wellness or mental health because it was a very taboo area to be a part of but not talking about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and so one of the things that group has started out over the last nine ten years is to be able to try and raise awareness about mental health mental wellness and to be able to talk about it for those of you who are not familiar with mindset well these are the constituent businesses of the group in singapore and i'm sure some of them would be quite familiar with you you know from the genki sushis to the starbucks the cold storage hong kong land and mandarin oriental this is all part of the group that is behind mindset in the jardins group itself we've been recognized for our efforts over the years and we've been encouraged by this what's our focus our focus really is trying to do good and to be able to recognize that this is a journey we don't do it alone obviously we do it with our partners and co-collaborators um two of them are with me today dr daniel fong of course and and lee yen from samh and you'll find that there has been a growing awareness and a environment where more people are aware of this and are willing to come alongside and be a part of it so we don't do this alone we do this with all our social service agency partners and if you think about mindset as an organization it's actually only made up of two full-time employees everyone else who is involved in this effort is actually a volunteer or has got a daytime job doing something else like myself um how do we do this we do this by way of what we call jardine ambassadors so every year we've got 40 individuals who come alongside spend two years of their life to be a part of this venture and to be able to walk alongside with the activities that they have what are the activities awareness outreach getting people back into the workforce and this is important because part of this inclusiveness is to be able to get and accept people who may be suffering from mental health issues to be accepted within the workplace and that i think just adds to this whole thing about how do we have an inclusive community as a whole social enterprise and fundraising um again this chart shows apart from the numbers that have been contributed to our effort are the other partners you know from digital mindset to singapore association mental health institute of mental health i just wanted to highlight two particular flagship projects that we have launched in the last nine years the first is with the singapore citizen mental health called mindset learning hub happens about raising the importance of the workplace environment and how if you're a mental health person in recovery how important it is to be in a work environment because that gives you a sense of attachment belonging to be part of a local community and it adds towards your self-worth in terms of building that environment for for persons in recovery the other one which we embarked on last year is kind of interesting uh it's with touch community services and this focus is on pathological gaming but it also talks about addiction to the internet and all things internet and it's kind of interesting because if you think about the last couple of months um i for one have been totally addicted to the internet i i am walking through that addiction right now and participating on a daily basis whether it's a webex or a zoom or some form of video conference that i'm on um and and i think this is going to be in my in our view a growing area that we'll have to address as we go back into that new normal of how to be able to regulate between the internet virtual world and the real physical world itself um i i think it would be an interesting challenge for us as we make that transition this is the one chart that i i think if you forget about all the other charts that i've talked about hopefully it will stay with you and what i would call the four is um as employers i i think it's important for us to be able to set the tone of awareness if you are an employee you would not think twice about saying physical safety in the workplace is important and you need to be able to have a place where your employees come in and will not leave injured because you have got poor processes but i think the fundamental shift needs to be not just a physical safe workplace but also a supportive workplace that accepts and supports good mental health practices and mental wellness and and as lien and says there's a group of employers have come together in the last couple of years called work well uh there is a e-guide that you know helps with steps is how you can be able to do this at the workplace and again one thing that i like to highlight is that it is not as daunting as it looks to be able to take that first step because i i think today we do have that support structure that's out there and and well this is one the second a that i would like to highlight is what i call acceptance because when you talk about mental health issues oftentimes people tend to light up their eyes when you talk to somebody about mental health challenge that you have but it's not lighting up to help it's lighting up to step away because immediately you have got that stigma that comes around and say oh maybe you're not quite that okay and if you're not quite that okay maybe i should not be associating with you or if i leave a label with you then i look at you in a very different perspective altogether and i think in hopefully over the last uh a couple of months of this corporate pandemic you know it's been able to show that none of us are immune from the stresses and none of us are immune from some of this mental health challenges that we may have whether it's stress at work for working from home over the last couple of months on not being able to separate our personal lives from our work lives um activities i think it's important as employers in the employment and environment to be able to talk about this to promote this and to be able to address uh stress management um i like to particularly highlight self-care here and i put down there especially for leaders why do i say that because oftentimes as managers and leaders in the work environment we don't tend to take a like a superhero persona and say of course i can manage this of course i can deal with this but i think it's also important for us as leaders of the groups that we manage in the workplace to recognize that we've had to first take care of ourselves before we can take off somebody else and and it reminds me that you know not that long ago we used to have this activity called flying on an airplane if you recall that before kovit came around and and and one of the things that they'll tell you is that you know if we have a decompression and the air mass were to fall down help yourself first as the adult before you can be able to help your children or somebody else and i think that's a good reminder that we have to take care of our own mental health wealth being as well and and then finally the last a would be assistance i i think that as it's not just the social service agencies have recognized the government has recognized and so there is formal support mechanisms that's out there that we as in the work environment can be able to point out colleagues and team members too lien has shared some of that mind line is one that was just introduced not that long ago by the government and i think they are certainly tools and help that's available so from from that perspective i would just encourage everybody to think about the workplace in in this perspective and with this mindset of the four ways of awareness of acceptance of activities and of assistance uh yeah so those are the points that i i wanted to highlight and uh happy to take any questions thank oh you thank you jeffrey you can mute yourself um really very interesting i didn't realize we have so many things in common like addiction to internet and um so as a small question small follower question for you that came so um for a while we have been imagining what technologies could do for our future and today we are bombarded with information and a new term that we are hearing is digizofrenia and it's said to be linked very heavily with mental health could you comment on uh probably the biggest influencer of the modern day mental health issues i i think it's a it's a question of trying to segregate work life balance and and daniel and bm can be able to talk to that technology is supposed to serve us and to be able to give us a lot more time to serve our own personal needs i think there's been a conflating and the bleeding of our personal lives in our work life and the technology that's supposed to help us i think is also starting if i can use that a strong word starting to hurt us and harm us and i think the only way that we should respond to it is to respond with a a a discipline as it were in terms of trying to define time that we would have for ourselves as opposed to things just circle on i don't have a commute now from the office from the home to the office which used to be about 15 minutes where i could have a down time listen to music and clear my head whether it's going to the office or coming back now my commute is from my bedroom to my study which is less than 30 seconds so how do i replace that to be able to get myself re-centered i i think it's important so those are some of my thoughts lovely thank you and thank you for highlighting the importance of creating environment and organization that promotes awareness of mental health and again that again brings very well to um rebecca and before i ask you a question can i just remind everyone to please uh continue populating q and a's uh we will try to address them as after after rebecca spoke and rebecca turning to you so if you could share how your company pwc has helped employees to navigate through this unprecedented times in fact i think the word unprecedent has been reported by google as the most uh searched word for the last half a year thanks elena um just checking so can you see my can here can see okay perfect i just put it on the screen okay great so um i was given the room of two slides so i've tried to pack it all into two but so forgive me um so i think just to understand how companies in general but pwc specifically have dealt with what's going on in the last six months um it was usual to look at kind of our well-being journey over the last year or so and where we were pre-covered um because that's also when we look at this it's important to look at you know where we're going to be when we emerge out of this as well so um i think for us really first of all looking at you know what is the state of mental health in the workplace in singapore the the business case is very well established for investing in employee mental health um in singapore the ncss study showed 5.6 times return on investment for investing in employment health in the workplace so but i think that's something that's not really been internalized necessarily by the business community here um as much as it could be um the message that it's not just a nice thing to do it actually makes business sense um so when we talk about mental health in the workplace um you know the 2019 study in singapore showed 92 of the workforce in singapore are stressed um but more importantly 12 percent said that they had an unmanageable level of stress so there's about risk of burnout and and this 92 is above the oecd average so in general not so singapore workforce were more stressed before you came in jacob than than the average and so that's kind of the backdrop that you start on but um as we were saying it's not just there's kind of the mental health um whether you have distress or a problem but there's also the clinical side so with one in seven people experiencing a clinical mental health condition uh not just distress during their lifetime and actually most most studies show it's about three quarters um have an onset by your mid-20s so that means that by the time you're in the workforce the likelihood you know that that a significant number of us are living with either mental health distress or actual full-blown mental illness it's actually very commonplace in the workforce and we just don't talk about it so it's not an other people's problem it's actually it's an everybody's problem um so what does that mean for pwc well uh so globally we have what's called be well work well which is kind of our framework for for well-being in the workplace which really focuses on four aspects of personal well-being so your physical health your mental health and then emotional and spiritual aspects but we looked about a year ago and said how do we really uh localize this and make this relevant in terms of the maturity of you know in singapore and we really wanted to acknowledge that workplace mental health is a two-way street so you have your obviously individual mental health affects the business right because um it affects engagement performance absenteeism presenteeism retention you know all of those things um but also work is a huge part of our lives particularly here i mean people work extremely long hours um and there's often a huge link between uh a huge amount of kind of um your identity and sense of purpose and sense of um of yourself that's very linked to to work and so uh what you do at work doesn't stay at work it also affects you at home and so it's a hugely important factor you're kind of what we call professional well-being is a huge factor in your overall mental health and well-being so that's why we have them kind of interplay of the two together so yeah so we look at it as both you're as as a as an organization but also as an individual you're responsible for your professional and your personal well-being and they're intrinsically linked so i think many of you may have heard before the daniel pink framework where he would talk about you know autonomy mastery and purpose well when we talk about professional well-being it's sort of similar we talk about you know your growth journey so for us that's is what you're doing um do you do you feel that what you're doing is is part of a longer career does it fit into your goals and aspirations and that's that kind of sense of purpose in what you're doing and are you getting kind of progression then really um the learning and skills so are you getting skills to get better at what you're doing are you really mastering something and feel that you are you know an expert in a topic and then the the huge part about you know the work culture and environment that has a huge um effect in terms of belonging so do you feel heard and valued but also do you have the tools that sort of enable you to do your work so all of those aspects really um on a pre-code on a normal situation or very uh have a very big link to your your mental health and the the employees responsibility to that so for us well being really um including managing your mental health it's not just a soft skill and a nice to have the the clear message from us is like it's a critical business skill to maintain your performance and engagement so that's also why we're part of that as i mentioned earlier the work world leaders work group and we hosted in last year the first ceo dialogue on mental health to really make sure that um you know this is a strategic priority that's been dealt with at a c-suite level so um you know in terms of the challenges we already touched on them before so stigma is a huge issue so we did the you know the beyond the label campaign internally um and we had an internal campaign last year where we had our leaders uh do a video where they were really saying why mental health is important to them and role modeling and saying and making a pledge and explaining like this is personally what i do to invest in my mental health um which was great but then we sort of realized realized that having asked everyone to pledge to talk about mental health the actual level of mental health literacy was too low to do that people don't have the basic uh understanding and language to be able to talk about mental health or mental illness so since then we really worked on increasing that mental health literacy um through trainings awareness and things like that um including doing a training for all of our uh front sort of front end um hr staff and some of our leadership so it was a full full day training on mental health mental illness and what that means in the workplace so that they're equipped to be able to actually deal with situations when they come up but then the other thing i think is around culture so [Music] the the type of organization we are and i think also in singapore in general there's really a kind of stress as a badge of honor kind of culture that means that um working unsustainably is kind of rewarded um and that's really seen as a you know that's a success that's a a great thing if you're sort of working yourself until you can you can barely function so how do we get around that um that aspect of it so you know places to start as an organization so you know as i said we started with a lot of awareness stuff but then it's really about leadership setting it as a priority so you'll hear a lot i hear a lot you know i don't have time i don't have time to invest in my own mental health and well-being but what that's really saying is i haven't made it a priority because we all have the same amount of time it's just that you're allocating your time based on the priorities and if it's not set as a priority you're not going to give time to it um so that's one thing where leadership's really important to set it as as a as a priority and then role model that so um yeah as i said we also did you know full day training for our leadership in our hr frontline staff um but then really you have to support it with policies so make it official so we've got you know flexible medical leave we've got which you can take a sort of mental health phase we've got insurance coverage that covers mental health and we have our employee assistance program and things like that but also practical tools so i was involved as i said the wellness guide from the work work world that um lee jan mentioned but also we have a mental health manager's tool kit and things like that so but fundamentally if you don't embed it embed mental health and well-being into how you recognize performance it's never going to be a priority so we've now just launched a revised professional development framework which builds um into our whole leadership portion we've really built how you manage your own well-being and how for more senior grades how you manage the well-being of your team um is actually one of the attributes that's measured in terms of your performance um and your yeah and so that's and your progression so that's that's um that was sort of where it was at pre-covered uh and then obviously uh covered 19 happened um and we've already touched you know the others have already touched on how this um affects your affects individuals and the workplace in different ways but i think many of you might have seen that meme that came out which was like what has advanced the digital transformation agenda in your organization more your ceo your chief digital officer or kobit um and the answers obviously covered 19 as we all went digital but i think that that also stands for mental health um because having been um it's really pushing the agenda to talk about mental health in the workplace um it's a for a long time suddenly there is a conversation that's happening um kind of naturally sort of opened up pandora's box really and even small things like on call you know ending calls with people and they'll say you know stay safe stay sane and you know for all that you know it's it's trite but it does mean that people are really acknowledging that there are physical impacts but also mental and emotional impacts of what's going on right now um and that they're that's something that's coming into the into the workplace sorry this alarm going off oh rebecca that fits really well with your timing and i need to kind of we're coming close to kind of an hour so do you want to close in with the next sort of a 20 seconds sort of on the key message and i think you're actually there's a question from cara sort of anything you're answering just nicely and uh if you could help me to round up your your slide sorry what was the question um i will read the question i think you did answer that but um i love the term step in not step away but a lot of managers don't know how to step in and know what to say when an employee opens up do you have any practical tips on how best to respond so actually that's something um that yeah so i was gonna get you so obviously the individual part of this in terms of you know resilience but really the critical part is getting managers and leaders it's that middle part because if you don't bridge what you're doing as an organization to through managers to the actual people it's it's there's a real gap there so that's one thing that we have had a lot of questions on so we're already working on it but essentially now instead of me going to people they come to me to ask so we've had some sessions on how to approach these conversations um where with someone who is showing signs of distress or who's actually come to you to disclose that they're really struggling or have a mental uh or facing mental illness as a coach or a manager so the the key message there is really on listening to understand not listening to reply or to give advice um and that you know and empathy is really key and also acknowledging you know we're equipping managers to have a conversation where they're listening with empathy and then can refer people to the right to the right sources of help you you're not expecting all of don't expect your managers or don't expect an individual to be able to counsel someone you're not you know beware you're not a psychologist you're not a counselor you're not a you're not a trained doctor um but what you can do is make sure that they it's around that psychological safety aspect that they really feel comfortable to voice their concerns and feel that you're listening to them and want to get to a better outcome and then you can on their behalf find find where to go next but really um the key there is really just listening to understand thank you so much rebecca i really appreciate and um um i know we're running out of time i wanted to address one of the questions and uh i know jeffrey you wanted to uh to to answer it we have a question from yvonne that would like to know how one can participate in the mindset jardin ambassador program thank you very much um the program right now is within the group itself and we've been talking amongst the x-com as to how we can be able to extend that outside of the group but i think i've sent a response to whoever was asking that question i think was nora my email please feel free to reach out and i think we can continue that conversation as to how we could get you involved thank you there is one question before i pass to uh to andrew and this question also from ewan and if possible uh dr fung would you like to take this question i'm thankful for the panelists sharing while what is the percentage of the employers in singapore that really care of aware of the importance of the mental health at workplace where most company hr hardly mention about it from my understanding that's a difficult question like i'm not aware of how companies look at this um but my own point is uh i think it's important to have not just engage employees and and workers in the in the companies but um employees uh and uh um workers who feel that um they are being um they are doing something that they enjoy you know it's almost like uh in healthcare we started this movement called joy in work and the reason was that uh in in at least in healthcare organizations there was an over emphasis on getting things done uh and not remembering the people the providers of the service that that needed support for themselves so i think trying to find joy in work is probably quite uh critical for overall well-being and that's that's something that i i hope that every employer would think about you well that concludes our event and i really would like to thank all the presenters and we could hear all the passion uh in the room and before we close off um if i may go to andrew um for to close off the event andrew uh chairs the dni committee of uh british chamber elena thank you and thank you to all the panelists i thought that was a fantastic and really fascinating discussion so thank you to all um for for taking the time to talk to our members about this very important topic um for me some of the takeaways i took from the discussion um i think the difference between mental health mental illness is very interesting and very important for us all to be aware of and i think we've all got a role as as business operators in the singapore community um we all have a role in protecting our employees in in in really looking after employees um but it's also interesting that the healthcare industry is is highly involved and charities are also very involved and there's clearly some some very good resources out there that we can use um to to really support our employees during this period and also i thought it was fascinating to hear some of the best practice initiatives um that the companies operating here in singapore are following and doing to support their employees and mental health was an area that has been highlighted by our members um as an area people would like more help in addressing and raising awareness so i think hearing from from companies on practical tips how to how to support your employees during this time is is really important so thank you both to to draw dean and pwc for for really giving us that overview of what you're doing um this is an area that the the diversity and inclusion committee are very focused on um it is an area that has got a lot of um interest from our members and we feel is important to to carry on this journey really to to improve the um the understanding and the awareness um of this issue uh going forward so you will see more um more initiatives from the dni committee going forward um but on that note i'd like to say a huge thank you thank you first to all our expert panelists um it really came across that you serious you are experts in your field and very good tangible advice that you gave to our members so so thank you to our

Sleep 2015; 38: 843–4.",[Music] the current challenges surrounding the covet 19 pandemic have caused a huge amount of fear anxiety and uncertainty for all of us today on demystified medicine we will talk about the impact of the pandemic on mental health including who is the most at risk and what you can do to improve your mental illness during this difficult time while social distancing guidelines help prevent the spread of the virus it has also led to determination of social gatherings closure of small businesses and increased financial difficulties due to layoffs and medical expenses in the u.s alone there are more than 20 million people who have filed for unemployment from january to april studies have shown that large-scale traumatic events that carry economic and social consequences can dramatically increase the mental health burden in the affected populations so if you're feeling stressed depressed or anxious during the pandemic you're not alone a global study has shown that one in four people in the general population experience some level of depression another study found that a rate of depression is three times the pre-pandemic levels and for populations that are under increased pressure or exposure risk to the virus such as university students front-line healthcare workers or covenanting patients the rate of mental illnesses is even greater by some estimation around 50 percent of university students one-third of all health care workers and half of covet 19 patients experience depression anxiety or sleep disturbances major risk factors in these three populations include socioeconomic status education level and whether they're living with others or living alone people who are under increased pressure or exposure risk and who also have low socioeconomic status or uneducated or live by themselves are at increased risk of developing mental health disorders so how do you regulate your own mental health during the copit 19 pandemic physical activities such as biking walking sports and even dancing have all been shown to reduce anxiety and depression exercising not only improves mood and mental health but has also been shown to improve self-esteem as well as attention and memory sleep may also play a huge role in improving mental health death is especially important during the pandemic while insomnia and sleep disturbances have been shown to be common occurrences in many at-risk populations studies have shown that higher quality of sleep may significantly improve symptoms of stress depression and anxiety interestingly exercising has been shown to significantly improve sleep quality it is recommended that seven or more hours of sleep per night is needed to meeting optimal health in adults lastly screen time is highly associated with mental health while screen time is unavoidable given the transition to an online work and learning environment the internet is also filled with misinformation and divisive content reducing unnecessary screen time especially on social media can have a profound and positive effect on your mental health with these tips in mind by incorporating daily exercise into a routine getting sufficient amount of sleep and reducing unnecessary screen time you can marketably improve your mood and mental wellness you can evaluate your own mental health using a variety of widely accessible screening tools online such as the phq-9 which screens for depression the g87 which screens for anxiety or psqi which screens for sleep disturbances if you decide that you would like some help with your mental health programs such as ementalhealth.ca crisis services canada and the u.s national helpline all provide access and referral to mental health services free of charge you can also ask for referral to professional mental health services through your primary care providers here are several more resources for seeking mental health advice in both canada and the united states hanging there we will get through this pandemic together [Music] you ,True,False,True,False
57,AVahHjU7_LU,Temasek Foundation,Understanding Mental Health in Singapore,2019-11-08T04:06:33Z,Dr Angelina Chan of Changi General Hospital shares on the common types of mental health challenges in Singapore and where people can seek help.,[Music] a common mental disorders that we see in Singapore belong to two large categories anxiety disorders and mood disorders for anxiety disorders the common ones are generalized anxiety disorders an obsessive compulsive disorder while for mood disorders it would include depression and bipolar mood disorders research has shown that one in six to one in ten Singaporeans suffer from a mental health disorder this means that it is as common as diabetes unfortunately a lot of people do not seek help early because they are shy afraid of what others might think of them so it's the stigma that prevents them from getting help early someone who is suffering from a mental disorder would show signs and symptoms so what we would observe is changes in the way they think feel and behave and these changes are significant enough to impact on the ability to function day to day as well as the ability to interact socially and attend to social activities so it's very helpful for us to be able to identify signs and symptoms of common mental disorders this would allow us to be able to encourage people to seek help early just like any other medical condition treatment will involve taking some medication learning some self-help strategies to take care of themselves to also make some changes in their lifestyle in order to learn some stress management techniques things that would enable them to be able to cope better with day to day life stressors it would be good for someone who may be suffering from some form of mental disorder - perhaps see a doctor and this doctor could be at the general practice level or to see a doctor at the polyclinic if the person requires more professional help then they would actually make the relevant raffle if the individual needs some form of counseling then it is good for the person to go see either a counselor in private practice or even go and see a counselor at the Family Service Center again they would do the assessment and if there's a need they will make the relevant referrals to male health professionals in Singapore you [Music] you ,False,True,True,False

Magheshwari RKS, Assistant Nursing Director.",[Music] covid is coming to our shore so that actually put us on high alert doctor told me that a positive call week 19 i was so scared there were occasions whereby we paid but someone else came with a bigger bag of cash and we decided that we would organize ourselves on the principle of leaving no singaporean behind the first time i saw my son is so happy yeah that is over [Music] pneumonia outbreak in the central city of wuhan the outbreak 11 of them in serious condition [Music] early morning on the 1st of january 2020 i was officially informed that there was a cluster that is worrying and we ought to watch it very carefully a lot of times we read it from the public media but we also realized the important thing is that if there is a potential transmission from animal to human and a human to human transmissions then i think we will be really into big trouble it was december 31st i remember the moment distinctly reading about it on promed which is a an email list serve of people in the field about 80 000 people across the world i emailed colleagues in geneva and said what's going on and there was clearly a lot of activity i could just imagine the the chaos the need to try and find out more information we have a very close colleagues who has already long term established his working relationship with the researchers in in china as well as our own colleagues locally who have built up these connections over the years trying to get a little bit more insider information so what could this virus be at the same time people in singapore were contacting me saying do you know anything about this and my answers were yeah it's uh it looks significant and um w.h.o is a buzz authorities are still working to identify the virus the outbreak in wuhan has affected at least 40 everyone is wondering when the situation stabilize or even improve and i think a little bit of informations and hint came out that this could be a corona virus and that was a very important message for us to be able to get our laboratory ready it was eerily similar to what we were getting in early 2003 about the information coming out of guangdong about the sars outbreak when it became clear that there was widespread community transmission in wuhan itself we knew then that this would likely impact singapore because there were air links between ohan and singapore and so it was very likely that the virus would be coming to singapore and therefore we set up a inter-ministerial committee basically a multi-ministry task force in order to monitor and to coordinate a whole government response but when it really crystallized for me was when i was in davos in january 2020 and it was about three am in the morning davos time when i got a phone call and it was minister gun kim yong on the other line telling me that we are establishing this task force asking me to be a member of the task force and i think from that point on the gravity of it really sunk in i suppose the moment that i recalled most vividly was minister kang kim young was urgently trying to contact me and i was at some event and i couldn't answer his call immediately so he says jonathan we are going to have to form a task force to manage the situation will you be okay to join the committee so immediately i say sure what do you need me to do just let me know this is a new virus i remember when the task force was first set up there were cynics and people are skeptical and saying were we overreacting why is there a need for a task force but i'm glad we did it and we anticipated set it up because we knew that with a virus like this potentially it could end up in a situation that would be like sars or perhaps even worse well in the beginning as we had our first meeting we had very little knowledge about the disease there was a lot of unknown basically and it is very challenging to try to make decisions and try to navigate our course of action in absence of knowledge there was a lot of trust between us that we knew that we had a big job to do no questions we'll just get on with it and get on quickly singapore has confirmed its first case of the wuhan virus the patient is a 66 year old chinese national and a resident of wuhan and very soon after that the second case was detected and was then admitted to national center for infectious diseases and we knew that from that point in time singapore will be into the fight against covenanting [Music] and we decided that we would organize ourselves on the principle of leaving no singaporean behind wherever they are in the world regardless of what situation they were in if they wanted to come back we would have to find a way and because wuhan was locked down we had singaporeans who were also stuck in wuhan so there was again another flurry of diplomatic activity again behind the scenes to get permission to launch what i think was one of the earliest repatriation missions into wuhan in order to extricate singaporeans from one who wanted to come back everyone on those flights volunteered they knew they were going into a potentially dangerous situation we knew far less about covet 19 than we know now so in a sense that in fact required real courage and i saw that in action [Music] i mean i have to confess that during the call with my boss i think there was a slight hesitation on my part initially anything today is a singaporean who is currently facing difficulty to return to singapore from south america does he have all his travel documents with him my main concern then was that unlike the other consular missions this one sounds like it's not just about me right i mean if i was infected with the virus i there is a risk that i may spread it to my love once fortunately i think at that time my wife joyce was next to me she understood what was happening so she nodded and gestured for me to proceed [Music] on the morning of our flight to wuhan we were sent to sgh where we received a crash course on how to wear our protective equipment or the ppe [Music] i tried to catch some sleep on the plane but on the way there i think it was difficult because my mind was still active running through all the contingencies and responses i tried to relax by chatting with the school crew and that was the time when i found out that oh the entire crew for that flight were volunteers were all volunteers by the time the wheels of the aircraft hit the ground in wuhan the first thing that i did was to turn on my mobile phone that was when we received the good news that all the singaporeans were eligible to be evacuated back had made it safely to the airport we were not supposed to interact too much with each other other than what is necessary and we have a couple of singaporeans would come over to us bring us a bottle of water asking us what do you want to eat you know because some of them have instant noodles with them so uh even in such moments our fellow singaporeans they themselves are tired you know they are also worried whether they have the virus they still thought of others like us i thought that was one of the more heartwarming moments for myself and and for my colleague when the plane eventually landed at changi there was no sense of euphoria amongst the passengers like applause or cheering actually the mood was a bit subdued understandable because one people were tired two there was still some anxiety about what comes next the testing the quarantine whether they have the virus or not and then during the quarantine itself both myself and my colleague at separate times we develop some flu-like symptoms not taking any chances i think we will rush off to ncid i guess the strongest most vivid memory must be my time in ncid because it was a long time since i found myself in the hospital we completed our 14 days and were finally let out on the 14th of february yes valentine's day when i reached home me and my wife we did not go for any candlelight dinner in a restaurant we just put on our flip-flop walk to the nearest coffee shop i ordered my favorite black pepper chicken shop i think we both felt that after what we have gone through we appreciate this simpler things in life [Music] better easily the most stark memory is arriving in beijing and seeing clear blue skies empty streets occasional cars you could walk down the streets not see a person for 10 minutes it was eerie it was shocking to learn how this country had had to respond to deal with with this virus in short the virus had brought china to its knees we learned that the virus was at the highest load early on in the illness and this was critically important because we knew that if the virus is shed in high amounts early on and potentially even before you had symptoms then this was going to to be a disease that was spread through the community so i knew singapore could deal with this as well as anyone else i also felt that other countries were particularly vulnerable whether that's just because they they lack the capacities anyway but also did they have the the mindset to be able to conceptualize what was coming their way and subsequently we realized even before the symptoms starts and asymptomatic infections and once you put all these characteristics together i kind of knew that this is going to be a hard battle against this virus and it's very likely that you will never be able to fully get rid of this virus [Music] foreign [Music] oh without ncid i think we'll be in trouble today so i was grateful to my predecessors who have decided that learning from sas we better have our own center for infectious diseases so that we can consolidate all the resources build the knowledge build the capacity and build the [Music] capability and here our closest partner is tandook singh hospital they inject in the manpower allowing ncid to escalate very quickly almost three to four times of his regular capacity [Music] so at the same time i would say that it is a very stressful period but we are ready for it we are able to bang together as a team be able to support one another we also have a team of psychological medically trained individuals to be able to help them the most common issues faced by most of our staff is the long hour of work fatigues can set in the other thing is that it is the fear elements and a lot of times i think most of our staff feels very safe and that is our sole purpose to provide our staff a very safe working environment but the fear may be from their close relatives or from their family members which is very understandable because you are working in the front line basically in a war zone and they will have to also handle their own personal fear as well as the family [Music] outside of clinical work i also deal with preparation for mass casualty exercises how to do disasters as well and i'm also involved with moh in terms of disaster planning actually i think that pandemics are a bit more difficult to handle because you do need a lot of endurance you need a lot of patience to deal with the different things that it shows at you so it's more of a marathon rather than a sprint the first kovit 19 patient i saw essentially was a returning traveler from china and i think the main emotion i got from her was the fear i mean i could see in her eyes i mean it was an unknown virus she wasn't sure whether she could go back whether there was any treatment available what was the prognosis of the disease so the main thing was that we had to deal with two different sites so both the screening center and the a and e [Music] [Applause] so there was one night in particular i remember and i was the senior doctor on night shift and we had about eight to ten doctors and student nurses as well to deal with about 300 patients in the screening center there were five different zones and two outside tentative areas and it was really challenging because i think to oversee all of them to make sure that they are actually safe and stable is really difficult [Music] so this is the extension of the screening center it's really quiet now it's so much different from how it used to be of course i don't want the screen center open again because if it opens means there'll be another pandemic that's happening i know that if it opens we'll always be prepared and i'm confident that we will be able to do the next pandemic as well one important lesson that we learned in the early days of kobe 19 is that every outbreak is different we have sops what we call sop standard operating procedures and every time when something happens we always take out the sop dust it off and check what should we do next every upgrade is different and therefore we cannot just follow the plan blindly we must be prepared to adapt to change to [Music] move [Music] [Music] morning now i cannot go home even my children they want to come here they cannot come so it's it's really heartbreaking for me because i miss them [Music] first time when they air it so everybody's texting me sister you make us cry but one thing that really strikes me most is my mom how she reacted when she watched the documentary she really cried us and cried very hard because my brother is here also and my sister-in-law is also working here so she keep on saying verbalizing while crying so hard and telling tell them to go home tell them to go home tell them to go home i told her nothing to worry because the government and the management of our hospital is really looking after us how are you let's hit the white mother [Music] wow so quiet i've got goosebumps i'm having goosebumps this was where our first few patients got admitted to well suddenly everything is flashing yeah i can still see the patient doing going through the conversion from a normal compost to a covid facility was very organized madness real organized madness i think the first wave of patient coming in was the most scariest it was something that i think all of us have not had experienced nursing such patients before definitely there's a lot of anxiety a lot of fear but very fortunate on our first day we did have support from ncid who actually gave us a lot of assurance a lot of hand-holding to to tell us that we are in the right direction so i remember when we are doing the exercise with them one of the patient cried and he's trying his best to communicate in english because i got some communication barriers and then he asked me sister what will happen to us what will happen to me am i going to die there's a lot of uncertainties but you know what i answer to them don't think too much take one step at a time [Music] what we have done is to have a record plan if the hospital needs to stand up again to accept a patient we will be able to do so in very quick time within 24 hours our staff have been told who will be recalled by batches a few of the patients here i think they've been here for a while they just want to see how are they getting on this few days so moving it was a difficult move for me because from a kampung going to a condominium sort of feeling but it's a good move so when i move i move with a positive note and here i am now currently i still work as an infection control nurse so activities wise same thing like for example i'm still doing infection control audit doing some trainings staff education can you show me the seven steps of hand-held you put it's either water or your hamburger then you do something and then your wrists definitely i'll come back when this whole thing is over when we have no more patience we will definitely come back to black vision so i think what is very very significant is the kampung culture that we have in bright vision is something that i can never find anywhere it can't be too much longer now till they figure it out but tell you honestly my plan is to go home this is the reality i want to be with my family and i am looking forward for that because life is very unpredictable we don't even predict this thing will happen right no one even predicted but it happened so i thought to myself maybe donna this is the sign for you to be with your family because we don't know what will happen tomorrow [Music] [Music] it was a self-preservation all of us need our basic needs to survive and when we find that their scarcity or we think that there's going to be scarcities of resources or supplies like food something as basic as that you want to make sure you have so i think we need to understand that the kind of self-preservation is about preserving yourself and the loved ones around you that's the first psychological factor the second psychological factor is one of a hurd mentality sometimes you don't really need you're not sure if you do need but when you see everybody else doing it you do it as well right so that is how the contagion works i'm a former tv editor who got into food production a few years ago because i saw the importance of being able to produce food where people live i'd never seen empty shells of vegetables before it was quite a remarkable site and i think seeing that made people realize how important having local production is because if the board is shut there's no replacing that supply you need to be able to supply locally and and vegetables are not the sort of thing you can store for a very long time you can store rice and canned food and things like that on the shelves for a long time or even frozen food but fresh vegetables need to be constantly produced and replaced and consumed because they don't have a shelf life [Music] yeah how's it going good okay do you think because there's been a bit more cloudier slope growth or so as we expand out our greenhouse capability we need to be able to move from the 2000 packets we're doing a week to over 2000 packets a day and that's going to make a significant difference in what we can supply to the supermarket [Music] so even before kovite 19 we'll be building the foundations for singapore's food security apart from diversifying our sources we've been raising our local production and that's why we have the 30 by 30 goal which is to raise singapore's food supply uh to produce 30 percent locally by 2030. so as a response to the pandemic and kobit 19 we decided to accelerate that goal and that's what the 30 by 30 express grant is about where we have high-tech farmers they are ready to raise production we funded them to a tune of about 40 million to nine companies and you'll be able to see more local produce in the next six to 24 months [Music] i'd like to see us aiming much much higher we're trying to produce as much as we can and i think collectively we should be aiming for 150 and while that might sound crazy i don't think so i think it's important that we produce not only for ourselves but be able to produce in a way that we can become an exporter and then if we come and export it then we have a buffer we have a shock absorber to global prices like covert so if the borders get closed we can divert our export into local consumption so this is just the first of what we plan to be many rooftop farms in singapore we want to do this in every neighborhood [Music] so we'd like to see more of this urban farming rooftops of vacant hdb multi-story car parks in commercial buildings you know even like shopping center rooftops and all that and even industrial buildings and why this is important is because you bring the food closer to the consumer you cut down the carbon mounds and you cut down the transportation required to bring the food from the farm to the consumer and that in fact can make local production more affordable in the long run [Music] some of them could produce it but they couldn't get it to the ports and the airports and ship it to us some of them could produce it but they weren't willing to sell and there was a worldwide scramble to get mass medicine and food we need to activate our global supply chain networks really to call up all our contacts from all over the world to try to secure mass the food the essential supplies in fact on many occasions our people both the government officials and also the supply chains players they have to physically bring with them cash to the place place the order and there were occasions whereby we paid for it but moments later someone else came with a bigger bag of cash and took away what we had bought so we could never relax until we have secured the stuff that we want get it onto the ship of the plane and monitor it closely until it comes back to singapore malaysia is set to close its borders at midnight to fight the spread of the coronavirus it's the first country in southeast asia to impose a two-week nationwide lockdown [Music] so again if i cast my mind back to that time i remember speaking to the foreign minister hisham speaking to the chief minister of johor astley and those conversations were also important to you know update each other and what was happening and the fact now in retrospect that in fact there was hardly any disruption to essential supplies [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and of course we have our first case of uh an infected crew that came on board the ship and january uh one day or two days just before uh the state of emergency being declared that that actually brought us you know uh into sort of a reality you know it's coming to our shore and at that period there's already travelers coming into singapore with uh with covet cases so that actually put us on high alert okay rock i've been about 35 years as a sailor my main role is as chief engineer i am in charge of the engine department actually we are scared but we are only follow some protocols and uh protection to avoid this scuba so now since we arrived here in singapore uh me and my crewmates are very thankful because we are very safe and accommodation given to us by singapore government after singapore we're heading to portland after that one we heading for colombo sri lanka to date now for example we have facilitated more than 80 000 crew changers signed on and signed off and they have gone on board 6 000 ships so i think it is for us a major accomplishment because it is not easy to balance that public health risk protect the seafarers protect our local population and all this gives a commitment to the shipping industry that they can come here and do business in singapore and that keeps our pot open which continues to fuel the economy of singapore one person even told me that he has not seen his son for one year he was stuck on board the ship and he was really very glad that they were all praying on board the ship every day for a port that would allow them to do the crew change and they will get that it was singapore and he was glad that in about eight hours time he is going to go home and and see his son after my six months contract i will be going home to take a vacation with my family and uh hoping that everything will be okay so i like this contract for my family and we could earn much more enough for our needs and for the future of my family and i hope that one day or [Music] time will come i want to visit against singapore once again [Music] there was a great reshuffle of humanity occurring at that point in time now although our airport was close to tourist arrivals one fact which people may not appreciate is that we kept changi open and functioning as a key transit so i recall many conversations with many different foreign ministers who wanted to get their own citizens home and they had to transit in singapore i think the other point i would also emphasize when i look back at that time is when the mco came into effect there were many families who were desperate to go to one side or the other and it's not about economics or jobs husbands or wives or parents who are ill who are in icu or who have passed away and people aren't able to say their final goodbyes so there was a very very human dimension to this separation and again to the maximum extent possible we tried our best to to help to get families reunited say the final goodbyes either in the icu or at the funeral people realized that singapore was reliable even in the depths of a crisis we continue to be a key focal nodal point for the transit of essential goods services pharmaceuticals food and most important of all people [Music] [Music] we did say that we hoped never to get there but the situation was such that we had to seriously consider it and the task force debated at length the pros and cons we knew from the beginning that it had we imposed this circuit breaker it's going to impact lives of many people and the livelihoods of many people because the economy will grind to a halt it would also have impact on well-being of people their sense of isolation particularly for the elderly and vulnerable groups it would have impact on children too because if schools were closed some parents may not have the ability to look after their children if they are in the essential workforce working and some and the children may suffer but we realized as the situation worsened we had no choice we have to explain to the cabinet because our cabinet colleagues are fully aware of the implication and the impact on people and economy so we presented to them with charts and with numbers with projections and say this is what we're going to be seeing if we don't have a circuit breaker but i'm happy to say that the minister for trade industry and minister of finance were fully behind circuit breaker because they also know that if we don't do that we're going to have a protracted multiple waves of infection the impact on the economy on the people will be even worse we will therefore impose significantly stricter measures this is like a circuit breaker and undergirding all of that is the point that you know you needed a calm and cooperative collaborative response from the broader society because we were essentially asking them to do things which is out of the norm and we needed their cooperation and compliance for it to be effective and that is why i think the foundation of this is trust and confidence you can only foster that trust and that confidence if you have clear communication that is provided in a timely manner that is transparent and coming from an authoritative source in a regular fashion and in part this is also in my mind it was influenced by experiences in the past because very often uh in you know in crisis situations one of the concerns of the general public has been the lack of information [Music] there has to be a near real-time feedback to policy makers decision makers about what the population at large is thinking i think for covet 19 there is this intermediate concern that some people might have a longer term health issues after recovery so during the circuit breaker we found that the proportion of people who saw a doctor for the illness had dropped from a high of about 90 percent before the circuit breaker to as low as about 50 during the circuit breaker when we saw this we started to probe further by launching additional surveys asking people what are the reasons or the key reasons why they did not see a doctor for their illness firstly there was a group that was concerned about the length of the sick leave that they would have to undergo if they saw a doctor for the respiratory infection there was another group which was actually concerned about catching the infection if they stepped out to look for care during a period that was supposed to be dangerous in terms of covet spread so we fed back some of this messaging to the ministry of health and along with other inputs which i'm sure they receive from other agencies they actually undertook a messaging campaign to reinforce the need to seek care and also subsequently they did revise the sick leave policy okay so this is the question why would you get vaccinated and then all the options are listed over in text over here i have taken the vaccine but we have to hide until the vaccination starts we need to be on a gut against fake messaging we need to figure out if the population has any concerns about the vaccine we have noticed that a lot of our participants in past surveys have actually reported that they have received fake news or messages they suspect to be fake on other aspects about this virus so this is one of our chief concerns as the vaccines start to be rolled out in singapore singapore has reported its first two deaths from the coronavirus they are a 75 year old singaporean woman and a 64 year old indonesian man our folks are with their families and their loved ones during this difficult moment i decided that i had to do the announcement myself call the press briefing and brief the press about the two mortality but it is also important at that point to rally singaporeans together because i think this bad news will affect everybody it's not just the family members but the rest of singaporeans too i had to prepare myself because i know i will also get emotional during the press briefing words are not sufficient to express our appreciation for all of those who are i didn't go into the parliament making a speech planning to break down obviously it rarely happens to me but i recounted how i've seen so many instances of singaporeans responding valiantly to the crisis and i've seen so many of these instances everywhere when i go out to meet uh the people on the front lines if i could allow singaporeans to see through my eyes what i've seen i think everyone will be similarly overwhelmed [Music] i was 27 weeks pregnant my first symptom is i had bad cough itchy throat and lost sense of taste i think i got it from my father-in-law he worked in airport that time we had a family gathering he already showed symptoms but we're really not sure he really had coveted 19 then most also suggest me to to pack my things and my son things and convict us to end uh because i'm pregnant [Music] my son was

However, not all seniors have adapted to the digital world. Dr Ng Wai Chong, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NWC Longevity Practice, outlines six factors why this is so.

IPS Website: https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips","In my work I do see more seniors complaining of symptoms suggestive of anxiety and maybe mood disorders, mental health, loneliness, boredom, caregiver stress. And my colleagues are reporting increased incidence of elder abuse. I think this pandemic has a toll particularly on the mental health and social connectedness of people and I totally agree with Karthik's emphasis on mental health, particularly people with cognitive disability such as dementia. But having said this, I also agree with all of you who mentioned that seniors are not entirely unused to or alienated from technology. Many of them are already embracing and swimming in it every day. Main issue related to technology - what stopped people from using it's not so much - there are many factors, I usually use the
scheme of these six areas. Accessibility, you need to make it accessible, so the hardware and the software and the user interface need to be really useful. And then available, it should be available - is 3G, broadband, 5G widely available? And how's the pricing - is it affordable? And then is it acceptable? Acceptability is about humans, if their friends are using it and everybody is sharing, like my mom is sharing all sorts of memes on her WhatsApp, and after she discovered smartphone there was no barrier, she was already accessing so it's a culture and influence by friends and families. And lastly, it's about the accountability. It is good that we are beginning to regulate telemedicine and creating a sandbox at the Ministry of Health. So with new practices and behaviours with regards to technology - the legislation, the policies, and society will probably need to rise to the occasion, to make sure that data is protected and the quality of care is maintained.

61,lr6bsE-G978,CNA Insider,Living With Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) | Strangers In My Head | Mental Health,2021-01-08T12:00:30Z,"Youthful and outgoing, one can hardly tell that Le Yong battles with a mental health issue. Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is an under-diagnosed condition, characterised by obsessive and intrusive thoughts of perceived flaws in a person’s appearance. Unaware of this mental health disorder at an earlier age, Le Yong has had cosmetic surgeries to correct his perceived flaws. However, surgery has not fixed his body image issues. 

Every day, Le Yong needs to make an extra effort to manage the distorted image he sees of himself and the feelings of shame for having these obsessive and ‘vain’ thoughts. As he feels the pressure to measure up to society’s standards of what it means to be normal and the perceived expectations of what a man should achieve, Le Yong dreams of a simple life free from BDD.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",when i go to the mirror right i see a very broad and short face and it changes like i can see different faces sometimes and i'm very unsure of how i really look like i think about my face all the time like two thirds of the day will be based on my appearance i feel upset disappointed hopeless ugly woman like that i wanted to end my life because i think i'm too ugly for the world [Music] i'm being seven this year my name is laura young yeah i'm suffering from body dysmorphic disorder i think there's something wrong with my space abnormal i can check up like 50 times a day in the mirror not to soften anything but to confirm my flaws see sorry you know some people might feel their hands are dirty they wash their hands and afterwards they feel their hands just clean right i'm like washing my hand but it's like never clean i perceive myself as a mentally sick patient i perceive myself as somebody with loss i always talk to my mom yeah or ask her if my face isn't okay or not yeah because you know i i'm always seeing different faces right so i don't have a stable body mage so i'll check with her okay okay okay no no it's okay okay but honestly speaking right when people give me assurance it doesn't help i'm obsessed with what i see in the mirror so if i see that it's short it's broad it is what i would believe in people would think that this is vanity this is a childish way of thinking but it's so real to me [Music] i was desperately looking for help because i feel lost i feel really ugly hopeless depressed i'm not making much progression i'm really on so much medication so i found out the disorder caught body dysmorphic disorder from the internet and it describes me very well and how i feel is that at least i'm not alone it's not a mystery it's something treatable [Music] how has it been like um for the past few days since our last session the checking is low oh okay yeah oh 12 15 times and that's it okay 12 to 15 times in the last few days like just now i just went to the toilet i had a negative feedback from the mirror i saw a face that's very broad and short and it feel a bit uncomfortable about it yeah like disappointment was set the worries are so strong and um just so prominent in all aspects that it can really be quite debilitating for them and oftentimes like um what ends up happening negative feedback recently there's more positive feedback there is still negative feedback so i believe this is a number game the more i check the more higher chance that i will have for negative feedback and that's why ultimately we want to work towards reducing the mirror checking so there used to be a lot of mirror in my house so my parents they remove it you know there used to be a lot of mirrors in the living room in the toilet they remove it so i went out they tried to make me check lesser every single day almost every minute you're thinking about the passive flaw yeah and then it's always at the back of your mind no matter what you do only sometimes when you also might fall into something like doing what i like to do like cooking then i will stop thinking so i believe everybody have these sets of mental capacity to do everything in that daily life but i have to give up quite a big portion to to my symptoms the distress caused by the bdd is so intense that i cannot function properly this i work in dignity kitchen i'm working as a cook learning how to cook i used to work for work for them few years ago but i decided to try try out the society so i went out to work by myself and see how far i can go yeah and then i feel yeah and i feel very bad about it whatever he does you want it fast you want it perfect you know he has very high expectation of himself like even after work in the evening he will text me so hey can you be harder on me can you not give in to me because if you keep giving to giving to me right i may not be able to to to improve you know oh i want to get things done properly if i can't do it properly i feel like i'm lousy so like if i can't cut something in in a more uniform way manner then i'll feel bad why i can't do it okay if i'm not feeling okay i can take a break anytime i want to which if you go out and work you don't get that kind of treatment and especially in the workplace format right people just want you to get the job done they don't care how you feel or how sick you are so people like me i don't have a place in the society [Music] that very young age when i was like secondary school started it started with my nose every day i think about it everything the moment i wake up before i sleep everything i keep thinking that people are laughing at my flaws everywhere i go like every laughter every staring is on my floor so i actually had my nose done three times and after the third time i'm finally happy about it but then the bdd moves on to something else which is the shape of my face [Music] and you get sensations you get sensations over that perceived loss which is very disturbing as well i just you know suffered quietly i i don't know who to tell because i don't know what i'm suffering from i don't know what's going on and i'm embarrassed to tell yeah i hide it from my parents as well body dysmorphic disorder is often overlooked because firstly there is little awareness of it and on top of that there's just so much of worry that they will be misunderstood as being vain or narcissistic and this really prevents them from from coming forward to seek help remember last time i shared about um there's this image of ourselves that we have in our mind right do you recall that yeah yeah so um the image is is often something that um we kind of have even without looking in the mirror so it's let's say if you are sitting over here now um if you're not looking and we're not looking at your reflection there is still kind of an image of how um you think other people see you like right now it's very strong ah okay why why do you think like right now those cameras there's your eyes yeah the camera is watching one more eyes from you yeah yeah so it feels like there's a lot of people like looking judgments my head right now yeah yeah and and this is what you're thinking about i feel like running away actually because there's so much that that is going on right being part of this documentary i actually feel that i'm given the chance to create awareness about body dysmorphic disorder but i'm worried that what i see in the documentary i i don't like it maybe i'll see just my flaws yeah so it's a bit scary i want to go to the toilet yeah i'm going to go to thailand now okay all right okay do you think maybe i won't be cool no it's okay yeah i'm fine they're quite disturbing yeah yeah it's distracting to have the camera yeah the ugly image is very strong i went to the toilet i get a negative feedback um he's always been very afraid of seeing himself on film on on camera especially with that being taken by somebody else okay he has got little control over how the picture of video looks like the important thing to keep in mind is that that's not how you really look that's how you feel but is it helpful to focus on that image no not not helpful right yeah how is the filming process been difficult for you uh you know this anxiety of like oh i'm gonna be filmed how will i look in the film so maybe the day before i i get nervous i can't sleep [Music] i have physical cravings i have a dust for alcohol every day alcohol will make my bdd worse because my mood will be affected after i drink i want to cut down the amount of alcohol i'm thinking because it's taking control of me life for me right now is like a roller coaster a lot of up a lot of down sometimes i feel like i'm okay completely fine sometimes i feel like i'm in a trash because i'm not progressing i'm not doing things that i think that i need and i want to do [Music] so what's next what do you want to do now just get myself as skilled as much as possible learn what i can learn as much as possible you want to start a story if i can start also definitely i want to but right now i don't if i'm capable my dream is to sell laksa yeah and let everybody eat my laksa actually if you can get a good luck start i can actually help you to set it up for le young the sky is the limit why i say that he has a very good personality in terms of selling sales and everything second thing he's a perfectionist he like to do things right or don't do at all that is a very good personality third thing he's hard-working if it's not for bdd he actually will do very well right i'm gonna have it you follow exactly what i do it is the part where you do the chopping right so adaptive using the tip only when leon shared his dream about being a hawker i'm both happy and worried because being hockey is not easy an average hawker probably works like 10 to 12 hours and he might not be able to take the stress of long hours and if he's manning the stall himself right and the time where he need to cope right you need to walk away and that's the part that is worrying don't tear the skin yeah this is where it splits i'm trying my best to go to work every day trying to let not my mode affect what i'm doing so all these are small little practice that is going to help me in the future okay thank you all right but i don't think i'm doing that well at the moment because sometimes i skip work when i feel bad i avoid getting myself more frustrated or stressed because that will cause my symptoms to pick so sometimes i choose not to go to work i think i'm not that confident to start a hawker by myself at the moment because i'm still in the mess [Music] i'm jealous of people who are healthy and then they can mingle around and make as much friends as possible you know and be happy but i can't because i feel that i'm very ugly i think that when i talk to them right they will look at my flaws i cannot engage in a proper conversation in that manner so it's very upset thing for me when i know that i can't do it yeah and then i avoid it [Music] so basically i just go out by myself you know regardless of what i'm feeling or thinking when i'm getting a negative feedback from the mirror just be myself and do my things and then slowly you you again that confidence hey mother how are you huh since you have this kind of situation then you shouldn't be forcing yourself to work this is cinema like i feel like everybody can do it then i can i can't do it like all right it's okay take your time jackson is my best friend yeah he he saw my meltdown he know that i'm suffering from some mental conditions and i actually feel safe when i talk to him you know when i'm around him i feel safe as well if you remember that day right on birthday i don't even saw it actually i show one of the girl magic trick but i didn't manage to get her a contact you know also wasted she seems nice you know i think i know i think on instagram is it this one oh no yeah yeah i have relationships and it all failed that's why i'm not married i want a girlfriend by skip i think it's me i think the relationship feel because of me i i feel like i get very paranoid because i think that there's something wrong with me physically that's why this person don't like me or behave in a particular way i don't think of myself how really am i going to take care of other people you know how people can accept people like that they don't have a proper job i need a lot of acceptance and which people around my age it's really more than that right like you are doing so well they're always shocked i admire jackson because i think he's doing well in his career in his relationship he can manage his life he can drive a car so it's like the ideal person that i want to be like just socialize a bit more tomorrow we'll not have dinner drop by i'll let you know yeah let me know okay are you okay with that are you trying to get a good image uh should we turn it should we turn it off again it's better if you've done it i turn off okay okay this is better okay now we're smaller because there's uh so much uh you know hidden uh secret suffering out there that it's good to hear from someone like yourself a lot of people are afraid to seek help a lot of people have like a bad impression on mental health when you look at yourself in the mirror what do you actually see i think that will give us a better understanding of what your experience is like i'm very bothered by by the width the width of my face from this area to this area i will keep comparing with like celebrities or pictures that i see on people around me and when i do that i feel that my face is too wide and too short have the people around you like reassured you about the way you view yourself is not the way that other people view you okay i'll tell you who did i ask for assurance the most that's my mom i always answer is my face okay or not yeah and then she always tell me hey yeah okay does that help in any way i would say it helps but just for that short period of time when you ask your your mom for reassurance how do you feel afterwards sad i feel sad [Music] like why should i make my mom feel this way i made my mother cry for behaving in a particular way saying nasty things when i'm feeling down who wants to see that kid suffering do your family members are also preoccupied with some other things maybe not a body per sale could be uh maybe like washing hands actually i'm the only one i have a elder brother and a younger brother they they are normal but i'm the one that's sick yeah one thing i teach the students strong is that um we don't like to think so much in the categories of normal or not not normal so i i like to think that you're also normal but you have an experience that is very distressing okay i want to be as normal as i can so i try to be as normal as i can but i realize that i have a lot of limits like i cannot get frustrated once i get frustrated my symptoms will pink if i didn't sleep well my symptoms will pick if i drink too much the next day my symptoms will pick so there's a lot of difficulties to live like a normal person i think yeah and i've never experienced living as a normal person right can you crazy what you see there ugly huh ugly why my face so ugly my face was short so white you feel a bit depressed when i saw the clip of how i look it doesn't feel good i think it's ugly what it's done is done like we cannot reverse and i already decided to put this up then we're gonna put it up no matter how bad i think i look so do it just do it i'm cool okay yeah before the family i'm quite i doubt myself i can't do it a lot of anxiety going on off negative emotions but after i did it actually i think i feel quite good i want to create awareness for people yeah so it's something i want to do it's like a goal early little goal and i did it to me happiness is like having a healthy mind being able to experience things around you like a normal person you know when i cook i feel happy [Music] i dream of for life free from btv i'll be so carefree i'll be a lot more functional a lot happier i want to support my family i want to start a laksa store i want a simple happy life [Music] what's up [Music] ,False,False,True,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] today a million wildlife species are facing the threat of extinction what's frightening they're dying off faster than ever before it's just a really unnerving feeling knowing that somewhere down the road the animals that we have today may only exist behind glass like what we're seeing here but we live in a tiny city-state i wonder how can we possibly make biodiversity an issue that matters to more people in singapore i'm shushan born and bred in singapore and in my time as a journalist my favorite stories to cover were always the ones about nature i discovered a secret sanctuary for gibbons rescued from poachers in malaysia explored the mountains of borneo we reached 10 of our journey and spend my holidays in other natural wonders abroad covert 19 put an end to my trips abroad but being stuck in singapore has turned out to be an eye-opening experience this is looking at us with his eyes wide open oh it's so cute in this two-part documentary i come face to face with some of the rarest species in the world right here in singapore to think that they exist amongst us you know forests blows my mind really and meet the tenacious men and women in the uphill battle to save these creatures from extinction these crabs are only found in singapore in the last 200 years we have lost nearly a third of our native wildlife can we make it in time to stop the remaining species from disappearing forever it was thought to be the last one of its tribe [Music] in the history of humanity we've been exploiting the bounties of nature for our needs you could almost say it's in our nature but have we come to a point where we've gone too far what do we stand to lose when our own flora and fauna go extinct and what role can our tiny city-state possibly play in preserving our planet's biodiversity that's what i'll try to find out in it's in our nature i love spending my mornings here but today i'm not here for a casual hike i'm taking part in a competition a five-hour bird race okay so has already started yeah we are ready to run oh this is getting exciting okay so where are we going today i think we just hang around here and look at the tree and see what kinds of birds find this tree not exactly the kind of race i was expecting most bird watching is done being still at one stationary location yeah yeah you just tell the tree that's really the most exciting thing people do i'll just look at what you're doing and copy you the bird race is an annual competition organized by nature society singapore and participants raced to well spot the birds each species has assigned a point between one and five depending on how common or rare they are and the team with the most points wins they started bird watching at noon yesterday wow yeah and you see they are seriousness they're not they're not even talking you know they're like very focused you know they're like all out to get like 100 kinds of birds yeah well the game is on i've got my gear ready and i can't wait to get started tell me what i should be looking out for oh there you go oh yeah yeah you see that yeah oh it's on the brunch what is it it's a blue filtered v-eater whoa dingley has been bird watching for more than two decades but what started as a hobby eventually became his day job today he works with bird life international a bird conservation ngo so i really can't get a better guide for my virgin bird race [Music] oh you see there's four birds in the sky yeah yeah five point five points all right wow we've got this five point birds man this is what it looks like oh nice oh you heard that high-pitched call yeah that's good i see it yeah it's been an hour of straining our necks but it's paid off we've spotted 20 species of forest birds and you could say by this time dingley could add one more bird watching convert to its list [Music] [Music] i don't think i've ever been so excited about our feathered creatures i've been told in the last decade more than 400 species of birds have been recorded on our island we spotted another 15 more species before heading to sugaibulo a hot spot for migratory birds dingley tells me more than a hundred different species stop over here on our island on their way to other parts of the region you see all the brown birds on the mud yeah so they're very small near to the water stage there's a like 60 70 brown birds there so these are wimbros and wind bros are strawberries that live in the high tundra of of siberia wow so literally right at the top of the continent and to come here they will have to fly more than six seven thousand kilometers one way previously singapore was thought to be a stopover only on the east asian australasian flyway but a new study just published found that some birds which spend their winters in singapore actually made their way from the himalayas making us part of the central asian flyway as well all in all thousands of migratory birds stop over on our island between august and march every year i guess you could say we are an air hub in more ways than we realized why does our island matter to these migratory birds so singapore by virtue of our position makes us really an important pop-up point for birds on their migrations you see we are right at the tip of the malay peninsula so a lot of these birds that are moving down the peninsula they would you know fly through singapore and this is the last chance for them to refuel before they go to indonesia they have to fly across the sea and flying across the sea is not easy for monkey tree birds all pit stops equally important for the case of birds of prey for example we are beginning to find that singapore is a very important pit stop for eagles and hawks going on to indonesia on certain days account up to a thousand eagles passing through singapore on their way to indonesia wow [Music] so we're going here yep [Music] okay so we're just in the last few minutes of the race and we've just chosen this spot to kind of try and spot a few more birds in the last six minutes hey i'll see see you see you next time that's the lesser egyptian all right robert you got to put that in now lester edgerton what about this one here oh little harrison little herrera have you seen that oh common common sandpiper yeah yeah another one yeah you see they know the burrito is ending they're all just showing up finally like okay last year robert you want to submit the results now did you finalize the list then i go and check it all right there we go i've submitted the final list for today's race so uh we've got about 40 birds all together which is not a bad count well then guys well done i think we all deserve a drink you know before this i may have thought so what a bird is a bird but what i've discovered today is that there are so many different types of species of birds and within the species itself there are multiple subspecies it's opened my eyes to how little i know about our native wildlife i want to find out more and i'm choosing to start at the museum of the living dead oh it says here that we may have over 40 000 species of plants and animals i didn't know that [Music] this museum showcases a collection of wildlife specimens from across southeast asia including flora and fauna native to singapore and i've asked to meet professor leo tan a man some might call the godfather of local biodiversity he's among the first few singaporeans to fight to save our wildlife [Music] so the exhibition says we may have over 40 000 plant and animal species in singapore we have more trees in singapore species than the whole of north america in one square kilometer because we're in the tropics we have a greater biodiversity we have such a rich diversity of corals almost 250 species which form almost a third of the total corals in the world we probably have a third of the species of crab in southeast asia not all of them edible why do we have such rich biodiversity in spite of being a city-state we were once part of the natural rainforest tropical rainforest malaysia and singapore were joined at one point in time in our geological history not only all the way to australia dinosaurs once walked through singapore we call the abundance of wildlife biodiversity and over the last 200 years singapore has lost almost a third of native wildlife [Music] now the only chance we might get to see them is through the eyes of kate pocklington she's handled at least 50 000 species of wildlife all of them dead and many locally extinct kate is an animal artisan she restores animal carcasses and then works to portray them in their natural state today she's preparing some specimens for an upcoming exhibition okay so we've got um the malayan tiger cream colored squirrel and these two are both extinct in singapore 1909 wow very old this is an ancient specimen my goodness specimen 1 one of the largest squirrels in the world [Music] first discovered by sir stamford raffles in 1821 it was said to be abundantly present in the woods so the first thing we're going to do is like basic just give it a clean so just yeah just go with the direction of the fur i feel like i'm grooming my cat in fact they were so common that up until the late 60s they were sold as food or pets but the species hasn't been spotted on our island since 1995 specimen 2 a malayan tiger they're only found in the malay peninsula the first recorded sighting 1831 after it mauled someone to death and as development encroached on their habitats these attacks became increasingly common a bounty was even given for every tiger killed the last one on our island was shot in 1930 my job today to make this sculpted tooth as realistic as possible that one over there is missing a tooth when it's on display it really wants to look kind of scientifically accurate so i got this one out to show you how the teeth should look wow should i um oh sorry am i taking no you're not taking too long no not at all i'll just do a few lines on his okay then we can try it so cool she's really bringing it to life right now look at that it's amazing kate why do you think it's important that other people get to see these specimens if they're already extinct then this is the only chance that we've got to see them right so it's kind of important that i do whatever i can to keep them this way and so that people in the future will understand what we had yeah it's very different from looking at a photo you know yeah when it's just in little bits and pieces it's kind of hard to tell what you're looking at but now that we've really put it together it's really starting to take the shape of a tiger i might not have been much help but i'm feeling proud that i've had a hand in preserving our natural heritage especially since more than a thousand six hundred native species are on the edge of extinction according to the singapore red data book last published in 2008 one of them is this raffles bandit langer only 67 are left in the wild so this one at the back died in 1987. and it's actually one of the old curators of the museum saw it um it was thought to be the last one of its tribe so kate why do you think we've lost so many species of animals in singapore habitat loss for different animals and urbanization happened quite fast land use changes deforestation so with habitat loss makes it more difficult for animals to find you know food not as much space to live our island was once covered in forests but after the british arrived most of it was raised to the ground replaced by profitable plantations by 1900 90 of our original forest cover was gone rapid urbanization in the 1960s destroyed even more forests and coastal habitats and as we continue to encroach on their habitats thank you for watching more animals are being spotted in ours in distress oh there it is yeah i see it oh no it looks dead it looks dead i don't know that's a life [Music] earlier i discovered that we could have more than 40 000 species of plants and animals in singapore that's the good news the bad news more than a thousand of our native wildlife are on the brink of disappearing forever urbanization happened land use changes deforestation which is why today the folks at acres are busier than ever acres runs the only wildlife rescue hotline in singapore a small bet you found it on the floor why don't you send a picture of the vat to us whatsapp on this number and since they started in 2009 they've dealt with all sorts of cases injured birds distressed mammals or reptiles that simply crawled their way into people's homes another call hello i guess hotline it really seems like the calls are coming in non-stop yep why do you think that's the case uh i think one thing is definitely more people know about us uh so they they call us the other thing can be like we're getting more urbanized more land is being cleared so um more animals are being seen in public places not all bad i mean i guess it goes to show that people do care right yeah people do care and that's great love uh and but that's one of the reasons why our call volume has increased also um so i mean we are trying our best to help us reach out to as many as possible our first rescue of the day a python that has slithered its way into a backyard and we're off to catch it and release it back into the wild so they've given me a pair of gloves i'm gonna assist in some way uh if it's not too dangerous of course yeah this is exciting [Music] so the key is to just be calm just to be calm yeah because he doesn't see me as a threat so he's pretty chill here you go all right rescue one done next stop a student care center a baby common palm civet was found ambling around and it sounds like it's in distress okay okay i'm just gonna give him a bit of electrolyte see whether he takes it oh they go civics are nocturnal so they aren't a common sight in the day but even if you've never seen them you might have tasted the poop these mammals can excrete one of the most expensive coffee beans in the world kopi luwak [Music] how is it he seems a bit wet so there was a bit of concern now whether he whether it was blood or anything like that but no see no issues so he looks alert civics typically live in forests but the adaptable creature is also comfortable among trees in urban areas for this babysitter kali thinks his mother could be nearby so they've just identified this area as a possible place to release a civet i mean it's really ideal because it's a huge tree where it can kind of climb up and make itself comfortable [Music] but my euphoria didn't last long it's a rescue that needs our immediate attention she sounded quite panicky if you wait too long the animal can die from dehydration bleeding that can be fatal none of my previous rescues prepared me for what i'm about to see next oh there it is yeah i see it oh no it looks dead it looks dead i don't know this is life it's a sunda kalugo that's on the brink of death alive they're saying that it's still alive but it's not moving as much as it was i don't need to rush this because it's barely alive this is one of only two species of kalugos found in the world and these tree dwellers can travel up to 136 meters in a single glide that's longer than the length of a football field carla thinks this baby might have flown straight into this barbed wire a 2007 study estimated that just one thousand of them are left here and that's why every single one matters yeah it seems like one of it one of its body parts is stuck in the wire oh it's bad oh it is it's very bad so it's twisted i mean i can't even imagine how terrifying this must be for the creature yeah there you go after 15 minutes the kalugo is finally released [Music] it's okay it's all right it's gonna be okay oh so we need to go back and check exactly which part of the the wing the potato the injuries are yeah it looked quite bad any delay in treatment could reduce its chance of survival oh boy [Music] yeah so you've just snipped off the entire this is the part that was torn and probably um hooked onto the wire so it's all dead membrane we just removed it and there's no bleeding so what's your assessment of the situation so far it's actually pretty good he can be reunited with this mommy great and after eight hours three successful rescues i've come to see how crucial a role the team here plays in preserving our wildlife but just when i thought my day was over well i just got a call from akers that they just rescued one of the most elusive creatures in the world and it's now at the zoo so i'm rushing there now i'm about to come face to face with a species that's not just critically endangered here but also all around the world this is the sunda pangolin it's one of the three critically endangered species of pangolins in the world [Music] it's very typical of pangolins to come out of their natural habitat to just explore we're going to give him a sedative pangolins are sent to the zoo whenever they're rescued this one was found curled up and stranded on a road divider and sent here to be examined pangolins are the only mammals in the world with these protective scales and this feature has made them the most traffic mammal in the world more than a million of them have been poached and killed for their scales in the last decade people actually believe that those skills give people strength they're actually just made out of keratin which is the same thing that you have with your fingernails so people might as well just eat their fingernails now that it's fully sedated the team needs to work fast two hours and longer yeah then you'll start seeing blood pressure is dropping even and within seconds dr abraham spots the first sign of trouble a laceration on its tail most probably the animal got himself caught in some netting somewheres the team needs to run more tests to determine the full extent of its injury so they've just taken it into a separate room and they've laid it on the table i think they're going to do some scans on it now the wound on the tail that bone is slightly affected you have to also make sure that the internal structures are okay the mood in here is quite serious i guess there's a lot at stake when you're dealing with an animal that is really endangered so we're just going to clean the room [Music] beside these phones he's actually in very good condition so you're generally quite happy with what you're seeing now i guess everyone in here is quite relieved that is healthy enough to be rehabilitated into the wild the final procedure a microchip implant with a unique identification code it's part of regional efforts to collect data on this elusive creature [Music] c583 it's nice to see these penguins in singapore actually most of them are in really good condition when they come into us as opposed to the regional countries where they see animals that come in under large confiscations and the animals are half dead because they are endangered every single individual place of age if we don't intervene if we don't try to help it these things don't actually have a chance [Music] habitat loss however isn't the only threat to our most endangered native species meet the invader and you might well have played a role in this invasion i've come face to face with rare creatures this is the penguin yes and rescued wildlife in distress oh there you go you're getting more urbanized so more animals are being seen in public places but habitat loss isn't the only threat there's also alien species that threaten to evict them from their homes darren is studying one particular intruder [Music] hey darren what's a lot looking at the experiment in progress now the two of them are going to start fighting each other the defender the lowland freshwater crab that's native to our island the challenger the red claw crayfish a species that doesn't belong here the crayfish if it decides to start looking for a shelter it will try to evict the crab these red claw crayfish were first brought in through the aquarium trade and released into our reservoirs by irresponsible pet owners [Music] oh he's going straight for it oh oh he's actually going in oh my goodness and it doesn't take long to see why these guys are a threat well it looks like the crab is trying to defend its home the crab just doesn't want to go out right when you lose your shelter that makes you more prone to predation is pushing the crap out and look at that show of aggression right there if this were the wild this crab would be toast should we be concerned well invasive species are among the top threats to biodiversity they are breeding in the wild and their numbers are significant enough that they are spreading from the reservoirs where many of them were initially introduced to other water bodies including sometimes to some of the forest streams where our native freshwater crabs are living ultimately this becomes a concern because some of our species are found in singapore nowhere else in the world this could even potentially lead to extinction it's complete extinction these crayfish have already been found close to the habitats of some of our three native crabs that exist only in singapore and one of these species ranks among the world's hundred most endangered the singapore freshwater crab it was originally known to be found in just three streams on our island these crabs are particularly fussy about where they live they're sensitive to changes in the environment and climate change is shrinking their options daniel is trying to introduce them into more streams across the island it must be the tiniest crab i've ever seen in my life it's like not even the size of my eye [Music] he's among the first to successfully breed them in captivity these five to eight-month-old hatchlings are his 17th and 18th batch and today we're going to be releasing them into the wild [Music] daniel you're so fast i can't even keep up oh my god treacherous the survival of these tiny invertebrates hinges on a magnitude of factors they need fast flowing hill streams with the right ph level and a high amount of oxygen changes in weather patterns could affect their survival okay so we have reached the place that we are releasing the crabs that's a lot of demands for something so tiny what's at stake if this species vanishes from our hill streams it plays a number of roles in the ecosystem it will feed on leaf litter as well as also the animals that's present in the stream it is also a opportunistic predator who will predate on small animals inside the stream so all these species are part of the ecosystem or interdependent on each other with the removal of one species such as the singapore freshwater crab it may have an adverse impact on the stream ecosystem and potentially affect the entire stream ecosystem as well as its other inhabitants so then with the loss of one species could the ecosystem collapse it's possible there's still so much that scientists don't know but if one tiny critter can potentially have a huge impact on our ecosystem what about the most prolific group in the animal kingdom the insects i want to find out more so i'm meeting someone who cares for more than 21 000 insects including some native species what is that oh this is the red ring giant green stick insect oh my goodness they're actually local to singapore [Music] also under her care are some endangered species [Music] delvin wastes no time in putting me to work i will need you to help me sweep up all the fresh that's accumulated on the newspaper over here gotta be careful not to kill any of them we're killing an endangered species can i move the bottles a bit yeah oh there you go is that clean enough does that make you happy uh yes most people think of insects as pests why do you care so much about insects invertebrates are very unique they play a part in almost every ecological process out there we need them more than they need us insects are responsible for approximately 80 of the pollination out there pollination is needed for crops and that gives us food security [Music] pollinators are responsible for fertilizing 35 of the food crops we consume without them most plants can't disperse their pollen and butterflies are among some of the most important pollinators we are going to collect some butterflies i'm going to show you how it's done so we gently grab them and hold them by the wings and then we drop them into the basket over here okay oh this thing just sprayed something on me yeah it's a defense mechanism it excretes some liquid what was that like uh don't worry it's nothing it's just a normal excretion that is quite common after they have must be something gross right that's why you're not telling me we're gonna be releasing them into the [Music] [Applause] aviary most of the time we tend to undermine the roles of insects in our ecosystem but we have discovered approximately a million species at the same time scientists also predict there's so many more out there that we still have yet to discover having not discovered them we don't exactly understand the total impact how much are we benefiting from them okay so we're gonna release the butterflies now and you can do the honest really yes oh wow [Music] scientists believe that there could be almost 7 million species still waiting to be found globally about 18 000 are discovered every year [Music] and recently some scientists suspect that one creature found in our forests could be a new species of a worm that's older than the dinosaurs [Music] yeah so this worm is at least 500 million years old wow but you can find them in in the forest in singapore profile and his team are interested in its excrement wow that's a lot of slime if you missed that here it is again [Applause] yeah you see you can see how my finger is just sticking to that like that yeah that's exactly the function of it the slime hardens quickly but what's unique is that it can dissolve in water over time profili and his team are trying to identify the chemical properties that make this possible and once they unlock this mystery they can synthetically create a similar material that could hopefully replace plastic you could dump it in the ocean and it would degrade into amino acids that any living creature could recycle so then as a scientist would you say that you constantly look to nature as kind of this treasure trove of solutions uh yes in all nature there's many many solutions have been solved over millions of years of evolution for a specific problem that's the case for many other organisms on the planet including here there's many things you can learn from many many different living creatures [Music] the team is also studying a shrimp that can punch hundreds of times above its weight oh here we go started attacking me [Music] well actually you took it it just knocked it right out of my tweezers some mantis shrimp species have two hammer-like clubs see those they allow the mantis shrimp to strike their prey with the force of a bullet without any damage to itself and so we're looking at the material that is made of any material that has to be impact resistant like bulletproof vessel for instance or uh maybe new kind of light lightweight uh helmet you know this kind of uh of a structure could be potentially you every organism has some secret to tell us the biodiversity the the more you you discover the more you look at it the more chance you have to discover something which is completely unexpected for centuries we've looked to nature for answers leonardo da vinci conceived the idea of human flight by studying birds the bullet train's design was inspired by the kingfisher's beak and more than a hundred medical drugs are derived from compounds found in plants but recent science has also uncovered that nature doesn't just heal our bodies you maybe begin to close your eyes but also our souls i just felt like you know this very profound sense of [Music] rediscovery i've discovered that nature holds the secrets to modern day problems well actually it took it this slime is basically a natural bioplastic but recent science has also uncovered that nature can have healing powers on our mind and body i want to put that to the test so i signed up for a forest bathing session one of the latest wellness trends in singapore you know never in a million years would i have thought of walking through a housing estate under some mrt tracks and then finding myself in this green oasis earlier on this is also a plot human is my guide she is just one of seven certified forest therapy guides in singapore hello nice to see you again okay so um this is a mat for you thank you is everyone comfortable yeah it's kind of yes yeah can we take off our shoes you can if you want to so this invitation is called pleasures of presence finding pleasure as you become present then when you're ready when you're settled you feel that you have found a comfortable place to look at and then you maybe begin to close your eyes not available a compound that protects them from disease and bacteria and inhaling them can boost our immunity and reduce stress so taking your time slowly rising with your eyes closed just allow your vision to come in a soft focus take our time [Music] and then notice this whole space that you are in by your sense of sight what are you noticing when we were doing that rotational thing i just felt like you know this very profound sense of rediscovery i just really thought of you know that moment when you're a fetus and you're coming out of your of your mom's womb and and really opening your eyes for the first time and i just can't imagine how that must feel i felt for the fetus that i was several decades ago wishing that hoping that my birth was as peaceful as what i just experienced [Music] i can't believe it i just waxed lyrical about my birth these phyton sites are clearly doing something to my head next up a slow wonder through the forest i get what this is now it is a moving experiential meditation session followed by 10 minutes of water gazing literally i feel like i'm in japan right now and finally a tea ceremony to end the session so so far the people i've been speaking to have been trying to educate me about nature in very scientific ways now having experienced nature in a very physical manner has made it a whole lot more personal [Music] so naturally i've jumped at the next chance to get back into the wilderness but this time to see the rescued pangolin i saw just days ago after being treated at the zoo it's being picked up by anne parks for its release back into the wild so i can't reveal my location but what i can tell you is that we are somewhere deep in the jungle so when deciding on a site to release it what are the factors you consider we have to consider whether there's sufficient food whether there's some shelter and most importantly away from the roads we also see how many that we release our males here i said how many females you cannot have a bachelor group here right right so we all have to be taking a lot into consideration it's very quiet so most likely we need some coaxing so but let's try pangolins typically produce only one or two offspring every year and they're notoriously hard to breed in captivity so it's crucial to create the best chances for this spatula to sow his seeds in the wild so it's just curled up into a ball right now um it is very frightened and very scared so the ant parks officers are just trying to coax it into into being less afraid i suppose what what do you want for it that we find a partner and repopulate it yeah yes yes he's speeding up he's sleeping that's some heavy expectations but the survival of his species depends on it well i hope he gets it on soon [Music] but if anything recent history has shown us that locally extinct wildlife can return it's a tale embodied by one particular species that's one of bernard's favorite subjects look there they are there they are hello hey there's so many of them we have two species of otters in singapore the smooth coated otter and its more elusive cousin the asian small clawed otter that's found only on pulau ubin watching them i find it hard to believe that they were once extinct locally they disappeared in the 1960s when our rivers became so heavily polluted that no marine life could survive they probably went down the coast and went to malaysia and why did they return what did we do differently what happened was when we cleaned up our waterways they were spotted again in the late 90s so the authors are a success story right does this mean that we could actually attract more species back to singapore if we do more so our smooth quoted orders are very urban and adaptive species but not all animals that we find in singapore are this adaptive singapore mainland doesn't have ideal habitats for example for the asian small clock to thrive they need shallower waters they need a mangrove habitat they need extruding habitats so it's important that we preserve some existing forests mangrove areas in the next episode when a forest is fragmented they start to unravel they start to lose diversity they start to become very disturbed the race to save our wildlife from extinction has already begun we are talking about species which are under threat because we know so little about them i find out what it takes oh my goodness it's so soft never in my life would i have imagined getting so excited about picking up someone else's and whether it's too late to turn back the clock one thing particularly worrying is that we're getting rare threatened species as [Music] roadkill ,False,True,False,False

Prof Mohan K Isaac, University of Western Australia, Australia","good evening one and all I welcome you to today's webinar on response to mental health crisis of coab it 19 global perspectives we have over 81 participants who have already logged in and I thank you all for participating in such large numbers I am dr. Bob acaba Chavez and it is my pleasure to facilitate this webinar we have with us today our esteemed Secretary Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India miss Preeti Sutton who has been the key strategist in times of the covert pandemic we are also honored to have with us the stalwarts and icons of psychiatry and delegates both nationally and internationally who have graciously ugly to participate in this webinar and we are all eagerly waiting to interact with them so without further ado I had a quest our head of the department professor Fatima muti to welcome this virtual gathering and good evening to most people I think many people have joined around the world or either in the afternoon or early evening and so good evening to all of you I think it would be very appropriate to say that you know we've never imagined in our lifetime that we'd be going through moments like this just a decade ago we were rejoicing in the fact that the world was flat and we were rejoicing globalisation and now we're at a moment where we're wondering whether we the world is going to get flattened and how are we going to manage the times ahead there's been a lot of you know emphasis on physical distancing we realized like never before the importance despite physical a distancing we've realized for the first time in our lives Eve it's the greatest importance of staying connected of learning from each other of networking of learning both what we should be doing and what we should not be doing in terms of addressing the pandemic the Kobuk pandemic hasn't been just a physical pandemic in terms of affecting our physical states it's really unleashed a whole lot of mental distress we've known about the worried well people with depression anxiety various kinds of psychological distress uncertainty and anxiety and particularly in marginalized communities the effects of these can be extremely devastating we also know about the economic kind of challenges that in turn can you know aggravate the mental health problems at the same time I think we understand the importance of resilience more than ever and in times of these uncertainties how is it that we can learn how to cope how can we be less vulnerable and come out of this stronger that's why we need people to come together and try and see how we can find solutions so we yeah so this is truly a webinar with the difference we've had we have a set of global stalwarts from Australia professor Mohan Isaac from the United States professor Micelli Kevin from Canada professor Lakshmi Arthur from the UK professor Benesch Mogra and closer home our beloved director professor bien Ganga other who are really going to talk about the impact of the the COBIT pandemic not only in the countries that they're located in but what lessons it has for the world how do we address the public in terms of mental health how do we look at underprivileged to societies what might happen after the pandemic ah the common thread that connects you know all the speakers is that the four of them are visiting professors in the Department of Psychiatry we've never had an opportunity before to actually bring them together on a common platform and this is the red banner that offers us this particular opportunity and we're very very glad to have them not only do they bring in the expertise of the countries they work in they have mentored several young psychiatrists from India and I'm sure the wisdom that they bring will help us to find not not only to understand the challenges but to find solutions to this huge crisis ahead of us the icing on the cake is of course that you know as dr. Gangadhar mentioned we have a amidst missus pretty Sudan the secretary a Health and Family Welfare Government of India and we couldn't have hoped for a better person to actually inaugurate this program after releasing the newsletter Samet worm which was brought out by our Center for integrated medicine at NIMH hands under the leadership of Professor Ganga and professor Scheele Rama so she's going to do that and inaugurate this webinar as all of you know babaca described as her as a strategist and i think particularly she's always been one and particularly in the Corbett crisis her leadership has been exemplary she has a particular interest in mental health is actually written about the crisis of mental health and what might be the factors contributing to it she has brought about several people together to bring about material awareness material start a helpline strengthen the state government responses to the mental health crisis increase prevention of mental health problems improve awareness and importantly reducing the stigma and the fear around Corbett so madam we're very very grateful for your taking time off to be with us this evening and we really look forward to your inaugural address we also have in amongst us mr. Neil ambush Sharon economic adviser to the Government of India as well as a joint secretary responsible for NIMH hands and he's been extremely supportive to us in honor activities and I'm sure has Health Institute grow from strength to strength so we'd like to welcome you sir and I will not stand between you and the speakers but before I conclude I'd like to welcome our large audience you know we've had about 300 registered participants with many of them have logged in now we're hoping that more of you will log in and I'm sure this is going to be an intellectual as well as an emotional treat for all of you and I hope you enjoy the two hours ahead I'd like to kind in a welcome speech you don't normally thank people but I'd like to thank professor Naveen and the team for actually bringing this all together and bringing us all together on this flat welcome once again and thank you all very much Thank You Man we now move forward to the release of a quarterly newsletter so much more from the department of integrated medicine of NIMH hands I hereby request mrs. Patil then to release I thank you man I request our esteemed health secretary ma'am to deliver the inaugural address very much professor eminent national and international experts my colleague in ambush participants ladies and gentlemen I think professor Abbott Emma materially said very well humanity has actually rarely expressed and experienced such a collective sense of vulnerability in fact I would like to say that if we could express our experience of a relative or maybe that that will help us to overcome the stress and anxiety that all of us are feeling at this point of time I begin with expressing my gratitude to demands our premier Institute dealing with mental health and also all our national and international Institute's that are dealing with very sensitive subject of mental health and showing us the way ahead thank you very much actually the present pandemic has posed a dual challenge for the body and the mind so sure psychosocial if health effects of over 19 remain unseen and I'm sure are going to last longer than the physical trends in India our challenge has been huge you see this is also due to our social settings our then sleeping settings and the cordial and social gatherings that we are used to the physical meetings that weekend the celebrations India is a actually nation of festivals we are unable to celebrate we are unable to actually get together because we do have to observe physical and social distancing not only for ourselves but also to keep our loved one safe and this all has led to stress and anxiety stigma and fake news also has actually contributed to people feeling very anxious and also very stressful there have been in the recent past suicides I think out of bewilderment and also out of not realizing and not being able to reach out physically to their loved ones so this webinar is very timely I would like to also say that we have in the ministry recognized the need to set up special resources for addressing issues of stress anxiety and mental health it's a fact that our own mental health survey of 15 and 16 2015 16 showed that there is prevalence of mental health issues of varying degree I mean it's it's not not all are very severe and 150 million Indians need active mental health intervention but very few fewer than 13 million seeking it we are actually quite you know hesitant to talk about these issues I wish we could discuss our stress our anxiety our depression with our loved ones just as we discussed our diabetes or hypertension or our other diseases so I think I must come for India also true of knowledge and talk about mental health and I think I must thank demands under the leadership of dr. van Garderen that we have actually put in a lot of effort but there is a national mental health mental health helpline run by newman's which is then on-boarded by various states in their vernacular languages there this helpline has been widely publicized we have a separate section on behavioral health and social or psychosocial resources on our website our website has you board ship running into millions so that is also very helpful we have videos and small clips helping people to to cope and go and to see those even if they are in isolation so that it can help them cope with stress we have actually there is a dedicated site called copied warrior . as a nicely dot in which actually has about one hundred and sixteen thousand psychology and social welfare professionals which are line listed as four districts and this has been done this this aggregation of human resource has been done so that at the disaggregated level the concerned administrators the concerned doctors the concerned institutions can avail of the services of these very efficient and I would say a precious resource to deploy them in settings which will they will be useful and they will be helpful and we've had nearly 2.5 million viewers on webinar and courses related to bubut and mental health together but I am saying well this is just tell the participants and our experts that what we are doing is only a drop in the ocean we need further guidance on how we could take further and help and reach out to people and we are especially we want to start a communication theory is engaging specialists experts and achievers from various walks of life to give educational and motivational talks so that people can be reached far and wide and you would like to translate this into or netilat languages because India is so diverse so I would request this Wagner to also address how you could help us how we could reach out to people and I close with thanking our experts for participating and also thanking in enhance for taking this initiative this very very important initiative and we must have many such webinars in the future also thank you thank you mom for your enlightening words before we start off with the sessions we have a few housekeeping announcements we want this webinar to be as interactive as possible so please feel free to type your questions on the chat box which has been made available to you on the webinar platform and through the YouTube live streaming the link of which has been already circulated since we have several speakers so please type in name of the speaker you want the question to be dressed to kindly keep your microphones muted during the speeches and all the questions will be taken up at the end of the final presentations so with this I now request dr. Neha Kulkarni to introduce us to our first speaker good evening a first speaker of the day being dr. Lakshmi Adam who's the professor and head Department of Psychiatry and director at Institute of Mental Health University of British Columbia Canada he is the president of world federation of societies for Biological Psychiatry editor-in-chief of Canada and Journal of Psychiatry his areas of interest being bipolar disorder with more than 330 publications in the field he is been his accolades include Mogens Co award general Thurman award and Calvin price for bipolar mood disorder research is one of the top 1% of highly cited researchers I now invite professor Lakshmi Adam to deliver his talk on addressing mental health needs of the public the platform is your circle maybe click the presentation mode yeah okay perfect thanks very much first of all let me say it is such a delight to see so many colleagues and I want to thank for the opportunity to share what we who learned about the mental health impact of Kobe 19 with with all of you so I think this slide is has been circulating around for quite some time and I'm fairly sure that many of you will have seen this and you'll see this in patients presentation as well so what this shows is what typically happens during a pandemic and that is in the set of four earlier stages the acute care beds are overstretched and then around that time are slightly after mental health problems are so begin to emerge and then steadily increase with time now of course with co19 this pandemic is probably something that's not none of us have ever seen meaning that there's probably nothing like this that we witnessed in our lifetime so far and so as we look to the future I think there are a lot of uncertainties in terms of how this is going to evolve in looking at them some of the numbers this morning I think so far something like thirteen and a half million people have been affected and close to 600,000 people have died so far so I think one thing that is probably very clear is that there is going to be a significant mental health impact or aftermath and some might even call it a mental health endemic so to speak how bad that's going to be is anyone's guess at this point in time let's go to the next slide please so there are many factors that likely will contribute to the mental health impact of this pandemic and I just think about five of those the first one being and probably one of the most important ones is fear of contracting the disease and also passing the disease on to some of the loud ones and this is a obviously a major source of stress and I think to mitigate the risk of spread as we all know many countries around the world had implemented lockdown some of those have been lifted and some of the countries have begun to re-implement these lock downs again and I think one of the consequences of these lock downs is that they tend to disrupt our social rhythms our daily routines and we know that our biological clocks are entrained by these social rhythms and when those biological clocks are disturbed they tend to lead to depressive symptoms can we go to the next slide please so this is a study we did very recently just trying to understand that relationship between social rhythm irregularities and stress and depressive symptoms and what we found was that there is a significant negative correlation between stress and social rhythm irregularity and equally importantly we found in our recent study that there is a clear relationship between development of depressive symptoms and social rhythm irregularity so clearly disturbance in these social routines seem to have a significant negative impact on mental health let's go to the next slide please and there are obviously other consequences of this pandemic economic impact is another massive one with job losses and businesses being shut down with service industry self affected most gently go back go back to the previous line so that's another significant risk factor traumatic experiences of witnessing relatives being admitted of hospitals being on ventilators relatives friends acquaintances dying obviously or major stressful factors and lastly we also know the Y was itself seems to affect the body in many different ways particularly its impact on the immune system and also we know that it enters the body through the ACE 2 receptors and these these are all expressed in some of the areas of the brain that are intimately involved in emergence of the mental health symptoms so areas such as hippocampus amygdala and some of the Mona in the music nucleate regions as well so there are many reasons as to why this pandemic might have a significant impact of mental health next let's for the next slide please so I think how these factors impact that really depends on which group one might belong to so for example for someone that's in the front line as a healthcare worker fear of contracting the disease and spreading that to two loud ones is a massive risk risk factor and of course those with the pre-existing mental health conditions many of these tend to operate and there are many others as well well let's go to the next slide please now the challenge though is that you know we all do believe for the reasons that that I have outlined that this pandemic is going to have a significant impact on mental health but unfortunately the data so far it comes regressing what the impact is is of very poor quality so if one looks at what's been published in various journals many of them are opinion pieces with not much data and most of the data that's been collected still go back please bring us like most of the data that's been collected instead of based on surveys and many of these surveys have not used these sort of a best methodological strategies to to estimate the impact so there are numerous methodological problems with these studies let's go to the next slide so this is a survey that was done in Canada and again these surveys are done on a weekly basis and depending upon when the results come out the sort of percentages tend to vary but I think most of these surveys tend to look at some of the common problems such as anxiety depression substance use and as you can see approximately a quarter of the population seem to endorse each of those things let's go to the next slide please so what about the studies that are being done and I think most of the data that has been published comes from some of the studies that have been done in China and this is a systematic review which included about 12 said 'yes with about 27,000 people and this systematic review suggests that about a quarter of population are endorsing anxiety symptoms and approximately similar number endorsing depressive symptoms and also substance use as well now don't forget that these results are based on in very sort of blunt instruments such as PhD nine or gat seven or Gattu you know things like that let's do the next slide so this is another more systematic review with more patient's are more respondents included in these studies and again the numbers seem to be fairly similar ranging from a quarter to a third of population endorsing stress or anxiety and depression so I think it's fairly clear about a third or a quarter of the population have these symptoms the what's unclear is how many of these people actually meet the criteria for some of the dsm-5 or ICD disorders and that research is is still not there or not out there is yet let's go to the next slide please so this was a study that was done a key BC again looking at about 3,000 people and these people have been asked to complete questionnaires on a weekly basis and this is sort of methodology everybody seems to be using these days and as with the other surveys and studies the UBC study also found fairly high incidence of depression and anxiety and in this particular study our colleagues looked at what are some of the predictors of increase in depressive symptoms in the in respondents and they found again not surprisingly low income difficulties with school and work social isolation concerns about getting basic necessities so some of the risk factors that we talked about seem to be the ones that seem to predict some of these mental health symptoms let's go to the next slide please so if a quarter 2/3 of population are being are likely to be affected by this pandemic and comes to the mental health concerns the question is you know how do we how do we address the needs of these populations so this is an editorial that we published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry where we address in detail what are some of the strategies that one might use to address the needs of those four groups that that I've talked about earlier on and that is you know if you have someone in the general population that has mental health issues sweaters on the main strategies one might imply versus someone with a pre-existing mental health conditions or frontline health workers are those that had coded 19 now we'll talk about some of these in terms of what we've done how in managing this issue within BC so let's go to the next slide please so what we saw with this pandemic I think like everyone else we were fundamental health perspective anyway we were expecting the worst but - but luckily enough in BC our chief medical officer has managed the pandemic quite well in collaboration with our health authorities so we all work together so during the acute phase at least within BC although we were expecting the worst even from the medical perspective our system was not stretched at all and in total we only had about 3,000 cases of code 19 within within the province of British Columbia but from the mental health perspective we were also expecting significant surge in demand and so we had pre-planned by preparing for the worst case scenario in terms of creating koete cohort units and redesigning our mental health services but to our surprise what we actually found in the initial days at least was that there was a 40 percent reduction in bed occupancy so number of our mental health beds were empty and as we as the pandemic a world what we found was that many patients were afraid to come into the hospital because they were concerned about getting contracted with the the Coheed 19 so that was that was one of the reasons for people sort of shying away from the hospital in the initial days although that has changed since then now we're back to 105 percent in occupancy which sort of goes with the the expected increase in mental health problems that that most people have predicted again in the initial days of pandemic our outpatient activity reduced by 50% and we swiftly switch to a transition to what to a care with 95% of our outpatient activity was done through the virtual strategies using zoom and many of the other strategies the carico head unit that we had created most of them were empty so we finally end up switching to one unit where most of our patients were admitted so we've been incredibly lucky in BC in managing this exceptionally well let's go to the next slide please so what we've done apart from just addressing the hospital situation as I mentioned earlier one of the major reasons as to why you know we've been so successful in BC I think had to do with the consistent messaging from our chief medical officer and also chief medical officer working with health authorities what one doesn't want to see is what Trump is doing minimizing the problem and giving messages that are inconsistent and and clearly erroneous so so that's obviously what's causing huge challenges in the US we create a crisis line the volumes for crisis line went up by something like 400 percent and those continue to be high but also our we our government you have about five million dollars to beef up our virtual mental health system capacity in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association so that anyone with you know depression anxiety symptoms can access online CBT with coaching support and that has had a huge impact we are working on redesigning the social rhythm therapy based on some of the research that we've conducted and the way hoping that we'll be ready for deployment in the in the near future we also made sure that some of the frontline healthcare workers needs were addressed so within each of our health authorities we established teams that were available to provide psychological debriefing for our friend line health care workers and for our physicians we worked with the doctors of BC to set up a virtual mental health care system so that any physician that has had any mental health issues can can access these services quite rapidly so by providing access to a number of these psychological supports we were able to address the mental health needs of the frontline health care workers and also our general public quite rapidly and all of these have had significant impact and finally I think some of you may have heard about what the government's in each of the power provinces and the Canadian government has done in supporting the financial impact of this Kovach 19 by providing wage subsidies to people and also providing business loans to to businesses to support their their activities so I think we've used sort of a multi-pronged strategy strategies to to some extent I would say to mute the mental health impact after co19 so far but just looking at what's happening in the rest of the world we're not done with it and worst is yet to come we are preparing for the second and the subsequent subsequent ways just go to the next slide please and that's going to be my last leg so as he heard I think one of the major strategies that's been incredibly helpful is the is the transition to that which will care strategy and our government has recognized that and our Prime Minister has announced 250 million dollars to further refine our virtual care strategy so this is an editorial that we published basically pleading to our prime minister that this is great that you're investing this much money but let's just make sure that it is invested in right areas although transition to virtual care has been incredibly Swift there are a number of issues with the virtual care strategists including things like privacy so all of those issues are addressed and this in this editorial so I'm going to stop there and thank you very much for your attention thank you selflessly ting the importance of mental health needs of the public I now first doctor pratik Varshney to introduce us to our second speaker thank you dr. Veronica it is an honor for me to be introducing the next speaker professor Denis bubela to his various credentials there is being the former president of the world Psychiatric Association the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association currently he's the emeritus professor of mental health and cultural diversity at King's College London his areas of interest include cultural and social aspects of mental health including Social Anthropology and community psychiatry and history of medicine and policymaking his interest has led to research and publication of more than 450 articles in national and international journals of repute he has authored more than 40 books which have been translated into various languages including Japanese and Chinese in 2019 he was awarded the book of the year for his textbook of public mental health for his research and work he has been the recipient of many honorable which include the coveted commander of British Empire in 2012 the Lifetime Achievement Award from the AFP a the honoris causa from National University of Paraguay and the prestigious presidential medal from the president of Indian psychiatric society I would now like to invite dr. professor Dogra to deliver his speech on mental health of the underprivileged during over 90 you right while their slides are loading [Music] okay can everybody see that yes sir okay and right it's a great privilege to be sharing the platform with stalwarts of Psychiatry particularly need sort of global pandemic and I think it is absolutely critical that we learn from each other and we have a global response rather than each country are thinking as if the virus knows our walls and nose needs visas across countries I am what I'm going to do is right bear with me I'm gonna sort of present some findings from a major report at a public health England had done on underprivileged populations in the UK and you may have seen the headlines that South Asians are much more likely to have died from kovat are both as members of the National Health Service and the frontline staff but also I in the general population and just to remind us that underprivileged populations generally mean women children elderly minority racial groups I think minorities LGBT populations people those who are poor unemployed living in overcrowded conditions and I think the challenge does remain about definitions and heterogeneity of groups I'm going to focus on race gender and poverty I haven't got data on LGBT populations I'm not going to be covering that but again I'm not going to define race and ethnicity I think people are aware of that and I am so it's basically the things that we need to be bearing in mind that racial groups are not genetically discrete often they're not reliably measured and certainly they are not scientifically very meaningful but these and feed into racism and particularly in you would have been aware of the tragic murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and subsequent campaign around the globe on black lives matter and it is also worth bearing in mind that there is a difference between race and culture and they carry different meanings and we have known for a very long time certainly since the 1960s that the rates of various aquatic disorders are higher in some black Asian minority ethnic groups we know that schizophrenia is much higher in African Caribbeans depression is much higher in South Asian as a deliberate self-harm and particularly Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations in the UK have shown much higher rates of depression and in the minority ethnic groups there is also a challenge that we do not know enough about East European groups and these variations have been attributed to a number of factors such as genetic and dabney in it I'm but 30 years ago there was a theory that it is all about winter birds then it was about frederik complications are particularly among african Caribbeans and there have been studies which have argued that there are social and psychological factors whether these are related to structural racism or not but what that has meant is that quite often this leads to misdiagnosis over diagnosis culture conflict etc and we know that the help-seeking is delayed in many ethnic groups because they they are not aware of what where to go what to do they may have very different models of explanation of their distress so they may seek help elsewhere in in the UK certainly till a few years ago every summer there would be Hakeem's and words coming from India to our places where there are large South Asian populations I had say it's a very different issue related to help seeking and we know that South Asian populations particularly have much higher rates of diabetes mellitus of hypertension high levels of obesity and other chronic physical illnesses such as osteoarthritis arthritis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mean I know it you know black lives matters campaign has shown that there is a challenge in terms of structural racism in the society and it is quite evident that even when within the lockdown quite often black drivers or people of color who were out were much more likely to have been stopped by the police and we know that from the National Health Service that they're less likely to be listened to for whistleblowing and they're more likely to be low paid out frontline and care home staff particularly from the Philippines and East European and they have had more problems in accessing personal products equipment just to illustrate that the deaths rates due to co-ed among Asian the nation British have been 1.5 times those of white population I'm among blacks they've been 1.7 a mixed ethnicity in 1.6 and others non-white is 1.3 and risk of dying following a positive test is two times higher for the Bangladeshi group one point four times for the Pakistani group and one point three times higher for the Chinese group and these findings are from the public health England report and as I said that they've been consistently higher rates for other ethnic groups sometimes almost equal as in other Asian or in odd Black Caribbean particularly risk of dying well which is higher for the Indian group but if you have diabetes type one and your hba1c is equal to or less than 58 millimoles in the previous year your risk of dying is twice I but if it is more than 58 then it goes up to our nearly three times and similar differences in diabetes type two and interestingly there's been a scale where they have looked at the what they describe as Cove adage which summarizes vulnerability for combination of risk factors and they may each risk factor and because women are generally said to be more protected by their Cove adage is lower I for example healthy white women aged 40 will have a ecovillage of 32 I whereas white man aged 45 with BMI of 36 and severe asthma will have a cove at age of 45 five years for BMI 36 and four years for severe asthma therefore giving an overall age of 54 and in Asian women age 50 with diabetes type 2 to H be aired a1c over 58 has covered age of 50 minus 8 because she's a woman plus 5 plus 10 so her kovat ages 57 so added years of age for Asians or Asian British are four years for blacks is six I for mixed ethnicity is five and four others non-white is three so you can see the moderately there's a moderately robust or provisional evidence for that so similarly due to BMI if your BMI is between thirty to thirty four point nine it adds four years to your life are between thirty five and thirty nine point nine it adds five years and if it's over forty it adds ten years and similarly the moderately robust data and diabetes type one adds years to your covert life similarly with other chronic conditions heart failure add its chances of dying of cobra two point three times are years added nine similarly in cerebral vascular disease and the evidence for these is moderately robust and it is again I mean if you look at organ transplant if you had an organ transplant then your chances of dying from kovat is four point three times higher and it adds sixteen years to your covert life so again I'm not going to go through that but it's consistent the findings released by public health England about two weeks ago suggest that risk of dying following testing positive I seventy times higher in people eighty years or older than those under forty higher in males higher in those living in more deprived areas and in a black Asian and minority ethnic groups even when it's just adjusted for age sex deprivation etc say ethnicity and income inequality are independently associated with covert 19 mortality and as Lakshmi's already mentioned I'm not gonna go through that but it's also worth bearing in mind that BMI populations in the UK I work in occupations which place them at increased exposure as I said the got a lot of them had been working in social care homes a lot of them had been at front-line NHS staff but also driving buses there was a rather tragic incidence of a bus driver who had been spat on by somebody who had co-ed dying off a covert subsequently and BMA individuals use public transport to travel to work and there are I mean obviously long-standing inequalities at public health England did a survey qualitative survey with about 4,000 are qualitative interviews looking at the risk to exposure and risk of complications they are dying from Ovid 19 and it is important sort of recognize that minority populations and underprivileged groups also have much more eye issues related to diet for that smoking infectious diseases at etcetera although women are less likely be infected or develop co-head i but there's clear evidence that violence against women and girls has increased exponentially and over two hundred forty three million women and girls have been subjected to sexual and physical violence in the previous 12 months this is general intimate partner violence and there's been increase in france for example by 30 percent since the lockdown in argentina by 25 percent similar figures in Cyprus Singapore Canada Germany I'm and UK there's been a rise of domestic violence with increased demands for emergency shelters and it is also that women quite often are in insecure jobs so they're losing their jobs and economic pressures create additional problems and we know from previous outbreaks that Wilde's once the epidemic pandemic is over men's economic activity may return to pre-crisis levels but impact on women's economic security tends to last much longer so the global recession that will occur is likely to contribute to a dip in women's income and unpaid care work and pushing more women into poverty so the key messages are that we need to be aware of a long-standing impact of social and economic inequalities and pandemic has just brought this to the forefront underprivileged groups are more likely to be as exposed to risk I have higher risk of complications and this may be related to issues to stigma discrimination or racism lack of trust etc so just to conclude that in underprivileged groups are suffered more disproportionately they also have higher levels of comorbidities and what we need to be looking at is both sort of structural changes this is not a band amic which is affecting countries in isolation this is a global issue which needs global solutions and global work to get to the next stage I had once again thank you very much for inviting me and thanks very much for listening happy to take questions thank you sir for highlighting the mental health concerns of the vulnerable sections of our society I request dr. in a very pursuit there to introduce us to our third speaker Thank You Monica it is my privilege to introduce to you our next speaker professor bien Ganga who is the senior professor of psychiatry and the current director of Nam hands he

Raman award the doctors they award from the government of Karnataka and many others his talk today is on preventing the comorbid disaster and I now invite professor gang gather to commence his talk yeah I miss ladies visible yes sir yeah oh thanks redeemer for making a wonderful team to share our observations on concerns rate mental health during Kovach what I will share in the coming may be introduced so would be work related to how we face the challenges of managing mental health in enhance and also in the country at large what are the contributions that we made and how it has shown results essentially we see this challenges from the kovat scenario and we had the opportunities we had we converted them into opportunities and this is precisely what I am going to share this is something that I'll be presenting as a representative from the entire mental health division of NIMH hands there are several people who contributed to this starting from the psychiatry is ecology is social work in the health education and nursing so many people contributed to this this is what I am going to be presenting as a summary of what we did in clinical services what we contributed from the community mental health services dr. Moniz acts has been the person who laid the foundation community mental health services way back almost three decades ago sorry you're going to witness all the developments that we're going to be seeing here before I continue with my talk I got a message from secretary she may probably be leaving at any time commitments both the secretary and Schmidty pitty Susan and our Omega do I sell any llamas Sharon you believing any moment halfway through they said they have another appointment to meet given the cold places all over the country it's well expected thank you madam thank you near emoji for being there thank both of you for giving an inspiring introduction and raising of us madam exit I'll continue it may talk later of course miss you the later part of personal answers though so then coming back to my talk legal services ready Midland services we did several training and capacity building throughout the country and we produced many information education communication brochures flights etcetera I'll come to the tip later coming to clinical services what we did there are the areas where we contributed one of them was which is the brainchild of Fatima a continuum of care we closed down the outpatient services once the lockdown was announced in March in the patch we knew that people wouldn't have facilities to travel and also OPD crowds used to be very huge and social distance would be a myth and put together we thought it's a good idea to approach the outpatient services government also gave an advisory that people should utilize hospitals largely for emergency services so we closed the outpatient but have a concern for our patients in scattery made us go back to their case files in all places where the cell phone number was registered we made them call them updated them getting a consultation and where possible we also listened with the district mental health program in Attica and also the Bangalore Metropolitan hospitals where these people can be sent to receive their medicines we're required or consultations near their house through these services apart from this the telemedicine services I must say regarding telemedicine the very timely intervention by the Medical Council of India who gave the telemedicine guidelines a-a-a Dennis was made and order was made in so telemedicine became a very legitimate business in our clinical practice so following that demands also produced the telemedicine guidelines for mental health therapists in particular and thanks to the telemedicine group enhance and also the Indian saccadic Society the National body together this thing was released and so far mental healthcare telemedicine is now a legitimate activity so we allowed face-to-face interviews in this telemedicine services also generated electronic prescription we had some challenges here again thanks to Kovac we could push this issue of letting them prescribed benzodiazepines we allowed one been the recipient will prescribe to the telemedicine services another pump a lot of people during before with anxiety disorder fluids if I'm also helped many second urologist they were using this for describing to patients with epilepsy and we also were able to introduce methylphenidate which was again a useful medicine in patients with resort we had this opportunity to introduce the interactive voice response system for people to telephone take an appointment and then come something that we would never have imagined before this Cove it started this was a challenge that people will come directly and wait in the queues crowding to overcome this we introduced this it was an opportunity to convert outpatient services to an extent possible using a VRS although we still have to saturate this process and so make everybody use this service there these changes led to closer to about 20,000 of those 15,000 phone calls was a few a week backs a number they have made almost 20,000 phone calls a pitch close to a word thousand eight hundred people benefited from critics as you know that a lot of people would get follow-up prescriptions as free dispensation at the demands counters the opening was closed and thanks to the dmhp and the bangalore metropolitan hospitals we were able to deliver his medicines to the bangalore centers level centers cooperated with us and close to about 30 districts all the states helped us guess we asked them to go to their nearest center the district gave us the medicines from the district mental health program stocks we were able to give a telemedicine services to 150 consultations the interactive voice response system although we had some hiccups in to start with but stoon he picked up and close to about 1800 people called up and obtained appointments these changes in addition to that openiy was transformed we in the period of kovat we knew that the lockdown would be lifted and we would get back our crowd thanks to the hospital administration which made larger waiting halls outside the building of the outpatient and also decluttered the outpatients waiting halls to be able to make people sit in a more distant way to give a lot of space between them together the work efficiency and the comfort levels in the outpatient largely increased and we had done it during the period of lockdown and thanks to all this preparation following the lockdown when we lifted the outpatient closure we also have got the outpatient activity back the functioning was lost muda the community mental health team did the wonderful job in this period one of the activities was looking at the concerns of travelers who were quarantine but clearly those who are air travelers who are wanting that one Isaac was mentioned for two weeks I don't know whether he was going to accept what observations that I have had here from our colleagues quarantine people so the quarantine people were spoken to and Zaman services were offered for counseling thanks to the cannot occur health department's mental health team which actually worked with us so what we had we had sources of distress boredom social isolation concerns about their job they're getting salaries fear of infection what if the test results would be positive concerns of spreading infection to the family members largely of course stigma so these are the symptoms which let me also mention close to about twenty percent of them have anxiety depression symptoms sleep symptoms and even suicidal ideations were in this population 1,600 phone calls were made to these people number quarantine these questions we had this data analyzed as you might have read in the newspapers and other media concerns about migrant workers doing the lockdown period was enormous thanks to several health departments or state and central administrative bodies the handled immigrant workers concerns quite well nonetheless places where migrant workers were camp we had an opportunity to meet them educate them present some posters explain to them about the illness not to have concern but to be careful and these things led us to develop a small video clipping and also a advisory as to how we need to work with this mental health services we had help from the vendor metropolitan group who had their Health Survey health workers come along with us in the part of Education and facilitating these things we had about 5,000 odd migrants assists and we visited as many as about hundred and forty sites where migrants were located some even in demands campus migrant workers were doing a huge construction construction had starved the conductor had to hold all activities and their concerns also examine they the team people had pre-existing mental illness severe nature new onset mental illness in about five people we referred about fifteen of them to different hospitals our management they had to flag the several concerns uncertainty about how long would this lockdown gone wanted to go back to their families fear of being abandoned by their employers and if needed some of them were carrying the many some of the human who were pregnant and they were concerned what would happen substance uses related desire issues also of concerned what if I am NOT going to get alcohol in the next today's travel I've had this fire problem so these are the concern that they express and thanks to the community mental health team and also the Connecticut state government helped the department which made this highlighted and all other workers who went on to now work with the migrant workers that took this survey shion's and health subjects by appropriate counseling we also launched a helpline the moment the lockdown started we anticipated a disaster like situation and people would be very concerned public both those who are infected and those who are not infected would have lot of concerns so we set up a helpline a toll-free helpline for people to see my counseling thanks to the Ministry of Health they said this should be a and national activity so they requested us to engage as many mental health professionals as possible all over the country and this was possible thanks to the dental instead of psychiatry and also the pageboy Institute of Psychiatry they participated and also in many states people came forward as many as 14 natural languages from 16 different states but 250 plus mental health professionals were able to give a helping hand we were available the lines could go to them three lakh calls came and close to over 50,000 calls were related to mental health services again thanks to the secretary health we were asked to also dedicate a separate line for helping the health care workers and their mental health concerns and to these people hire highly trained professionals from mental health from the Department of Social Work ecology as Kadri from NIMH hands were available to help them I do not have the exact number of people who sought help for mental health conditions from the group of the healthcare providers not just the co-ed warriors but many other groups of people we did several their stress related concerns clinical psychology is a cat of social work so we had close to 30,000 people benefiting from this I am just making a list of activities that the dependents a character has then the sites will be available I'm not going to details of these things we trained psychiatrists in many states we also try and lay counselors we find obstetricians for concerns related to postpartum or newly prenatally area period and the mothers had questions like and I feed my child if I develop COBIT consider that so we're also trying to allay their concern just a little practitioners address we also trained psychiatrists using a CME program on how to use telemedicine in psychiatry this is a list that we did through this telemedicine services and we also have a very very vibrant demands digital Academy which also jumped into the fray making this training to several groups of people on just mental health substance abuse disorders and the Health University of cannot occur rather than the health University actually participated with us in feigning many people on issues related to mental health and other directly Public Health importance in Fouad they used our platform of images like Adam II to Train physicians nurses health workers all over the state the general since Academy also has blend into this the National Commission for protection of child rights realized that child abuse was a concern and a large project has been given to the shaker she surely is reading this project and this is now going to address these concerns of children whether co-ed are no covet I'm sure this cuz this program will be very helpful the Department of Clinical Psychology needs some unique activities how to train psychologists very efficient in terms of telephone counseling so they did a training program for people psychologists to avoid a 10-15 number they also set up a portal on which people can discuss mental health concerns share questions get some answers answers are usually written by a clinical psychologist a psychiatrist who would put the appropriate answer many questions were common and close to a 150 questions for which answers have been generated as many as about 35 answers which are common to these questions have been generated on this portal the depowered a psychotic social work which also hits the Center for disaster management and psychosocial support again did the several programs of our law police officers and many college teachers and school teachers and these were very well received and many teachers participated in many felicitous program and in fact the canonical government for the bangalore city police have asked us to conduct some programs how to manage stress during the covetous situation and this again has received lot of interest lastly before I conclude we produced four stuff information education communication materials pamphlets videos posters newspaper articles as many as about hundred you stupid articles came from the group of behavioral sciences scatter psychology social active on me leave topics available to Covidien Minton online blocks the publication send you publications also came to publications have committed period summers later some as opinion papers and summer data papers we also produce some short messaging services small statements or advisories which will boy SMS as part of general public awareness thanks to the health department many of these they also reviewed did some baking and a host of them are already on the Government of India health department's we have said this is something that we will all post or having contributed to the national activity in mitigating mental health fair stress mental health complications are comorbidity in Kovac firstly while we were doing many of these activities we thought from week to week we made compile all activities and published 12 issues have come the last issue was released a month later now the frequency of releasing these bulletins is once in four weeks and this has attracted a lot of people as many as 12 pages of this and 12 issues having come compels all the work that we have done of course month to month we are going to be updating this work as well so I think I will stop here I must thank not just one department but all the departments there are many groups which are working particularly the medical super ends present and the past medical super end who contributed enormously in developing these activities the Health Education Department which made all the education material and other academic departments which participated in many of these training programs I must thank all of them and of course thanks also to the mystery which was continuously motivating us demands which made us produce all these activities we recently completed a manual of how to address mental health concerns in mental hospitals other establishments and psychiatric patients in general during the whole period when they're infected and they're not infected other challenges like hospitals being closed off it is being closed in some places and people who are homeless mentally ill who are entering in all these situations how kovat concerns can also be at risk and curve in individuals mental health concerns can be addressed a manual has been released a few weeks earlier we also released a manual on mental health concerns in those or healthcare workers how do we address them how to manual eyes the whole services for them these are the activities that we have done I thank again the man team for letting me over here I as the director of demands I also thank all the esteemed speakers for coming I may

been awarded deal in Moorthy long duration award of the Indian society Society now I invite ruff is a moment Eliza to deliver his talk on practicing psychiatry post pandemic for that very kind introduction it was delighted I was really delighted to hear certain presentation about the contributions of Newman's earlier of course I listen to hell secondly saying that the anyone demands for the major you know contributions in the field of mental health even not only now but in the months and years to come Oh in a short period I think you have given tremendous leadership to a lot of activities by various people in different departments and as an old student I'm the old Faculty of the man's I'm indeed proud to hear all these contributions now let me begin my presentation okay so I want to express my gratitude to the men's organizers for organizing this kind of a faculty for the first time more importantly I want to thank them because now begin the key organizer asked me to talk about what happens after things like that the enemy this gives gave me an opportunity for some future gazing and that is what I hope to do with all the participants who are now logged in here are your men you may expect relations you could be right you can of course based on a lot of information that you can you have already you can mix regulations you've already heard from secretary during her inaugural speech she said that these psychosocial problems are invisible they are already there but she already made a prediction they are going to stay with us for a very very long time now lunch mean his presentation said that you know we don't know yet how the end week is worldly still in the midst of it it mentioned think of it for example today in India we covered a major milestone we covered 1 million cases first it was a gradual increase in the past few days it has been in the United States which is you know one of the richest country which pens for healthcare in terms of proportion of GDP one of the highest in the world about 16 17 percent of the GDP and also created a record today for the total number of infections per day it crossed 77204 are still in the midst of the economy and you talk about post handily you can only future case and make speculations and that is what I am going to do but I do this raised numerous questions I'm trying to answer them as I go along I promise you I will not take it's because it should be some time for discussion and of course we are who are waiting to listen to dr. casement who is already written out to research and he has excellent ideas about what side so I would I am stopped in about 10 to 12 minutes so psychiatry has withered lot of upheavals even if you look at the last one century you had major problems you know he's this pandemic the most disruptive I think there is a very wide belief that this has been the most expected in fact Henry nusrah is written that this is the cataclysmic event which has changed in the world so I would think that it is a pandemic that has become in the most destructive and probably it is going to change society forever in fact they let me it he said house Italy in Canada how it is a pandemic a much needed a call for psychiatry the optimist in me made me think that ok you know this is a very good bed because fault lines which have been there not postman to make but pre-pandemic and make period and portability various fault lines so I could think that we all of us or organizations or mental health proteins should consider this as a way to fight for psychiatric in these lessons from the past what does post pandemic mean I've already mentioned that we still don't know but they came from past I'll give you some indications about and we can refer to a post pandemic period how do we know about the pandemic or do we know that the enemy is is over I think we are far away from that point so we don't have to breathe for claims in practice of psychiatry I'll tell you that okay any lessons from the past what has been widely talked about is a Spanish flu more than 500 million infections five million deaths but what is important is so we are still in the although it that this is likely in the beginning of psychiatry and how psychiatry has phased all these deceptions we'll know very much world was but of course the deinstitutionalization woman we saw tens and thousands of people be charged from mental hospitals in the United States in UK etc and the problems which that cause which we are even now facing after 30 40 years people are talking about even now end up on that old war laugh of the Soviet Army so he doing bellezza Paul ISM suicide rates when top physical has deteriorated so we know that these kinds of nature of people can have disastrous consequences not only on health let me move on to the next one what are the fault lines at Table four I don't have to highlight since I talked about psychiatry post handling I think we should look into the major fault lines that we have still not been able to deal with effectively all over the world a huge pigment gap across the world I would say across the world you can please if you look at research data you find that it is only a difference in the degree of the hugeness or the whiteness of the treatment comes in countries of Asia such as India other places it is huge but even in countries such as the United States I mean of course Canada and Australia may be partially exception to this huge statement yeah grossly inadequate resources not only financial but also human resources the continuing universes if you want the health secretary referred to in Earth's speech these are all fault lines that we need to be aware of as we playing for the post pandemic area shamefulness even in the rich countries sources this has been a big problem why because recently I read Alan France is saying that tens of thousands of people with severe mental illnesses are dying in the United States because of the cooperate if you listen to DNA is talking about ethnicity they you know long-standing economic situation which have all been you know population as well as people who suffer from the neglect of disadvantaged populations the rural populations are vulnerable the economic and social policies which are promoted in equally an innovative policy I would I'm very confident to say that all over the world is in the last 20 years or so the economic and social policies have only contributed to increasing iniquities and inequalities tribulus energy of the number of psychiatric beds where people with mental disorders have been you know in the next slide I show you that Mentalist homeless mentally ill large number of people in jails in United States and many other places with the diagnosis of mental illness brains trans institutionalization all these have to be kept in mind as we the point I am making is that LT talk about psychotic practice post endemic we should be aware of the large fault lines which we are not being able to effectively deal with this is a full tutorial famous book about psychosis he recently less than six months ago in October the keynote address at the American Psychiatric Association of Institute of psychiatric services conference he said rarely have so many real meaning people in so wronged my generation made major mistakes in emptying the state hospitals without thinking about how to treat the seriously mentally ill in the community is up to the next generation to solve this problem only highlighting these so that we are aware of these issues as we plan for psychiatry and mental health care post pandemic this I am you know the problem of long-standing inequality iniquities socially economically and the consequences on mental health has been highlighted by English in many of his slides but I would both of you who want to know more about it it's not as like a disease and economist Joseph Stiglitz who is a Nobel Prize winning economist who wrote several months several years ago race of inequality and there are sections in this book or to mental health consequences or social problems and I think the Kovach pandemic has only exposed these problems because in all countries including in India today there is a CNN report every since you report but out the poor but the 60% of poor people in India of the worst weeks in Saudi and we can be closed down etc people middle class upper middle class of course they have their homes they can sanitize they have so price of inequality people who want to know more about it the Oxford you know they have to tolerate it already but people who are interested in knowing how inequality how wide it is even in very advanced countries in building perhaps not instead you the initiated PA lancets I country talking about the futile psychiatry and I'm highlighting the Pauline that psychiatry is not all very good you need to be aware of all these fault lines before we move into the future of the things that mean you have to be concerned about I have already made this point that the pandemic is not perfectly we are already harnessing the potential of technology to provide more rescission in the digital mental health mental health care and how swiftly we have both virtual care I'm not really mentioned about that is something which we have to focus much more on while we consider this VD also acknowledge the fact that anthem which will be a part of sauce future people have already talked about how are we going to deal with future pandemics okay what are the major things that we need to deal with don't even refer to my previous speakers already they will actually talked about current rates of anxiety depression substance use it there is a huge increase in mental health problems there are already indications I mean the last three four weeks I mean in India of watching the news every day all of the country and also era which has been highly they are having a search and every day the number of suicides which are reported is an indication about the things to come a huge increase in mental as well as a metal has consequences of the economic downtown in fact a few days ago that the years after 2021 in be similar to the years after 1945 I think this was Bill Gates talking about future pandemics to send bodies so the enormous economic consequences we have a little taste of it about the prices in peace and Lee in Spain the suicide rates went up etcetera that would be something that we need to deal with on a positive side I think wider and increase she was the SAG that similar of late evening he's seen operated by the Union secretary in sings of the Ministry of has been family well said he's an important indication that the government of England is is also a mini retirement I know I was in Australia to see weeks ago in fact one of the few things there's two parties the two poles keep fighting all the time but one of the things on which was very unique agreement was funding for mental health almost a billion all over release for you know the telemedicine and things like that so will this be an example will increase funding in countries and a big I put three question marks because I don't know because please going a huge economic downturn funding for mental health to improve services probably is also positive now the the rapid that doing those delivered is because I'll raise some questions will become the form of a of you know connecting with the doctor you don't have travel you don't have to paid in the practice the outpatient room etcetera so maybe this will become a crucified mortal what you know for millennia the laning laying hands represented the essence of the doctor-patient relationship the human touch of the carer and coating was artificial intelligent much before they could it started in 2009 I'll show you so he talked about that so decent being physically apart a sense of menace and also psychics can remote care facilitate transfer of trust empathy and compassion I'm sure we will have many many more points for his research agenda and I will now it's a very interesting book it's called deep medicine how artificial intelligence and make you mean again of course this is mm thank you very much once again for officials back to Naveen thank you sir for highlighting the lessons to be learned from the past pandemics flagging the fault lines and challenges lying ahead of us I now request dr. Neha Kulkarni to introduce us to a final speaker dr. Mallika a last Speaker of the day professor Micelli case she won the Stanley Cup professor and head Department of Psychiatry Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Howard Medical School is the editor of schizophrenia research journal with his areas of interest including psychopathology Biological Psychiatry including anatomical and functional neuroimaging new recognition and neuro development genetics in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and many more who is one of the principal investigators of business project with more than eleven hundred and seventy publications in both national and international he's been the recipient of many honorable awards I invite professor my dedication to throw us a light on research in public psychiatry during pandemics I welcome you sir sorry I can buted myself do people hear me yourself first of all Thank You mayor for that introduction and also thank you for the organizers Naveen pratima and Gangadhar and others for making this wonderful event very timely event possible I know that we are running late into the event and I'll try to be brief and my job has been made easier by all my illustrious predecessors in this event and what I'm going to do is to point out the research directions that we should be as a global mental health community be pursuing in the years to come and the fact that the the Kovach pandemic has given us an unprecedented opportunity trying to move my slides here and this is not exactly moving okay yeah and so as I said Kovac 19 is a global stressor that has you know come upon mankind and we can be viewed as a natural experiment upon this world and during such a pandemic while we have several disastrous consequences that we are dealing with this may also be an opportunity for us to reflect upon the nature of this pandemic and what it might reveal to us about the mind and the brain and about the future practice of psychiatry altogether as bajas Oxford interestingly as this cartoon points out it was during a pandemic the Great Plague of London in the 17th century when there was a quarantine and Isaac Newton Sir Isaac Newton was essentially isolated that was the period during which he discovered the groundwork for his theories of calculus and the theories of gravity and motion so this may be the time when we are sitting at home but we have our minds and our data to look at and actually think about potential new solutions that we hadn't thought of before now Mohan also pointed about the importance of learning from our past it has been said wisely that those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat the consequences of the past repeat the mistakes of the past so we have to look at what has happened in previous pandemics and they one pandemic that is well known to everybody is the Spanish flu of 22,000 18 or 19 as well as many as 500 million were affected and about 50 million people died and the number of new hospitalizations for mental disorders increased by 7 fold over the 6 years after the pandemic which included depression anxiety in your senior neuropsychiatric complications including what became known as encephalitis lethargica the parkinsonian features they all emerged only years later so the what the main lesson for that is this is the time time to begin research and understand the nature of postcode neuropsychiatric disorders is now and it has to be started proactively and this is a slide actually short earlier on is a very insightful slide points out the fact that what we are still in the middle of is this first wave of the immediate mobility and mortality of covered 19 what we are beginning to see and what will become more problematic are the subsequent consequences of the resource restriction the economic declines the are the non Kovach conditions which were kind of not receiving treatment re-emerging back into the hospitals and the post ICU complications and so forth and also the trauma and the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic leading to psychiatric disorders it is these disorders that we have to anticipate and take proactive ways to understand and intervene I recently wrote a paper which in which I outlined a research agenda for a coed pandemic and the kinds of questions that can be framed as priorities so if you think of this as a major group of disorders we have to understand what are the risk factors as well as what are the resilience factors and the previous speakers have outlined the important factors such as medical comorbidity personality factors environmental factors such as smoking social distancing loneliness unemployment economic decline race underprivileged communities urban a city and air pollution we have to study these multifactorial origins of psychopathology and negative consequences of Corbett and also understand the presentations of these various psychosocial consequences that you will see or we are beginning to see either new onset horrid exacerbation of pre-existing anxiety depression psychosis obsessive-compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder Dinesh pointed out the importance of looking at intimate partner violence which we are already beginning to see a pattern of cognitive decline and dementia lakshmi pointed out social rhythms disturbance which may have an impact on mood disorders and so forth we are also beginning to see the world is changing around and developing quick solutions to healthcare resources delivery and approaches to care and we have to see how they are working are there alternative ways I should healthcare policies change and and Delly Stelly psychiatry and digital psychiatry which many of the previous papers have commented on is almost coming to the center stage at this point now in this slide I wanted to put together the the model of how we understand Cobie related neuropsychiatric complications one has to think of these as an epidemiological triangle with the host that is our own body and our own immune response the agent which is the virus of the left side and the environment all of these factors interact to produce the consequences that we are beginning to see and are those include all of those that I mentioned before social economic demographic and pre-existing illness related factors as well as access to care medication and heterogenic effects medical comorbidity and even genetic risk all of these will have to be considered in our understanding of the nature and evolution of psychopathology and we know that the these illnesses have a time course there is an acute infection many people thankfully recover without symptoms and some who have symptoms may have mild symptoms and thankfully a small proportion which varies from country to country maybe around 5% and global average develop an acute severe inflammatory response due to what is called a site of and storm and that may lead to its own delayed neuropsychiatric consequences like delirium and cognitive declines and may be followed by several downstream psychosocial consequences an important question that has to be understood prospectively is whether conditions that cause an ongoing chronic inflammation due to pre-existing medical illnesses like obesity autoimmune disease or pritus diabetes hypertension depression do they all predispose to a higher chance of developing cytokine storms and do they also predispose to higher chance of subsequent neuropsychiatric sequere now this is a cartoon which is also circulating around which is very insightful if you carefully look at this there is the now acute wave and which tend to flattened by a strong collective response which is the best case scenario but if this strong collective response by the community and the public health care systems are inadequate and are short-lived that would lead to a subsequent search again of both of the Cova Dwyers as well as of the mental health consequences so one has to have develop a response both at a community level and at a healthcare system level a you know adequate and consistent collective response which is not only comprehensive to begin with but also sustained in the longer run so that is the key point that requires national and local level leadership and it was very I was proud to hear the others presentation of how Anna mance is taking a lead for the country and perhaps for the world on developing a collective response in that way there are many things that are beginning to change it has been commented by previous speakers about the rapid shift that is happening to telehealth you know in my own system in Boston we have seen that almost 90% by now of outpatient care has been switched to telehealth and even inpatient settings we are walking around with iPads and I'm sitting in the central room and having tele consultation with the patient sitting in their wardrobes and so forth and simply the same thing is happening with consultation liaison settings as well so what are the strategies for developing a research plan and a research agenda there are many ways in which data can be harnessed for benefit in understanding Cobie related mental health consequences one could use existing health records like electronic health records are available which can allow linking between mental health medical and community health services to identify patterns and trends both in clinical populations as well as in individuals with suspected or existing coverage 19 it's also useful to capitalise on existing cohorts of already well characterized populations like the UK biobank is one good example large numbers thousands of people whose clinical characteristics as well as biological specimens have been characterized the same thing with many large studies like we snip and in a mass like a DBS and so forth and such platforms might allow might also have recruitment platforms which will allow these individuals to be brought back and if they have been exposed to Cove it how do they respond and can we learn anything about their baseline characteristics about who does or does not have negative consequences also it's important to initiate population studies in vulnerable populations like children frontline health care staff people who have survived severe cough in nineteen and so forth for example we are in in my own Hospital in Boston we are beginning to start a co-ed clinic for people who have been discharged from intense intensive care units and we will be prospectively following them up to understand what what's going to happen over the next few months or years what are the principles of good research practice first of all one needs to conduct both hypothesis-driven as well as hypothesis-generating research the hypothesis-generating research will involve selection of large scale agnostic data that uh that are obtained in a you know in a way that could be that could lend itself to measurement based care study designs need to be rigorous ethical and would need to consider general population as well as vulnerable populations when we say measurement based care we not only provide care for patients but also we measure what we are providing the care we are providing and also the responses and there the psychological and physiological changes over the course of time using biomarkers and so forth we also need to involve multiple stakeholders patients those with lived experience the public the policymakers and so forth the research has to be interdisciplinary and what can God there outlined was a great example of collaborations between disciplines such as psychology psychiatry epidemiology neurology neuroscience and so forth data need to be harmonized and methods need to be harmonized across multiple settings and also international collaborations the more the data the better the answers will be and so collaborations are already emerging internationally of consortium that are beginning to collect data in a uniform kind of way now one idea that I want to throw out here I'm sure somebody is already doing it but I think the mass could take a lead on something like this and the one testable hypothesis is if you look at all the medical conditions and the demographic conditions that are associated with the higher risk for post coverage consequences as well as the co-ed infections themselves these are things like obesity metabolic syndrome chronic medical disease diseases like arthritis sedentariness what is common among all of those one thing that is common among all of those is the is what is often termed the concept of hello static load Dinesh pointed out one other concept of kovat age and I would argue that kovat age may be related to the degree of accumulated stress in the body that you know that throws individuals homeostasis away in other words the body is thrown out of balance and what is it that can reverse this kind of imbalance it may be that exercise healthy diet good sleep yoga and meditation may move individuals towards the mode of the homeostatic balance institutions like them hands which have a world repute on an empirical study of lifestyle interventions like yoga too could take this as an opportunity and collect data on outcomes of people who are exposed to kovat as well as those who are not exposed to ghovat as well as those who have explained exposed and have had infections and other consequences to see whether pre-existing parameters of lifestyle can predict resilience towards negative consequences and also whether introductions of healthy lifestyle interventions could make a difference and of course for such research one needs a comprehensive systematic prospective a study that involves both psychosocial and biomarker based assessments of data that's that's a large-scale effort and you know it's very important that national organizations and international collaborative opportunities should be looked into for these kind of questions I think that's so biomarkers might include simple measures like c-reactive protein cortisol heart rate variability sleep quality and so forth so it take home points our Kovach 19 is a huge challenge to health and mental health everywhere kovat 19 is a natural experiment that offers an unprecedented opportunity for mental health research several important questions pertaining to causes presentations trajectories and treatments of mental illness can be addressed in the context of pandemic I would stop here to say when Mohan asked the question whether what's in future for us this may be an opportunity for psychiatry to bring the body and the mind together and also also to bring large-scale resources to address the mental health issues the the challenges that that he the fourth lines that Mohan pointed out a lot can be gained by embedding COBE related questions in the context of ongoing studies as well as new studies of vulnerable populations and as many of the previous speakers have also said he helped and digital health a rapidly assuming center stage and prospective proactive research is needed now so gathering actionable evidence while we continue to do what we can do to mitigate mitigate mental health consequences of covered nineteen leadership is critically needed more than ever and it is amazing to see how Lim hands is taking taking the lead here thank you thank you sir for enlightening us on the strategies that you could use to relate it to the mental health research I now request professor Matthew Vargas to moderate the question and answer session so thank you very much to all the five speakers who did an excellent job I think this webinar something that will be watched many times over in the next few years let me start by asking question to Kevin who just finished so Kevin in terms of research are you suggesting something like the worldwide solid I had to eat trial similar study for mental health and maybe it's something that since you already have some thoughts on it and maybe you and Lakshmi and the range from the Institute and maybe Mohan from Western Australia and enhance could think of a large very large sort of international study looking at this you know some nice research do you think that's a thought this one I think you read my mind Matthew absolutely I mean I don't know much about the Solidarity trial even though I have heard about it and you know if there is any way in which we can bring all the first who are interested in this important problem together it will be fantastic great I think it's something for both you and the other to think of Matthew can I just jump in an adequate point just mostly from the logistical perspective right I think I read a great idea but I guess one also needs to think about logistical challenges and the time it might take to cause something like that and and I think one of the things with the pandemic is it's unclear how this is going to a wall on how long it's going to last and and I think in BC we try to harmonize the harmonize the data so that we have a common database for all patients that have been affected with co19 and we spent really last two-and-a-half months trying to figure out all the processes and and during that period I would we've lost a lot of valuable time because most of the patients now have recovered at least from the acute phase so I think while the idea that patient meant mentioned is is a really good one and I think as we try it as we wait to implement that I think it shouldn't stop new Mahan's from taking the leadership and implementing that in India right away because I don't think you should be waiting for this to become a global effort because that might take quite a bit of time during which you know one might lose valuable amount of time so my suggestion is it's a great idea but let's start with NIMH hands because Newman's has shown an incredible amount of leadership in addressing this covert challenge Thank You Lakshmi for those comments and also suggestions and I think that's something that we need to really look at Mohan questions you you say learning from the past is important and learning from the Spanish flu and other disasters that we have had in the past do you think you you were positive in sense of saying that this might actually push us to us doing a lot of tele consultations and telehealth do you think telehealth will change will be the game changer in terms of reducing the treatment gap and do you think that in a in a world that was so far very unconnected do you think that this will actually improve social connections between people not just families and those but also our patients in ourselves okay let me just respond let me make first firstly two points telemedicine is not anything new 15 years but it was only for remotely located rural populations in Tina's population in fact I have myself done a review of the scarf telemedicine project into the port district which was funded by the trust him blah era under the sitting in scarf would review patients in Buda Co tape of the Kota is the least developed in so any medicine as being there but what is important to notice that from the time of it and any started how swiftly we have more to it not only in the advanced countries can gather told us about how that is being applied even in India so now the question is I mean that was some of the questions that I raised once the coffee settles on we don't know when you heard from Lakshmi also maybe two years later I think this too shall pass and they would be something for the normal game many people say that it will not be the normal that we have some here will be a new moment but what time will telemedicine be the preferred mode of consolidation my guess is that it will be no issue in has no set at ninety percent of all the consultations in most I also had misgivings concerns can you transmit the empathy concern to us as doctors we have always seen patients face to face etc so I think this will be the game changer this will be the main mode and there would be a lot of people not for essential services not for serious problems but for mild to moderate problems the anxiety is the patient it is other problems I think the digital actually method would be the mainstay and to give you an example social media and even in the number of people who are linked to social media whatsapp and all kinds of things you know it's numbers are rapidly increasing and success of all those providers service providers who provide social media is an indication that telemedicine would be an ideal it would be also processing thank you one another the this global pandemic which has come to India has actually pushed up the issue of health care in our country and I think all Healthcare is really being ramped up and also mental healthcare so the district mental health programs and and other people on the ground especially mental health professionals are really being pushed into the field do you think that this will actually push the district program and the health program of the country in a big way because we are talking about MBBS courses MD courses we are talking about fast-tracking things do you think this will be a game-changer as far as healthcare in India is concerned now but one it has alerted us about the importance of Public Health whether for the physical health our mental health i as a scat rest believe that public health should come in the 4th and we should move out of hospitals as much as possible and resources spent on the hospitals if a part of it is spent on the public health agenda we would probably be giving a better care to the population this is number one the other issue which I think I should give with Kevin this is a tremendous opportunity for research we should consider maybe initiating a large in the center collaborative study following a big cohort of population who has gotten infected and not that mean Oh a couple of years maybe more numbers of years be able to see what are the outcomes of these krama infection in terms of psychiatric morbidity mortality or any other developmental progressive phenomenon that we may see this is a very good opportunity risings we have now visiting professors from four different countries I think this is the right time to start a mighty central follow up quad to be able to unravel this question sure the in the people in the on these in this we will take up a big proposal on examining discussion and something that can I think get funded at this critical moment lineage there was a question for you thanks Denise for bringing this double or even triple whammy that the underprivileged are facing in terms of having more physical commodity not being able to afford health care and increase violence now there's a question somebody's asked it says how do institutions and hospitals look after the mental health care of the healthcare workers and also of the underprivileged what what strategies can we adopt I thanks very much Matthew I think before I answer the question can I just go back to the sort of elemental health question I think it's incredibly important that we don't jump on the bandwagon in that yesterday mental health changes the concept of care I spend some of my time with the Tavistock which is as you most people would know as history of psychoanalysis and certainly the older psychotherapists are complaining that they can't share showed display empathy whereas younger generation does not see that as a problem so I think we need to be looking at what do we mean by empathy and that in context of privacy and confidentiality is going to be the key whether tele mental health takes off or not the question about what we should be doing I think it's absolutely vital that the institutions look after their mental health and well-being of their staff and again in a series of surveys have shown that the rates of burnout among doctors and medical students freak Ovid I was something between 30 and 40 percent in some medical schools and 95 percent in some medical schools in Hong Kong for example so there are Chen's about what we need to do I think there are four levels of interventions each of us has to be responsible for looking after ourselves and looking after those around us whether it's at home or at work our teams team members institutions have a moral responsibility to look after its staff by making sure that access to occupational medicine occupational health is available readily easily and is well supported then there are but then a third level is more at a sort of regional or state level as to what organizations need to support each other because there are questions about confidentiality for example lemon in Bangalore if NIM hands staff are feeling under stressed how free are they in accessing services within them hands so should they be have some kind of mutual agreement with st. John's so they can go to st. John's and be from st. John's can come to them hands in a similar way and fourthly at the sort of national level Medical Council's have and nursing councils and you know equivalent bodies and other healthcare professionals have an ethical and moral duty to make sure that services are available and accessible I mean we found in a server in the UK that medical students generally do much better in seeking and getting help whereas junior doctors do very badly and we know that junior doctors and those who graduated our medical students within the first year of graduation are really stressed out and they find it very difficult to seek help so we need to be investing as a profession to make sure that services are accessible and readily available without stigma and if we cannot provide those services without stigma then we can't go around criticizing other people that they have stigma about mental illness I finish and I think that systemic perspective in terms of primary secondary and tertiary prevention is very important I think the search shows that it's really the system with large systemic interventions that are really useful if somebody has depression and anxiety the intervention interventions are less likely to help as opposed to actually preventing it from a very systems is to make larger institutional and national perspective one of the key things is that in a lot of surveys in couvade are showing anxiety and depression the question is are these kind of genuine appropriate responses or are these illnesses because if we create more demand for our services and we time delivered that that is gonna be a traditional right yeah so Lakshmi there's two three questions for you thank you very much for all that research that Canada has done on the covert situation especially the systemic responses from your British Columbia there are three questions one is how do we prevent suicide what a strategies to prevent suicide among the health care workers let's first question and the second one is on the effect of code on sexual health okay well let me start with the first question on that is I think the early identification of the mental health impact is the key I think because you know things don't change overnight with different line health care workers they're obviously constantly exposed to number of stressful factors related to providing care for people with with co19 and so what we had done within our system was to organize the the psychological first first aid so we assembled a group of experts within within our system and the team was readily available to provide help for anyone that needed help the access was the keys in other words you know didn't have to wait for several days before they could see someone so the help was available quite rapidly so that I think that was one of the things that was very helpful and the end the second thing I think is also access to the crisis lines that we had implemented in our system so they are again if someone a healthcare worker is concerned about seeing a team within the healthcare setting and there are concerns about privacy perhaps then they can call the crisis line and get get that support and then the third thing that we'd organised is working with the with the physicians organization within our our healthcare system we we set up a virtual mental health clinic so people that that have accessed the psychological debriefing or psychological supports if they didn't feel that their needs have been met with that kind of strategy and if the concerns are you know a bit more serious meaning that they've sort of moved on to having a a major depression or an anxiety disorder or psychosis or bipolar then there would be a rapid access to more formal psychiatric assessment and appropriate treatment interventions so I think the key is offering easy access or rapid access to to frontline health care workers and providing help earlier on I think is probably the best way to to address those suicidal thoughts and that leading into actual suicidal attempts and the second one was about the sexual health Matthew was there that's right yeah so so I think we so we have a member in our department whose expertise is in fact sexual health and she's actually been doing in number surveys to to understand the impact of endemic on sexual health and of course when the pandemic began the general impression is that you know people are spending a lot of time at home there are lots of time on their hands so you know there's going to be a significant increase in sexual activity there's a baby boom you know those kinds of things but what the preliminary data are suggests suggesting she hasn't analyzed the data in detail is yet but from what they've looked at in toss the preliminary analysis it's it's actually indicating that the sexual activity the pandemic for vast majority of people not for arm for master majority has actually gone down mainly because of stress and anxiety and those kinds of things but it's interestingly for a small proportion of people it has gone up and I think her hypothesis is that it's perhaps for this small group of people it's it's a way of coping so far as majority it leads to decrease in sexual desire the activity goes down but for small proportional people it's difficult and so it does go up thank his fees as you mentioned trauma in passing how would you conceptualize covert related trauma as being unique and what are the kinds of research questions we can explore in that area yeah so again you can look at the trauma from the individual that has been admitted to hospital with co19 you can also look at a trauma from the family members perspective or even from the frontline healthcare workers perspective so with the individual that has contracted Co it and has been in the hospital of course there's the issue of watching other people on the unit's going on ventilators going into coma you know on all the activity that goes with it and also the patient himself or herself going on the ventilator and the trauma on the fear associated with that and for healthcare workers you know I think if one watch to what's happened in in China particularly in the earlier days of this anti might come in you know one has heard a lot of horror stories and you can also imagine the trauma from from the religious perspective where they know that their loved ones are in the hospital but they can I even visit you know they have to see them through a glass window or things like that in terms of you know what are some of the research questions that can be addressed I think I self alluded to in my presentation you know a lot of the data that's come out so far is based on very poor methodological II based kinds of studies so we have some ideas but we don't really understand how this is going to be impacting I mean donación brought up the point about a lot of people endorsing anxiety and depression but is this sort of a normal response one might expect given the pandemic are you know are some of these people actually transitioning into the DSM and ICD disorder so we don't have firm answers Kazak and cage talked about this offering a natural experiment to study and I think well we know with this with this co19 virus is that it does have a significant impact on the immune system and we know that the main system alterations have been implicated in the needle biology of many of our psychiatric disorders so in a way this might present an opportunity to study how stress impacts you know glucocorticoid system the immune system at energix system and how those changes in those things interact with some of the predisposing factors and the resilience factors that might eventually determine who and developing for example whether it's PTSD our other type of anxiety disorder are our depressive disorder so in other words looking at those different types of cohorts and propensity matching looking at the exposure to some of these events and then perhaps collecting blood samples for some of those measures and doing a comprehensive clinical assessment to collect some of those data or later risk factors so that one can then begin to model how these factors interact that ultimately determines who ends up developing these these disorders so and I think given the number of cases that you're seeing in India I think you know and I agree with the case that this presents an amazing opportunity to answer many of the questions that we have we want to answer by about 25 minutes but I just couldn't let me because go without some discussion so I think I'll cover all the questions I don't know if there's anything from the Facebook shares the I wish made a comment about what we are doing for media people how we can use the media to come up with primary prevention in yeah it's a good question I just want to bring you to there's the audience that the mental health education department is holding a webinar tomorrow for media persons as to how their presentations on covertly could make a different impact more positive impact in individuals to be able to help them out of this crisis of mental health yeah I think there's one more question from Morley I'm not I think I've covered all of them about early interventions going out the window but I think that's morally can sort of probably talk to Lakshmi about that early intervention system I think I can go I'm gonna hand this over back to the organizers now in EMCO thanks a lot for letting me moderate this session thanks thanks very much and I think we should take some of these ideas forward thank you thank you all I request professor Naveen Kumar C to deliver the concluding remarks thank so Haruka and I I must say I think it's been a wonderful experience having all our senior professors you know coming in and connecting virtually for this excellent program we had had a feast academically touching upon various issues of kovaydin mental health actually I mean starting from the health secretary madam herself she talked about the importance of mental health and kovat and professor Adam go the the work that has gone on in Canada and of course dr parra speaking about the underprivileged population and professor ing talking about the initiatives that has been taken in diem hands and professor MK talking about practicing psychiatry post pandemic and of course the icing on the cake was the talk on research ideas can come up and how to take this forward and of course lot of ideas have come in and as proximity work is rightly put it some of these things need to be taken forward so I thank you very much one and all for having spared your precious time and spending time with us we are indeed privileged and hope to see you all thank you thanks very much take care everyone bye you'd be ending the meeting for all thank you thanks very much everyone stay safe both now ",True,False,True,False

and you’ve probably already read every article and watched every video you could find about
the coronavirus. Most of those have focused on what coronavirus
is doing to our society, our economy, and our lungs. But as a neuroscientist sitting here in at
home, what I’m most curious about is: what is it doing to our brains? By now we’ve all got the symptoms of COVID19
memorized: dry cough, fatigue, and a fever. You might even know about some of the more
obscure symptoms, like a sore throat, diarrhea, and aches and pains. We’re learning more every day about this
virus, and working out new ways to combat it in our communities. Most of what we hear about the effects of
COVID19 are about what it can do to our respiratory system. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the official
name of the virus itself, seems to enter the body via the nose or mouth, binding onto cells
using the cell-surface receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2. The virus injects its genetic material, called
RNA, into the cells and hijacks their machinery to make more copies of itself, which go on
to attack more cells. Eventually, the virus can make its way down
the throat to the lungs, where it takes up residence and wreaks even more havoc. In the tiny air sacs where oxygen gets absorbed
into the bloodstream, called the alveoli, the fight between your immune system and the
virus can cause inflammation, cell death, and excess fluid, a combo that leads to pneumonia. Sometimes, when the infection is really bad,
patients end up with acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, when their lungs are so
clogged up that their bodies aren’t able to absorb enough oxygen and they really struggle
to breathe. This is usually when a person ends up requiring
ventilation to support their breathing - and even that doesn’t always work. But the danger isn’t only to your lungs
- it's to your whole body, including your brain. As the number of COVID19 cases climbs, doctors
and scientists have noted more and more symptoms linked to the central nervous systems - severe
headaches, for one, and loss of sense of taste and smell for another. Other reports include seizures and strokes,
and a recent case report even identified a COVID19 patient suffering from acute necrotizing
hemorrhagic encephalopathy, where the inflammation in her brain led to memory loss and disorientation. So what’s going on here? Well, again, since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus,
we’re not entirely sure. A lot of this hinges on whether or not the
virus can cross the blood brain barrier. Because the brain is so fragile and easily
damaged, it’s evolved a special set of blood vessels that are extra-effective at keeping
most things, like foreign pathogens, out of the brain. It’s called the blood brain barrier and
you can watch a whole video we made on that by clicking in the corner or checking out
the description. So the blood brain barrier is great for preventing
infection, but also bad for getting drugs into the system to treat any infections that
make it through. Case studies on patients have found conflicting
evidence as to whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can cross the blood brain barrier, but some preliminary
research in China seems to indicate that it can. And like anything that causes inflammation
in the brain, that’s bad news bears. Inflammation in the brain can cause a whole
host of problems, most notably swelling, or encephalitis. That swelling puts pressure on the brain,
causing everything from mild, flu-like symptoms and headaches on up to seizures, hallucinations,
paralysis, and loss of consciousness. Viruses like the flu or other coronaviruses
can also kill brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which wrap around neurons and act as insulation
to help them send signals. When oligodendrocytes die, this results in
demyelination of neurons, which can lead to muscle weakness, vision problems, pain, and
changes in sensation, among other things. Viral infections can also activate the brain’s
immune cells, called microglia, and make them attack the brain’s healthy tissue when they
shouldn’t be. So can SARS-CoV-2 do all of that? Well...we don’t know. We’re still trying to get a handle on what,
exactly, this virus does to the body, and to the brain. So far, it doesn’t seem like neurological
issues are /primary/ warning signs of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but some case reports indicate
that these symptoms, especially headaches, can show up days before the dry cough or fever,
meaning they might be good indicators for when a patient should be isolated and tested
for the virus. But, even if SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t primarily
attack the brain, that doesn’t mean we won’t see a wave of psychiatric and neurological
issues following this pandemic. Researchers at UC San Diego published a paper
in April of 2020, just a couple of months after the pandemic began, to warn the scientific
and medical community that patients who have been exposed to or recovered from COVID19
should be carefully monitored for neurological issues going forward. Based on past influenza pandemics, like the
one in 1918, they say that we should be on the lookout for possible increases in cases
of insomnia, anxiety, and depression, in addition to the risks we’ve already mentioned. And all of this doesn’t even touch on the
ways in which physical isolation, the anxiety of living in a pandemic, worrying about our
loved ones and our health, and the stress of financial uncertainty can all independently
cause serious mental strain. We’re still learning what the long term
effects of this virus will be - and not just on our brains, but on...everything. But this isn’t all doom and gloom! Thanks to technology, we’re better connected
with each other than we ever have been in the past; we’re able to FaceTime with our
grandmas, play video games with our friends, and swap favorite sourdough recipes with our
internet communities. There have been some incredible acts of generosity
and kindness, and sharing our vulnerabilities and fears can help get them out in the open,
giving our support system a chance to prop us up when we need it most. If you’re having a hard time with social
distancing, Micah made a video not that long ago about how to better deal with it. Please, please take this virus seriously. It’s a very scary and stressful time, and
it’s understandable that we’re all feeling impatient for things to go back to normal. I’m sad that I don’t get to spend time
on the beach, or visit with my friends, or go camping or hiking. But I know that this virus is very real, and
very dangerous, and I’ll stay at home to protect myself and those around me. I hope you will, too. How are you doing, Brainiacs? What have you been spending your time on? If you’re one of the cool people still watching,
drop a comment with your favorite sourdough recipe...or any bread recipe I suppose! Just comment
something about bread. That’ll really confuse everybody else. Thanks for watching this episode! Until our next transmission, I’m Alie Astrocyte. Over and out. ",True,False,False,False

It's now racing against time to bring the number of infections and fatalities down. Despite its initial slow response to the coronavirus threat, Indonesia has been ramping up its fight against COVID-19. But there's concern that the move may have come too little too late. Are the Indonesian healthcare facilities well equipped to deal with the rising number of infected cases? And can the authorities control the spread of the virus across its vast archipelago?

when it declared its first scope at 19 case since then the number of cases has grown exponentially spreading to all 34 provinces across the archipelago Jakarta was the epicenter of the outbreak to be honest the government's early response off their tackling of the COBE 19 pandemic has been substandard from the very beginning if you recall earlier in the year when China when South Korea Singapore countries around the region started declaring their coronavirus counts Indonesia was still very much in denial about how many cases they had made third that they didn't have any over 19 cases well until early March in less than a month the number of cases searched from 0 in February to more than 15,000 cases in March and more than 1,000 deaths president Joko Widodo even acknowledged March that the government had deliberately held back information on Kermit 19 cases my caused some kind of panic in in public so this this is the thing that he wants to avoid and the government also at a time I

convenience in the body lately we know that she can't live it reefer but at the moment we not really realize what kind of even there we're not really asking lots about that two three days after she mention it that spilling a bit difficulty to breathing I remember when my mother in demonic went to the hospital I'm talking to her directly so I'm facing and he coughing a couple of times from off me so that could be the droplets go inside to me so today's not not take long two days I already have symptoms feeling really icky and then the starting fever because the Samantha's symptoms were not too bad the hospital allowed him to self isolate in a spare room at home but on March 26 at 3 in the morning his worst nightmare came true the phone is ringing and tells our mother it's it's completely blown my mind say drowning in the sadness anything is chaotic in my mind I know exactly my wife down there and how she see crying and then confusing with semen isolated from the rest of his family members the responsibility fell upon his wife to make all the funeral arrangements they were only given four to five hours to prepare and only his wife and a priest from the church were allowed to be at the funeral can you imagine the one you loved no one kept calm only my wife and one priest from our church we have to prepare everything in four five hours immediately buried the body because he's

mother-in-law who succumbed to the dreadful disease Indonesia's Health Ministry has admitted that the mortality rate of 9% is much higher than the global average but the true number of covert 19 related deaths may never be known Indonesia has limited resources especially when you look at the financing and also personnel the public health personnel too to deal with coffee maintain outbreak what's certain is that Indonesia the fourth most populous country is facing a massive challenge to keep the disease at bay does Indonesia a country known for its inadequate medical infrastructure have

number of deaths in Indonesia has been climbing steadily it leads all other Southeast Asian countries his mortality rate is almost double the current global mortality rate still some observers believe that the actual number of deaths could be far higher the majority of observers know that this the figures that are being released by the government is perhaps far from accurate if we look at the numbers of admissions to hospitals alone if we look at the numbers the higher levels of mortality rates across cities across Indonesia alone we know that this number is not correct so the danger of using this kind of figures as a measure to how well Indonesia doing is dangerous because it's just simply misleading if we compare the testicle capacity Indonesia is probably the lowest in the region with around 300 to 400 tests per 1 million population this is pretty much lower compared to for example Vietnam Vietnam has been able to test more than 2000 people 1 million population and then Singapore has been able to test more than 30,000 people out of 1 million population so there's a lot of thing to catch up for Indonesia to basically test the population Indonesia today faces a severe shortage of vital breathing devices to treat people with the disease according to the Health Ministry Indonesia has just over eight thousand ventilators nationwide for a population of 217 million people it also has 2.7 critical care beds for every 100,000 patients we look at the number of hospital and number of physician or doctors they all fall below the demand [Music] Indonesia also has some of the lowest doctor patient ratios in Asia according to a 2017 whu-oh survey the country only has four doctors for every 10,000 people it's also slightly behind Laos and well behind Malaysia which has 15 in terms of doctor to patient ratio to show his commitment to the cause president jokowi has reallocated some 26 billion u.s. dollars from the 2020 budget to fund the fight against covin 19 of the extra spending the government will allocate four billion dollars for healthcare including the protection of health workers the government has also recently built a specialist hospital on gar Long Island in Riau to treat kovat 19 patients from across the nation a team of Indonesian engineers from vandamm Institute of Technology are also working around the clock to produce compact ventilators to help celebrate the fight against the pandemic yes allocating funds setting up specialist hospitals developing the ventilators were very crucial steps to deal with the situation however first these have to be supported by followed up well follow up policies so that these steps could be effective despite devoting its financial resources to deal with the crisis the statistics seem particularly disturbing there's been an extremely high mortality rate among healthcare workers as of early May the pandemic has killed 38 doctors and 17 nurses many of them welded tirelessly to treat kovat patients and saved as many lives as possible sadly they have become victims of the disease instead for your information Indonesia's health care at the moment I saw the bringer break down because there's just so many patients so until the end of April at least 25 doctors have lost their lives treating comput patients since the beginning of March this is due to like a facility like EPE for example it is also important to know that across the archipelago there are only 300,000 hospital beds at least in the beginning of this pandemic so if you assume that 10% of Indonesia admissions would get the virus the number of bags would already not be enough and of course there are even fewer ICU beds and medical special rooms also very few Penta laters which are very important to treat although hospitals provide the medical staff with personal protective equipment their concerns as supplies could soon run out especially as the number of patients on creasing not only in Indonesia but

medical infrastructure it's a serious challenge facing the country something that it must tackle immediately if it wants to mitigate the impact of future pandemics as you maybe recall that when many countries have already started closing their borders starting the implementation of social distancing measures the Indonesian government is still trying to learn the investor of tourists to come to Indonesia so without understanding about the seriousness of this pandemic the government King may be underestimate the problem and promoted from policy in terms of giving providing economic policy during this period Indonesia appears to be racing to make up for the lost time after failing to implement mass testing and social distancing measures early on but half the measures gone far enough to contain the spread of the virus will they reap dividends in the end [Music] Jakarta Indonesia steaming capital of more than ten million people but the once bustling metropolis is now deserted parts of

ghetto [Music] to stem the spread of Kovan 19 the government has urged people to self isolate and stay home a number of areas such as Jakarta have come and a partial lockdown all workplaces have also been shut as a work from home policy kicks in but for people who live hand-to-mouth or those working in the informal sector such as pushcart traders motorcycle taxi drivers factory as well as construction workers they have little choice but to go out to earn a living many have in fact been laid off as Koba 19 takes its toll on the economy economic situation in the large scale social distancing measures have caused a kind of severe economic damage to the economy the whole economy and also the informal sector and if we look at the government projection have calculated about five million people could lose their job and about 3 to 4 million people may fall into poverty during the pandemic in the worst case scenario the economy may contract to minus 0.4 percent this year I think it's inevitable that we can expect the Indonesian economy to have slowed down and what is more important at the moment at least according to my opinion is for governments to for the government to try to save as many lives as possible growth for Southeast Asia's largest economy has been at its weakest since 2001 as recession looms its GDP rose 2.9 percent in the first quarter of this year is a lot worse than the 4% grow the previously anticipated that does not augur well for some 25 million Indonesians who still live below the poverty line in a ninja's finance minister Sri Mulyani inter Watty

Jakarta he's barely able to keep his business afloat during these challenging times profit 19 has not spared any of the industries and F&B industry is one of the most affected industries as well yes we have not been spared as well as a group we don't believe in laying off people but however in order to sustain and survive and keep breathing and when we cross the situation start running we need our employees but in order to start running when the situation gets over we need to be able to keep breathing at this point of time [Music] as the pandemic continues to grip the country there are growing fears of a repeat of the social and economic chaos that hit Indonesia at the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 the economic meltdown coupled with the deadly riots in the streets of Jakarta then led to the downfall of former President Suharto although the conditions are different today it's always been in the interest of the government to ensure that the pandemic will not plunge the economy deeper into the abyss Indonesia is facing a tough choice at the moment right whether to safeguard its economy or save the lives of its citizens and a lot of governments around the world are facing the very same choice right now when to open up prescriptions what to do next etc but we have to think about this from a long-term perspective as well will the government risk losing a lot of lives to safeguard the economy in the short term if Indonesia loses a lot of lives in the short term that means the long term economic impacts could potentially be even more catastrophic despite the doom and gloom civil society has risen up to the occasion to help ease the burden facing the government and society Indonesians are donating mas to hospitals providing food to those need tailors

that could help them with their daily needs can the government rise up to the challenge and return hope public health and livelihood back to the people [Music] [Music] Indonesian president Joko Widodo had made economic development his main priority of doing the first 100 days of his final time in office but today barely five months after he was returned to office the country is bracing for a recession admit the economic downturn caused by the curve at 19 outbreak companies are forced to lay off thousands of their employees according to government estimates some 5.2 million people will lose their jobs and almost 4 million Indonesians will fall into poverty this will all happen as the world's most populous Muslim nation is ushering in the adult fee tree celebration which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan without doubt the curve at 19 pandemic now constitutes the biggest challenge to president Joko Widodo popularly known as jokowi first term this kind of crisis of this magnitude or complexity so this the second term which is actually the final term of jokowi this being faced with a very difficult challenge the first test whether he can deliver what all of these political promises has been observed that this corona virus pandemic has been a really true test of joeys presidency and about his ability and his cabinet's ability to deal with crisis situation and what their priorities are and from how they're dealing with the situation right now two very obvious priorities of joeys administration one is safeguarding the and to is to not alienate anybody from the religious particularly the Islamist spectrum of Indonesian politics and hopefully these two political priorities doesn't result in human lives and hopefully in prioritizing these political interests the jokowi government has not failed its people in this time of need during this pandemic as the country's scrambles to contain the spread of the virus and cushion the impact of the pandemic

than 2,600 people for 1 million population this is also what makes the Denisha a bit different from a lot of countries in Southeast Asia there has been a lack of capacity in testing in addition to not

Indonesia will as it is around the world will continue to go down and that the government and also officials who are in charge of the mitigation efforts are learning from their earlier mistakes which means that the lives that more informations can be saved and public health provisions or in the nations can also be better improved Indonesia has survived the 1997 Asian financial crisis and countless

I think I experienced everyone of them! For about 36hrs after my second dose I went through what I can only imagine what a mild to moderate case of COVID must be like. However, my side effects lasted much shorter than the real thing and I will not have any long lasting consequences that COVID itself can bring. I share my story to encourage everyone to get the vaccine. You may be miserable for a day or so, but it is much better than getting the real thing! The side effects are expected, manageable, and short lived. Worth every minute to not get COVID! I highly encourage you to get the vaccine when it's your turn.

Always consult a medical professional for matters concerning your personal health.",after getting my second covid vaccine i now have a new appreciation of what my patients who have had coven 19 go through hi i'm dr louis crane board certified family medicine physician and let me tell you the second dose of the covid19 vaccine is no joke it made me feel worse than i felt in a long time stick around for the rest of this video and i'll go through my experiences and tell you why i'm glad i had some side effects and what i think it means for my response to the covet vaccine and how it might protect me in the future [Music] all right let's start back with the first dose of my vaccine which was approximately 31 days before my second dose after that dose i really didn't have a whole lot of side effects had a little bit of an achy arm mild headache and a little bit of fatigue for a couple of days but that was really it nothing real significant now after my most recent dose last friday i felt terrible i got my vaccine at approximately 7 30 in the morning worked the rest of the day felt pretty good my arm got a little bit sore faster than it did the last with the first dose but really not any worse than the first dose but by about 7 30 that night so about 12 hours later i really started to feel bad i started running a low grade temperature started getting really achy had a pretty significant headache to the point where i was on the phone with one of my relatives and pretty much had to cut them off and tell them i had to go because i just felt so bad i hadn't felt that way in a long time that pretty much continued through the night didn't get a whole lot of sleep friday night my temperature got up to about 100.5 and i continued to have shaking chills fever aches headaches just felt miserable most of the night woke up saturday morning feeling pretty much the same spent most of the day on the couch really couldn't do anything i was certainly glad that i got the vaccine on a friday so i had saturday off and didn't really have to do anything or go anywhere because i'm not sure that i could have pretty much laid around most of the day saturday was able to eat and drink normally just felt miserable that pretty much continued into the night and overnight most of the night saturday but happy to report that i woke up sunday morning feeling much better my fever had subsided the chills and sweats had really gone away still had a little bit of headache but that pretty much resolved as the day went on so really only had about 36 hours of what i would consider to be moderate symptoms now let me tell you why i'm actually glad that i had those symptoms i opted not to take anything for my symptoms because i didn't want to blunt my immune response any more than i had to i think if my symptoms had continued for any longer i probably would have but since i had the weekend didn't really have anywhere to go or anything to do i figured i'd just let it take its course and in hindsight i'm actually glad i did now if you look at the reported data from the moderna trial which by the way modern is the vaccine i got there are two of them out there right now moderna and pfizer my health system was giving the modern vaccines that's why mine was 31 days apart you can get it as quick as 28 days apart but just due to logistics and timing mine was 31 days if you look at the data in the trials 92 percent of patients had some sort of a side effect most of those were just injection site pain pretty common you got a shot it gets into the muscle that's where it does its job it makes the muscles a little bit sore 70 percent of people ended up having some fatigue 64 had headache and then as on down myalgia's arthralgias miles just just means muscle pain arthral just means joint pain chills nausea oh i had some of that too by the way i forgot to mention that um sweating fever about 15 of people in the trial had fever so i felt pretty lucky i had just about everything that everybody had but i have to say i would trade 36 hours of misery for getting coveted any day because that short period of time which is consistent with some of the other reports that i've heard from other people who have gotten the vaccine either in the trial or as part of the mass vaccination plan going on right now their side effects last in anywhere from 12 to 36 hours sometimes as long as 48 but most of them went away pretty quickly i would definitely choose that over getting covet and having days of symptoms and potentially the long-term complications that we're starting to see in a lot of individuals so i'm very glad that i was able to get the vaccine before i got coveted itself now why am i glad that i had side effects who wants to be miserable voluntarily right i'm glad i got side effects because if you understand why the side effects happen you know that it's your immune system's response to the vaccine that dictates you getting side effects the fact that i had side effects means that my immune system was kicking into action so hopefully that means in the future my body is going to be able to respond when exposed to the cobot virus and neutralize it before it makes me sick that's the idea behind the vaccine right now not everybody gets side effects and don't think that just because you didn't get side effects that the vaccine isn't effective that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying it's reassuring to me that because i had side effects hopefully that means i'm going to be more likely to be protected from getting coveted in the future now as we age our immune system isn't as robust as it once was and this was shown even in the trials those 65 and older generally didn't have a lot of side effects that's because usually people who are 65 and older have lower immune systems now thankfully in the analysis of the vaccine data they showed that it was highly effective even in those individuals over 65 so again don't take lack of side effects to mean lack of efficacy that's not what i'm saying now please don't take my experience with side effects or anybody else's experience with side effects to deter you from getting the vaccine trust me it's completely worth having a few hours of mild to moderate symptoms versus getting coveted 19 and all the side effects and symptoms and complications that come with it most people describe the side effects of the vaccine to be a mild version of coping 19 and frankly if that was a mild version i don't want the real thing and i think a lot of my patients who have had the real thing would agree with me so please don't let it dissuade you from getting the vaccine there's a good chance you won't have side effects at all there's a chance that they won't be as significant as mine there's a really good chance that they won't last but more than a few hours a day or two at the most and it is completely worth it now i chose not to take any tylenol or ibuprofen i suspect if i had my symptoms may not even have been as severe as they were and there's certainly nothing out there that says you can't take tylenol or ibuprofen i just chose not to that was my choice i'm certainly not advocating that that be your choice if you choose not to i don't think it's going to hurt you and it may help your immune system react more efficiently and effectively but there's so certainly no data that says that's absolutely the case that was just my choice so as the vaccine rollout begins to ramp up i hope you will consider getting the vaccine when it's your turn please if you have any questions about the vaccine ask your local health department ask your provider or if you have general questions leave them down in the comments below and i'll be happy to answer them as best i can alright that's it for today remember as always be safe out there you ,True,False,False,False
68,B9_HVnTRflc,JJ Medicine,Adjustment Disorder | DSM-5 Diagnosis and Treatment,2018-12-18T00:40:45Z,"Lesson on Adjustment Disorder: DSM-5 Diagnosis and Treatment. Adjustment disorder is a psychiatric disorder involving emotional and behavioural symptoms due to a stressor that lead to significant impairment in a person's life. If the stressor (and its consequences) is removed, the emotional and behavioural symptoms are assumed to ameliorate as well. Adjustment disorder can mimic other psychiatric conditions and can have symptoms of depression, anxiety, mixed and conduct issue symptoms. Treatment is generally more conservative and is based on psychotherapy approaches.

JJ",hey everyone in this us we're gonna talk about adjustment disorder and what adjustment disorder is and how we diagnose it so adjustment disorder is also known as situational depression it is a psychiatric condition due to a stressor that results in emotional and/or behavioral symptoms so it doesn't really clarify exactly what it is there could be some criticism as to what adjustment disorder is because it appears to be so vague but generally when we look at adjustment disorder we want to think if the stressor in the patient's life is removed their condition should improve it should basically go back to normal so that is kind of how we want to think about adjustment disorder it's a stressor that's causing their problems it's not an underlying mood disorder anxiety disorder etc now the epidemiology of adjustment disorder it's estimated to be or to affect about two to eight percent of the general population and female-to-male ratio appears that females generally outnumber males two to one so what are some of the dsm-5 criteria for adjustment disorder so the eight criteria basically tells us the most important point as to how to diagnose dustman disorder it is a development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor occurring within three months of the onset of the stressor itself the B criteria is that these symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant as evidenced by either of the following mark a distress that is in excess of what would be expected from exposure to the stressor significant impairment in social or occupational academic functioning the C criteria for adjustment a sorter is that stress-related disturbance does not meet criteria for another mental disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a pre-existing mental disorder this can be very true sometimes a lot of patients can have psychiatric disorders that are induced by a stressor and what this means is that we have to try to exclude other mental disorders that may be causing these patients emotional and behavioral symptoms now we also have to rule out did the patient have a pre-existing mental disorder in the first place and is this just an exacerbation of that pre-existing mental disorder we need to find the chronological time whereby the patient started experiencing the symptoms did they have symptoms before the stressor that were just minor or that were maybe there and weren't diagnosed or were those symptoms just initiated after the stressor so it's important to get a good timeline and again I come back to the idea that if we ask the patient oh if we remove the stress from your life would you feel better would you go back to the way you were before and if they say yes then we can generally think about adjustment disorder not always but that can help us to decide if it's adjustment disorder or not the D criteria for adjustment disorder is that the symptoms do not represent normal bereavement so this is important because we may diagnose a patient with adjustment disorder after a loved one has died so if a patient loses a loved one they may have emotional and behavioral symptoms that are significantly that significantly lead to impairment in their life and they never had a mental disorder before and that they don't meet criteria for another mental disorder we might actually diagnosed him with adjustment disorder but we can't if this is part of a normal bereavement process if the patient has generally lost a loved one in a recent amount of time this could just be normal bereavement the e criteria is basically what I have been mentioning all along is that once a stressor or its consequences has terminated the symptoms do not persist for more than additional six months so we might give an individual diagnosis of adjustment disorder at first and once that stressor in their life has been removed and they continue to have these emotional or behavioral symptoms longer than six months after it's been terminated we might have a change or diagnosis it might not have been adjustment disorder might have been something else I might have had been a major depressive disorder now there are specific specifiers we can use with adjustment disorder we can diagnose patients with adjustment ice order with depressed mood so they may have some sort of depression that doesn't quite fit the criteria for major depressive disorder and it seems to be related to a particular stressor so this might be diagnosis for that adjustment sort of with depressed mood it can also be a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety or with mixed anxiety depression with conduct disturbance with mixed disturbance of conduct and emotions or an unspecified catch-all category we can further classify adjustment disorder based on the following is it due to a single stressor such as maybe relationship breakup is it due to multiple stressors perhaps the patient has stresses in their job and in their marriage that it is causing the adjustment disorder is it recurrent is it something seasonal perhaps they the patient is laid off because they have a seasonal job and they keep having recurrent adjustment disorder because of that seasonal aspect is it a continuous thing going on in their life I like they think of this as living arrangements sometimes if a patient is living in a crime-ridden area or if there's lots of drugs in the area they live in this can be a continuous stressor it's not something that may easily go away but it's continuous and there's also another classification known as developmental events I think of this as the milestones in someone's life milestones can be anything can be start going to college getting married having a baby these can all have can all be a stressor on someone a developmental event that is a stressor that leads to emotional behavioral symptoms that are clinically significant that we might diagnose the person with adjustment disorder so after looking at all of the criteria for jessamine disorder is there an easy way to remember the criteria and make a diagnosis I like to think of the three SS nn6 so that sounds very it sounds very vague but we'll go through it so three three stands for three months since a stressor so the three means three months since a stressor so that's what we need in order to even consider adjustment disorder the S is symptoms so these are behavioral and/or emotional symptoms the other s is that there's a significant impairment in one's life if there's no significant impairment in one's life if they're functioning well there's no problems in relationships there's no problems in their work there's no problems in their school we can't necessarily make the diagnosis of adjustment disorder one of the ends stands for not normal bereavement so if there is a bereavement process that is occurring it might not be adjustment disorder it cannot be in normal bereavement the other n is for not another mental disorder or not simply an exacerbation of a pre-existing mental disorder so those two or those two ends are the exclusion criteria and the other six is that it doesn't last longer than six months after the stressor has been terminated so three SS nn6 so three at the beginning double to six at the end three SS and n six is a possible way to remember how to kind of easily think about the criteria and the exclusion criteria for adjustment disorder so once we've made the diagnosis of adjustment disorder how do we treat it treatment involves brief psychotherapy because this is not a not generally a chronic condition we can use individual or group therapy sometimes we may add a biological treatment to the regimen we may use benzodiazepines they may be used for significant anxiety symptoms if the patient has significant anxiety it's not being well treated with brief psychotherapy we may add benzodiazepines but otherwise we generally use psychotherapy for adjustment disorder patients anyways guys I hope you found this lesson helpful I was a quick lesson on adjustment disorder if you found this lesson helpful please like and subscribe for more videos like this one and as always thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time ,False,False,True,False
69,Vv9sQKeQFTs,ORF,COVID-19 and The New World Disorder I Shashi Tharoor | C Raja Mohan,2020-04-17T12:30:12Z,"The Coronavirus crisis has been instrumental in initiating a decisive and solid transformation in global governance structures as well as the world order. As existing systems of governance, trade, and multilateralism stand challenged, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament in Lok Sabha and ORF President Dr. Samir Saran in their latest book, ""The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative"", attempt to look at global governance systems since 1945,  the rise of China and the challenges it can pose as a potential superpower and new approaches to governance with enhanced roles for India. 

How is the changing post-WW2 systems and multilateralism connected to China's rise as a global leader? With a fractured political-economic consensus, has the international community's capacity for collective action diminished? Given the waning legitimacy of international institutions and a global resurgence of national sovereignty, can the Indian imperative withstand the political buffetting on the global stage? Is there value to boosting multilateral collaborations with international organisations? Are we ready for shorter global supply chains and more restrictions on trade as the US moves towards anti-globalisation?  Has India had the leverage to pick a side in global politics pre or post-COVID-19? Can a global regulatory framework to monitor who leads economic restructuring exist sustainably? Given the revival of national sovereignty and geographical boundaries, how do we move back to borders having limited relevance and looking at the world as a larger collective?

Maya Mirchandani, Senior Fellow at ORF, in conversation with Shashi Tharoor and C. Raja Mohan, Director of ISAS, National University of Singapore discusses the radical shift in global governance structures accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic and India's imperative to push for new law reforms and coalitions between like-minded nations for global sustenance.

#NewWorldOrder #NationalSovereignty #COVID19 #ChinavsWorld #COVID19Pandemic  #CoronaCrisis",namaste and good evening everyone it is my pleasure to welcome you all to who RF Mumbai is inaugural when is a baby now friends misses our humble effort to which we intend to stay engaged with you all in these uncertain times and actually when we are all locked up in our homes and as we just try to adjust the new ecosystem in the digital domain or RF Mumbai will curate more such discussion forums and we promise that in the in the months and the weeks and months to come our engagement will become even more enriching and beautiful and therefore I'm delighted that for the inaugural edition of the Bennis it will be not now we have a fascinating discussion on a fascinating book the New World Disorder and India's and the Indian imperative one of the most telling accounts of India's emerging role in the contemporary global phase who authored by shiteru and war as president Sami 7 so friends if the world was as perceived by the authors in a state of a disorder at the time when they were completing the book commad 19 in many ways seems to have landed a very decisive and a solid transformative punch to the global system and so what will be India is imperative now in the disorderly a world post through 819 is something that we will make this decision so so interesting so without any further ado please allow me to toast the proceedings over to Mike le Maya merchandani who joins us from Delhi as the chair of this inaugural webinar and also dr. Shashi through who needs no introduction to any audiences be in the words in the physical realm or cyberspace and he is joining in from New Delhi as of apresenta and also joining us from Singapore as a discussion is professors one of India's finest strategic players in foreign policy analysts and the director of the Institute of South Asian Studies and the National University of Singapore a warm welcome to all of our panelists and a big thank you to you all for joining in in such large numbers thank you thanks a lot for that and thank you for also having introduced the panelists so we can actually dive straight into the discussion which is as you said on Shashi Tharoor Anthony Sharon's new book the New World Disorder and the Indian imperative so Shashi I mean I'd like to ask you to speak about the book and the idea behind the book but not without prompting you with a question I mean of course the book was written in three kovat times as double pointed out but a lot of what you and Samir talked about and wrote about you know as the Atlantic system is being challenged as the post-world War two system and multilateralism is being challenged had to do with the rise of China and the kind of challenge that China was posing as a potential superpower a union in a unipolar world really to the global system and what that meant for not just the old superpowers but also emerging powers like India so you know give us a little bit of the background and bring us up to speed contextualize it for the for the audience in the current context today Shashi Thank You Maya well what I was planning to do is spend about eight or ten minutes talking about the thesis of the book and then there's another eight or ten minutes telling you how we relate it today to the situation in this curry deflected world that we're living in but the New World Disorder was an attempt to look at the global governance of the international system since 1945 how it's worked who has gained from it who has lost what its limitations and deficiencies are and to prescribe a new approach to global governments which certainly an enhanced role for India that was broadly speaking what we tried to do the International can she is stumbling into the third decade of the century um it's much uncertainty and anxiety about the future even before curving there is into the past century have been undone the grievances real or imagined are being manipulated by strongmen leaders who have gained strength around the world and that subsequent generations are likely to be worse off than their ancestors many claim ah blame our current predicament on these leaders who have actually undermined the norms and institutions in many ways that their predecessors were instrumental in establishing and here too one could argue that these populist figure these ethno-nationalism populist to use the popular shorthand drivers have changed they reflect something that has changed in the world how do we get here it's increasingly clear to communities in countries that is the distribution and agency in the international system is the net credible and it's to be no longer reflects the realities of today the Security Council for example the permanent membership reflects the geopolitical realities of 1945 not a 20/20 now this anger and disappointment directed against globalization within many countries has powered the rise of the strong men and women and I'll the project of economic integration is successfully reduce inequality amongst countries I think inequality within countries has very clearly gone up you've seen essentially that those evangelism evangelizing for the old up noble economic order the order of globalization they were certainly not in a position to be able to ensure the protection of their own people at home from exclusionary economics and the rise of nationalism when when you're looking at a world where 10% of the global population controls 84 percent of the wealth they're not surprised that inequality has risen pretty much everywhere we can talk about the fourth Industrial Revolution and so on which is accelerating the demise of manufacturing the rise of robotics artificial intelligence all of that organized labor is at a crossroads all of this has created a deep sense of economic insecurity in the socio-political currents around the world now the affected individuals of the world have found an ally in digital technologies ordinary people now possess a loud megaphone to express their communicate with each other attack the state sometimes support the establishment sometimes undermine it from the Arab Spring at the turn of the past decade led to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong digital technologies have erased the asymmetry between the voices of those in power and those who are being governed you know the governors and the governed this whole role of digital technology is also up for grabs the very tools are allow communities to mobilize are also becoming instruments to subdue them control them surveil today's technologies are defined by ubiquitous simulants which we already see even with the arrow you see to let us come around our country with couvade now come back to covet but I'm just saying yeah you've got an app which in many ways is supposed to be a boon to trace the progress of the virus because it will use GPS and cell phone tower information see who you met where they were whether they were near people who have food and so on but at the same time that set of tools and algorithms in the hands of a government in the postcode Adira can be used to trace and control movements to bring down your neck valence is also in many ways out of hands out of our hands in the hands of the powerful the rich either the government's or those who have the concentrated wealth and power to design and deploy these systems so there's gonna be a new tussle through technology between agency and control again so if you take all this together the anxieties around technology globalization representation have left democracies around the world struggling to contain how the kind of discontent I've described global governance was once characterized by the rule of elite institutions raised around the set of agreed established principles democracy was running that way now there's a changing mood on the streets that's challenging many of them all norms and values we're all struggling to define this moment scholars and scientifically scientist colonists writers in the Graduate born are all trying to describe all this around the globe using the political climates and democracies described as a liberal authoritarian partial all of the stuff but it's made clear the texture of democracy is undergoing a dramatic shift the time that it takes to fully appreciate the limitations of today's today and the political ideologies are failing to provide purpose and meaning to individuals then people will turn more and more to find refuge in identity in religion the thin line separating church and state is arguably collapsing identity politics religious politics are rising including in our own country many other countries dislocated from the factory floor distant from the corridors of power it individuals who once were prepared to organize themselves in a different kind of global system are now rallying around a far narrower tribal sense of self right located in the specificity is a place religion it's misty David Goethe the British writer has written about the division between the somewheres and the anywhere who are the anywheres of the ones who are comfortable in business class lounges anywhere in the world who flit from five-star five-star hotel conference to conference room speaking the people were called Davos map if you like that's the anywhere and they're comfortable anywhere in the world hearing any language exposed to the world as its call themselves citizens of the world whereas the somewheres are people who take comforts are being routed in one place one language one religion one ethnicity and often one set of prejudices which they share with those around them and they don't want Outsiders coming in that's where a lot of the xenophobia the backlash against comes now this fracturing of the political economic consensus good ad says the somewhere is a winning over the anyway so where is then the international community's capacity for collective actions hasn't have been diminished we see it in the failure of mitigating climate change for example this decade even before kovat the environment was going to have a crucial decade in dealing with climate action and politics because they the impact of climate change is now more visible and more devastating than at any time in history and climate refugees for example are outnumbering those refugees fleeing conflict or even economic migrants so you're really looking at a world in which short-term thinking won't do go these big existential questions yeah but I must say Koval is added to that one could argue before I come to Cove it that other international regimes also gridlocked twentieth century rules relating to trade to connectivity to innovation to peace and security I have all have been undermined that perverse unilateral state behavior by countries instead of searching for shared interests that can make these systems fit for purpose in the 21st century in to be locked into an increasingly destructive zero-sum race and it's having seen all this there Sameer and I wrote about the New World Disorder because we felt it was extremely important for the world to realize that the systems that have been running the world since 1945 have have essentially been completely undermined and here us in New Delhi we need to reseat the paradigms that are challenging this this world system global governments and for us they need is for India's reflexive and discrete responses to these challenges to evolve into the creation of a coalition of like-minded leaders who will use their individual and institutional capacities to respond to the demands of global govern to the 21st century the fact is that the century will take shape in an era of strong leader strong corporations and strong communities an era where cooperation is for addict where contest is frequent where consensus is elusive and so we the second part of the title of our book the new world is order and the indian empire is based on the hope that india will find the courage to take fresh new initiatives to catalyze the new consensus for our world now this ties in of course to what we're seeing with the whole covin epidemic because in many ways the Cova Depa demmick has plagued the international community at its weakest moment as I've described it a time when national politics these various strongman economic parochialism narrow-minded self-seeking are up ending the idea Nobel village and so in our book it's not the values and norms that the global community is professing that we take objection to but the means and methods through which they've been devised exercise and often betrayed and among the many crises of global governance we document to in particular stand out in the context of the corona of iris and the snuke Ovid phonetic the first is the reigning legitimacy of international institutions that I talked about because see what happened with the World Health Organization's response he attacked my President Trump on the w8 show now the new letter going around everybody is whatsapp from the US Congress making various accusations whu-oh certainly pretty much all agree that the indulgence by WH er of the official Chinese line went far too long but it's a very important case in point because we were argued in our book that many of our global institutions and their agencies suffer from politicization manipulation lack of representation and that be leadership is no really not really independent this difficult all have independent purposes disconnects it from the powerful member states and that's true I mean I I've often argued for example that the secretary-general of the UN on the direct agenda of the W issue should have one single non-renewable beholden to the big powers on whom on pleasing whom they're dependent for their reelection but what we're seeing right now is very much that that the the domination of China and the weh show the domination of the US and some other organizations all of this show these limitations that Sameer that I talked about in the book and the second crisis is about the resurgence of national sovereignty waiver with no populist nationalism taken together our world seems increasingly less willing to cooperate and also less able to cooperate look at the headlines we've been seeing around the world you're in coverage right the Trump administration America first instinct that seen them attempt to source a vaccine for the American people alone from Germany yeah to cancer pharmaceutical imports in China so threatened India in a press conference the retaliation we didn't sell them hydroxychloroquine and to sigh meeow even global consensus on a resolution in the Security Council order the g7 by insisting on the divisive Wuhan virus formula which is right now the g7 or the UN Security Council could aggregate China wouldn't allow it right a Beijing meanwhile has got away with letting the virus loose handling it initially in an opaque manner and manipulating the institutional architecture that should have responded to it and now it's trying to play Savior by supplying emergency medical equipment to the world emergency medical teams Italy and all of us come at a price well beyond the cash value because experience suggests that nations would be expected to pay for Chinese health with silence on chinese china's misdemeanors even the EU which was seen as the last torchbearer standing of integration and globalization as has completely failed after brexit to support its member states in their worst public health emergency in modern history there's a real division between the rich countries of northern europe and the rest and they emerge much the worse for us from the so we Sameer and I can only look on with disappointment now the thesis of our book is playing out in real and with such fatal consequences now I don't want to suggest that in a sweeping critique of global governance we want the world to think our readers to think that it's a futile enterprise on the contrary it's the recognition of the interdependence and shared resilience and shared fragility of our global society that prompted us to undertake this exercise had global governance been working effectively the world would have identified the coronavirus as soon as it emerged the institutions would have sounded a global alarm earlier about its dangers and they would have identified and publicized the best practices been adopted by all countries to prevent or limit its spread that this did not happen is a damning indictment of the state of our New World Disorder and as our book demonstrates the coronavirus is far from the first noble bog to witness it won't be the last either in 2001 we learned that anger and malice in the dusty caves of Afghanistan could bring down skyscrapers in New York yeah in 2008 we saw government financial brandade practices in the u.s. grant dives into a global financial crisis in 2016 we saw Russia trying to register itself in the voter rolls for the u.s. elections so is that a new and global market for foreign influence operation so it's made clear that the sheer complexity of I interdependence the impossibility of measuring their interdependence requires more global governance not less but it needs a better form of global governments and that's why we talk about the Indian imperative because these imperatives obviously India first imperative during the virus and the epidemic it's to provide for our people but the truth is that we're facing challenges there are vast and mostly undocumented and migrant informal workforce is already some from the economic fallout of the virus then the medical staff health care workers flight attendants teachers service industry workers or professions that are put in underpaid vulnerable they may be collateral damage we remain hopeful that India's government India Society will see this crisis as an opportunity to give ourselves a reboot resolve the many socio economic inequities that plague our country not the alternative is horrible to contemplate but let's also move beyond the domestic to the international and say that these domestic experiences and policy lessons must be used by the government to shape India's international engagement the pandemic has accentuated governance challenges confronting most emerging economies responding to their needs presents India with the opportunity to be a very different type of power the source of the u.s. is far was its vast geopolitical network military might diplomatic alliances economic institutions China's rise on the other hand was based on us do economic pilots control over supply chains its manufacturing for the world its trade all of that in India can't do those two things what we can possibly do is become the world's first development that is our rice being linked to our ability to provide government solutions to the development needs of millions of people and countries in Asia and Africa and for that we'll have to reboot the ethic and method of global cooperation we have to call out the fact that the world is dangerously slipping into spheres of influence exclusive arrangements limiting our ability to respond effectively to global challenges India's early outreach to our South Asian neighbors and thus our community our proactive role in the g20 all of this demonstrates that it remains adept at navigating ideological and political diversity comfortably some it needs to do at home as well we are not doing the better management of our diversity at home that we can do we need to get that right to be credible abroad I'll conclude by saying that the rapid and global spread of the corona virus epidemic is a devastating reminder of the consequences of the New World Disorder it's also a timely reminder to the sovereign states in the world that the reassertion of sovereignty must not imply an abandonment of responsibilities when the current pandemic is over the globe must learn lessons but what happened how international systems and institutions can be strengthened how we can reform normal governance in order to forestall the recurrence of another botched up kovash kind of suburban kind of situation I will stress that many will find in this pandemic an opportunity to close themselves off to the international community to put up the barriers protectionist barriers bring businesses back home no longer reliant global supply chains and so on India must defy such impulses if anything Indian leadership in these times and a new earth ethic and a new result for global governance that's the Indian embarrassing that maybe just a vaccine that the international community needs to get through a new decade a better global governance I'll stop there and listen to you folks and take your questions thanks so much for those remarks and quick question but before I just housekeeping an announcement for we have about 123 participants who've joined in to this conversation and I just want to request you all that if you have any questions for our panelists once both of them are done speaking put them in the Q&A tab and I will pick up the best questions out of that and toss them to the speakers as well and they'll be hopefully able to address your queries but with that Raja would let me ask you you know Shah he started his his comments by talking about the challenges that had been posed to it's not in you know just just up to the last year before covalence some of the things he pointed out was about you know the collapse of the global order in a sense post sort of economic protectionism coming in in play in certain country how we've seen what some scholars call like a democratic backsliding so to speak which which you know allows populist leaders and strongmen to you the very tools and the very mechanisms of liberal democracies are light elections and things like that to their advantage and then feed on grievance and anger and and you know protectionism and things like that so we have we have you know examples of that all over the world we've just seen for example in the midst of this Kovach crisis what Viktor Orban has done in Hungary with his power as well and you know the idea of ruling by decree until further notice so that's one part of the question I mean the Indian imperative of Canada can it withstand this kind of political buffeting on the global stage that's one and the second part I'd like you to take on is you know the point that she made about the value of international organizations and multilateral frameworks and the need to kind of also find ways to boost that kind of collaboration rather than turn protectionist in in a deep way but you know we've seen the United States walk out and say it's gonna stop funding from the w-h-o which walked out of the Human Rights Council last year as well and yet it expects that agencies with which it treats with disdain are going to actually also look at the you know I mean there's a contradiction over there that the US is saying on the one hand they're not doing any work or they're battling for China or they're battling for you know any other country or the Russians or whatever have you but you know we're not gonna do anything about it we're just gonna walk away is that the right answer the right no Jimmy can we find a middle ground here let me begin by congratulating Shashi and some aid for doing this book it's an important book and I think it comes at a time as I say most of the things timing is everything so sure she got the timing right so in fact it comes exactly at a time when the commit crisis as Shashi said earlier is only accentuated the already existing trends so it's not something that has started we've seen this trends build-up certainly since the 2008 global financial crisis so I think it's less support populism I think it's less about values is less less about institutions my senses there are five broad themes nothing she covered the whole range with a broad set of issues I would just identify five quick issues and see how India needs to respond in first his globalised dish after 1990 it was assumed that globalization was inevitable reversible and it everyone had to has to deal with it what we seen happen in the last ten years is people in the developed countries who feel they're lost from globalization like America's global elite in partnership with other global elites was outsourcing jobs in sourcing labor and has put them at a terrible double disadvantageous situation so I think the populism is a manifestation of economic loss for a large number of working people in the West and that produced a backlash which Trump is channelling so I think whatever you might think of him he's put onto something and he's turned the Republican Party which is supposed to be Democrat you know which is a rich man's party is turned it into working man's party with anti trade anti-globalization and the need for changing the rules to help the poor guy of which in the u.s. so so this is a very very argument that comes from a different what about the fact is for years we've complained America is imposing globalization on us now we've got to deal with the fact America is walking away from globalization are we ready for this of the ready for a shorter supply chains in the world are we ready for more restrictions on trade are we ready for pullback of large number of production centers from outside China Asaf it will go back to the rich countries so I think it's a very very different situation so I think this can be understood mainly in terms of the the reflections in terms of populism so I think it poses a big challenge for us the what seemed lost 30 years a central feature of global economy is being reversed and I think we just at the beginning but there's WTO or w-h-o both a whole lot of institutions are going to come under stress second I think is the power that has begun between China and the US so part of the occupant in globalization is that look China has gamed the system and has taken advantage when you say China is the factory for the world today exports to everyone and creates deficits everywhere therefore most people just accept it it doesn't make a difference to Google it doesn't make a difference to Amazon but it does make a difference to people in Ohio people in smaller places so I think they're pushing back so so so I think the whole question that if China's gain the system like in whu-oh or in WTO America is pushing back now you could argue with the methods the style of drums governance but we must see this for what it is it is a genuine power struggle between USA and unwise in China and this when you talk about the Cold War the big difference between US and Russia u.s. in China is China is the second largest economy Russia will never boss China's globally integrated it is dominates a whole lot of flows a very different game so we are in twist a new Cold War which is very different from the first one and how this power struggle pays off I think creates conditions for India are we going to be non-aligned are we going to be multi aligned so where are we going to be that is a question that's going to come to us in a in a big way the third is the digitalization that is taking place and that is poses that is changing your society your politics the political mobilization your media and that interrelationship on this cyber issue the book talks at the whole chapter on cyber related issues the whole governance of the new digital world in which again the China's dominance of 5g China's use of you know its current dominance is again a problem so therefore the pushback against 5g also begins from the US and I think India partly agrees with the US on the Bri and the push so if I think we are in a situation where how you govern the technology book has some very interesting insights there so I would certainly recommend the chapter for most of you who want to read read the book the fourth issue is really the global governance which is the central team talked about but I think the globalist and I'm not impressed by this argument somehow suddenly Trump is wrecking the international institutions cannot transcend the power structure that exists UN did not work because Russia and America fought during the boom barring for a decade of the 1990s when she was probably in the UN in a leading role the rest of the time you will never work so to to be moon today some of the UN is not working never work it created an illusion in the 1990 you somehow Chinese and Russians will just go along with the Americans and they're not China's Brazil it wants to set its own rules it wants to put its own laws it wants to shape the international system it's pushing back so you can complain about this till the cows come home but we got to deal there is the international institution the post-war institutions as I said from WTO to whu-oh are going to be reef restructured reoriented some will be deconstructed some will be reconstructed so because we prepared rather than be mourn the loss of the old institutions and finally it's really the book the game talks about sustainable development which is man and nature the assumption that nature you know it doesn't matter be keep doing what we are doing under the impact on nature would not affect us and I think both the COBIT crisis and climate change in a very classical way of showing our interdependence with the nature so that demands I think a whole way of doing economic things the sustainable development argument which is in the book and more fundamentally how do we deal whether it is the microbes or carbon how are we going to deal with it is a big problem so I would just conclude by saying once again this is a good book to think and reflect about our current condition and I think for India this is the moment to think clearly because we're not in a position to make definitive judgements on where the world is going all that we know is the world is changing and changing maybe rapidly and the India today is in a better place than in the 1950s as the third-largest economy if in PPP terms still even with our you know current problems that we need to take a leadership role we need to build new coalition's and not be tied down by the old baggage sometimes India keeps going back to the old baggage but I think today we need to take a fresh look the key question must be how does it suit me what am I interests and to what can India contribute to the structuring of the most stable system I think that is where the challenges and I think book gives us a starting point to think about right I think I mean Raja moon and Shashi both of you have touched upon this this one aspect this is the supply chain global supply chains that a China actually controls so it's not just in terms of manufacturing today but also digital technologies which china and robotics by china is kind of becoming sort of collection center of the power center once again for the world so you know when when Roger Mullins makes the point that China wants to play by its own rules and United States is pushing back at global fora you know for a country like India if the Indian imperative is what we are really looking for under the ambit of you know India's own self-interest and autonomous choice there is non alignment 2.0 whatever terminology you want to give it a strategic autonomy where do you see India actually choosing aside are we in a position to do the side both freak Ovid and postcode were we in a position last year at this time and are we in a position today to pick a side if it comes to that because you know again Shashi why don't you take that first then we get we get Roger to come and comment on that as well no I love it Amaya's question is well become no I was saying that look which side do we take I mean I think it's a good question we take India side wherever India's interests are and Shashi famously said once upon a time long long ago that India should not be doing immoral running commentary on the world the lines man was constantly blaming others for force I think we have in the game this time we got some elbows so I think we gotta play the game that we need to join therefore whoever we can to shape the rules that both for us and work for a larger part of the world and not this standing outside and pointing a finger and I think that model the running commentary that model running comment to be sure she talked about I think it's time to put that aside see with the very cold-blooded thing where is this world going or how do we secure ourselves first and then how do we help others and to create a more stable system shall she the question to you was you know what India would take if it were if it's supposed to pick a side well I agree with rather first of all that means speaking I think both of us would be saying much the same thing for about a decade now that means going back even when I was in government I was pushing this view then we need to take a more proactive role that we as a country well we have the technology the human resources the capital the skills to really make a difference on everything from cyberspace to outer space from riding to the plane shed our reticence stop commenting from the outside and so I'm actually becoming a player saying that you know I'm conjunct in fact that we need to be at the high table and all of these decisions pick up in global geopolitics if you're not at the table you're on the menu and you know we've been eaten full up I'm others for a rather long time so the importance of actually being a a rule maker rather than a rule takers we've been for seven decades in the global system this is something that's rather important and I I think see eye to eye on the the need for India to be a little more active I think we're part company with my co-author Samir is on whether today's India or the India particularly of the last year is going to have the credibility in the international system to make the kind of impact that it's otherwise capable of doing because an India that was being divided with politics of bigotry and Prejudice with many sections of its population up in protest with the fish being stifled and so on is not a great advertisement for the successful management of diversity that how do we broad and preach the same thing that we are failing to do spectacularly at home so I would say India defined as being well beyond any one government but the India that we all have seen over a period of time is in India that is ready to play imperatively role on the global stage and there I think we can identify Raja and I very easily the areas where we would agree on India are stepping up if it were willing to because we know the areas where we can make an effective contribution whether it's peacekeeping whether its rules for outer space whether it's up the digital divide and how to overcome it you know the whole system of global governance rests on the idea you shape common rules for the road in the common interests of all of humanity but now we have a number of leaders on the world stage you're going on saying America first and written out in India first and so on how do we create a cooperative spirit where people say that it's we are first when it comes to domestic interests but globally we understand the value and the merits of pulling some of our interests together moving forward I believe that the kovat crisis has been a setback rather than an advantage some would see this as an opportunity to reboot the system and the optimist in me wants to say that and rather more or less say this change will come and let's take take the opportunity my worry is that the wrong change may come and the reaction took over you may see more barriers going up between countries whether economic barriers barriers to trade barriers to foreign investment you already have the Japanese story of giving two billion dollars to Japanese companies to pull out of China and come back to Japan and further 250 million quietly has been given to those companies that can't be viable in Japan but can pull out of China and move to third countries now if it's merely a diversification of places of investment and supply chains fine then we also gain from it every one gains if it is a retrenchment and a retreat back to their own economies then a lot of consequences follow the world becomes once again divided into various mutually unfriendly camps right consumer goods go up in price if China no longer scaling up the advantages of cheap labour and I change for the world but you're buying things made in America that useful made in China you'll be paying more for as simple as that and in many ways the global economy will look very different if the negative things happen we'll have to wait and see how these others Freeza but I do worry as I saw one of the question that came up was was that I've been cribbing about strongmen leadership you rather have namby-pamby persons no I'm talking about strongmen leadership in the sense of leadership that is that is not interested in global cooperation not versus namby-pamby leadership but versus the co-operative leadership the noble system don't forget was evolved by the very people who had won World War two the United Nations is what they call themselves even when the media called them the allies and it's the victorious alliance of world war two that converted itself into the presum organization called the United Nations they were not namby-pamby people yeah but stood there were farsighted states will like thinkers who understood the importance of global cooperation to prevent the horrors of the first half of the century when you had world war civil wars countless displaced people horrors of the Holocaust and Hiroshima and they said never again let's create a world on prevent all those things happening and with all respect to my friend Roger who said the UN never worked the UN did prevent World War three it did prevent a lot of the horrors the world had seen in the first half of the 20th century from happening so to that degree it seems to me that that that there was some gain from the systems but if they become old and atrophied it it reflected the geopolitical realities of 1945 now for 2010 we need to change it all there we can't change it through America first type leadership yeah humanity first kind of leadership yeah okay so Raj you know why don't you respond to some of that also I think she's touched upon a lot of the questions that are being asked of especially in the context of hyper nationalism and xenophobia and it's this fear that you know something like this we've already seen you know the shutting down of global travel for example visa regimes to get tighter or things like that how would that manifest going forward will there be an opening up or not does this play into the kind of protectionism and isolationism and an inward-looking politics in a sense so you know take that on but also tacked on to that you know we have a lot of questions that are asking about the geo-economics of it and the economic future for example right now given how things are globally on the economic front I mean you know India is projected growth rate is now below 2% for annum you know Chinese forms buying stakes and companies in America and Europe and Australia for example developing countries seeking out IMF loans to be sort of come out of the kind of crisis also a lot of economic turmoil we've seen in the past few years now really you know sinking even further in the wake of this crisis so what role was China play in sort of play out some of these countries or roles can the countries play themselves can there be a global regulatory framework that one can evolve which can sort of monitor who takes charge of of an economic restructuring I think we're going to first see the breakdown of the existing order we not constructing anything actually we are already breaking up what exists because it doesn't work for some people and Trump says American people WTO is not working for them and a lot of Democrats support him on that so WTO has come to a situation where it can't India said our set does not work for it because China will dominate Trump says the same thing I mean it's not the fact of China's power and China's gaming of the global trade system has created a pushback stop it aggressively some of it most softly like in the Indian case so I think what we seeing is is really that a rearrangement of the existing institutions and if possibly I would say a competitive multilateral it's not that Trump is just walked out and set up something new they're talking about setting up a new WH er kind of organization Xi Jinping has talked about a global health Silk Road Xi Jinping a set of belton Road initiative Xi Jinping a set of Asian investment bank which is rivals to the existing institutions so they already a rising China wants to set up its institution they've already started this and America is just woken up and they're pushing back so I think there will be new institutions and I think I would think this is an opportunity for us to be able to define a set of rules using our way today which we didn't have debate in 1945 we are the model break but today you are the economic weight to weigh in on many of these issues and shape the outcomes but I think we have to be mindful of one important difference today compared to the last 30 years Shashi talked about it sovereignty sovereignty is back the state is back first thing you do is shut your borders done when people say germs don't have you know but it's no germs than cross models germs come with people so when every country has shut its borders and the flights were stopped so so I think this idea which the important thing is when you're in a crisis you're trying to protect your home now how do we work the new rules there I'm agree I'm fully with rushing that this is not just about protecting yourself which is the first responsibility of any sovereign state to is its to its own people but today Shashi used a very important phrase like-minded nations so this is not about non-aligned movement this not about g77 this is about a group of people who share your interests to take that forward and create what we can because they will be competing groups after all this doesn't respect the world lines we had Arabia the United States and Russia three people you can say that democracy is not democracies but three of them get together and fix them up does it fit into any of the old patterns it doesn't know China is an oil expert I mean u.s. is an oil exporter Russia is always beep so these are the swing producer today they get together so I think we got to be open to creating coalition's with like-minded countries on an issue based faces look if bi is a problem for you then you work with the Americans and the Japanese to do something else if you want to build something in the Indian Ocean you must do something on your own because US is an outside power you can build your own internal capabilities and help other condition Indian Ocean so flexible coalition's coalition's with like-minded countries and creating multiple coalition's to pursue multiple interests so I think what we need to do is take out alignment out of this equation it is we could be an important actor we must push your interests but embedded in a in some kind of a common good that is what I think the balance between realists like me who say look power is what matters and Russia she was saying we got to work together to produce some kind of a global governance framework and I think these two can be combined and that is the trick one if the state is come back the state has to be smart as well it has to be navigate the new possibilities of the new dangers that are coming from retreat of globalization renewed power contestation new technologies in all these the state has a very very important role of balancing regulation and promotion of new institutions new structures within which will help us leverage our position in the international system bring that back to you because you know Raja movement made the point that sovereignty is back and I agree with him because I mean the first thing we saw was this idea idea of these are our national borders and by shutting them down and you know Outsiders stay out kind of thing um up until even three months ago we were talking about how the digital disruption and technology and you know we tech companies are kind of becoming all those supranational powers in themselves have made geographical boundaries somewhat irrelevant do you agree that we have seen the revival of that boundary and that border in no uncertain terms and if we have how do we get back to a place we can actually have this conversation about you know borders having limited relevance but you know the world is a larger community i mean i think i think the question on everybody's mind today are for example you know all of us as you said are anywheres people you know we're comfortable and in different continents in different airports and in different cities all across the world we've lived everywhere do we foresee that coming back i mean what is your projection roger moon do you want to take that on and then we get rusty back into it no no i said look the state is back yeah and as internationally internally you seem you have the Tories in UK talking about rebuilding national health service you have the republicans talking about the poor people in the US so the state is going to spend money like water now you know the US congress is both sides are together in spending money so this idea of the thatcher rican consensus that underlay the globalization such a global thatcher regan consensus came in the in the 80s and the globalization started in the 90s consonances internally has broken up in the advanced countries so therefore and that reflects internally the state is going to do more to address the questions of inequality which we started with it's also going to address the concerns of the people at the bottom half of the society and that also means externally the state this idea somehow google and amazon will open up the world and everybody's going to happy in this anarchic stateless world is always illusion and I think that illusion has been shattered by the Cova crisis that without the state today's Facebook Google saying please regulate social media yes make sure you set rules for us internally and rules externally which is micro for example is calling for a code of contact so I think the state and interstate with a - not you know not supranational not you know transnational but inter - national engagement among like-minded states I think is the is the key and on the economic front Roger one what's your prediction I think we wrap with that question because shashi signal seems to have frozen but just answer that look I think there is going to be weakening of globalization at the same time new productive forces are being unleashed by technology so just as India popped out of our cell now what does it do does it create national champions does it say internally we need to rebuild our domestic capability say for example on the drug industry all the APS are coming from China are you going to just let our nation's mere economic units that do maximization of profit for capitalists all are the social communities are the cultural communities which demand that finally this is not just about economic efficiency but this is also about keeping a community or a nation together and that's why the state has to mediate internally between capital and labor between different groups so that it is not the kind of you know wild ride that we've had all these years and externally you can't let other states take advantage or take international capital to take advantage of your internal structures so I think it is a fresh compact between state and between states and I think I mean we leave it at that point because that fresh compact if you're talking about also is going to create or challenge existing economic models I mean that we've seen globally we've seen the sort of arguments between capitalism and socialism and communism and all for the better part of the 20th century and today we're looking once again the public no matter what straight out of society you belong to whether it's the migrant laborer whether the very wealthy who are looking to the state who are looking to systems that have been put in place by the state to actually pull us through these extremely uncertain times so you know I think that question about what kind of economic model or so your economic model is going to have to be addressed as and when we emerge from this crisis doctor socialism is back hey Bernie Bruce so you have you see Germans to Biden moving to the left a lot of presumed right-wing leaders are already moving to the left a big shift that is taking place internally in most advanced countries right thank you so much for being on this I know it's late at night in Singapore for you but we appreciate your taking out the time the rules thank you for having been with us we seem to have lost your connection but hopefully we will do many more of these given that we're all house bound and have time on our hands and have internet connectivity which still connects us across borders so in that sense borders still remain a little irrelevant but thank you all for being part of this discussion and we really appreciate your taking up [Music] ,True,True,False,False

About Me: 
Some of you may know me by my Instagram handle @Fifteenblades. My name is Dr. Rola Rabah. I am a fourth-year Oral & maxillofacial resident completing my 6-year residency to become a dual MD DDS degree Oral surgeon. Follow my channel for weekly videos covering a variety of topics including residency, fashion, and health.

If you have a business inquiry, please reach out to biz.fifteenblades@gmail.com",hi guys my name is doctor willard i am an oral maxillofacial surgery resident and today i am going to share with you my experience getting the covid19 vaccine i got moderna dose one a few days ago and i am really excited to share my vlog about my day-to-day experience with this vaccine and my side effects this is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but that is my own experience with a vaccine you or someone else you know may have a different side effect profile they might react very differently to the vaccine this is just my own personal experience and i wanted to share it with you in case you are curious what someone who is young and healthy in the healthcare field might experience and remember i am a doctor but i am not an expert in infectious diseases i am not an expert in vaccines or virology however i do get all of my information from reputable resources i only give you evidence-based information and i do ask please if you are out there doing your own research which you should it is totally okay to have questions and to ask questions and to do your own research but if you do please make sure that the information you gather is from reputable resources like the cdc i will link below some resources that i personally use in order to get the latest information this is a fast evolving pandemic a fast evolving vaccine and it is totally normal for you to have hesitations however with the right information that's how i was able to come to a decision to take the vaccine and i hope that you will too as a public health request and something that we could do together in order to end this pandemic this video is in no way trying to persuade you to do one thing or the other at the end of the day i want you to have the best information out there and i want you to be able to make a decision you're comfortable with keeping in mind all of the evidence out there i believe in vaccines i believe they are one of the most important things that has happened to medicine and has saved thousands and thousands and thousands of lives um it is something that is going to give us a lot of hope and going to aid in ending this pandemic and so i am utterly excited to have gotten this vaccine and i cannot wait to get my dose too there are two vaccines out there right now in the u.s being administered there is the pfizer vaccine and there's a moderna vaccine clinically they are totally equivalent however there are a few differences between the two for example the dose that you get it's a higher dose with moderna a lower dose with uh the pfizer vaccine you also have differences in the duration between the first and second dose with pfizer you have to wait 21 days to schedule your second dose with moderna you have to wait 28 days to schedule your second dose however both vaccines do require a second dose in order for you to have immunity additionally both vaccines have the same efficacy meaning that they will protect you approximately the same uh amount uh the same percentage uh one is 94.1 that is the madonna vaccine and the pfizer vaccine is 95 effective and so these vaccines are highly effective compared to other vaccines out there and other vaccines that we use every year and so this research that has gone into these vaccines acts absolutely incredible i'm just astounded by the research the studies that were done which i will also link and share below and everything surrounding the rollout of this vaccine has been absolutely astonishing and i'm so so so so excited and proud to be part of the first group who has gotten this vaccine based on recommendations our hospital got the first batch of vaccines and distributed it to the most high-risk individuals and are still distributing it every single day and so i was actually placed in category one as you know i'm an omfs resident and so everything we do in the mouth is highly aerosolizing and so um healthcare workers who were working with patients and were going to be at high risk of being round covered patients got the vaccine first and they were staggered in order to monitor for symptoms and side effects and once you got your invitation to schedule your vaccine you scheduled your vaccine you went and got it and then you scheduled your second dose um the understanding is anyone that has gotten a first dose will definitely get the second dose that's how the vaccines are being distributed and so without further ado i'm going to show you in a vlog style so it's less formal what my experience has been getting the vaccine remember this is dose one so if you are interested i will do a vlog about my experience getting dose 2. if you are interested don't forget to let me know below and before you go anywhere please make sure you subscribe to this channel follow me on instagram at 15 blades and like and comment below hey guys so i am walking to the hospital to get my covert vaccine this is dose one of two i am really feeling all sorts of emotions excitement relief um anxious all sorts of things but i'm heading there now done done first shot done excited hey guys i just got my shot i am feeling like a million bucks um you know during the entire pandemic i just walked to the hospital every day with this profound fear that i was going to bring kovid home to my loved ones but i knew i had a commitment i had a job i was dedicated i wanted to help people so i still went every single day put on a ton of ppe and worked through it all but today just feels different it feels like hope is here the beginning of the end and so i can't even describe this feeling that i have i'm just ecstatic really really truly ecstatic and the entire process was really easy um i just answered a couple questions about whether or not i've ever had covet my symptoms um anything like that any allergies that i know i've had before with other vaccines or other medications they looked at my medical record and my medications really quickly um and then once all of that was set i got my cdc card with my vaccination record they wrote down the vaccine number and i got my first dose of moderna and honestly i did not feel it at all like if i wasn't holding my phone recording the footage for you guys i would have had no idea that the nurse was done with the injection because it was so painless the entire process was really seamless afterwards i sat down in the observation unit for about 15 minutes because they wanted to make sure that i didn't have any sort of reaction most people that were sitting in there did not have anything at all nothing that i saw and we all just kind of left and went on with our day and i made an appointment in 28 days to get my second dose of the vaccine so that's all set and i am like so excited for it you guys i know i've said that a thousand times but truly truly this is an incredible feeling and so far everything feels amazing um no symptoms at all after the vaccine i had no symptoms whatsoever didn't feel faint didn't feel um any sort of symptoms my arm is not sore at all and so i'm gonna go on with my day monitor my symptoms today and then tomorrow i will let you know how i feel good morning everyone so it is the morning after my covid vaccine dose one of two and i'm feeling pretty good i have to say the only symptom i really had yesterday um was a little bit of a sore arm and this morning that sore arm went from like zero to a hundred so my arm is quite sore it's this one i can't even like lift it past my shoulder um typically whenever i get vaccines i get some soreness at the site of injection and so i'm not super surprised because it happens to me every year with the flu vaccine and i remember once i had like typhoid vaccine and it was really painful and so this is pretty sore probably more sore than when i get the flu vaccine but that's pretty much it other than that i feel pretty good i'm headed into the hospital right now to go on with my work day i will keep you updated and let you know how it goes as the day goes on because technically i don't really hit 24 hours for another six to eight hours and so we'll see how i feel after 24 hours but so far so good i'll keep you posted hey guys so it's about 2 30 p.m and i ended up coming home a little bit early i am starting to feel really fatigued um no other symptoms just really tired like i felt like my body was kind of achy and i was really sleepy that's not usually the case for me especially this time of day and so i did have one more case of anesthesia left but the crna was that i was with was like you know what just go home get some rest you might as well and normally i blow it off and be like no i'm totally fine but i just really felt like i needed to get into bed and just turn off the lights and take a nap my body just feels exhausted like i i went and had a really huge workout and got no sleep and that kind of day after feeling um that's pretty much my only symptom and then this awfully sore arm like my arm is so sore i was intubating in my first case and i was having like a hard time doing it because my arm was so sore um but other than that i really didn't have any other symptoms i actually when i was in the recovery room i ended up taking my temperature just to make sure that i didn't have a low grade temp or anything um and i didn't i was normal temperature i took my blood pressure and it was totally normal i really don't have any other symptoms i don't feel nauseous i don't have any headaches no abdominal pain nothing really other than the sore arm and just feeling really fatigued really tired and wanting to take a nap and so you know it is early i'm going to just not settle an alarm i'm going to hop into bed um and take a nap and see if i feel better when i wake up and just keep moderating my symptoms and i'll let you guys know hey guys so it's about um four o'clock and um i didn't set an alarm or anything i just woke up naturally i'm not really a nap taker but i do feel better i think that nap did wonders for my body i'm still feeling kind of achy um arm's still sore but overall i'm feeling a little bit better so i think my plan is just to go to the living room watch some netflix drink some hot tea and just take it easy for the rest of the day and i'll let you guys know how i feel tomorrow hey guys it is officially day three after i got my dose one of the moderna covid vaccine and i am feeling like a thousand times better my sore arm is so much better it is still a tiny bit sore but that's about it not feeling fatigued anymore no more body aches no symptoms whatsoever i went to work did a full day of cases today came back home and i am energized back to normal everything feels great so really my symptoms um there were no symptoms the day of the vaccine most of my symptoms were on day two 24 hours after i had the vaccine just a little bit of fatigue body aches um and definitely a sore arm aside from that i was totally good to go the day after and really if i didn't have such a relaxed schedule on day two of the vaccine i could have definitely just worked through it it really my symptoms felt like um you know a bad day after a gym or you know a day after getting not a lot of sleep so it wasn't anything severe wasn't anything that was gonna going to throw me into bed um probably could have worked right through it but because i had a chill day i ended up coming home and taking um the rest of the day to just relax and so that was my entire experience with the vaccine and those were all of my symptoms truthfully and so hope this is helpful for you guys and i hope that with this information you can kind of do your own research and talk to other people see what their experience has been this is a really really interesting time in history the pandemic is something that has really shaken the entire world and the fact that we've come up with a vaccine one year later is absolutely incredible i'm so proud of science i believe in science i believe in this vaccine which is why i went and scheduled my vaccine as soon as i was able to but remember you guys no matter what um news is out there do your due diligence make sure that you're getting your information from legitimate resources um that means people who are experts in this field even myself i'm a doctor and i'm not an expert in vaccines i'm not an expert in viruses i'm not an expert in infectious diseases but i do know where to get good information from i do know who to trust and who to listen to and bad information out there is going to really hurt our country it's going to hurt your neighbors it's going to hurt your family so make sure that you are listening to trustworthy resources trustworthy information and if you're following influences on social media pick out the information that is logical and once you do go and do your own research as well don't just stop there make sure you take everything with a grain of salt and only after you do really good research from valuable resources i will link below some official resources for you to find out more information about the covid vaccine and coronavirus in general um make sure that you make your decisions based on that and on that alone it's not based on emotion it's not a based on what blogger has said what and it's certainly not based on what politician has said what this is not political this is medicine this is science and this is how we are going to combat this disease and how we are going to move forward together as a community thank you so much for tuning in you guys don't forget to subscribe to this channel like this video comment below let me know if you've gotten the coven vaccine and what your symptoms were like remember everybody's totally different and so just because i experienced these symptoms does not mean you're gonna experience them you might have different symptoms based on your body and your reaction to vaccines this is just my own personal experience so understand that and take that information and use it as you please thank you so much you guys don't forget

World Health Organization (WHO): https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019","(upbeat music) - Defining anxiety
disorders can be tricky. What are anxiety disorders and when does normal anxiety become a clinical condition? Dr. Ramani answers these questions in today's episode of our
anxiety disorders series. Dr. Ramani, can you define
normal anxiety for me? - Normal anxiety is
appropriate to the situation. It's worry, it's a
response to uncertainty. If a person is facing a stressor
where there's an unknown an exam, a deadline at work, there should be some
worry, it motivates us. In fact, a normal curve that associates anxiety and performance, it
shows it's an upside down U. There's a top of that curve, you get optimized performance. That's where anxiety is sort of at this perfect mid-level. Just enough to get you off your butt and make sure you study
and your mind is sharp. So anxiety can actually enhance
performance to a degree. It sets some stakes in there, and then again, if we're
having a stressor in our life, it's appropriate to be anxious, 'cause it leads us to mobilize resources. We don't say, I got an exam, I think I'm gonna take a nap. We're like, I have an exam, I better study, I better focus. And it activates us. So that's normal anxiety,
it's appropriate worry about the things in life and that when that issues resolves, we sort of let go of some of that anxiety and move on to the next thing. If we stay in a situation
of anxiety for too long, almost like our sympathetic
nervous systems, our fight or flight, is
activated for a long time, that's not good for our health. It releases stress hormones, it wears us down physically
and psychologically. So there's a point at which when the thing we're worried about passes, that we let it go. That's normal anxiety. We all have some of it, it's what gets us out
of bed in the morning. - And so, I think there's a
lot of people that would say, or think, that we shouldn't have anxiety. Any time they feel anxious
they go ope, this is bad. This shouldn't be happening. - We're all, I mean, in the modern world, we're all going to have a little bit. I have to say, it's getting worse, 'cause now we even have anxieties around, what do you people think
of my social media posts and things that, that to me, that's actually rather wasted anxiety. It's really about things
that have to do with maybe survival needs,
taking care of your family, taking care of your job,
making sure that things are sort of running on
time, and when that's, that demand is higher, for
us to be a little anxious, like I said, it can enhance performance. But to live with no anxiety, that would be a little bit problematic,
'cause anxiety also creates a little bit of a check
and a balance system in us. It makes us aware. Self-aware and aware of others. Like, I want to make sure
I say the right thing. I want to make sure that I'm on time. Like, there's an awareness of it. When we talk about the
absolute absence of anxiety, we're actually talking about psychopathy. A person worries about, like hey, I'm willing to take your
wallet and shoot ya, because I'm not worried. You know, that's the most
extreme example of it. Obviously, when you're
just having a good day, and things are moving along, you don't need to expend that much worry. I wouldn't call it
anxiety if you're saying, oh, I want to be on time to school, you get in the car, you go. That's something you have over-learned. But, if it's a day you have
a test, and if you're late, for example, and being late
will mean you'll have less time on the test, that anxiety
might mobilize you to say, I better leave a half-hour earlier today. You might feel that little
churning in your tummy. If that enhances performance,
it's not a bad thing. - So, you're using the example of a test, and when I was in college
a lot of people said, oh, I get a lot of anxiety around tests. I did too, but it didn't inhibit me. - Right. - Are there people who can have
too much anxiety for a test? - Absolutely. In fact, test anxiety
and treatment programs on test anxiety, they're
all over universities. They're offered all the
time, and it can get so bad that the person freezes during the test, and then they don't
pass and it's not really a valid indicator of how
much they know that material. And that's heart-breaking to witness. So, there'll be all kinds of programs, including time management,
breathing, preparation, sitting in the right
part of the classroom, I mean, all kinds of techniques. But a lot of it's self-talk. - So, from a simple
standpoint, anxiety is normal and it's not bad unless it is causing you to go through some
undesirable consequences? - Yes, unless it's causing you a sense of subjective distress. You feel uncomfortable. I don't want to feel like this. Or, it's causing you
some form of impairment. You're not doing well on the
test, it's getting in the way of your relationships, people
are like, you need to stop, you're obsessing over this. Other people are noticing,
it's what we call, when it causes significant
distress or impairment, that's when we start thinking
of the anxiety as a problem. - As a disorder. - As a disorder, yeah. So, can someone have an anxiety disorder without ever have gone
through normal anxiety first. - So, the idea that when a
person has an anxiety disorder, they likely have always
run somewhat anxious. If you sort of scroll back on
the life histories of people who have anxiety disorders,
you're gonna probably see a pretty tightly-wound kid. They tended to be anxious as children. They'd be anxious about
school performance, they'd be anxious about their friends. They might be anxious about what other people think about them. So you would see a person who
probably, temperamentally, ran anxious all their lives. Now, how much of that was
inborn, how much of that they may have learned from their families, they might have had an anxious parent. Obviously to fully tease
that apart is difficult, but anxiety tends to be
sort of a life-long pattern that can get really enhanced
in adult and blow up in adulthood and become
more of a disorder, and you can see teenagers,
maybe to some degree children, who have anxiety disorders as well. - And we're gonna get into
this more in later episodes, but at any point in life we
can develop anxiety disorder? - Yes, and that's where anxiety disorders are very, very interesting
and quite different than a lot of other mental illnesses. For example, if you look at a
disorder like bipolar disorder at the age of 40,
someone's not gonna wake up and then develop bipolar disorder. That's something that would
have been set probably by their late teens,
early to mid-twenties. With an anxiety disorder,
it is quite possible that a person could develop
a phobia later in life. A person could develop
generalized anxiety disorder later in life. A person could develop panic
disorder later in life. That can happen. It's still not normative. By in large, a lot of these
paths do get set early in life, however, life happens. And let's say a person all
of a sudden experiences tons of stresses, a
divorce, the loss of a job, the house burns down, whatever happens, family member gets sick,
and it just gets all to be too much, it's
not unusual for a person to have that happen. In fact, generalized anxiety disorder, the average age of onset is about 30, 31. That's a later onset than
most mental illnesses. And that's a problem
because it averages out, there's people out there
who are having their onset later in life, 40 or 50 years of age. - Wow, the average age for
generalized anxiety disorder onset, 30, 31. - 30, 31, which is late
for mental illness. - Wow.
- Yeah. Which makes sense, life is
starting to happen, right? You're no longer a college
kid going to a keg party, you're like, oh, there's
these things called bills and I've gotta get a job,
and the world expects something of me, I'm
supposed to get married. The expectations start
ratcheting up, and that's where sort of the rubber meets the
road on the anxiety disorders. - Really fascinating, and
that makes perfect sense. I'm really excited in future episodes to dive more into that. Now, you mentioned in episode one, that anxiety is the most
common mental health disorder, and it often is co-occurring with other mental health problems. What other co-occurring diagnoses
do you see anxiety with? - Most commonly, you'll
see anxiety disorders co-occur with a mood disorder. So anxiety and depression together is a very common combination. There are theorists out
there that actually think that division between
anxiety and depression is somewhat artificial. That it's similar processes in the brain, and that, in some ways, it's
just a manifestation difference where one person might become very sad, another person might become very worried. And in fact, rumination is
often a big part of depression. So, that's almost like
difficult to tease out, but we'll often see those
two hanging out together. - What is rumination? - Rumination is when you sort of get stuck in a obsessive rut of thinking. Typically about the same thing
over and over and over again, you can't let it go. It could be something
that happened at work and you can't stop thinking about it, it could be a falling out with a friend, and you can't stop weighing in your mind. An argument you had with a partner, and you just can't break out of it. For people, it's normal for a little while to say, god, I wish I didn't say that or I wish that didn't happen, or how could she have done that? But then over time, other
stuff comes and we sort of let it go and we move forward. For a person who's
ruminating, they can't let go. And they'll do that with everything. It'll be, did I look at
that person the wrong way? Did I park in the wrong place? Do you think they like me? Did I say the wrong thing? It tends to be more self, in anxiety, it tends to be more self-blaming stuff. Did I do the wrong thing? Did I make them uncomfortable? So, it doesn't, that's where it has a very specific flavor to it, that we'd almost label as neurotic. - For how long does
someone have to ruminate for it to be considered
neurotic or too much? - Same thing. Is it getting in the way of their lives? That's where we would, you know, and here's where it gets challenging, some people ruminate a lot,
and they start withdrawing. They start keeping to themselves. They don't talk to other people as much, they cut out from their lives. So we may not even notice it as much. But people around them
might say hey, this person doesn't come around, have they called you? They're not showing up
to family gatherings. If they live with people,
they'll notice a change. So, it might be just other
people noticing changes in their rhythms, but when that
rumination gets in the way, they can't talk or think
about anything else, and it's really causing
them problems at work, with friends, family, that's
when we start paying attention. - Do you think that people
are aware that the rumination is getting in the way of their life? - I do, I do think people are aware. In anxiety disorders,
insight is very preserved. People know this is too much. They can't stop it, but
they're the first ones to say I know this is disproportionate,
and I can't stop it. And that's where anxiety disorders
can be rather paralyzing. Because the person feels
like they can't let it go. They can't stop worrying. It's a very helpless feeling. - And that would give
me anxiety, I feel like. - Yes, exactly, it's a feedback loop. It just keeps going and going
and it just sort of spirals. And that's where it's so
painful, because I think I see people, and no matter
how many times you try to give them the
counter-argument, if you will, they will, they're still sort of stuck in their interpretation of events. And a lot of the work in anxiety disorders is helping teach them new interpretations. - Now, we've talked about general anxiety. How many different types
of anxiety are there? - There are different
types of anxiety disorders. The most common are actually the phobias. And the phobias are sort of
divided into three groups. The specific phobias, social
phobia, which we now call social anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia, which is sort of on it's own,
because it often hangs out with it's friend panic disorder. Panic disorder is another
form of anxiety disorder. Then there's generalized anxiety disorder. So these disorders are all
characterized by anxiety being the key element of the disorder. The phobias have a very
specific form of avoidance associated with them. So people with phobias avoid the thing that they are afraid of. People with panic disorder have a very strong
physiological experience, which can lead them then
to pull out of life, because they're having
these panic attacks. And then finally,
generalized anxiety disorder, is sort of a wide ranging,
wide reaching anxiety about a variety of issues. But it really has to be
around for a long time, for about six months or so. So let's say a person's
going through a rough time. Their mom is sick and in the hospital, and they're worrying about everything. Who's gonna pick up the kids, who's gonna go to the hospital? That only lasts for three or four weeks, we wouldn't diagnose that as
generalized anxiety disorder. We look at it being over a
wide range of activities, sort of disproportionate to
the level of the stimulus, and very persistent. - You mentioned agoraphobia? What is that? - Agoraphobia, people sometimes say, it's the fear of open spaces. So the person's like, I
refuse to go into a field. It's not. It's fear of being in places from which escape would be difficult, help would be difficult to get, and there's a possibility that they could embarrass themselves. - But that didn't get
it's own category, right? - Agoraphobia is it's own. - It's its own section?
- Yeah, but agoraphobia almost 90% of the time, co-occurs with panic disorder. And think about it, if
a person is starting to have recurring panic
attacks, and they don't know when those attacks are gonna happen, in other words, they're
spontaneous, then what happens is they get scared, I don't want
to go to the grocery store and have this happen, I
don't want this to happen in a movie theater, I
don't want this to happen in the middle of the
warehouse where I'm at work, or at school, so what would
that person start doing? They'd stop going to those things. And one day, before you know
it, they could look up and say, I haven't left the house for months. Or, if they do go out of the house, it'll only be if somebody's
willing to go with them and stay with them and reassure them. So it's very specific, it's that fear of being in situations where help may not be readily available,
or escape won't be easy. - Wow, that sounds so difficult. - It's so debilitating,
it's heartbreaking. It's really, really heartbreaking
because agoraphobia, that agoraphobia-panic
combination can often occur when a person has a significant
stress or loss in their life so for example, someone
in their life dies, or they go through a really stressful interpersonal experience,
like a painful divorce. That can be accompanied by panic attacks, and then before you know it, that person will find themselves having almost completely
cut out from life. So, they're missing out on the opportunity for connecting with
other people, for coping, and now days, I'm gonna
be honest with you Kyle, agoraphobia's getting easier. Because people can Amazon Prime it, they can order stuff online, they can get on social media, so they can almost get that
sense of ah, I'm in the world, but they're not leaving their house, where the fear of a panic
attack always looms. - And are they aware that they haven't left
the house in a month? - Oh yeah. They're definitely aware.
- And that feeds the anxiety? - Yes, yes. - It's like, oh gosh, I haven't
left the house in a month. - And that's what so
many mental illnesses, what's heartbreaking is there sometimes can be a sense of shame, you know. And that's the devastation,
as I'll always say on MedCircle, there's
nothing to be ashamed of. These are all sort of the things
that happen to human beings and people won't leave, and
they'll sort of withdraw even more, so that's also, that can also get really really tricky, because part of being a human being is, even the little things of life. Even going on a walk
around the neighborhood starts to become very difficult. - Well, I love, I forget which
video it was that we've done, but you said that all of these diagnoses, whether it was a panic
disorder, general anxiety, social phobia, it's just the tool to find the right treatment, it's not this label that we go
hey, this is who you are now, so sorry about it. It just goes, this is the steps, so we know the steps to take after. And that gives me some stress relief. - Well the difficulty is is
that sadly in our society, mental illnesses and these
labels still carry some stigma. So if you went to the
doctor's office and they say, ah, you have a bacterial infection, you'd be like, cool,
I'll get my antibiotic, go home, go to bed, take some. But if you go and see a
mental health practitioner, and you're told you have
an anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder,
you might feel like, you know, you'll cringe at it. It's not exactly what you'd consider dinner table conversation. And to me, whether a person
has a flu, arthritis, a stomach ulcer, or depression, they're just illnesses. - That's right. - And they're all manageable, and they don't define the person. - Well, when we were talking about, we knew we were gonna do
this series on anxiety, and we knew we would find,
or we knew you were an expert at social anxiety, and
we thought, you know, wouldn't it be great if Dr.
Ramani could find somebody who could work with this
person who has social anxiety and we could film it and blah blah, and I didn't immediately offer myself. Because I go, do I really
want to bring that out? Do I really want to tell,
maybe three million people, hey, I was diagnosed with social anxiety, and now watch a therapy
session of me dealing with it. And I thought, I have to,
because I can't be here talking about how we're
breaking down the stigma, how people shouldn't be ashamed of this, this is just a method,
and so finally I said, guys, here's the deal, and I
explained what was going on. Because I get it. I get why people are afraid, but I also understand
why they shouldn't be. - But look how, just by
coming clean, if you will, or sharing it with the world, look how many stereotypes you break. - Right. - You are willing to go on camera, and your words will
reach millions of people. That completely flies in the face of what we think social anxiety is about. So I think for people to
understand, this is not just a person who's a quivering
nerve in the corner, that this can have many manifestations, and that then people feel embarrassed, well no one's gonna believe
I'm socially anxious, I'm on TV, you know? So it helps people see that,
there's a wide range to this. I've worked with clients who are actually brilliant salespeople,
and socially anxious. - I get it! - You know, and to me, doing a sale, I would have a panic attack
if I had to sell something. But I could speak in front
of 10 thousand people. - Yeah, well I am very
excited about our session. If you wanna see that, make
sure you go to MedCircle.com and sign up and we will send it to you. Now, we talked a lot
about what anxiety is, the different types of
anxieties, what isn't anxiety? - Okay. - What is not. - What is not anxiety is,
what we call normal anxiety. Being worried when it's, being worried when it's April 14th and you haven't started your taxes. That's not an anxiety disorder, that's like start worrying, now. - Yes.
- You know. This is, it's the, you know,
two hours before a final exam and you haven't studied yet, worry. So, when you say, oh gosh,
I'm worried about my exams, I must have an anxiety disorder, no. If a person says, I'm really
afraid of snarling dogs, we're not gonna call that a phobia, okay. If a person says, I don't
want to go to a theme park, but I'm willing to go to a
movie theater, grocery store, that's not agoraphobia. So, they don't tend to be that selective. Anxiety disorders, by definition,
tend to be more sweeping. So, this idea that I'm
afraid of one thing, may not mean that you have a phobia. A person who says I don't like big parties may not mean you have
social anxiety disorder. So it really is a matter of degree, it's also a matter of
how much it generalizes. And that's when we think
about whether or not it's truly an anxiety disorder. Because what we don't want to do, is we don't want to
medicalize and diagnose and sort of label the normal responses to difficult situations,
because that's when people start second-guessing
themselves and saying, well maybe I'm broken because I'm anxious. I'm like, well you better be anxious, you're going through a lot, that's a very appropriate reaction. So that's what we always want
to be careful in all of this. - Yeah, I like that a lot, because if we did start
diagnosing every type of thing, then it also minimizes
the other diagnoses. - Yes, I think so, I think so. And I think people just
wonder how much is too much? And some people are actually living under tremendous amounts of stress. Whether it's because they're
having trouble keeping up with their income, or
they're having significant relationship problems, or
somebody who can't pay down their student debt, or
something like that. You know, those are big problems. And so, if a person's worrying about them, and then they think they
don't have the right to worry about them,
that's concerning to me, because I do think a person has a right to any emotion that they're feeling. - Yes, your right to anxiety. - Yes.
- I like that. Is there any research being
done on where anxiety disorder is most prevalent in the world? - Interestingly, in the United
States, anxiety disorders are the most common
form of mental illness. That's not the case all over the world. In much of the rest of the world, mood disorders like major
depression are the most common. - I wonder why. What's the differentiation? - You know, I wonder how much
about the American condition, I mean I think this is
a competitive society, that there may be some
things built into our culture that may foster anxiety. It could be that, also,
maybe a lower acceptability to endorse depression,
and I think many times a person enters a health care provider or a mental health care provider's office with sort of generalized medical, or psychological issues, I should say. A lot of times, they might
focus more on the anxiety, than on the sadness or something, too. But that is an interesting distinction, that it is for the United States, that the anxiety disorders
are the most common, but that's not the case
all over the world. - Is there any information on
which demographic of people may have more or less
anxiety than the other? - Here's an interesting one. One thing that has sometimes
jumped up in the literature is that sometimes people
with more economic resources suffer a little bit more from anxiety. And that may very well be,
because a big part of anxiety, is a sense of control. When your sense of control
is being nipped at, that's when you feel more anxious. And there is some belief, that
people who have chronically been living in poverty, or
have fewer economic resources, they've almost adjusted to being buffeted by the randomness of
life, and they don't feel as anxious about it, they're
like, oh it's just another, just another day in paradise, you know. And I sometimes wonder that I've, I work with students, I take students, for example, to India every year. And, we sometimes see these families living under stressors
that seem insurmountable, but what I'm not seeing a lot
of there often, is anxiety. I'm seeing other manifestations, but not the kind of anxiety
I certainly would feel, if I had the level of uncertainty that they had in their lives. So, the sense that I've had a
life where I've had some sense of control over things in my life, that means that if any of
that control's taken away, my likely response is anxiety,
because at some level, I must think that I can fix it. - Wow. Wow, I know this is so juvenile, but more money, more problems. - Amen boyfriend, amen. That's exactly what it is, That's exactly what it is. - Well, what everybody wants to know, and what we've touched on
here, but we're gonna dive into more detail on, is what causes anxiety. So that will be coming
up in episode three. Of course, you can get the full series by going to MedCircle.com, and also see our mock therapy session, very excited for that. Thank you so much for watching. You can access more

announcements have also been made for a closer look at all these changes we're joined now by infectious disease specialist dr lyon hongnam welcome to the show doctor so let's just zoom straight straight into the changi airport cluster which had started after an 88 year old cleaner tested positive earlier in a month firstly how would you assess the spread the speed of the spread and have you observed anything that alarms you actually quite a bit if you think about it what was happening now and you look back to one to two months ago one two months ago singapore was coasting through no issues at all looks like we have got everything under control and of course our dreaded and our wolves desired singapore hong kong bubble was being planned now fast forward one two months later at exactly the same scenario with people who are drilled into wearing masks and cleaning up the place immediately we have a cluster right at our own airport where the thoroughfare of the b1617 which is the mutant industry is going through which is ravaging through singapore at this point in time nothing's changed on our part but something's changed on a virus part which means the virus is a lot more transmissible a lot more adaptable than the previous mutants which have been fighting with so we are dealing with a completely new virus with the goal post exchange and surprisingly and very upsettingly a lot of our vaccinated people fell sick is that a dampener a little but but everyone everyone had very mild symptoms and everyone had uh didn't require oxygen in fact majority of them had no symptoms at all so not the perfect result and it's going through our defenses which have been tied through for the last uh last few months and is breaking through what does it tell us then that you know these 18 people that caught the virus were vaccinated what does it tell us about the virus and how concerned should we be that it's still able that you're still able to get the virus even though you've been vaccinated it tells us that the virus has changed the goal pose we were targeting it always at this direction and the goal post change and then our efficacy falls which means that we are not able to prevent an infection totally but we end up changing a disease from severe to mild and in turn from mild to nothing so we should still go ahead with the vaccination at least we stave off the hospitalization stave off the deaths and it it renders a daily virus into that of a mild common cold or nothing at all which is exactly what we want to do make it toothless biteless dr young as you know the titan measures are in place for the next month or so and there's going to be a review that's sandwiched in the middle of that period if you look into your crystal ball how do you expect this situation to develop okay my crystal ball gazing tells me we will expect about five to ten new cases every day right after the midpoint and the midpoint onwards we should get everything under control and we're talking about two cases or so for the second half of it all this is possible if we all work together and we control our need to go out to eat and go out to socialize and say just stay pretty much at home and work from home we go back to almost a near circuit breaker situation and we will break the spying of the virus and dr young with more people getting vaccinated and the vaccinations being rolled out across singapore do you expect at what point do you think we can you know call or say the fact that we've reached heard immunity given that those that have had the vaccinations are also severely impacted by the virus now this is going to be a really difficult question if you look at the changi airport group 80 to 90 of the people who worked there were vaccinated and yet many of them still felt sick so if we actually go with 80 to 90 for the general herd immunity i don't think we're going to get it in fact i think i'm going to aim for 90 percent herd immunity if even possible we must be prepared that the covet 19 is going to live around with us that's what mr gunn has said it's going to be a daily affair that we could actually get cough calls runny noses from the covet 19 but as long as it doesn't kill us it doesn't hospitalize us it doesn't strain our hospital care we will move on life as it is um your take on face shields not being accepted going forward is there any work around for those who might have some kind of health reasons you know for just not being able to wear face masks that's dreaded isn't it i mean the facial so convenient but the size of it is that when you breathe out it comes up comes out to the side down everywhere except where it's not supposed to go so if you look at it the other way a surgical mask works beautifully it filters out the air it looks as if a shield doesn't work facial must be replaced with a surgical mask and i'm going to ask the viewers here get a surgical mask that's certified a surgical mask that is really good for healthcare system works don't get something that's cloth mask that's disposable short of what thomasic holdings or thomas holdings have been providing because those at least have been tested if you're making your own or buying off the shelf look it doesn't work very well you could fall victim to covet 19. get the proper marks protect yourself protect the nation best certified surgical mask i just want to get your thoughts on testing pcr tests authorities will also are being used but authorities also want to use antigen rapid testing for those with respiratory symptoms how will this help and are there other ways to pick up infections faster i love the antigen testing simply because it is much much cheaper we are talking about a tenth of the price of the pcr testing two the antigen testing actually has its values if you look at the first five day of illness it parallels very well if you pick up the first five days of illness you could at high viral lows and in turn your pickup for antigen is fabulous in the same 96 the criticism of it is from day 6 to day 10 the pickup falls so if you think about it if we do it regularly sufficiently and when the person has the first few symptoms and presents to the clinic there's a high chance we can pick it up now a point in note which singapore has tried is actually a situation in barcelona where they had people going into a concert had a rapid antigen swap test first before they went in for the concert they had a concert they had masked that absolutely no social distancing that had a wild time and what came out was very few people fell sick not so much because of the concept but they felt sick because of other circumstances so antigen does have a role to play in singapore be it in the clinic or in a bigger event so i'm looking more forward to more of that cheap and good tests very valuable insights you've shared with us thanks so much for your time infectious diseases specialists there dr lianghorna

76,8dYqL2lzPys,CNA,Majority of Singapore schools to shift to home-based learning amid rise in COVID-19 cases | In full,2021-05-16T13:23:36Z,"Singapore’s primary and secondary schools, junior colleges and Millenia Institute will shift to home-based learning from May 19 till the start of the June holidays, the multi-ministry task force announced on Sunday (May 16). Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open. This follows a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 community cases in Singapore. READ: https://cna.asia/3fkXktF

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",welcome to the multi-ministrial task force press conference on our panel today we have minister for health mr on king kong and minister for education mr chan chun singh may i now invite minister ong to begin with a few words minister please people always confuse me with king young don't worry don't worry thank you everyone for attending the press conference on a sunday night see a couple of new faces today uh i we wanted to meet everyone because we are reporting higher cases today um 38 locally transmitted out of which 18 are now currently unlinked but of course our contact tracers is working very hard to try to link them so one reason for today's higher cases partly is i think there are more transmission but the other reason is that we are now using a new method coupling art meaning uh antigen rapid tests together with pcr so how it works is that we have distributed art kids to 236 of our clinics out of 900 of the phpc's clinic so for anyone that come forward to the clinics reporting ari that means acute respiratory infection syndromes the doctor will administer art first yeah and for those of you who have gone through art before it's a simple swap 20 minutes you can get an indication so if they are positive we can quickly isolate them and then administer a pcr test which we are also doing it faster so as a result today we have several cases detected seven seven you know all unlinked detected because of this new method and in the coming days we are going to distribute these art kits to all the clinics all our phpc clinics so i think that way we will be much more we will be much faster in detecting cases there are in the community the other thing we wanted to talk about today which is why min chan is here today out of our 13 or sorry 18 unlinked cases we have four students but these four students has have already been reported by moe yesterday so it's it's not totally new cases moe reported them yesterday they are all linked to the learning point cluster and quarantine before they are detected but we understand that as students are infected outside of schools parents are worried so i'm sure both minchan and i minchand as well as i we are both getting numerous requests queries that since we are approaching mid-year holidays whether we should just advance the holiday or move to home-based learning so that's why i think we discussed this and minister chan will now take over to explain what moe will do thank you ikang so following from what ekang has just mentioned i think there are a few things that have developed in recent weeks that cause us to be much more concerned than before now first of course we know that there are many new strains of the covid19 virus there are various new mutations and some of these mutations are much more virulent and they seem to attack the younger children so this is an area of concern for all of us so the way we manage the situation must constantly keep abreast of such developments and preempt some of these developments where possible so as ikang mentioned the sharp rise in the number of community cases today requires us to significantly reduce our movements and interactions in the coming days now we are watching this very closely because we do not think that is a random thing that happened in just one day or so so we want to make sure that while we are handling this situation we have to significantly reduce our movement and interactions in the coming days and to this end moe will move towards home-based learning for primary school secondary school jc's and millennial institute students including students from the special ed schools starting from wednesday 19th of may 2021 until the end of the school term on friday 28th of may 2021 and thereafter the school children will be on the school june holidays now we understand of course this shift may cause anxiety in some parents but we want to assure all parents and students that moe will continue to extend our help and our fullest support to the schools the teachers and the parents who require additional help to make these adjustments and we will also want to put in place measures to continue to minimize the disruptions to the learning of our students now preschools including the moe kindergartens and the student care centers both in the schools and in the community will remain open to support families who need their services during this period as telecommuting is the default mode of working for most now we will encourage parents to keep their children at home during this period where possible but of course we understand there are many parents who are essential workers who will need to continue to work at their places of work and therefore they will require services in the schools and in the child care centers to help them during this period and we will make all effort to help our parents and families who require such services now we make this move with the full knowledge that our schools can draw on their experiences in executing the home-based learning full home-based learning last year and we are prepared to transit to online teaching and learning our teachers are also ready to help our students access a full range of online and hard copy home-based learning materials and assist students who may require digital devices or internet access and maintain regular contact with our students and their parents now similarly we will also look to convert more classes in the institute of higher learnings online to reduce in-person attendance now this remember our thinking is to make sure that in the coming days we significantly reduce the number of movement and interactions in order to minimize the chances of transmission of these new strains of the covid19 virus for institutes of higher learning labs and practical lessons will continue to be conducted in person with the necessary safe management measures in place tuition and enrichment classes should move their activities online till the end of phase two as well to prevent any intermingling and to cut down any possible transmissions now having said that i'd like to take a step back and look at how we manage the situation going forward now going forward we must work on the assumption that now and then there will be cases that will emerge in our community and perhaps in our school thus far we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission we must never be complacent so going forward we will need a range of options in order to thrive in a coveted world for us to continue learning and living in a covic world so we must remain a jar and adapt accordingly but we must have within our asana a suite of options especially to allow our students to continue learning in schools now we all know that home-based learning over a prolonged period will have certain limitations and to the extent possible we will want to continue fiscal schooling for our children where possible so going forward if the community situation does not warrant it and if we only have sporadic cases in the schools we will be able to use more targeted measures to ring fence schools that are affected while allowing the other schools to continue to operate now going forward we will also have a suite of other measures in place to allow our schools to have the best chance to provide physical schooling for our children this includes vaccination of more younger cohorts when the approvals are given for the use of the vaccine it will also include new and more rapid testing methods so that we can quickly ring fence the affected schools without having to close down all the schools for physical schooling or to convert all of them to home-based learning and i want to emphasize that we are taking this measure now as a proactive step in order to make sure that our children are safe our parents and our educators have peace of mind and the significant increase in the community numbers today is the basis for us to want to move to take this move now and it's not just based on a few cases that we have detected in the school brought in from either their homes or the outside of school enrichment classes so having said that moe will continue to monitor the situation carefully and we will review our plans as necessary but our fundamental aim is to make sure that we keep our students safe keep our educators safe and to allow our parents to have the peace of mind and the confidence when they send their children to the school for fiscal schooling and we will have various combinations of different methods to make sure that our children will be continue to be able to learn in a safe environment thank you chun singh maybe before we move to q and a maybe just let me say something about vaccinations um as you know vaccination does three things for us number one uh it provides a shield against infection of the copay 19 virus number two even if the virus broke through the the vaccination and you are infected we hope it brings down the severity of the disease and thirdly being vaccinated you reduce the likelihood of the person vaccinated to transmit to another person and slow everything down and all three appears to be what is happening now in in countries like israel that has vaccinated a big proportion of their population so when we went into the national vaccination exercise the first phase was folk has been focused on those who need it most meaning vulnerable population that amongst us and second those in the front line such as hospitals seaport airport and teachers as well teaching in the front line and so for this group we want to give them the maximum protection meaning two doses yeah and today the progress has been good so one quarter of our population today are fully vaccinated two doses um one third has at least one dose yeah so i think we are now approaching phase two of the vaccination exercise and moh has been studying what phase two should look like and one possibility to think about this is that maybe for phase two we should try our best to give as many people as possible a good level of protection against covet 19 that means give as many people as possible one dose of kovit 19 vaccination without reducing the effectiveness and there has been many international studies and it shows that even with one dose it confers good protection without compromising efficacy one dose without compromising efficacy so our scientists have been studying this we have an expert committee as you know and the evidence locally and overseas point towards this that an immunologist around the world also express his opinion that it is reasonable for those two actually to be further apart from those one so instead of 21 or 28 days or three days or three weeks or four weeks which is the case currently it can possibly extend to six to eight weeks without materially impacting the efficacy of the vaccine so this will also be helpful given our current situation where we have more cases and this is something we are studying and when we are once we are ready not too long in the future we'll announce the details how we are going about doing this but rest assured if we do this and when we do this all those who already have your second dose appointment will not be affected this is a strategy for phase two of our vaccination exercise moving forward yeah so i thought let everybody know this first while we continue our study finalize the details and once we are ready we will put it out very soon thank you we can go to q a thank you ministers we will now begin with the q a segment media agencies please remember to use the resend function on zoom if you'd like to ask a question do also remember to unmute before asking questions kindly note that we will only take one question per media so as to allow more to participate may we have the first question from st ray please hi good evening ministers thank you for the briefing just quick question can we ask why is home-based learning only starting from wednesday and can you elaborate on what you said earlier about how the more viral constraints are affecting younger children thank you to your first question why home-based learning is only starting on wednesday there are a couple of reasons for this now remember yesterday for those schools we've confirmed cases we have already swung into action and they will start their home-based learning from monday for the rest of the schools they will typically take about one to two days to get their materials ready for them to brief the students and also the parents at the same time we are also connection from the feedback of the many parents who have contacted us that they will also need to make some adjustments to their plans for example putting in place alternative child care arrangements for their children so we are doing this uh as soon as possible which is why we're starting on wednesday so this is the reasons why we are starting for all the schools less the few schools that we have already highlighted yesterday for with home-based learning from wednesday onwards now your second question as to the areas concerns i think those uh of you who have been keeping abreast of the scientific literature you will know that these new strains of these new strains of the kovite 19 virus seems to have a slightly different characteristics from the previous strains and until today i think many of the scientific communities are also trying to ascertain the different characteristics of these various new strains but one of the things that we have seen seems to be at least from our numbers there are more children who seems to have contracted this virus so of course that is an area of great concern to the ministry of education the educators and certainly our parents which is why we are taking the necessary precautions in order to give ourselves the assurance that we are putting in place the best possible plans for our children so that they have they are safe and our parents are confident of the measures being put in place to ensure the safety of their children dms is not with us today so the highly scientific question i think we are a bit handicapped but i did speak with him before coming to this practice conference he did mention that it would appear the b1617 strain appears to affect children more so you'll notice that for schools the response has been different compared to say last year so once we detect a infection but outside of school moe has been very fast actually to put the school on home-based learning for next few days and test the entire school so there is also a precaution that has been put in recently in view of different behavior of this strain of virus thank you ministers can we have the next question from cha pao tupang please hi good evening ministers this is childhood from sao paulo earlier you mentioned that currently there's no evidence of school-based transmissions however could the transmission have taken place on the school bus since some of these schools with infected students they actually share the same school bus vendor and also um why not consider bringing forward the school holidays like we did last year and this scientific question right what is emerging strains right is the transmissibility and infectivity particularly high this time round which could have possibly caused this exponential increase in cases because it seems like last year one case can spread to two to three people whereas for this year one case can spread to up to four to six people thank you let me just uh briefly touch on the latter part of the question i think the behavior of the virus have not changed last year two one case need just one super spreading incident or setting and you can spread to many cases this this strain i think is no different but it is true that there has been literature showing that it is more virulent but fundamentally you are looking at a very contagious virus on the questions about the transmission within school now we are never complacent and we do not take the position that until we have evidence to do this before we start uh acting on the evidence because if we do that then we are looking at what we call the real-world mirror rather than looking forward now having said that what is of course of concern to us is not just what is happening within the classroom in the school setting what is of course of concern to us will be the outside school activities and interactions including what you have mentioned about the school bus so we are looking into that and that is also why we are asking all the outside school activities tuition centers enrichment classes to the extent possible they should move to the online learning during this period because we have tried our very best to make sure that we keep the cohorts within each of the school tight and that is how we have been relatively successful in preventing transmissions within the schools but as you have rightly pointed out there are always the risk of transmission in outside school activities meaning outside classroom activities so we have to be very careful with this and never be complacent and as the nature of the virus continues to evolve we must never make the wrong assumption that the characteristics remain unchanged for the different strains of the virus now to your second question uh have we considered about bringing forward the school holidays yes we have considered that and we have taken into taken into account the feedback from various uh sources from the professional educators from the parents from the schools leaders and so forth and let me explain why we have not gone on to moving the school holidays forward which is about two weeks time now one of the reasons that we started this conversation was that remember we wanted to bring down the level of activity outside the home to as much as possible because of the sharp increase in the number of community cases and the feedback given to us from the parents from the professional educators is that to the extent possible they would also like their children to have some ways that they can continue to engage them meaningfully in the homes for the next two weeks so the home-based learning allow us to achieve part of that objective the second reason that some of the professional educators and the schools have given us is that they are towards the tail end of the term already they will just need a couple of days to wrap up this rather than to carry forward to the term three now because bearing in mind we are never sure what exactly will unfold in term three and from last year's experience we can see that if we load everything onto term three then it can also be a very stressful period for the people for the students the parents and the schools in term three so on balance taking into account both the professional feedback and the feedback from the parents we thought that it is meaningful for us to move to home-based learning for the remaining eight schooling days in fact it's seven because of the public holidays uh until the end of the term that and the schools are well all in sweden into gear for this kind of operations because last year we have already put in place the necessary processes and measures for us to be able to switch to a home-based learning quickly so these are some of the reasons why we have taken the decision to have home-based learning for the remaining seven learning days rather than to move the holi move the entire holiday forward which will then have another set of implications for the planning for many of the families thank you ministers members of media please only ask one question to allow more to participate can we get the next question from bbc karishma please thank you hi uh thank you ministers for holding this press conference you've indicated that students are being infected by the b161 strain of the virus what's the status of the current kids who are infected how much worse is the strain on the virus in terms of effects that you can see on the children and in terms of timeline for vaccinations why haven't you been faster and did the vaccines we have show that they slow down the transmission even for the b1617 virus let me take it there's a series of questions sorry yes i apologize um i think all these are valid but i think there are also medical questions that we want to find out ourselves as of now i believe all the children are well yeah just like last year some children some students were infected and they tend to be well so far as far as i know they are all well um as to the other fairly valid technical questions you ask these are questions we also want to find out but we need some time so if i may add to what ikang has shared to our knowledge all the students who are either under quarantine or who have been confirmed to have contracted the virus a few of them have mild symptoms but no one is very seriously ill at this point in time and we are thankful for that as to as ikan say as to how this virus may affect the children differently from the other strains i think that is best answered by the medical fraternity and we are certainly keeping a close watch on this if i may just cover one other point which i just underemphasized which just now during one of my answer the schools will remain open to continue to provide support to those children and families with higher needs so that i think i've mentioned that i just want to emphasize that because we are fully concerned that some families and some children will need additional help during this period and we can be rest assured that the schools the preschools the student care centers will be available to help the children and the families with these higher needs thank you ministers can we have the next question from reuters aradhana please hi um thank you for taking my question um my question is again back on krishna's question on our vaccination program just wondering are we why are we not able to accelerate our vaccination program is it because that there are type supplies and now is that the reason why we're trying to uh increase the interval between vaccine doses to stretch the supplies so would it be possible to say how many vaccine doses we have in our inventory right now and how many are still on order okay the vaccine in our inventory goes up and down based on arrivals yeah and we have a steady stream of arrival of supplies both visa as well as moderna enough to cover our population but they come at a certain pace yeah so we are our vaccination exercise is still pretty much uh aligned uh in tandem with the arrival of supplies okay if we have a lot of supplies of course we'll do it faster but we need to administer doses based on the arrival of the supplies but within that constraint i was mentioning earlier now that we have covered majority of uh vulnerable good groups as well as those on the front line for the next phase of our national vaccination exercise we are studying possibility of giving as many people as possible one dose so there's a change of concept but without affecting those who already have their appointment yeah but to answer your question it is limited the pace is limited by the pace of the supply arriving in singapore so if i may just add two points to that one part of the vaccination program that is new is when the approval for the vaccinate for the vaccines to be used to be authorized to be used for the younger age group and we are talking about pfizer which is now seeking approval for it to be used for the cohorts from 12 years old and above now that is a new group of people and for this group of people moe is working closely with moh to put in place our plans to vaccinate this group of people when the vaccines are available and we and in the overall review of the vaccination plan for the remaining of our population we will take into account the prioritization for this group of people with the rest of the other age groups that may not have been vaccinated yet but i also want to assure fellow singaporeans actually as exactly as what ikang say our main constraining factor will be the supply of the vaccines and if the supply of the vaccines are not disrupted we'll be able to progressively do this at a steady pace and if we look at our capacity for vaccination we have built up our capacity for vaccination ahead of the vaccine's arrival today we have about 40 vaccination centers all across the island every one of the vaccination centers can easily accommodate at least 2 000 persons a day so you see our vaccination capacity is really much higher than our vaccines availability and we have done this consciously because we know that the vaccine flow will be uneven across the time period but at any one point in time our vaccine capacity is all our wax our vaccination capacity is always higher than the availability of the vaccines then together with our cue management system this gives us the confidence that once the vaccines arrive in singapore we can get it into the arm of our people in the shortest time possible because the people are ready to take the vaccine because they have signed up for it we have built up the vaccination capacities in the 40 vaccination centers the hospitals the poly clinics and so forth so this is how we are doing as fast as we can but on top of this is exactly like what econ has mentioned we are also looking at the strategy of vaccinating the remaining people based on the latest scientific evidence that we have in order to make sure that as many people get a certain level of protection as soon as possible thank you ministers can we have the next question from today jun sen please hi minister sir i have a question for minister chang i wanted to ask about the vaccination for those under 16 year olds what when do you expect the approval to be granted and because there seems to be a significant anxiety or apprehension among parents to have their young kids vaccinated how would the government address this particular problem without making it compulsory uh judson we will have more information available when we have worked out the plans and the metrics together with uh moh yeah i think maybe a bit of background when the vaccines were developed they have to conduct quite very rigorous clinical trials so it is not that the vaccine is unsafe for young children but in the clinical trials they did not test on enough children of that age group and therefore it is not approved internationally to be used on children but lately pfizer has been doing additional clinical trials on children between 12 to 15 and the data has been submitted and i think now there has been approvals around the world in presidents around the world that they can be administered to children of that age group which is why we are also proceeding with children of this age group working with moe thank you ministers can we have the next question from cna digital we mean please thanks for taking my question my question is more for mint on i think um bearing in mind the number of community cases which we haven't seen since the last circuit breaker can i ask what's your response to calls to go back into full circuit breaker mode thank you yeah thank you i thought this would be us but it's a very difficult question to ask at this time because you know this is a particularly difficult time to answer that question because you can see the cases rising and whether the trajectory goes exponentially up or flattened which did happen chinese new year this year we saw cases going up and then it flattened and then it disappeared and how which direction it goes we will only know in the coming days so so all i can say is as of now we need to monitor the situation and then come to a decision later and i don't give that answer because i want to stall the question we genuinely need to have some questions answered number one for example today is the first day we impose more stringent measures social distancing measures and today is the first day in fact and this time round we decided to remove the most high risk settings meaning enclosed space crowded no mask it hits the restaurants the most and so by removing the most risky settings i think we make will make an impact and furthermore there is also an indirect impact because once these places are closed the general activity do go down we find ourselves going out much less frequently we will find ourselves going out much less frequently and home-based learning is coming on stream early middle of next week i think that will reduce activity even more so what is the impact of that we know there will be an impact i think we will only know in the coming days second is i mentioned earlier where you're pairing art with pcr now and able to detect cases much faster and so in the coming days we are also monitoring how will the cases surface are we able to flush out surface cases much more quickly in the coming days and we also want to find out that answer thirdly is something we are currently studying which is what is the severity of the disease amongst those who are vaccinated or amongst those who got infected by someone who is vaccinated and this is something that moh is studying we're still looking through the data as of now we can say that for these 76 individuals who were vaccinated at least with one dose due to the current this round of outbreak none require icu but we need to dive deeper into the data and as more days go by so really seek answers to these questions and when the time is right we will make the right decisions and if it has to come to more stringent measures as lawrence have said in the last mtf we will do so and if it's a cb we will say it is a cb yeah thank you ministers can we have the next question from mothership julia please hi minister china i have a question for you i understand that hbo will only start from wednesday um considering that the virus is already in the community among students uh will parents and students who are worried about their safety be unlocked attending classes in the next two days the short answer to that is that the schools after today's announcement in fact the schools will be contacting the parents and the respective schools will work out the plans accordingly thank you ministers can we have the next question from scmp sinhui please hi hi good evening ministers i know you've been asked this number of times but you know given the current situation and the number of unlinked cases that we have today that brings our seven day moving average to four point seven one and i know minom you're no longer minister of transport but where are we right now with the travel bubble with hong kong my answers have not changed from the last time yeah i was here at the conference i discussed with secretary edward yao last friday and we recognize that singapore given our rising number of cases it is not likely that we will meet the criteria for the launch we were not likely to meet the criteria for the launch of the singapore hong kong air travel bubble but i think the the exact numbers we will know early part of next week minister shahran is fully aware of that i think he's in touch with secretary albert yao as well and we will make a decision and an announcement i believe early in the coming week just to follow up on the question that was asked by mothership earlier i think bear in mind so far we do have a few students being infected but so far there's no evidence showing that there is school-based transmission so i i know principles teachers parents students are all cooperating working really hard to make sure schools protocols are really stringent effective and managed to keep schools safe throughout these 16 months so bear in mind schools is a safe place there has been transmission by transmission outside of school and so for parents who want to opt out i i in the past last year the the school's position is always do come to school it is a safe place yeah thank you ministers can we get the next question from the h here please hi good evening ministers uh i just wanted to ask because mean all mentioned that now we are going to use art in conjunction with pcr tests and we know art do produce some false positives does that mean that every day when we see the moh press release will there be uh cases adjusted down let's say in the future if say for example oh it turns out to be a negative art test or negative pcr test in the future oh yes it has slightly lower it has lower specificity especially for high ct scores but we are using both together art plus pcr so the numbers you see in our daily reports is after the individual has gone through a pcr test and is positive then we'll include in our daily reports we will not just to be clear we will not report numbers based on just a rt score or ert results thank you minister can we get the next question from one pao you too please hi good evening ministers just like to find out what's the progress of uh issuing of the personal learning devices to the students because we are heading into another round of home based learning so the original thailand was that all secondary school students equipped by end of this year so in this respect are we on track or we have to accelerate the pace and so how well did quick but in essence uh our schools and our students or this upcoming http given that it's relatively announced at short notices let me take that question our school system actually since last year's experience until uh early part of this year's i think they have gone through the the processes and they have all the machinery so we are pretty confident that they have in place the processes and the devices for the children but of course we know that you know once you give the devices to the children once in a while we have to check on the children to make sure that the together with the students check with the parents that the devices are working properly and so forth now i want to emphasize this we are not going into hbl suddenly because since our experience last year to now regularly the schools have been if you like exercising their own system so the hbl has been complementing some of the physical schooling even prior to this so that is how we keep our system warm because we know that just like now there might be situation that warrants us to quickly switch into home-based learning so whether is it the curriculum and the devices they all have to be ready so this is how our schools have been building up the system and the processes over the last one years and exercising that regularly so and but i accept that there will always be last minute changes or updates that we require and we'll work through this with the respective students who may need a bit more help but we are fully committed to making sure that during home-based learning our students have access to the necessary devices and we have in place the appropriate curriculum to conduct this home-based learning for our students but it is not um we do not switch it on and off uh like that in fact actually it has been kept warm at the background in fact this was one of the things that i checked with the team uh even prior to me going into moe when we review some of the contingency plans for heightened measures for the management of the covid and one of the questions that i've asked them was have they been keeping this system warm over the last many months and the answer is that yes many of the schools have kept the system warm over the last many months and every time we activate that we refresh the curriculum we refresh the devices to make sure that they are all in working order thank you ministers can we get the next question from channel 8 sushuwan please hello evening ministers are wondering if i can get trying to sell back for two important questions first to mr chan would like to ask why the home base the full home-based learning only starts on wednesday and not immediately and also to mr ong on the change in our vaccination strategy starting from phase two where we have a longer period between the two doses thank you what thank you ministers can we get the second last question from bt later please sorry sorry i think she wanted a sound bite from me as well it's like how um [Music] foreign um um thank you ministers members of media gentle reminder to only ask one question each can we get the second last question from bt layla please hello thank you ministers my question is about the sharia dialogue and the world economic forum which are scheduled for june and august this year what's the latest update on that what has been the government's latest communication to the organizers so far and um regarding thank you okay thank you mr laurencewong answered that same question last week which is the organizers will monitor the situation and closely and come to their own recommendations and decisions uh the there has not been further development since and the answers have substantively not changed thank you ministers can we get the last question from cnetv gwenet please hello yup hi um my question i hope you bury me is basically broadly just about testing guidelines was there actually a possible lapse of detection because that tuition teacher at learning point was not given a swap when she approached a doctor even though she was given viral infection and now that we actually have vaccinations and we know that there's more asymmetric muted symptoms does that actually change our guidelines in terms of how we ring fest and identify these cases and do maybe more surveillance testing so are you going to be you know are we going to be changing these guidelines soon and when um i i'm not i don't know enough to comment on the specific case but you are the the nub of your question is a valid very valid one and relevant one which is testing need to be fast and sometimes we one very highly accurate testing for clinical diagnosis that is necessary but now we also need to supplement them with a surveillance that may be less accurate but allow us to detect and isolate infected cases much faster and rapid art is one possibility those who have seen some of my updates when i was in mot which is breathalyzer is another form of very rapid surveillance effect within a couple of minutes but it's not as accurate as pcr and of course there's also wastewater testing is another possibility so we need to employ all these methods the more virulent the virus is the more we need strong surveillance coupled with accurate pcr tests so okay so can i just make a final point that what i say in uh mandarin perhaps i just reiterate in chinese to emphasize this point now going forward we must be prepared to live in a world where this covet 19 virus could be endemic in society we must find new ways to cope with this we must find new ways to allow our students to continue learning in a safe environment and converting all schools to home-based option may not be a sustainable solutions and we need different tools in our toolkits to manage the situation going forward and that is why this time around we are converting all to home based learning because the community cases have gone up significantly and we want as an overall national posture to really lower down the tempo of activities in our whole society now going forward if the community cases are stable or low and if we have stochastic cases in the school it does not mean that we must therefore then convert everyone into home-based learning because of a few stochastics a few stochastic cases when the community cases are either stable or low then we will have other ways that we can try to ring fence the affected schools by converting the affected school to home-based learning while allowing the rest of the schools to continue with physical schooling because over the long term we think there are limitations to full home-based learning the interactions between the students and the teachers the physical interactions between the students and the teachers are an essential part of the transmission of values role modelling and so forth for our students so this is why going forward we must make sure that we expand the suite of tools that we have in managing such cases and we are happy that with greater vaccination with more rapid testing will be able to try to limit the impact to as small as possible by using targeted measures on those schools or students that are affected otherwise it will not be a sustainable solution for us to convert everyone to full home-based learning for prolonged period of time thank you very much thank you ministers members of media for your time today we have come to the end of the virtual press conference the time now is 7 59 p.m embargo is lifted press materials will be disseminated shortly thank you and have a nice evening ahead ,True,True,False,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",decisions today that you've announced they are pretty much effectively a lockdown so why don't you just go all the way shut schools call it a lockdown the way other countries around the world are doing in order to reduce the number of local transmissions people use the word lockdown very loosely these days and it means many things to different people we like to think of our strategies in different categories and based on risk at the very baseline level there are things that we ought to do permanently and even after kovat 19 is over and it will be over at some stage we have to raise we have to maintain these standards for example things like washing our hands regularly not using your hands to touch your face these are all things that hire better public hygiene standards these are all things that we think are important baseline permanent changes that's why we call we launched an SG clean campaign and even after kovat 19 these practices will be useful for countering any other infectious diseases as well beyond the baseline we are talking about a range of a series of measures that can be put in place throughout or precautionary measures that can be triggered as we say additional breaks as and when the need arises so we announced a series of measures last Friday around large scale gatherings for F&B outlets to have separated seating that's the next level of risk and that's all that's the next level of precautionary measures which we have introduced now we are putting in place a third category high category high of additional precautions including limiting limiting gatherings to less than 10 and even closing some of these venues where we think social gatherings are likely to be concentrated we've said that these measures will be put in place for a month and if these if these measures are effective for a month and it helps to break potential transmission chains we may then come back to tear to where we were last Friday if these measures are not effective we may continue them for another month we could escalate further escalating further will then go into the next level of measures which would include suspension of schools and workplaces and they have to go together because there is no point talking about it you can you can close the school but people need to look after children and if parents are working then very hard for them to look after the children and the children will be running around anyway in the community so closure of schools closure of work places other than essential activities that the most drastic step if you will that's what I suppose people call a lockdown and that set of drastic measures may well be necessary but again we do not have to move get there in one step and we can take a series of breaks and then if the situation warrants it then we may very well at a later stage we may very well have to do that that's why we are in urging all Singaporeans to take these measures seriously if we do these steps well then we may be able to get through this current very critical time of the infection cycle where we are seeing a rise in imported cases a very large wave of imported cases and very real risk of local Tron mission happening it has not happened yet in a widespread manner and so all of these measures are really pre-emptive and that perhaps is a bit of the challenge we have in getting people to take it seriously in many countries the various drastic measures have occurred after widespread outbreak thousands of cases or tens of thousands of cases we are we are not there and so perhaps there is a certain sense of things are okay in Singapore but the risk are very real and that's what we are trying to highlight and that's why everyone needs to take these measures seriously and it's only with everyone if all of us do our part that's the only way where we can have a chance of success with these strategies ,True,True,False,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia","my fellow Singaporeans good afternoon I last spoke to you on covert 19 three weeks ago since then the number of new cases daily has begun to rise who used to see fewer than 10 new cases a day but in the last 2 weeks despite our best efforts we have routinely had more than 50 new cases daily initially many of the new cases were imported from overseas mostly returning Singaporeans then last week we began to have more local cases furthermore despite our good contact tracing for nearly half of these cases we don't know where or from whom the person caught the virus and this suggests that there are more people out there who are infected but who have not been identified and they may be passing the virus unknowingly to others in the last few days we have also discovered several clusters at foreign worker dormitories and one at a nursing home these are very worrying because large numbers of people live together in dormitories and nursing homes a single case can quickly lead to a large cluster furthermore nursing home patients are mostly old and frail and very vulnerable to the virus as the situation developed over the past weeks we have tightened our safe distancing measures progressively Singaporeans have responded well calmly and responsibly and made adjustments in their daily lives by working together we have kept the outbreak under control but looking at the trend I am worried that unless we take further steps things will gradually get worse or another big cluster may push things over the edge I discussed this with a multi ministry task force we have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks we should make a decisive move now to preempt escalating infections we will therefore impose significantly stricter measures this is like a circuit breaker it will help to reduce the risk of a big outbreak occurring and it should also help to gradually bring our numbers down and this in turn will allow us to relax some of the measures this circuit breaker will apply for one month in the first instance the task force is holding a press conference immediately after ice finished speaking to you to explain the details but let me give you the key points first we will close most workplaces except for essential services and key economic sectors food establishments markets and supermarkets clinics hospitals utilities transport and key banking services will remain open these are essential services we also should not disrupt economic sectors that are strategic or form part of a global supply chain people working in these industries can continue to go to work with safe distancing measures in place but most other work premises must close if the person can work from home he should do so Kelley commuted but others will not be able to including foreign workers on construction sites and in shipyards these workers live in dormitories and we will make arrangements to look after them the closure of workplaces will take effect from next Tuesday this will ensure that most of our workforce stays at home and limits their physical interaction to as few people as possible second we will also move to full home based learning in our schools and Institutes of higher learning we started with one day of home-based learning this week this has gone smoothly with some teething issues being resolved the Ministry of Education will work with the schools to implement full home-based learning starting next Wednesday all preschool and student care centers will also be closed but they will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative care arrangements sir we will tighten restrictions on movements and gatherings of people it boils down to three things first stay at home as much as possible second avoid socializing with others beyond your own household gatherings should be confined to your household avoid visiting even your extended families who are not staying with you especially if they're elderly or vulnerable third go out only to do essential things for work if you are in essential services or in a key economic sector to buy food at markets or to take out from restaurants and Hawker centers or to exercise in the neighborhood park keeping a safe distance from others the spirit of these measures is to get all of us to minimize physical contact if we don't go out if we avoid contact with others then the virus won't be able to spread it's as simple as that but I know this is very hard to do it's very hard as a practical matter in places like Hawker centers and wet markets because it's difficult to practice safe distancing especially on the weekends when it's crowded it will help if we all adjust our habits for example do our marketing on weekdays instead of weekends to avoid the crowd we will also deploy more safe distance distancing ambassadors to encourage people not to crowd together so please cooperate with them safe distancing is also hard for a psychological and emotional reason it goes very much against our human instincts it is in our nature to want to socialize to be close to those we are talking to to take comfort in the warmth and company of friends and family I fully understand this but I hope you will also understand why we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period because this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus so that we gradually bring our numbers down it's also the best way to keep our family safe and particularly to protect our seniors from getting ill so please bear with the painful adjustments that we have to make each and every one of us can and must do our part to keep everyone in Singapore safe from kovat 19 [Music] let me now say a few words in Malay and then in Mandarin sadhana Sedaris Cleon Ghulam Bob Rafa mingle pass belong on case bardukov assemble Angela's

directly today to explain why we need to make this major move now but also to reassure you that things will be all right essential services will continue running so that all of us can cope with this new situation as we batten down to fight this virus we have enough food supplies to last us through this period and beyond you can still shop at the supermarket for wet market and you need not rush to stock up for weeks at a time you can still buy food from your favourite Hawker centers or coffee shop though you will have to take out and eat at home with your family rather than hang out and eat outside with your friends I know these measures will impact our workers and businesses severely this is already a very difficult time for them we will help them come through this on Monday in Parliament DPM Hinks weekend will announce additional support for households and businesses over and above what was provided in the to earlier budgets we will also legislate to require landlords to pass on property tax rebates in full to their tenants we will also pass new temporary legislation to let businesses and individuals defer certain contractual obligations for period such as paying rent repaying loans or completing work besides implementing this circuit breaker we also are rethinking our advice on face masks up to now the government has advised the general public that you only need to wear masks if you are not feeling well and this is to protect others from your germs this is based on scientific advice and guidelines from the World Health Organization also we did not have communities spread in Singapore then so it was very unlikely for you to run to anyone with kovat 19 on the street much less be infected by them nevertheless the government gave each household for surgical masks to use in case you got sick and to give people peace of mind now the situation is changing we now think there are some cases out there in the community going undetected so probably still not that many we also now have evidence that an infected person can show no symptoms and yet still pass on the virus to others this is why the World Health Organization is reviewing the issue of face masks and so is the u.s. communicable diseases Center CDC therefore we will no longer discourage people from wearing masks wearing a mask may help to protect others in case you have the virus but don't know it this is so that you keep your droplets to yourself when you sneeze or when you speak or cough it can also protect yourself a little better especially if you're elderly or vulnerable because of pre-existing health conditions we still want to conserve surgical masks for people who really need them healthcare workers in clinics and hospitals for everyone else in a community setting alternatives like reusable masks will give some added protection so from this Sunday the government will distribute reusable masks to all households meanwhile many community groups have been making and distributing reusable masks for the elderly and vulnerable I applaud these efforts they show our community spirit and mutual care but remember mask or no mask you still need to wash your hands and keep a safe distance away from other people the next few weeks will be pivotal even after these stepped-up measures the number of cases will quite likely still go up in the next few days there can be cases who have already been infected earlier except they have not yet shown symptoms or not yet gone to see their doctor but if we keep our efforts up within a few weeks we should be able to bring the numbers under control and bring the numbers down and get into a more sustainable position we will keep on doing our utmost to protect every Singaporean from Kovach 19 many people have been working tirelessly for the past two months our nurses and doctors our contact tracers and health care staff we thank them all for the efforts and sacrifices now we are all enlisted to join them on the frontline it will be a long fight but if any country can see this through it is Singapore we have the resources we have the determination we are united by helping one another through this we will prevail and emerge stronger thank you [Applause] good afternoon thank you for joining us our prime minister has just addressed our law and given an update on kovat 19 he has also announced to slow the production of go V 19 there are now more than a million Coby 19 cases globally in Singapore the number of cases crossed the 1000 mark two days ago one more patient has passed away this morning from complications due to Kobe 19 our thoughts are with the family there are also an increasing number of unlink cases here we have progressively put in place safe distancing measures including telecommuting for workplaces in view of the trend of increasing local transmission and the number of unlink cases the task force has decided that we must make a decisive move at this point to further curb the spread of the infection from 7 April until 4:00 for me both inclusive we were put in place enhanced set of safe distancing measures as a circuit breaker to slow that infection the aim is to reduce much more significantly movements and interactions in both public and private places to do this we will move towards a full home-based learning for our schools and close most physical workplace premises save for those providing essential services and in selected economic sectors which are critical for our local and the global supply chains my colleagues from the task force will provide more information on the various measures shortly the key advice for Singaporeans is to stay home go out only for essential services and if you need to go out avoid close contacts with crowds or with people if it is not possible to avoid close contact wear a reusable mask will be helpful we know and that we understand that these measures are very difficult ones and will create a lot of inconveniences we will have to change our habits and our daily routines but these measures are important and necessary to protect Singaporeans and keep us and our family members safe the government will do what we can to help Singaporeans kite over this period we will announce additional measures next week to provide support for businesses and for households each of us must play our part and keep a lookout for when another stay united and we can get through this together thank you and let me say a few words in Mandarin no change in Chautauqua Liang bi go Katya did she eat in Susan's house if I want she earlie

colleges yet issue who some foods whose hands are itchy - what is the legacy citizen Jesus a lie voila watching what a hunger function type Putin had no doubt had a ninja are now call upon Minister Lawrence Wong to make his comments good evening it has been one week since we last put in place quite a comprehensive set of safe distancing measures our original thought was that we could perhaps take sometime to see if the measures implemented since last Friday were having effect in slowing down the spread of the virus but we looked at the situation on a daily basis and we decided that there wasn't we couldn't afford to wait any further because they are very very worrying trends and a number of unlinked local cases in particular continues to rise and they now make up nearly half of the total local cases you see every day this suggests that they are very likely undetected or hidden cases within our community and it also means that we are likely to see more cases popping up at today's level of infection our Hospital capacity is still able to cope with the cases that are coming in but we do not want to wait for a situation where the cases rise and sharply and then we get overwhelmed so we decided not to wait but to make a decisive preemptive move now and put in place this major circuit breaker to try and break the chain of transmission we are very mindful that these are painful difficult measures that will bring about inconvenience and disruption to people's lives and livelihood we hope Singaporeans will understand why these are necessary to protect ourselves our family members and our fellow citizens so it's absolutely critical that we take the measures seriously we have seen over the past weeks each time we made incremental moves and introduced new measures Singaporeans are responsible we comply with them but there will always be a group that tries to push the rules to its limits so when we say no more than 10 people in order to reduce the size of social gatherings people ask is it ok if I add one more person and just trying meet the rules but still as far as possible I want to get together with my friends or when we say let's have safe distancing 1 meter apart at FMB outlets you will still find places where people try to sit close together even though we have clearly set out the guidelines but they will still want to eat in rather than take out when the place is crowded or for that matter when we recently introduced telecommuting many have started I think the telecommuting rates have improved but you will still find employees and staff saying my boss my employer tells me I cannot telecommute even though it's quite clear my work allows me to do so so all of these behaviors and habits are really counterproductive the course we must assume that the virus is circulating within our own population there will be undetected carriers amongst us it could be any one of us so each and every interaction we have with others may well be the link that causes the virus to spread and cause us a new infection cluster and that's why we are now doing this major circuit breaker this time round and making it very clear the rules are simple and we hope everyone takes this seriously stay at home there's no more rule of 10 or whatever number just stay at home avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members living together with you in the same household beyond that you can go out for essential things if your work is essential if you need to buy some food and groceries but if you go out and you are unable to avoid close contact with others when you are out then wear a mask so these are simple rules and we hope everyone will abide by them we are really in as we have said repeatedly for a long fight because even with these measures in place we must expect the cases the infected cases to continue to rise they will still be high for a while and they may even go up in the next few days because there is a lack each time we put in place a new measure it would take time before we see the benefits of the measures that are put in place the later set of measures will continue for at least a month if we are all disciplined about the guidelines uphold them not just based on the guidelines but uphold the spirit of what we are trying to do then there is a chance by the end of the month we can roll back some of these measures and as I've said before we are rolling back not resetting back to zero but rolling back still with some stringent precautions in place but perhaps not as tight as what we are introducing today but if the situation does not improve if there is poor compliance poor implementation then we do have to be prepared for this set of measures to continue even beyond a month so really we are all in this together now we are all enlisted in this fight against the virus so let's hunker down and beat the virus together thank you let me now invite my darling medical services professor Kenneth Mack to give an update on the medical perspective Rob Thank You minister as of the 2nd of April 2020 we have 65 new cases 9 of which are imported cases the 39 cases are linked to previous cases where they individually are with clusters and 17 as yet unlinked cases epidemiological investigations in contact tracings continues to see whether we can establish further links in these 17 cases in total we have 1114 cases of Kovac 19 infection diagnosed in Singapore and forty four hundred and seventy three of these cases remain currently admitted in our hospitals 25 patients remain in the ICU and our doctors and nurses continue to look after them very very carefully with discharge 235 patients from acute hospital care 401 patients have been transferred across to eat a community isolation facility or into a private hospital who cooperate and partner with us in looking after these patients these patients remain well but are still awaiting their test results to turn negative before they can in fact be released back into the community 47 patients in fact have been released from isolation and they remain well where they are at home as minister has mentioned five patients have passed on and we announced the death earlier this morning of one of our patients the expect cases to continue to increase with each day this is more related to infection exposure from either imported cases or from others who had been in the community before we imposed our first set of safe distancing met measures it will take time for the safe distancing measures to take full effect the expansion of our safe distancing measures is a precautionary step it is designed to further reduce public circulation to reduce the opportunities for people to interact closely and therefore to reduce the risk of person-to-person spread our review and revision of our mass policy is intended to supplement and enhance the safety signatures that we've put in place the use of mass is not a separate policy and intervention in itself our recommendations concerning mass use a risk based and evidence informed and it relates to our understanding of what the risk of community spread is and our understanding of to what the mode of transmission is in Singapore and has been mentioned we will continue to paralyze the use of surgical masks for healthcare workers who need the masks to protect themselves as they dedicate the time and energy was looking after those of us who are ill and particulate also of us were infected with kovat 19 infection for members of the public our priority mix is to protect those who are vulnerable our seniors who are more susceptible to infection and if infected may in fact have poorer outcomes because of the many different medical conditions that may have and therefore we would encourage them to wear masks if they need to come out of their homes and be in contact with others we understand that there are also frontline workers who are involved improve the provision of essential services and in their daily work they may have frequent contact with other people and where they also cannot avoid close contact with others we will allow them to wear a mask in all other settings we understand that there may be spread of infection from those who have minimal symptoms or mouth symptoms and therefore to protect others we encourage those who are in this setting to wear masks again if they're coming out of their homes and if they are not able to avoid contact with others in this setting the wearing of the mass is to facilitate you going to see a doctor please do not go out wearing mass is an excuse to continue to engage in social interactions it is important that you see a doctor and obey the doctor's instructions don't go back to work if you are sick our measures reflect our determination the continual to isolate and control the spread of kovat 19 in our country at this time while there is some community spread of kovat 19 this is not still widespread we still have an ability to isolate to contain and to control further transmission it is important therefore first remember that we have not lost control of the situation remain determined to stem further transmission and a social the safe distancing measures that we put in place are designed to allow us to do so thank you I'll now to invite the Minister only can to talk about the measures that will be introduced for the schools good afternoon Thank You Kim Yong I'll talk about schools in our plan we have been of course implementing many precautionary measures in schools as well as our ih else Institutes of higher learning over the past few weeks as I always have said many scientists have said if the virus behave more like influenza affecting children more and making children the vectors for transmission we will have closed schools long ago but kovat 19 because of the way behaves it gives us the option of keeping schools open provided there are stringent precautionary measures and that is what that has been what we are doing so by keeping schools open this prevented a major disruption to people's lives especially our frontline workers our health care workers especially children from families who are which are more vulnerable I don't have home-based support for the education it also avoided the situation where school closed and students especially the teenagers that roaming around the community exposing themselves to more risk so school keeping school open keeping it safe with precautionary measures has been a plus in this fight against this virus I saw a street signs report yesterday that gave some data on infections of students so I thought I report some of the infection figures as of end of yesterday say preschool five infections so far number from oversea sources that means they travel to number from family members three number infection from the school none as for schools primary secondary and juicy we have five infections as of n-no yesterday number from overseas sources the minister's child travel one from family members infecting the child the the student for number of infections from school none IH else we have 48 infections number from overseas they went overseas many of them on internship coming back number from overseas is 38 number from family members from their homes five number from work because they were on the attachment one number from social activities two number from campus including the hostels none so as of now I think our track record in keeping school safe has not been too bad and really I need to thank teachers parents students all stakeholders for working so hard being so understanding cooperating with our precautionary measures to keep school open and keep school safe but never be complacent never let our guard down when there's widespread community transmission chances are there will be transmission in schools and we must always be prepared for that many parents have written to me over the past weeks some sign petitions to request for school closure and I've been doing my best together with my team to explain that schools can be kept safe and kept open but I've always explained to the parents we do not rule out moving 200 percent home based learning and but if we do it must be done at the right time and for the right reason but in preparation for this possibility we did a one-day home based learning this week for every student so Wednesday was for primary school yesterday was our secondary school today is for all JC students so every child every student had a chance to go through home based learning this week including their teachers too and that process this week helped us solve many teething problems soft the technical glitches we learn now almost 4,000 devices to students who don't have devices at home we don't know dongho's for students with those students who don't and we have some corporate sponsors and parents who perform essential services such as health care or without childcare support at home they register with the schools and this week they are able to send their children to school even during the home based learning day and situation new ways of schooling one particular area is that we now have students with lesser home support some with no support who are going to be with us for the next three and a half weeks so let's do more to help them to uplift them mobilize our resources differently to make a difference to them in this three and a half weeks so stay safe stay home stay curious thank you thank you I'll now ask Minister ton ginseng to talk about workplaces our essential services as well as essential supplies ginseng Thank You Kimmy oh I will cover three parts one the measures for businesses and workers second our supply chains and the mass collection exercise that we will commence this weekend let me start with the first on the measures for our businesses let me stay that our measures are in minimizing transmission at the workplaces and to significantly reduce the need to commute to and fro from our workplaces I want to emphasize that this is not about business closure this is about closing the premises for the duration in order for us to adopt the enhanced safe distancing measures now this distinction is important because many businesses will still be able to operate SPM has said all essential services will continue to operate let me list down the following essential services that we can expect to see continued operations first all health care and social services second all food related services the energy for water and waste management and environmental services fifth all transportation storage and logistics services six all information and communication services 7 all security operations it all facilities management and critical public infrastructure 9 manufacturing activities that are essential to our security sustenance and safety 10 all banking and financial services a number of other services including hardware stores for repairs pet supplies vehicle recovery will also be allowed to continue operations however all these businesses will operate with the core essential staff and are expected to comply with the strict safety sensing measures let me also say that all the related supply chains to keep the essential services functioning will also be allowed to continue our agencies will proactively inform the firm's that provide essential services if they have not already done so other companies can contact us for clarification and assistance as necessary we will set up a hotline from tonight to take queries from the business community the hotline will run from 8 p.m. until midnight tonight and begin operations again at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning the number to call is six eight nine eight one eight zero zero I will put all this information on the website after the news conference there is also a website for businesses to go to to get more information and to provide the details required and to submit appeals as necessary this website will be kovat dot go business.gov dot SG cove it not go business.gov dot SG all businesses that can be done from home all operations that can be done from home without the need to commute will also be able to continue businesses that are critical to the functioning of the global supply chains will also be able to continue for example companies that are involved in a manufacturing of semiconductor biopharma petrochemicals will be allowed to continue and likewise the Associated supply chains will also be allowed to continue business operations like construction that require some time to wind down safely will be given a short grace period to do so over the next few days we are aware that some business operations will be reduced and ceased for the time being let me now invite Minister Josephine to to say about the measures for a worker before I continue on the supply chains jobless [Music] good evening how will the closures of what premises affect workers livelihoods I'm sure this is at the top of our workers minds if business is still operating fully the employees should continue to get paid but there are also instances where business operations must be reduced or seized as a result here I would like to assure the workers that M om m TI and mo f are working very closely to enhance the jobs Support Scheme for local workers so that employers can continue to pay them now the details will be announced by Deputy Prime Minister hang in just a few days that takes care of local workers what if employers also have foreign workers whom they need to retain so that businesses can restart smoothly after this break in the past the government has said no to waiving foreign workers levies but the next four weeks are exceptional so we will look into it we will also consider if employers need temporary help to ensure they have the essential workforce to restart we appreciate that employers and workers will be making many adjustments quite a few have already made the switch to get their staff to work from home for the other employers we will do whatever we can to support them as they work out their responses of top priority is for all employers to communicate properly and clearly with the employees on work arrangements in the next few and also how colleagues can keep in touch with one another to provide mutual support we hope our employers can focus on that they can reach out to Ministry of Manpower to seek clarifications through our contact center which we will keep open throughout this weekend at the usual hours the number to call if they need to is six four three eight five one to two we will put out further information on this thank you Joe let me now move on to the second part to reassure Singaporeans on the integrity of our supply chains and our food supplies all supermarkets wet markets Hawker centers and food establishment will remain open let me say that again all supermarkets wet markets Hawker centers and food establishment will remain open our supply lines and our supply chains intact at this moment and will continue to function smoothly there is no need to rush to the supermarkets to stock up as this will only cause disruption to our logistics system we can continue to purchase our essentials and groceries as usual during this period the supermarket's will continue to operate at their leisure hours please purchase responsibly and consider those who are more vulnerable amongst us if we don't run on the supermarket's we will be able to get all our supplies as phenomena and the stock and the shelves will be progressively restock as usual for all food establishments they will continue to operate the main adjustment will be that there will be no more dining in takeaways and food delivery services will also continue if there's one thing that I can ask fellow singaporeans corporation is this if you are going to do the takeaway to top out bring our own clean containers where possible to help our food establishments conserve their packaging materials and for all of us to be more environmentally sustainable now let me move on to the third topic on the reusable mass collection exercise we have planned for this for some time and this is why we have the ready stock in our country fellow singaporeans might have also noticed that in the last few weeks we have started selling reusable washable mass at various of our supermarkets in order to ensure that all families would have access to a reusable mass the People's Association will commence the distribution of reusable mass to all Singaporean residents from Sunday 10:00 a.m. onwards we will conduct the exercise from Sunday 5th of April to the following Sunday 12 of April for all weekdays residents will be able to collect their mass from 3 to 9 p.m. daily for all weekends and public holidays the collection can be done from morning 10 a.m. to evening 9 p.m. all the collections will be done at the respective CCS and are seized and I think fellow Singaporeans are familiar with the collection exercise that we have done some time back for all the collection we will have priority queues for our seniors so that they do not have to wait too long and we hope that fellow Singaporeans will also allow our seniors to collect their masses each housing block and precincts will be informed progressively Singaporeans can refer to the website w-w-w dot mass go no bus must go away dot SG or the CC and RCS noticeboard for more information on when and where to collect their mass so let me say that again the will WW the mass go where dot SG or look up for the notices at the respective notice boards at the leaf lobbies for the HDB flats so let me pass back to Kim Jung I should also let you know that I have another colleague of mine at the press conference and he's Desmond Lee and I will invite him to say a few words Desmond please good afternoon the health and safety of our preschool community and our colleagues and clients in the social service sector of paramount importance to us in these challenging times and we've been working closely with both sectors to progressively put in place safe distancing measures to ensure the well-being and health of our teachers our children our social service professionals and our residents and clients at different facilities and with the enhanced distancing measures we are going a step further to make sure that our families colleagues and clients are kept safe and kept well while ensuring that Singaporeans with critical and urgent needs continue to have access to support to safeguard the well-being of our preschool community our students and our staff we will be suspending general services of all preschools and student care centres from the 8th of April to the 4th of May parents should keep the children at home during this period many preschools have home-based learning resources to support parents during this period the early childhood development agency or actor is consolidating resources developed by various preschools - a single website for parents convenience and we will share the link with parents next week agda will automatically waive the minimum attendance requirement for preschool subsidies in April on msf will waive the minimum attendance requirement for the student care fee assistance subsidies in April in essence all subsidies for preschool and student care will continue to be disbursed during this period a preschools will remain open to serve parents who have to continue to work in the essential services and who are unable to find alternative caregiving arrangements and these would include those working in services like in health care and in other services that Minister Chan had articulated earlier priority will be given to children of health care workers children of low wage or daily wage workers as well as children from vulnerable families with no support parents should contact your your child's preschool for further assistance and for primary school going children enrolled at various student care centers our parents should approach the child's primary school for further assistance now during this time MSF will suspend or reduce non-essential and non urgent services but the following services will remain open our social service officers or SSOs will remain open so Singaporeans in need can continue to get social and financial assistance with the appropriate safety sensing measures put in place and these include the temporary relief fund or TRF the kovat 19 support grant CSG as well as other Comcare assistance schemes on Wednesday applications for the temporary relief fund or TRF began and so far about 60,000 applications have been submitted by Singaporeans my colleagues at the SS oz and from the CCS under the People's Association are working hard to get affected Singaporeans the support that they need and I seek everyone's understanding during this time applications are open for the temporary relief fund until the 30th of April and there is no need to rush with the latest measures in place we will step up safe distancing for the application of the temporary relief fund in the following ways first we will be launching an online application form next week and an online system to reduce the need for applicants to travel out to apply we will provide more details soon second for those people who feel that they still need to attend physically to obtain and to fill in forms they can continue to go to the SSO s-- and community centres but will provide the forms for them to take to fill in at the convenience and time at home and a box for them to drop off there will be assistance provided on-site for those applicants who find difficulty in completing the forms or who have further queries or need for further assistance second residential homes will continue to serve our vulnerable including our seniors persons who are destitute persons with disability and Children and Youth and the statutory care and rehabilitation MSF services and funded social service agencies involved in crisis interventions for serious high-risk and urgent cases will also continue to operate these include cases of family violence child abuse self-harm and self-abuse the National Council of social service or NCS s is helping our members build up the capability to provide services using technology and remote means during this time they will continue to work closely with our social service agencies and charities that provide important services to support the day-to-day living of vulnerable Singaporeans such as food support and to ensure the continuity of their services and while these measures will cause inconvenience they are necessary to protect everyone's health and safety and we seek your understanding and cooperation on this thank you thank you we have established video links with the media and now I will be happy to invite the media for questions Thank You ministers we'll start with the first question first question from Sylvie Channel NewsAsia please state your question hey Jenny I have three questions the first one is how do we assess the success of the circuit breaker secondly will contact tracing and be continued because previously as mentioned that contact tracing will stop if there's widespread local transmission and if it is how will it be ramped up manpower wise the third question assumes all you come in terms of graduation the autonomous universities that mean that students will be graduating later and what about graduation ceremonies Thank You uncle contact tracing efforts will continue we are continuing to ramp up our capacity for contact tracing and we have enlisted the help of police as well as the SAF as well as other men power resources to allow us to continue with efforts of contact tracing despite the increasing number of cases and the contact tracing will continue to play a very central role in our efforts to contain and manage the outbreak of weed 19 but what is also important is to ask for the support and cooperation of Singaporeans with regard to our safe distancing measures because if you are able to give ourselves keep the safe distance with with one another this will reduce the risk of transmission and will help to slow down the transmission and will allow us to have greater capacity to contact trace whatever cases we see so contact tracing will continue and it is important for us to adhere to the safe distancing measures so that the contact tracing will be easier more effective now as Minister Lawrence want to talk about a circuit breaker measures the question was how do we define success and I think when we look at all the measures that were put in place the key objective is to reduce the spread of the virus within Singapore so what we would like to see as a result of all of these measures is the slowing down of the number of local cases a reduction in the number of local cases particularly in the number of local unlinked cases so those are the key indicators that we watch out for and again as I said if we are all disciplined in continuing with these measures coupled with the fact that we are doubling down on our contact tracing efforts to identify ring-fence infected clusters quarantine people who are close contacts with both moving in parallel we have a chance of bringing down the number of local cases significantly and reducing the number of unlinked cases so all of this in the end is that as we said it's it really comes down to a national effort this is no longer the work of government alone it's no longer the work of contact tracers alone all of us must now do our part to slow down the spread of the virus thank you before I pass on to our Minister um perhaps I should also add to clarify that over the next one to two weeks we may still see a number of cases increasing because the measures that we put in place today will actually have an effect only after one or two weeks because the infection has an incubation period some of the cases that we see today and in fact infected a week or two before so even if we started the measures today you will take one to two weeks before the effects can be seen what that means is that over the next seven to fourteen days we may still continue to see cases but we need to develop our efforts in safe distancing to come to do the slow down new infections that may occur over the next one to two weeks mr. Ahn thank you for that question I mentioned earlier that exams we were treated the or graduating exams national exams we treated that's essential so you will carry on but is carry on now for the University online article makes assignments I say that and I chef elaborated is that it is because graduation is essential a major milestone of the students lives so therefore with this format they will graduate on time but graduation ceremonies are not essential for now so with our advice that everybody should stay home there shall be no graduation ceremonies but I hope in time to come when this is all over we can still properly mark the milestone of their lives the next question next questions from committee go from the streets times please state your question I thank you my question is why is the start date of the new measures people seven by this not cause of Astral people will still want to be the best Ron's as the truck by secondly what does it mean that most workplaces will close but they break any loans if they refuse to close at the designated day thirdly listener can be learning experience on Wednesday Thursday and Friday to speak how many students are likely to need to go to school when the full home-based onion starts next Wednesday and finally with all this in place I have to ask is there a further set of measures you can put in place equivalent of as we've been saying does convene at this point thank you thank you could you repeat your second questions because we couldn't hear it clearly sure so my question second question was on workplaces when you say that most workplaces would close what does this mean will they be breaking any laws if they do not close and butter the penalties thank you let me save us a category that we are not in DOS convict and currently we are in Tuscon Orange and all the measures that we mentioned were measures that we can introduce during dusk on orange and we will continue to do so and these measures will help us to slow down the transmission and slow down the number of cases and this will help us avoid having the need to go to dusk on a raid at the same time we also have further measures that we can introduce and we'll have to dis look at the situation how it evolves as I've explained before our response is always based on the situation which continue to develop and we'll monitor the situation and decide what else do we need to do and and in time to come but currently this set of measures are very significant measures this is a very important step that we are moving forward in fact we are we understand that this set of measures already will create significant inconvenience and disruption to daily lives daily routines we are Singaporeans to bear with us and support these measures observe the spirit of these measures and that is to really increase the safety distance between individuals we know human beings need a social contact but for the next four weeks please help us by maintaining a social distance so that we are able to slow down the transmission significantly I think that's the key objective of the measures that we are putting in place today so our US Minister Wang to talk about safe distance measures well there was a question on the start date and whether you know having a later start date will lead to a rush for people dining in right well so the basic point is the start date kicks in a bit later giving people workplaces businesses time to adjust but even between now and the start date all of the high level or the stringent safe distancing measures that we are already operating still remains in place so restaurant seating would still be one meter apart strictly right there is no compromising on that and all of the measures that we have talked about no gathering of people above ten persons all that remains in place and so we are continuing with this stringent set of measures and then when the effective date kicks in there will be no more dining in that applies even to Hawker centers and coffee shops so all FMB establishments will not no longer have dining in and will only allow takeout and everyone will then have to make adjustments including Singaporeans so we do need some time for people to make these adjustments and we again once again remind everyone to adhere to the spirit of the new measures right it is really about each one of us doing our part to significantly reduce the number of social interactions we have typically if you think about your own experience a person would have perhaps 20 or more contacts with others besides their immediate family members easily right you go out you sit down you in a coffee shop you go to your workplace this cannot continue under our heightened posture under this new face of a national circuit breaker all of us have to reduce our contacts significantly limiting it only to the people who live around us and if we all do that as I said we have a chance then of gradually bringing the virus under control our Assam Minnesota's venture to respond to the question on the workplaces previously we had said that we want all businesses to try and get their employees to work from home and we had said previously 100% is better than 80% 80% is better than 60% in other words previously we accepted that in some instances at the work premises there would still be maybe 10 20 30 40 percent of the workforce still there with this enhanced set of safe distancing measures all of the workplace activities will have to come to a stop meaning that everyone will have to work from home and at the work premises there will be no one and what that will mean is that in some instances where it is possible for all the employees to work from home then the business can continue to operate fully otherwise the business operations will have to be reduced or to cease completely now this will be the case except for essential services and all the essential services have been described earlier by Minister Chen ginseng and Minister Chen has also explained how some businesses that could be part of the strategic set of activities in our economy and want to seek special consideration they can do so by applying to MTI but for all others unless you are able to get an approval to continue operations at the workplace it will be an offence to still have operations at the workplace so if there are companies out there that are still not clear about this please contact MTI or MLM either agency will be able to give you a clarification thank you Minister all will respond on this question on schools yeah that I think the question was how many students do we expect there will still come to school under the watch and supervision of the teachers based on this week's experience it ranges 10 to 15 students per school there abouts but next week Monday Tuesday will sort out the numbers further I do know some parents this week they purposely took leave so that they could be at home watching the child do home based learning they can't keep taking leave if they work in essential services and therefore I expect next week some of them may require the schools to look after their children and supervise them doing home based learning but some children I notice they came to school because they don't have Wi-Fi set not at home yet by next week it may be set up they don't have to come so plus minus some I think will be will be able to handle next question next question is from Stefania Palmer from Financial Times Stefania please state your question yes I have three questions first of all with regards to the new measures asking people to stay home and just go out for essential matters etc how will these be enforced will they be enforced and would there be repercussions for those for example who go out not for essential services what would that look like the second question is in light of the increase in the number of cases are you taking steps to increase the capacity of the healthcare system by it for instance you know increasing maybe the number of ICU beds or the number ventilators at hand if so by how much and the third question is with regards to the point that was just made by the manpower Minister what's - it being an offence for work premises remaining open at this stage would the penalties remain the same as bills announced earlier this week which included potential stock work orders or fines how will those be determined on is numerals on the first question on the enforcement or house first of all we want everyone to take very seriously this new advisory and measures that you should stay at home and only go out for essential activities the key is that if you go out to buy something buy groceries takeaway then come back immediately don't sit around in the hawker Center in the coffee shop and then continue to mingle in groups so that's the key that we will be watching out for and we will have enforcement agencies will be out and about watching out for people who continue to gather in groups even if it's less than 10 like I said we don't want any such gathering in coffee shops in hawker centres in wojtek's anywhere in FM b outlets and these should not happen at all so if you are to go out on your own or with a family member to buy something to exercise that's fine but don't loiter don't gather with people outside of your family members and the enforcement what agencies will be taking this seriously and if there are people who continue to breach these rules then indeed enforcement action will be taken against a second question on health care capacity over the last of a few months I've been explaining to the media as well as the public that we have been progressively expanding our health care capacity both in terms of the ICU beds as well as the isolation wards for the co v19 related illnesses by the same time I have to remind all of us that while we exterior capacity to deal with to manage the existing and the current number of cases that we see we should not test the limit and that is why we are putting in all these measures in place in order for us to continue to keep that buffer and even if we have a physical capacity in terms of number of bits in ICU and in isolation watts we also have to be mindful of the health care workers who have been working day and night around the clock sometimes for going there only for going their own families in order to take care of these patients so we must do all we can to minimize a number of cases that we see every day so that we give more capacity to the healthcare system and give more leeway for our health care workers so that they are able to perform their tasks and they still have their family to look after - I asked my professor accountant work to add on if yes anything to add yes thank you very much we have been expanding our capacity in many different ways and we've been doing this in phases in anticipation for any increase in the number of cases in Singapore a minister has talked about expansion in ICU a bit capacity and we've done this through the conversion of various wards that we have in readiness in our hospitals so if in fact to build that into the original design of all our hospitals to be able to expand that bed capacity but it's also expanding our capacity in other areas which includes all step-down care facilities we've also been engaged with quite a lot of discussions with private hospitals and have stepped up very nicely to accommodate us to support us in freeing up capacity to support the care for patients with kovat 19 infection we anticipate that our private sector colleagues would continue to support us in many other ways and this may also be in sharing the Lord in looking after our existing patients with chronic medical conditions who at this point in time would be awaiting further care as our prop across patrols are devoted what's looking after kovat 19 patients as we raise these bed facilities we are also mindful that we need also to make sure that these beds are properly equipped and we have been making ready some of our stock offer additional equipment for this particular purpose and we continue to procure additional equipment to ensure that our bits as we raised them would be ready to support any increase in the numbers manpower is also important and we have in in fact been progressively training more of our manpower to be able to take on these additional roles looking after additional patients in an ICU or critical care setting we have also been reaching out to health care workers who have had previous critical care experience but now might be deployed in other roles and we have invited them to return to the workforce or to these original roles training them providing them with refresher training to ensure therefore that they are fit for purpose as they eventually get deployed to these new assignments and responsibilities so these are some of the measures we have taken and we continue to take on additional measures as needed in anticipation for the increase in numbers that may come Thank You Minister Joseph in teal the penalties are the same as that announced yesterday but previously we said that even if you were not operating essential services some activity could be allowed at the workplace if there was no way for those activities to be done remotely but now we need all premises to close and none of those workplace activities should continue this is unless you are providing essential services or you have gotten a special approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry next question next question is from the mutant or from the unhurt southpaw and so please state your question afternoon thank you very much a full broad set of questions first one regards the world the chasers cause we're ten fastest on the in the US we saw and also some transmissions actually traced back to modern big back so are we actually found one thing in contact racing efforts and frequency and also is there any indication of prevalence of widespread community transmission and one more thing regarding a specific case the patient from the first patient from the Amway nursing home do you have any indication where a shaken got the the virus from was it from family members so that's the first set second set history with regards to mass M uh supplies so maybe could be mister give us a bit more of thinking of why your government is changing its stance on whether or not use must and cause some people might feel that this is a cause some confusion and also commit implemented be measures we are announcing today any any earlier and also do we have enough mass supplies when will be possibly be able to have our own production of massive the market anyway on the the third set of question is because to so many people work at home do we have enough data and data bandwidth who support all these operations and 15 on the more like part but the 200s almost as important no some of our readers have expressed concern whether simples who still remain open thank you okay thank you us professor Mac to talk about cases that we are seeing in Singapore both the clusters as well as a patient from Alamo Moines nursing home then I asked Minister Wang to respond to the other questions we continue with epidemiological investigations and contact tracing and in fact our efforts are not stopping in any way with in fact expanded our contact tracing capacity and capability through the support and assistance of posters in populous Falls and the Singapore Armed Forces and they have made some preliminary breakthroughs in establishing links from time to time but many adults investigations are connect are continuing we have some hypotheses in terms of how some of these clusters may have arisen and as time goes on as we can prove whether these are indeed the links they have taken place we will make that known to all of you at this time it's to I believe that while there is some level of community transmission it is at a stage where this is still potentially controllable we are able we believe still to cast a net wide to isolate and ring-fence all of these confirmed cases as much as we can and limit further transmission and therefore it is not our suspended state that we have widespread transmission to the extent that our ring-fencing and containment strategies have failed in fact we'll continue to endeavor and continue to persevere to do so because we believe this will make a difference in allowing them the safe distance images to take root and allow these cases then to then settle down you asked about the specific resident who was a patient and a resident at the Lima Moya all each home and they have since then been several residents who have also been confirmed to have the infection as well as staff members from our investigations to date it is a possibility we have yet still to confirm this but a possibility then effect it might have been one of the staff members who might have been having some mouth symptoms but continued to work and then an opportunity through close contact in the home then have led to other residents getting their infection but we continue to investigate to see whether this possibility is indeed true and as we continue with our efforts to determine these links we will again make make that known to you let me address some of the questions raised first on masks we have always said that our guidance on masks is based on scientific advice and evidence and that's why originally we started out by saying you only need to wear a mask if you are unwell that is also the advice by the w-h-o but we now are in a different situation because we are seeing new data new information being put out including evidence that in fact that persons with no symptoms may infect others which means that you may not know whether you are well unwell because an infected person may be carrying the virus but may well have no symptoms and then even when they speak droplets may spread especially in close proximity to another person that's why even the w-h-o and the US CDC are now reviewing their own guidelines and similarly we have been studying this for some time and on top of the new evidence we are also in a different situation in Singapore today than before before we didn't have community spread of the virus now we are seeing a increase in locally transmitted cases and we are also concerned about possibly undetected carriers within our community right so it's with because of all of these reasons that we've decided and the position on masks has to be updated and now we have updated the guidance we still want to conserve surgical masks for our healthcare workers because there is a global shortage of surgical masks we are trying our best to replenish our supplies of these masks and also to build up some local capabilities but still these masks have to be conserved for our healthcare workers that's essential because they do need them in order to care for their patients but for the general population some form of masks even a reusable mask can serve as a physical barrier and can provide some basic protection and that's why our advisory now is first of all don't go out stay at home but if you have to go out for essential activities and you cannot avoid close contact with others that's the key if you cannot avoid close contact with others then wear a mask and even there in such circumstances a reusable mask can offer some protection so that's the thinking behind this change in guidance on your other question could we have put in place the measures earlier in the end it is a judgment call based on the global and local situation certainly we could have done this very much earlier but there is also a concern from medical experts and public health experts looking at all of these safe distancing measures mitigation the the safe distancing measures that were referring to if you were to put in them in place too early there may well be fatigued and when there is fatigue people may not abide by the measures so well and then you will they will not have their intended effect so there is a case to think about when to implement them and to ensure that we implement them at the right time right for example if we have put in place all the measures that we are talking about now and we have put them in place much earlier we may very well still be in the same situation to date you know with the measures in place three months later right and children will be no longer will be out no it will not have schools for three months even longer so you have to decide if you do it too early there may be fatigue there will be significant disruption to people's lives and in the end it may well be counterproductive even the timing that we have decided now if you look at why other countries what other countries have done we are doing this relatively early in our infection cycle we have not reached a point where we are seeing many uncontrollable outbreaks right we are still in a phase where we are containing the virus many countries have moved to this set of measures that we have just announced only after giving up an abandoning containment and then they decide well let's all go into this you know stay at home orders we have not given up on containment in fact we are still going all out to detect and contact trace every case quarantine the close contacts and try and stamp out every infected cluster we are pursuing containment but at the same time we think it's necessary to do more with safe distancing and that's why we are putting in place these new stringent set of circuit breakers in place and both the contact tracing the safe distancing work in parallel and we have then best chance of trying to control the spread of the virus finally your question on Singapore Pools and I think for the outlets they will be closed they are not considered essential services next question we have time for three more questions next question is from shahida from BH Shaheed I state your question please hello hello yes I just want to ask the likelihood of many will definitely be affected with this circuit breaker so I just wanted us if there is any other for the support or those that has been announced whether they are sufficient and what else can we expect also on schools is there a limit on the number of students or you know that a school or preschool or student can take especially if their parents there are a lot of parents and essential services and vulnerable groups in that school Thanks so this question of our livelihood of small enterprises and individual businesses as mr. Chang to elaborate on and for schools econ will respond we understand that many of the businesses and workers we under stress as mentioned just now DPM hang and Minister for finance will be announcing further measures next Monday to help our businesses and workers iike the number that each school can take them so first and foremost two things one abide by the spirit of this set of measures which is stay home whenever you can only when it is essential whether it is no choice you gotta go out then you go out including let's say you really have no choice you are essentially your health care worker and and you got to go to work you gotta go in the front line you can leave your child in school or you live in a fairly small flat with four or five children and it's really you are unable to cope then maybe the school can also help you so live by the spirit of this policy last week this week is 10 to 50 per school I think with that number is very comfortable third point is that whether you are at home or in school the education actually is going to be roughly the same teachers are at home to teachers also have children to take care of they actually lock on many of them lock on and able to see all the children they actually take attendance they can even have a flex raising ceremony and say the Pledge and then go through the assignments or go through the lesson followed by assignments followed by marking so it is virtual it's almost like zoom yeah we can use that kind of mode so whether you are in school physically or at home physically it will be the same mode of teaching yeah but as I mentioned earlier we do expect a fair number of children for more vulnerable families being having to come to school so I think take this opportunity mobilize harness whatever resources we have now that we have them for three weeks slightly more than three weeks let's see what we can do to especially help this group of children help them up live thank you next question second last question is from Farris Mokhtar of Bloomberg fires please state your question I just do questions so what would constitute a Doss cotton really because based on your current guidelines closures of what places in schools would come in the dose Conrade so what is your current definition of dose conrete been in this unprecedented situation and how far or how near are you to a lockdown because many Singaporeans would effectively see these as as a lockdown thank you and under a dose contained we will have to expect to see many uncontrollable outbreak and as widespread community transmission and there's very difficult to continue to do contact tracing and to do containment and the quarantine because we will just have to rely purely on safe distancing so that will be the scenario where you are in Tuscon with as I mentioned today we are not endorse conduit because we have not given up on contact tracing we have not given up on containment on quarantine so we are in fact doing the opposite we are stepping our capacity in order for us to do contact tracing too as to do as far as possible to ring-fence the transmission to contain it so as to reduce the number of new cases a number of unlink cases gradually so I think we are not yet in das hundred and B are quite a distance from those hundred we have to focus on the immediate tasks of increasing a safe distances between among our population and stepping up on our containment efforts to contact tracing and through containment and it is important for Singaporeans to cooperate with us even as we do contact tracing we will find that sometimes our patients unable to recall their contacts their history and sometimes they also are not truthful in some of not sharing some of the contacts that they may have this will hamper our efforts in containment and in contact tracing so I would appeal to Singaporeans to help us share with us openly because this is a matter of a public health interest so we do want to get down to the bottom of the all the information as much as we can so that we are effective in our contact tracing so I seek the cooperation and support of us fellow Singaporeans if you are one of the contacts that we are tracing please help us and share with us who are your close contacts so that we can be effective in contact tracing maybe as a prop map to add on if s on the issue yes doc on reflects our risk assessment as to what the local situation is like and it's what ministers has explained already we look at the degree of community spread in the country and we also look at our ability to control that spread within the committee itself so at this time while there is an increased amount of community spread as opposed to one month ago it is still a belief that this is a situation that we can potentially control and therefore we are not making any plans at this stage to move into dusk on rate if we were to consider the second rate it will be in a situation where because of our inability or failure to ring-fence isolate contain and prevent further company spread then the trust of our strategy changes towards some level of mitigation - in order to make sure that our health system and its resources are sustainable - in the long haul and we are clearly not at that stage just yet we will look at a variety of different parameters as we determine what that risk of community spread is we look at the number of cases as you come on we study the type of cases whether or not they are potentially linked to existing clusters or whether they are unlinked and as further investigations carry on we look at our success at being able then to establish these links to these clusters we look at our ability to prevent further spread even within a cluster to ensure therefore that there are no further transmission that occurs after we've made an attempt to bring fringe and isolate so these are some damages that we would put in place some of the factors we look at to assess whether or not our containment strategies are successful and they would also influence us as we assess whether there is a need in the future to move to Toscana in this quick response to the point about a lockdown and the question whether this constitutes a lockdown in fact even when we introduce the last round of measures last week people were already asking us in fact I think some members of the media had asked was that a lockdown so rather than you know think about use the phrase lockdown and which means different things to different people let's focus on the specific measures and what we are doing today is a significant tightening on top of what we had just introduced last week because we think this is necessary but with these measures we are not stopping all work we are not shutting down the economy right essential businesses will continue we are not stopping people from going out if they really need to for work where it's essential or to get their food groceries or even to exercise amongst their own family members so there are clear guidance rules that we have laid out but it is certainly a very stringent set of measures that were impose more restrictions on people's movements and so once again we call on everyone to cooperate to work with us and to show in this time of crisis that Singaporeans can be resilient can be united and we all can be disciplined in doing what is necessary to protect ourselves and save lives that's one question I realized I didn't answer on the earlier question on IT infrastructure whether there would be a constraint we did consider that so we have consulted our colleagues and MCI and they have assured us that we do have the in physical the IT infrastructure to cope with the increased in usage and that's because we have invested over the years in significant infrastructure including in fibre broadband fiber into people's homes thank you next question the last question is from Carly from channel 8 car please state your question hi so let me check in terms of how many visions of the plans will be given to our nation's and understand that a lot elderly right and might not be aware personal hygiene am i read it are like a whole day so after that lines how of the nation watched the use of a mosque is it like every four hours or once again and will key it will be a reminder elderly when they collect a mosque Thank You US Minister Chan to respond to the question for the reusable mass we'll be distributing one to every single one to every resident in Singapore we advise people to wear the mass including the elderlies when they go out of their home into a crowded environment we recommend that once we come home and we can wash it after being out and then we dried it properly and then you'll be able to use it again the following day by the way I'll just like to add that when this is a need up the PA staff and volunteers will be so be on-site to help our elderlies and explain to them how to use the reusable mask when the collection exercise is on thank you for joining us at this press conference thank you very much ",True,True,False,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia","as the number of Kobe 19 cases rise globally and across the world we expect the number of cases in Singapore to also increase over time we are therefore taking steps to preserve our health care capacity and over the last few days we have been sending our well patients who are well but still require isolation to some private hospitals as some of you already know today we have operationalized a community isolation facility with a maximum capacity of 500 and we will be sending similar patients to this this facility starting from today in addition to that we need to continue to further step up our safe distancing measures to reduce the risk of further local transmission as well as tighten travel restrictions to prevent important cases which Minister Wang will talk about later one particular group that we are concerned about our seniors and those with chronic conditions we advise them to avoid social gatherings and crowded places as far as possible and to only go out for essential purposes such as to work or to buy food and other essential items records from our immigration and checkpoint authorities show that there are still about 1,000 Singapore residents and long-term pass holders who are travelling abroad daily despite our travel advisories these individuals pose a risk to the health of fellow Singaporeans when they return from 27 March any Singapore resident or long-term pass holder who disregard that prevailing travel advisory and travel overseas will be charged at an unsubsidized rates for the inpatient stay at our public hospitals should they subsequently become kovat 19 positive Singapore residents will also not be able to claim from marital life or integrated Shield plans for these treatments a public and private petals even as we show up the resources at our health care institutions and put in additional measures we need every Singaporeans to continue to play our part adhere to safe distancing measures we are put in place be socially responsible if you are unwell see a doctor and stay at home continue to maintain good personal hygiene if we all of us do that and work together we can make a real difference in our fight against Covey 19 now as Minister want to give a statement thank you good evening all over the world you know millions of people nowadays are living in a different reality what places are closed shops are empty roads are empty everyone is asked to stay at home we are not experiencing this in Singapore not yet but we cannot be complacent the threat of a widespread virus outbreak is very real because the imported cases are continuing to rise due to the large numbers of returning Singaporeans and despite our best efforts to isolate these cases to ring-fence any new clusters that pop up the risk of local transmission world rise as we have more important cases so we have to take seriously the measures to protect ourselves our family members and the people around us then that's why we say safe distancing is very important in order to minimize our social activities and contexts so that we can do our part to slow down the spread of the virus we introduced a series of measures for safe distancing last Friday they have progressively been implemented adjustments are indeed taking place I think if you go around if you go out you will now see that public venues are less crowded roads are less crowded but the adjustments are taking place too slowly the virus is not going to wait for us it is continuing to spread it is circulating in our population and anytime you can get an outbreak it is of great concern that you still hear stories of people gathering together are you still here anecdotes of people gathering in clubs in this course where there are large social gatherings where which can easily become super spreader events and then another cluster will break out after that so we have to make decisive moves and we are making the site more decisive moves today we are as you would have seen in the statement going to limit gatherings outside of work and schools to ten percents or fewer and ensure that physical physical distancing of at least one meter can be achieved in settings where interactions are non transient so with that as a guiding principle we will close all bars and entertainment venues like nightclubs discos cinemas theaters and karaoke outlets where there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time we will put in place restrictions on other public venues like retail malls museums and attractions where the contact is more transient these venues may remain open but with additional restrictions we will continue to keep open food and beverage venues but again with restrictions which we have already introduced namely to have sufficient separation between cables but now we will also restrict the groups of diners to be 10 persons or fewer now we will suspend all center-based yueshen and enrichment activities and classes because this again is an activity that has lots of mingling between students and we have to reduce such activities we will suspend all religious services and congregations we were canceled defer all events and mass gatherings regardless of size and we advise all Singaporeans to avoid holding or participating in social events or gatherings involving more than ten percents at any one time this would include private celebrations like birthdays and weddings these measures were all take effect from the 26th of March two three five nine Thursday night two trephine meaning from Friday onwards and we expect these measures to be in place until 30th of April so about a month or two incubation cycles but it may be extended if the situation does not improve alameen just summarized the spot in mandarin and say a few words well thanks in wanting to see me pooja panty portion Amenti anxious any silly since washer so CN solo

what Singapore thousand poop en tant Himanshu pa da Jia tomorrow woman's higher cannon TNT tli Cho chikun y ND for sure the condensing so these are on the title measures that we were put in place in order to minimize the risk of local transmission they are necessary measures and we hope Singaporeans take these measures seriously our key message to everyone does now Minister GaN advise the elderly to stay at home but really our key message to all Singaporeans --is stay at home as much as you can let me go out if you need to work go to school go out for essential tasks but otherwise stay at home reduce your social gatherings and all other activities for the next one month it's only by all of us reducing our activity level and the intensity of our context that's the only way where we can significantly reduce the chance of this virus spreading further in our community so this is a collective endeavor and we need Singaporeans to really take this task seriously beyond the spread of the virus within the community we know that many Singaporeans are concerned about returnees coming back and the numbers as we have highlighted are rising and amongst them you will always have a proportion who are you you see you will see some who are infected and because the number of returning is arising the basis hi so you are seeing more and more imported cases among among the returnees the UK and the US account for the larger share of imported cases so far and we do expect more Singaporeans and Singapore residents to come back from these two countries in response to the lock downs that have been imposed in these places the current arrangement for UK and u.s. returnees are that they all have to fulfill a 14-day stay home requirement in their place of residence most all of them would typically do so at home and then they find a separate room to self isolate from their family members the current arrangement has works relatively well in fact we have a few cases who have been confirmed cases from the returnees who are on stay home notices but so far none of them have gone on to infect their family members which means that everyone is taking the precaution seriously they are truly self isolating at home and even keeping a distance from their family members which is good but we understand that family members are still worried Singaporeans are still worried because of the large numbers and there is always a risk that infection can happen to a next person to somebody in close proximity so we are taking additional precautions even on that front and we will now put in place a new arrangement we are working with hotel operators to provide dedicated facilities for all returnees from America and Europe and UK to serve the 14-day stay home requirement so they will fulfill this in separate facilities namely hotels which we will identify and set up work out suitable arrangements so each returning will then be isolated in their own room they will have mules provided throughout the 14 days and they will we will ensure that they avoid physical contact altogether with other individuals these are new requirements which will be put in place for all returnees from America and the UK from 25th of March two three five nine so for Singaporean parents whose children for example are coming back after this date there is no need to go to the airport to fetch them because we will work out transport arrangements from the airport we will send all UK u.s. returnees to these dedicated facilities where they will serve out fully they are 14 days self-isolation requirement for all returnees who are already in Singapore serving the shn at home and who may not have you know the best of arrangements at home may be the physical arrangements are not so conducive for serving out the 14-day self-isolation period and they wish to apply for these dedicated facilities they can do so and we will help them to move to these dedicated facilities as well all right so this is an additional precaution like I said the existing arrangement of staying at home is working well precautions I indeed being taken but we are also doing this additional step just to ensure that all returnees coming home particularly from these two countries where we see higher risk all such returnees will be upon arrival in Singapore directly transported to a separate hotel and where they were serve out there 14 days of isolation period in food now as a prop mark to give an update on the medical side thank you very much Minister the press statement from the Ministry of Health will be should later this evening and provide more details to the information I'm going to give you now as of the 24th of March 20 2012 noon we've had an additional 49 new cases and this brings our total number of confirm and verify cases to 558 after 49 new cases 32 of these cases were imported in other words they arose in travelers who came back to Singapore of this study 225 were in fact simple citizens or permanent residents and additional five were long-term visitor pass holders the countries in which these travelers had travel history - included the UK or which at least 14 of these cases had travelled to the UK five had travelled to the US and the remaining travelers had travel history to other countries including Malaysia France Indonesia and Australia and other countries as well of the 558 confirmed cases we have 156 of these cases have been discharged and this includes the two patients who have passed on 17 cases our patient side B ICU and they remain critically ill and our doctors and nurses continue to look after them at this stage minister referred to the community isolation facility and this is also announced in the press release that you have the committee isolation facility is located in one of our common quarantine facilities in Paris the details are provided and we have commenced transferring some patients across who have been discharged from the NCI D - this quarantine facility as of this evening there will be 15 such patients transferred across these patients are well clinically well and they do not actually require any significant clinical care they have fully recovered from the kovat 19 illness but we are unable to discharge them back to their homes in a community we cuz they have as yet not had their test results turn negative as such we have taken deliberately to continue to isolate them as a precautionary move but because they do not actually need hospital care in any of our hospitals we've made the decision therefore to transfer them to in this isolation facility and they will be tested regularly in the isolation facility until they fulfill the same criteria that we had previously used to discharge our patients once they fulfill the two consecutive tests at least 24 hours apart and if they continue to remain clinically well that's when we will allow them to leave the isolation facility and they can then return home back to their previous lives thank you very much let me just put in perspective as you can see the world the number of cases so all over the world is still rising they have not reached a peak yet and therefore we do expect to see that the number of cases here in Singapore to also remain high and over the next few weeks they will continue to grow we are likely to see more cases at the same time we want to put in place two very important measures first to continue to tighten our border control and Melissa Moore has just announced additional measures to ensure that SH and facilities are available for the returnees especially from UK and us as these two countries have the highest number of important cases to Singapore so we are managing them better in our dedicated facilities for shn this is a strengthened and tightened travel control including the reason that recently announced measures on subsidies for healthcare facilities medical life and integrated plans policy on those who are travelling against our travel advisory all these are stepped up measures on travel restrictions at the same time we also want to enhance our measures here in Singapore to further reduce the risk of local transmission there will be local transmission but we want to do what we can to reduce a number of lager transmission and many of these measures include a safe distancing which Minister Wang has mentioned by the end of the day these two measures are not enough because at the end every Singaporeans must be responsible for our own safe distancing for our own safety for our own social responsibility so that we ensure that we are safe and also ensure that those we come into contact with are safe this may include our loved ones our family members our friends so we must do all we can to change our habits to adopt safe social habits including safe distancing including personal hygiene and I think to be able if we work together we'll be able to manage this crisis and keep everyone safe so thank you very much question so they are pretty much effectively locked down so why don't you just go all the way shut schools call it a lockdown the way other countries around the world are doing in order to reduce the number of local transmissions people use the word lockdown very loosely these days and it means many things to different people we like to think of our strategies in different categories and based on risk at the very baseline level there are things that we ought to do permanently and even after kovat 19 is over and it will be over at some stage we have to raise we have to maintain these standards for example things like washing our hands regularly not using your hands to touch your face these are all things that hire better public hygiene standards these are all things that we think are important baseline permanent changes that's why we call we launched an SG clean campaign and even after kovat 19 these practices will be useful for countering any other infectious diseases as well beyond the baseline we are talking about a range of a series of measures that can be put in place throughout or precautionary measures that can be triggered as we say additional breaks as and when the need arises so we announced a series of measures last Friday around large scale gatherings for FMB outlets to have separated seating that's the next level of risk and that's all that's the next level of precautionary measures which we have introduced now we are putting in place a third category a higher category high of additional precautions including limiting limiting gatherings to less than 10 and even closing some of these venues where we think social gatherings are likely to be concentrated we've said that these measures will be put in place for a month and if these if these measures are effective for a month and it helps to break potential transmission chains we may then come back to tier 2 where we were last Friday if these measures are not effective we may continue them for another month we could escalate further escalating further will then go into the next level of measures which would include suspension of schools and workplaces and they have to go together because there is no point talking about it you can you can close the school but people need to look after children and if parents are working then very hard for them to look after the children and the children will be running around anyway in the community so closure of schools closure of work places other than essential activities that are the most drastic step if you will that's what I saw people call a lockdown and that set of drastic measures may well be necessary but again we do not have to move get there in one step and we can take a series of breaks and then if the situation warrants it then we may very well at the later stage we may very well have to do that that's why we are in urging all Singaporeans to take these measures seriously if we do these steps well then we may be able to get through this current very critical time of the infection cycle where we are seeing a rise in imported cases a very large wave of imported cases and very real risk of local transmission happening it has not happened yet in a widespread manner and so all of these measures are really pre-emptive and that perhaps is a bit of the challenge we have in getting people to take it seriously in many countries the various drastic measures have occurred after widespread outbreak thousands of cases or tens of thousands of cases we are we are not there and so perhaps there is a certain sense of things are okay in Singapore but the risk are very real and that's what we are trying to highlight and that's why everyone needs to take these measures seriously and it's only with everyone if all of us do our part that's the only way where we can have a chance of success with these strategies Minister safaris from Bloomberg a few questions actually how are you going to enforce this well the government resort to police officers which we have already used but will you go to the extent of rolling out your military personnel second question is you talk about suspension of schools as the next step but could you give like you know a a clear explanation of like you know what would be the turning point the stage where you will be forced to suspend or close schools is it when there's a breakout of you know widespread community transmission or when you see that you know the number of cases are still not coming down as it is right now and the third question is there's of course the debate going around the world about you know whether you should close schools open schools some countries did closed schools you Taiwan Australia still open schools is this the right approach for Singapore right now and is it a wise decision to remit to keep schools open in terms of enforcement we are serious about enforcing these requirements and we have multiple agencies that involve and that is the multi ministerial task force involving Ministry of Environment water resources which looks after our food outlets and police who look after the entity may licenses for the various venues I think their respective agencies will proceed to enforce these requirements where wherever the venules comes under their charge and we hope not on resort to they need to have a policeman or the army to be involved in the enforcement by necessary we will not hesitate to take enforcement action so we really want Singaporeans to understand that we are serious about implementing and enforcing these measures so we encourage them to work with us we hope we don't have to resort to enforcement actions against them and on the schools maybe mister Wong will talk about it we have always said you cannot you have to look at this based on the individual country's characteristics and how the infection is transmitting in that particular country and then also on the nature of this particular disease and then look at what are the best measures to put in place if you look at the evidence within Singapore we have shared this data before a large proportion of the local transmission takes place through social gatherings so we think it's an important as a effective way to reduce the like the vectors for local transmission therefore is to reduce social gatherings particularly in large numbers that's why we moved with what we did last Friday tackling large-scale events tackling F&B outlets and like I said some promising chose not promising some changes have already been made but we do need to go further and that's why we are moving with more decisive moves today do we need to take further steps well then the further steps if you think about all that we are doing what other things have not been done really the two places workplaces and schools those are the two other areas where activities are happening and even there we are not saying leave them alone but even within these two areas we are taking extra precautions schools have already suspended all the CCS and enrichment activities what places are pushing for telecommuting staggered hours and having people officers seat further apart so it's not business as usual at workplaces and schools we have taken precautions but these are the two areas where we have not suspended any activities as of now and so when will we trigger the the next circuit breaker if you will well it's not just as I've said before based on the total number of cases rising because you've got to drill down to the root cause and the underlying reasons for the cases if the cases continue to be returnees coming back largely and with all the precautions that we are taking now going beyond themselves isolating at home but even in dedicated facilities then the risk of local transmission will be reduced so the key consideration for us is not just the overall number of cases but the risk of widespread community transmission of the virus within Singapore and data and evidence for that would be based on the number of local cases the number of local infection clusters popping up and whether we are able to ring fans and contain each one of them as the Pappa if we can do so well through our contact tracing and quarantine efforts then it may well be that we could maintain at this level I mean in an in fact if the number of local cases come down we may step back to where we were before but if the number of cases local cases not not returning imported cases if a number of local cases continuing to rise we see new transmission chains forming and new infection clusters breaking out and we are increasingly unable to contact phrase and ring fans all of them because you're unable to detect how they are linked then at that point we may well have to move to the next step and take more drastic measures just to expand on minister's point about the schools just to clarify in fact the schools have not been resting on a they in fact have put in place carnival courting measures to safeguard their students so ministers alluded to the cessation of CC and enrichment activities that's also including inter-school competitions the classes are are now organized such that students within the class sit much more widely separated and before and there's also just one of the timetable so that the staggered recesses and less opportunities for interaction across the years just a minute minimize intermingling they've progressively moved more of the lessons into the online space as well as to encourage much more interactions on the existing online platforms that the schools use therefore instituted regular daily temperature checks and where necessary when there's a travel history overseas the student in fact is also placed on a leave of absence so these are calibrated moves that the Ministry of Education have placed put in place whereas the students in the schools and at this point in time our sessemann is that these measures continue to be appropriate but as the risk changes over time and if we assess that the risk to students changes then they may be a need for adjustment of that particular posture hi i'm kim kiyul from the asahi shimbun wanted to ask that the bus and entertainment venues will be closed for one month or maybe longer so will the government be giving out any financial assistance to the operators thank you we are mindful that kovat 19 outbreak has already impacted many businesses and the measures we need to take to protect ourselves and to save lives like the ones that we are introducing today will have more economic impact as well on many FMB outlets on the entertainment venues that have to be suspended so these are all considerations that the government is taking into account when it designs the second package of measures which the PM hang will be announcing very soon in fact I think on Thursday this week so much reporters to be patient by Thursday we will share more details on the package but I think suffice to say that the MTF them ministry task force has provided inputs to the Ministry of Finance with regard to the impact of this the measures that we are introducing and the measures that we have are planning so there are mindful of the possible impact working out the package which will be announced on Thursday hi I'm Sami from The Straits Times so bath and entertainment venues will be closed what about James and for example yoga studios and also because it takes a few hours to get the results of the tests to see if you have the virus those who are being tested are apparently being caught to go home first and then if they have it they were set an ambulance to pick them up why not just ask them to stay there or at the facility and wait for the results because you know when they take the taxi sometimes you know they come into contact and also there's there was a preschool teacher who tested positive and the school closed only for a day for disinfection whereas in pass churches were closed for two weeks and then after that they closed for good so what is the SOP on this thank you thank you maybe our premortal elaborate on this I'll talk a little bit about the processes associated with testing which which is a question you've asked at this point time when we have performance what tests it takes several hours before the results come comes out and we advise people who have been swap tested then to go home and while they are waiting for the test results to isolate themselves and not go into crowded areas engage in a lot of travel outside their home and the purpose of which is to make sure that if those test results then come back positive then there's no risk of exposure to many other people we have considered whether or not we should allow people what's off tester to wait around at the facility for example the clinic or in the context of the airport stay around until those results comes out but we are mindful the fact that if there are many people being swap tested then that in fact then proves to be a risk in itself because you might have people then congregating gathering or waiting for their test results so on the balance of weighing that particular risk versus the advising them tend to go back we think it's it's in fact more prudent to let them go home and wait for the results and when we notify them of the results then we'll inform them whether they need them to be recalled back to provide them them with the ambulance that brings them then into the hospital for further treatment you asked another question about the why school would close what day we actually assess each individual case on the basis of the the the the specific details associated with that particular case and where there is in fact no risk of exposure to students in the school other staff members in the school there is no concern that we then subsequently have about a risk of spread in that particular setting and this may be for example because a pillar student or staff member might have been on leave for a period of time before he or she became symptomatic and then subsequently came to attention was diagnosed to have Co V nineteen the concern of infection spread with jelly's be speaking be around a pure time when he or she was symptomatic perhaps the day before but if he or she was never in the school during that period of time there is no risk and therefore there's no routine requirement for the school and to close and even the close for 14 days but as a precautionary measure the staff in the school are concerned about the well-being of the students and to provide a further assurance to parents who otherwise would be bringing their children back to the school many of them may be taking a decision then to at least close to school for day to carry out deep cleaning activities within the school itself to give a further assurance that in fact the school remains a safe place for the students then to come and let me explain why the schools are closing just for the HS for cleaning it's not actually requirement the public health perspective otherwise for him to close Thank You Maya Catania from Nikki you I think I heard you had a 49 new cases and out of which 32 were imported so there were 17 locally transmitted that numbers seem to be higher compared to the last few days is this a concerning level that in your opinion and also another question is workplace and in school apart the commercial activities commercial commercial activities like shopping malls shops you have which you have introduced that very strict restriction but you still keep it open why is that you know with a very limited number of the businesses is it is it so important to keep it open awesome Minister want to talk about a shopping malls we've got to the local numbers I also asked prop muck to elaborate later generally we watch the number as a trend so sometimes goes up sometimes goes down so that today we have a total of 17 13 13 I see a tunneling Z unlinked between out of the 17 local cases 13 as we are still continuing with the contact tracing some of them may have been would have been that link would have been found in time to come because these are just cases as of noon today so we are still continuing with contact tracing but we are concerned that the numbers are high and we will need to watch the number over the next few days to see whether the trend is sustained whether if it is sustained at the high level or is it going up even higher or is it coming down so I think we will need to continue the monitor we shouldn't be complacent and even is low number it is also no reason to be complacent because it's to a large number the rest of the world and the reason partition and the recent local transmission is still there and that is why we are stepping up these travel restrictions as well as local transmission prevention including a safe distancing so maybe ask further details will be provided in the press team and I would refer you those to those specific details when the press statement actually comes out but ministers are correct that we continue to be very vigilant looking at each of these cases all cases where we cannot immediately link to another case for example this is a husband-and-wife situation you know where it's quite easy to demonstrate a link very quickly but if we're not able to do so all such our cases would then be preliminary classified as unlinked and then we commence epidemiological investigations to determine whether or not they in fact had exposure to other confirmed cases whether there's a link in fact with other cases or clusters that sometimes it's a bit of time but once the investigation is complete and we can establish such a link these are link cases then get re categorized into a different category for example one that's linked to an individual case or cluster that may be present there are cases where that it takes a lot longer it's quite it remains challenging to establish a link but we nonetheless do our best to try and establish that and as you know we have done that after many many weeks through different test modalities we've used including serological testing so while the numbers are higher today compared to the preceding few days it is a concern because you know watch it closely but it's still too early to determine whether this now reflects a change in the situation in Singapore whether or not this means now that we'll have an increase in committee spread it's always a possibility but we think that's a bit premature to jump to that particular conclusion just yet we will track this look at this more closely and then we will perhaps give you some updates in the future press conference well our consideration for places like retail malls and attractions are that very often people who go there do not have close contacts with one another these are transient contacts so you go in a family you go to a zoo you go to a mall you buy something you have a meal and you rarely get into close contact with other people provided that place is not crowded if that place is very crowded then yes you may well be you know in close proximity to others so the first requirement is that these places be the retail more an attraction has to limit the number of people based on a criteria with highlighted so that you reduce crowdedness you reduce congregations of people so they cannot do things like have sales and have bazaars within the mall where large crowd together but the malls have different shops they have FMV outlets where people still need to eat they have pharmacies there where people may well when want to buy medical supplies so they have a range of shops and you know families may want to go as individuals or in small groups just to go and access these supplies to buy essential items and to eat for that matter so we won't stop that right or even if a family chooses to go to a zoo its outside and you know just to enjoy some free time and get out of cabin fever I think it's to be encouraged so long as a place is not crowded we are not allowing for close proximity laws context I think these places can remain so the rules are quite strict the retail malls and the attractions have to abide by the rules and if they do not if they are unable to then indeed we may very well close these venues will take two to three more questions please thank you he I from Joppa here's a few questions so can we understand which hotels are set aside for this SH and facilities for UK and US attorneys what's the capacity like do they have to pay for it second question so those um who still insist the positives they have to pay their own hospitalization fees so can we get an understanding of how much was the range of this fee like yeah I understand that it varies but can we get a reference oh people don't know how much they have to pay question so the facilities that close down does it include on casino music schools places like this yeah and last one how many more Singaporeans are we expecting to return back to Singapore yep thank you first question on which hotels I don't have the specific hotels now we can put let you know where they are but they will be all over Singapore in order to accommodate the US and UK returnees because we are talking about presently from the US and UK 1200 a day a day staying for 14 days so that's a large figure right and we will have to go to other hotels fortunately they do have bait spaces now and we will have to work out the arrangements beyond providing bait spaces it's also important to ensure adequate security arrangements because we do want these returnees to stay in their rooms throughout the 14-day period they shouldn't be outside at all so working out not only with the arrangements of the hotels but also with other operators like providing security and ensuring that the transport arrangements from airport to hotel so all that is being worked out and we will do this without requiring the returnees to pay right so this will be provided for them the second question is on casinos and music schools the schools because again we have said this is to ssin and Richmond our ting music schools music schools would fall in that category and so they will have to be suspended casinos were falling the more in the category of attractions but again I don't they will have to decide based on our new criteria and very strict criteria they may well decide that it it's very hard to sustain an operation of this criteria and they may wish to curtail some of their operations I don't know but that's up to them to decide right but they fall in that category of attractions right so whether or not they wish to open it's up to them your third question was charges for no hospitalization yeah we don't have the data on the hospitalization costs presently with us today we'll look at it and see whether or not as we can release that figure to you but we don't have it today so I can release it to you more no one can tell I mean we as I said today's figure is thousand two hundred US UK combined it may well be that this is the wave that we have seen and then the people have already decided those who was there was there those who are coming back will come back within a day or two and then the figure what taper off or it may well be that if the situation in the US UK continues to escalate more people may choose to come back we do have a lot more people still in America and UK a lot more whether students or people who have Singaporeans who are working there so there is still a lot outside in these two countries whether they will return we don't quite have a sense yet and but over time if as more of them contact MFA and our missions abroad they give us an indication then perhaps we will have a better sense so MF is also helping us to make that assessment across all countries so we know that content to us while UK you I don't have the figure with me now I'm just in from the today I'm just asking about the stay home notice I think we release talks about the enhanced penalties for these notices about what are the penalties before today like what penalties were there for people who breach the still notice what fines were there before this $10,000 maximum finder was announced the these penalties have always been there this have not changed so we have this is not an enhanced penalty today we are just reinforcing and highlighting the fact that these penalties have always been there including imprisonment sentence potentially for egregious offenders so what we are doing is we are continuing to step up enforcement we have always been doing enforcement but true true remote tech through the use of remote monitoring through spot checks but we are stepping it up and we are putting in place enhance enforcement's so whoever is flouting shn requirements the if they are caught we will not hesitate to prosecute and to apply these penalties we'll take the last question please high roof of a new paper and sorry couple questions one of them is on the community isolation facility just wondering if is doing me stuff differently from a non mode gqf given that they are recovering patient still in wouldn't be their last any question is I think previous asked about gyms and yoga studios and exercise facilities what about them and the last one is uh given the researchers on the guy drinks and stuff I'm gonna qualities me for political activities coming going forward la yeah especially I meet people sessions or you know just meeting the copy residents there nothing yeah thank you thank you on the CIFS facility I think Kenneth can elaborate we are going to step up in terms of the infection control because as you pointed out this I in fact that patients although they are recovering but they as they still carry virus in them we allow them to recover in these facilities so that we can preserve the capacity in the hospitals from people patients there are more sick and require higher level of medical care and therefore in the CIA facilities we have a stepped up measures for infection control and there's also some minimal medical staff there will be they will look after them including taking swaps to test them and and as well as provide us some basic treatment you should they should they need the medical service services yes actually the CIF is a repurposed common quarantine facility and we have dedicated this common quarantine facility exclusively for these cases that we've been discharged from the hospital there's no mixing of these people with people that previously had been on quarantine and then being looked after within these or housed within these quarantine facilities so there's no mixing it's just these people were been distracted I've been transferred out from the hospitals the staffing for the , the community isolation facility is identical therefore to the quarantine facility with respect to the staff that are containing housekeeping functions security for a place making sure that the utility is run so that hasn't changed that's still the same we have a small team from one of hospitals that has come in to provide with advice to the operators of the facility to give them also an assurance to provide them with some backup in terms of what they need to do make sure that the infection control measures remain robust they've been doing this when they were looking after persons under quarantine those measures in fact remain the same now that the facility is now repurpose as an isolation facility this small team do not need effectively to provide any medical care because these are all well people when they were discharged they were clinically well and while they were still in the hospital they in fact did not require any specific nursing or medical care at all the only difference was they need the tests to be done and this test will be done once every few days there's a team therefore it goes to the isolation facility to perform the swab tests they bring the swabs back I will test it and then the test results are reviewed by the doctors back in the hospital for decision to make whether to keep that person in the isolation facility still or to allow that person then to leave the isolation facility in order to make sure that this these people are in the isolation facility and they respect the rules they have to stay there they shouldn't be i isolating they are served the equivalent of a quarantine order when they are discharged so therefore there is in fact a legal requirement for them to stay where they are and when they are already there fit to be discharged that quarantine order is lifted or isolation order technically is lifted and then they allow them to leave the isolation facility and return home the question of gyms and other activities I think it's important to go back to the basic principles of why we are doing this our key objective is to reduce social gatherings and to keep them if even there is a grouping of people to limit them to less than 10 people and that's why if you look at the places where we've decided ought to be closed these are places like bars and detainment venues nightclubs discos we we think these are places where it's very very hard to avoid very close social gatherings so have to close for a month eating places yes they gather but people do need to eat right so rather than close all together we keep them open the FMB outlets but we say each dining group less than ten persons within the family so it's you already are exposed to one another less than ten and then tables are separated and if there is an FM be out that has you know very often it's very hard to draw these clear lines because you have FMB outlets that are like a bar they have live entertainment but it's so long as there is a live entertainment there's live music are okay these have to cease you just run the FMB because people do need to go out to eat or all they can order takeout but within the FMV venue the groups have to be less than ten and tables have to be separated so along the same principle gyms yoga studios we are not closing them right we they are not venues where you see natural social gatherings of people all the time you have individuals who just go to the gym and they exercise on their own but we will uphold the principle so if there are venues they are not able to do so then we will have to shut them but if they are venues they can operate while upholding these social safe distancing principles then yes certainly they can continue to operate and in the same way all political parties will have to adjust their political activities in line with these principles right we have highlighted the guidelines and the precautions that have to be taken so all organizers all companies including or all organizations including political parties we're therefore have to adjust accordingly ",True,True,False,False

About For Food's Sake! 3: COVID-19 is the worst crisis to hit the global food system: farmers saw their produce left to rot, shortages sparked panic buying in the supermarkets, and thousands of restaurants closed for good. While the food disruptions have eased, COVID-19 has woken us up to the many things that are wrong from farm to fork. With his own restaurant business on the line, Chef Ming Tan goes on a mission to find out what needs to change, and uncovers a system ripe for a shake-up.

*Correction:
In the programme, the narration wrongly stated that “restaurants were ordered to close on 4 April” during Circuit Breaker. To clarify, during circuit breaker in 2020, restaurants were ordered to stop dine-in service but could remain open for delivery service. The order was announced on 3 April and implemented on 7 April 2020.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] last year this time i was traveling the world investigating food mysteries disappearing fish in indonesia a butter crisis in france and a menacing pest in thailand now the only traveling i do is this food deliveries this is worse than anything i've ever seen okay okay enjoy thank you my business is shut we're screwed kovit 19 is the most disruptive force the global food industry has ever seen the whole supply chain is disrupted in the u.s quite a number of the factories had to close because of kovit so it's a major 30 drop from farm to table it is a wake-up call for all of us in this business intensive farms are potential breeding grounds for pathogens it's like a meteor that came along [Music] i just wet myself oh no oh no in this series i investigate how the pandemic is a wake-up call wait wait and what must change i've gathered up chefs from all around the world the restaurant industry is destroyed we have to do something we have to survive also as a restaurant the pandemic has forced us to re-evaluate how food gets to our table together we're on a mission to find out open the lips of the mussels that looks a bit rude ilg how we can turn things for the better yeah you can do looking for two and then the rest occasionally but is it good i just want to address you guys um for a couple minutes this surreal telling you guys this water right we're going to be shutting here for the next 30 days for the foreseeable future until the situation clears up okay unless so you cut everything off that section right this was the night before i shut down my restaurant i was a bundle of nerves i'm guessing a lot of cancellations do you know the numbers and how many today we probably lost around 60 of them i'm going to add a clams and a bikini thanks for supporting us for this last night so we're going to be shopping tomorrow it was a decent last night of service but it was also nerve-racking i didn't know what my future as a restaurateur was going to be and if there was even one to begin with are we really honest with you guys i don't know whether or not my younger staff understand the implications of what's happening right now but there are massive changes happening to the full world massive layoffs everywhere [Music] since i was a child i've always loved food and at 19 i knew i wanted to make cooking a lifelong career this is me as head chef at lola my big break how many people get to manage an entire team at age 25 and in the last couple of years i've been running various businesses a japanese eatery private dining an asian grill and an upmarket restaurant last year's revenue was the highest ever i had great hopes for 2020 i never expected what was to come [Music] when the government ordered restaurants to close on april 4th singapore's vibrant dining scene came to a grinding halt this is what i had to do 5 45 actually are you able to head out with it 5 45 10 okay yeah center road okay ken and we're off at this point i suppose you can say that i'm a chef business owner and a delivery man as well it's a bit surreal yes that this is now the way to send food out to people and it's definitely far less efficient than a restaurant where you have guests come to you and then they sit down so what to do i don't even know if our restaurants can sustain themselves over the next two three weeks between january and july 1 242 fmb outlets shuttered permanently including this two decade old dining fixture modestos as a student i used to come here to watch football and muncheon pizza i am quite emotional now because i had good memories here have you run the gamut of emotion knowing that you are shutting down an institution that's been here for 23 years yes i have cried a fair bit in two months our shock lost hundreds of thousands of dollars i call it actually a darwinian extinction event and it's like a meteor that came along and i think any of us who were fragile just got crushed and why were we fragile the last few years in our industry you will know very well the the two forces which which worked so strongly against us labor costs have gone up exponentially when we first started this restaurant foreign worker levy was 50 100 200. now it's 600 700 800 and ren also has gone up like double as well when you talk to the reit it's always no they're totally not interested to hear the word rent decrease and they would rather take the risk of leaving a place empty than to give a sitting tenant a break what do you think covey exposed about some of the deficiencies in a restaurant of this type could anything have been different sure we were too big the rent was a huge weakness turnover is vanity profit is reality but cash flow is the only necessity so while most businesses would have four to six months of cash flow restaurants usually operate on two which means that if you don't turn in any profit for two months you're in trouble [Music] the thing is we are not alone is that water or wine water water wine after three for the first time in history restaurants all around the world are going through the same challenge together i am reaching out to some of my culinary heroes eric repair legendary chef from the united states margarita forest named asia's best female chef in 2016 and viki ching rising star in hong kong's fine dining scene i want to know how they are coping how has revenue been affected at this point well the restaurant industry is obviously destroyed for one simple reason is that we are closed our goal for the moment is to try to generate at least enough sales so that we're not forced to retrench in new york operating costs are enormous the rents are very very big you have to have an enormous cash flow i've seen a lot of restaurant go in hong kong the rents are absolutely not cheap this coffee 19 crisis it's something that we have never seen [Music] so it's pretty clear running a successful restaurant anywhere in the world is a costly affair with potentially low returns consistently executing great food means hiring great cooks that's 30 percent of our revenue and then there is the cost of raw ingredients that can easily approach 30 percent of revenue rents can come up to 25 then of course there is equipment utilities and marketing even for the very best in the industry profits can be less than 10 percent [Music] in 2018 the average profit margin in singapore's restaurants was 5.5 imagine for every dollar you spend at my restaurant i only make about 5 cents but in spite of the long hours tight cash flow at thin margins an average of 808 new restaurants enter the market every year nice okay this is a safe distance i think i think saturday devito is a legend with 22 years of industry experience and the michelin star under his belt he runs five iconic italian restaurants in singapore do you think the restaurant seed in singapore is oversaturated i believe so we've seen uh way too big of an expansion over the past few years the entry level to operating this business is too low and the standards are not there also anybody can do fmb any customer can come in and talk to my manager to my chef and take them and open a restaurant tomorrow morning nothing is stopping them from doing that as long as they have some funds to do it they will increase your average rental they will have to pay your staff a little bit more to steal them from you and they end up setting up something that may not last even the five years is sustainable there is a bit too much of of the same out there do you believe that this pandemic represents a wake-up call for the entire restaurant industry i totally believe that the way people eat how they eat where they eat that is changing perhaps it's time for us to ask how many restaurants do singapore really need anyway now during this period plenty of restaurants are gonna shut their doors and as a chef this is tough to see it's hard but maybe it's about time right for the rest of us still weathering this stone maybe it's time we took a good hard look at what needs to change and if we need to trim some fat a month and a half into circuit breaker and this list has made its rounds on social media it hit home my livelihood is built on a very fragile foundation and we're off since january singapore's vibrant dining scene has lost over a thousand fmb outlets and counting this is a salad and dessert i was still soldiering on doing deliveries [Music] but one day at the end of a particularly grueling day of food deliveries it hit me i was barely keeping my head above the water [Music] so the biggest challenge here was having 70 80 percent of our sales just evaporate overnight you can't sustain the teams like that can't sustain the business like that it's been terrible i'm exhausted my team's exhausted i don't want to be just another statistic i had to get creative if your restaurant doesn't evolve there may be not much space for you there tomorrow for years the government has called for the f b industry to rely less on manpower and more on automation they've used the carrots by offering incentive schemes and the stick foreign labor restrictions that's a huge hit for restaurants because it is hard to find singaporeans willing to work in fmb restaurants are all about providing an amazing experience here's your menu sir thank you very much an amazing service requires amazing well-trained staff that doesn't come cheap and it means having enough staff for key peak periods because each of us has a specific role it's costly and compared to other industries really inefficient red wine for you sir thank you very much [Music] and often we end up being over staffed in the least busy period would you like to hear about our specials today sir [Music] before covet 19 i hired between 25 and 30 people in my restaurants including part-timers and foreign workers it makes up about a third of my total cost and i wonder are there ways to be less labor-intensive so i've arranged to meet ella please enjoy according to her creator keith tan ella is a state-of-the-art robotic barista she makes exactly the same quality as our top barista but at four times the speed so would you like to try it out i'll have a cappuccino sure confirm she has a voice yes she's telling you that she's preparing the coffee now what's interesting here is you can order another one at the same time at the same time cappuccino with order number 475 is on the way your cappuccino all right order 474 this is my fresh cappuccino there's froth on top it looks good smells good according to keith ella can make around 200 cups of coffee per hour it's impressive but isn't she just a fancy vending machine ella can be repurposed to do other things so suppose today our system is now preparing coffee iced coffee iced cocktails in the future we might want to turn her into cooking some food she's fast and she's versatile but can she really make a better tasting cup of coffee than me you know what i mean we should just test this out okay sure let's do it the rules are simple ella and i are making three coffees and who scores higher in terms of speed and taste wins two caps two cappuccinos one latte wow this is terrible three two one let's go move the top left top left top left press [Music] let's go uh milk milk [Music] ah stop stop stop stop okay uh now i need to watch this nozzle [Music] this is a this is that's supposed to be a latte please enjoy your cappuccino [Music] and then a cappuccino has the thing of [Music] powder [Music] please enjoy your cappuccino don't worry i'm sure the robot's not done already right okay okay okay no in uh uh how low it will start rinsing no wait don't rinse don't miss cancel no wait wait wait in a test of speed ella wins hands down okay order's done time stop okay it took you five minutes but it's not defeat not to me anyway they're still the blind taste test by a panel of three coffee lovers hi veronica hi can't wait to try this i marked my coffees as coffee eight ella's coffee is coffee beef i'm so anxious to find out what they think [Music] a seems to have more milk and better texture i prefer a yeah personal preference is latte [Music] i prefer cappuccino a this is a pure win for me me me pretty clearly right taste wise all the testers before my coffee uh upload i'll give it to you ella uh with your sleek shiny robotic metallic arm you were faster than me by a long shot uh it made me look like a snail like essentially so i win still meeting ella has been eye-opening [Music] i can even imagine deploying her to prepare ingredients or cook simpler dishes but with a price tag of 150 000 singapore dollars i don't think i can afford to have ella in my life right now [Music] but this is not the end of my quest for a more sustainable restaurant business other than manpower rental also takes a chunk out of my revenue which is why i am visiting my old friend douglas who recently took a huge gamble hey douglas hi this is good to see you what brings you here today what brings me here i'm here for a bowl of fish ball noodles [Music] hey one more fish inside one more 50 inside i want to miss that out the last time i visited him douglas's stall was a timber plus which is a hip food court catering mostly to office workers [Music] his sales dropped by 80 when the pandemic started because there was less and less of an office crowd so he packed up and moved to macpherson an area with a far older demographic surrounded by old residential blocks and industrial buildings very different from the hip food court douglas came from he'll save six thousand dollars of rent every year and he's got a space double the size of the previous one was this a calculated risk for you yes it is and has it worked out and benefited you during this period so i'm glad that we made that decision i was in timber for four years very happy that very nice place but again you have to be realistic is it it's not whether the place is nice for the customer they're very nice to you yeah so have you stayed at timber do you think you will be able to survive during this period before chelsea did okay when people start to work from home the business dropped by 30 to 40 percent kobe 19 won't disappear so quickly the environment is have changed the whole food industry will change and people calling for delivery or this is here to stay is that telling you or teaching you some lessons about where you need to go next if any anyone is looking to move to a new location you don't have to look for very expensive very luxurious people because you never know if you're going to succeed or not easy but it's less painful if the investment is smaller how have you benefited in a sense from this location during this period actually business have been better than when while we were at timber number one i think because people have been working from home so a lot of housing has stayed around this place so people come in go back in the f b industry one way to ensure a steady flow of customers is location but this comes at a hefty price rents in these places are sometimes up to sixty percent higher than in less desirable locations douglas has shown me that we should be rethinking what makes a great location and how this helps with financial sustainability but i wondered with more restrictions lifted and more people going back to their offices will douglas's gamble to move from a tech park to the residential heartlands pay off in the long run khatib is a residential area deep in the heartlands of singapore it's known for fish farms and housing estates it's 40 minutes to the city by train not exactly my first choice to set up a restaurant if i want walk-in customers i am puzzled why architect samsung invited me here to talk about fmb is this a mall uh no it's not a mall we are now at home team ns car tip so here is the main drop off porch straight away you see the restaurants or the full f b and then you take walk down further down and you can see the indoor adventure arena so there's a lot of activities so people get excited and people get engaged in this space so what new norm are you trying to establish here it is really forming this relationship with the community in order to sustain the fmb that is why you need to decentralize these people into this community be events or special bespoke dishes for that particular positioning and i really think it's about contributing back to the community uh by a form of charity so only then i think the sustainability of fmp will happen in a nutshell what samsung is advocating is for restaurants to be a bigger part of the local community so that in times of need the community can rally to ensure restaurants in their area stay in business now this could be a way for restaurants to stay sustainable but some businesses are going the opposite way they disappear physically from the community all together hi ian hey hi ming hi hi i hope you're hungry for some spicy mala stuff ian than's company runs 20 food outlets across singapore from thai food to healthy salad bowls do we call the ambulance but this new venture is unlike the others [Music] lady guatemala is a virtual brand that we created just for grab kitchen what is the difference with running a you know brick and mortar store and a sort of online brand in a space like this to run a restaurant the rent in singapore is extremely expensive and running a virtual brand in the in the cloud kitchen the rent is much lower at the same time when you run a virtual brand you don't need a front counter there's no cashier there's no waiter or someone to clear the place for you lady boss mala is among 22 fmb brands you can find at the new central kitchen launched by grab known as cloud kitchens these are large shared facilities where many different restaurants can prepare food for takeout and delivery grab kitchen hill view is singapore's largest and newest cloud kitchen [Music] as we walk we are actually going slowly towards the pickup area for customers dilip rosanali agreed to show me around what he calls the future of dining as long as they arrive here for dining customer or takeaway customer they can order anything from any of these kitchens absolutely yeah first try now dylan i'm looking at this like lovely wall here with all these brands right lady boss mala that one just burned my tongue hence all these burning questions for you i see you've got five by five so that's 25. this is the maximum number of brands you can run from this space well no not really there's no limit to it do you think clown kitchens are here to stay i do think yeah what we do is we minimize a lot of the fixed costs which is the rent and we go into a model where labor is not going to be as intensive also that cost bucket is going to go down because essentially you're not servicing your dining lobby right you're only focusing on what you do best you cook and that's it and that benefits all the merchants so all in all it makes it for a less volatile model even though we have a dining it's not optimized for dining so the rent is low with this we really dearest the venture for merchants that's exactly what it is but what if i didn't want to give up my shop front what else could i do this time the inspiration came in the form of crispy pork belly one restaurant owner took a huge leap and as a result he has managed to sell over 10 000 pieces of pork belly in two months frozen pork belly roasted pork belly is a well-loved dish among every singaporean but it's actually it takes about three days to actually cook a perfectly well pork belly very time consuming super so what we did was minimize and we cut short all the things that you need to do long before the pandemic dylan and his partner kent realized that fmb businesses couldn't rely solely on having customers come to them they wanted to bring food to the customers not typical delivery fare but finicky restaurant food that typically wouldn't survive travel and after three years in a food lab they created a pork belly dish that you can make at home all you need to do is roast it for 25 minutes and it won't taste any different from what you get at dylan's restaurant the key thing to pork belly right is drying out the skin getting it very crispy and then keeping the meat moist sorry i'm trying to be a bit nerdy with the food here but this is not easy for people to do at home even in restaurants it's a complex time taking process yes are you very sure this can happen [Music] before you cut it right give me some music all right you ready firstly crispy skin secondly all even all right it smells so good as you can see me this is what it looks like before this is a frozen frozen version right yeah please go ahead completely rock solid sealed up no air so this is the before and what you're having is the after rock solid so this keeps for how long are you can keep up to a year and i just take this chuck in the oven for instructions oven air fryer coaster okay the proof is in the pudding i'm gonna try this now it's tender it's juicy and the skin looks nice and even golden crispy thank you awful to me this is damn good thanks man it's evenly seasoned this is that brining stuff do you mention this now correct and it's incredible this was heated from this yep in a span of just 25 minutes i'm fascinated by dylan's idea of bringing convenience food to another level [Music] according to a nielsen report from 2018 when it comes to demand for food delivery or pre-portioned meal kits their use in singapore is 11 higher than the global average [Music] i think this idea is worth exploring pre-cooked gourmet meals can create a new revenue stream for me can order it online you can warm it up and then eat it anytime you want this also means i can utilize my team better in order to prevent us from getting into that bottleneck of sending food out in the middle of a peak period of time these meal kits need to be chilled and ready for people to order any time of the day and store in the fridge but first i need to test what food works for these meal kits so i prepared three dishes tacos right let's just check on that crispy batter feels crispy enough for me i'll wrap each ingredient separately for freshness and then deliver it to your home all you need to do is warm it up and assemble fresh tacos crispy skin all done in under 15 minutes my second idea was the quintessential singapore classic hockey and me with a twist the core to this dish is creating a noodle pancake that is going to have bits of charred crispy edges a bit of smokiness [Music] and i'm also not sure how i'm going to be able to guarantee a bit more flavor because there's no charring that can occur at home unless you have like a wok and a big ass fire and you're like frying it noodle pancake for hokkien me kids [Music] okay i'm quite satisfied with this [Music] my final idea for a restaurant-style convenience meal kit was baked sushi rice yes you heard that correctly to make it suitable for heating up in the oven i didn't include any raw fish instead i used a generous amount of crab meat smoked salmon and flavored mayonnaise why sushi rice there is this very fun aspect to baked rice caramelization browning on top the flavors are very fun [Music] in this bad boy it goes thank you i'll see you in just a few minutes water smells really good that belly took four minutes as a meal kit these dishes will be vacuum sealed and packed into a box all people at home need to do is warm them up and garnish the food [Music] as you can see i'm quite pleased with my dishes [Music] but the real test is still ahead of me [Music] let's see what some people say if i send it to them i have no idea what that is it's not hawking me enough there's no crisp people on that i feel a bit cheated [Music] yes sushi rice tacos which are vacuum packed cucumber tobiko so this is how it looks like i've spent the last three weeks trying to make these gourmet diy meal kits oh my god it's a lot more difficult than it appears because it needs to keep in the fridge for up to a week [Music] and the moment you warm it up and assemble it it must taste like a restaurant quality dish i've prepared three dishes hokkien me a set of tacos and the sushi rice bake i've sent them to three tasters sounds good already [Music] well there's a good mixture of yellow and a white thick bihu noodle so that's great she's gonna be more flippy in his pan though okay okay she got it her frying pan was quite high sided though [Music] that's that's a little bit liquidy this looks like a soup green [Music] there is a lack of wok hey maybe it's the way i cooked it that's a little bit frustrating i have no idea what that is but let's do it cool let's try put it in your mouth casey you know you want a bit more of the topical you want a bit more of the tomato you know you can and then you're soggy ah yeah i should have choice as well made it very clear you know it goes my seaweed sheets i'm convinced now are too large this is something i definitely need to change immediately it's not supposed to be soggy it seems to be crisp this was definitely my favorite it's tokidon toki bait which is the sushi rice even though it was already pre-fried and reheated it's still really really nice it still has that nice crunch the feedback was unexpected but useful i made so many tweaks and released the hawking me as my first meal kit for sale it helped to bump up my sales by 30 percent [Music] so while dining is now allowed again in singapore i'm keeping the meal kids in my menu after all restaurants are no longer what they used to be social distancing means we can only accommodate a fraction of the diners we used to have it's bad news for our revenue [Music] but i heard some restaurants overseas have found an opportunity to stand out in this new situation there's this place that's fully embraced social distancing and they've turned that into a unique exciting dining experience unfortunately i'm not able to travel there so i asked a friend to help me out [Music] renee park is an accomplished chef and tv host you may say that he's a slightly taller dutch version of myself [Music] renee i hear you have a really nice lunch plan today where are you off to well ming let me take you to a restaurant here in the center of amsterdam that i frequently visit a lot of dutch restaurants are homely tiny places full of gazellehyde which means simple coziness and conviviality but with the need to keep a safe distance one restaurant is reinventing coziness [Music] the restaurant media mata eaton conceptualized quarantined greenhouses in may when amsterdam was still on lockdown hello there hello hi the top yes a little bit because we're gonna put them fresh now okay a distinct characteristic of the restaurant is the big greenhouse where they grow most of the produce that they serve hence they decided to create mini greenhouses for their customers to dine in a safe and creative solution even the staff cannot enter these mini greenhouses instead this is how they serve food yes if you place exactly perfect thank you [Music] with the cherries listen guys i've got such a terrible job okay isn't it terrible yeah i have to do this all the time tasting food tell me julia is this the the future of dining is this the new normal so i think it's uh it's good to like create those possibilities and see where they can lead to yes so this concept is working i mean isn't there any other restaurants maybe in other countries that will copy this well they could i think also like the nice message that we wanted to give is that we could inspire other people what these guys at mini medic are doing right now is they are turning something terrible something negative this whole virus thing that is all over the world they're turning it into something positive into a new concept so what i learned here is that new concepts are born based on something that's maybe negative correct i mean exactly i mean this is a completely new way it might work you have to go out from your comfort zone like you have to [Music] absolutely [Music] how are you how was your lunch you feel safe but it's also very comfortable and you have complete privacy it's a fantastic idea mediamatic might be the first restaurant in the world that turned pandemic into profit yet another example of how a wake-up call can spur innovation and creativity [Music] the pandemic was a long needed catalyst for change in the fmb industry it challenged mindsets and preconceptions of what a restaurant should be and it opened up avenues for innovation i'm prepared to follow the hard lessons that i've learned over the last couple of months and i hope others do too because there's no way forward unless we're flexible [Music] and we evolve [Music] you ,True,True,False,False

Although the country had pulled millions out of poverty only recently, it's now facing the dire prospect of witnessing millions being pushed back to the margins once again as a result of the pandemic. 
 
Can India deal with the dual onslaught of the pandemic and economic disaster at the same time? What more can it do to save millions from the brink of starvation and death?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",kovit 19 has sent india's once fast growing economy into a tailspin growth has plunged into negative territory and the covet infection numbers are still over 40 000 a day but the pandemic and the economic disruption have hit the poor the hardest the country have pulled millions out of poverty only recently but it's now facing the dire prospect of witnessing millions being pushed back to the margins once again suddenly you find that around 37 million people have fallen back into extreme poverty what are you going to do in the long term how closely we stick to our objective of reducing absolute poverty i think that remains an open question the situation is awful continues to be awful can india deal with the dual onslaught of the pandemic and economic disaster at the same time what more can it do to save millions from the brink of starvation and death [Music] this is barbita in the eastern states of assam it is also one of the country's most backward districts with a population of 1.6 million the annual flood havoc has caused severe hardship to the life of residents living in this village [Music] [Applause] but the cobit 19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown this year have made the difficult situation even harder to bear many families have been pushed to the brink as a result of the current public health crisis and the situation seems to be getting worse by the day thirty-five-year-old fulera begum now lives in barbata with her three children [Music] she used to live in kalija which is in another part of the district her husband was ill at that time so she sold their home to help pay for her husband's medical treatment she then moved to karabali char with her family about five years ago they took shelter on a neighbor's plot of land her life took a turn for the worse after her husband died suddenly just three years ago she then started working in an eatery in the nearest town to help raise her family single-handedly [Music] and two sons during the lockdown one of her daughters fell ill she took her to the hospital in the city but she couldn't afford the treatment that the doctors prescribed her daughter's illness became more complex after she contracted kovid after a long battle with the illness stretching over months her daughter died last month fullera could not even bring the body of her child back to the village due to the potential risks of exposure to the disease [Music] struggle reflects a much bigger problem facing india today first came kovid in january then came the sudden lockdown in march millions of hapless jobless workers started marching on india's roads and highways as the economy ground to a halt the heart-wrenching scenes unfolding across states sharply brought into focus the inability of the state machinery to deal with a crisis of mammoth proportions what could the government do should it have focused on controlling the virus or should it have moved towards opening the economy ignoring the virus rampaging across the nation in the end the government began opening up the economy in phases even as the virus kept spreading throughout the populist nation as a result thousands died from the virus and millions were pushed to the margins of extreme poverty and destitution there is no doubt that the economy has taken quite a hit like most other economies around the world as you know this is the biggest economic shock that the world has seen since uh the great depression and world war ii so here in india we have uh also been hit by this but then it shouldn't be surprising we um as we said right in the beginning we were going to prioritize uh lives over the economy at least in the initial phase when we were trying to work out uh how this pandemic was going to pan out because if you will remember we didn't really know how it was going to pan out so we did a very severe lockdown poverty has been a long term decline in india and particularly in the last decade or so it had come down quite sharply now obviously the present shock does cause disruption in that trajectory no doubt about that but i think what you will see is that we have worked very hard in the government to make sure that the poorest sections of society have indeed been cushioned let's not forget that we in india for the last six to seven months have been consistently feeding for free every month do you know how many people 810 million people 81 crore people have been getting free ration that is food grains wheat pulses dal chana for free the point is not just that the economy has gone down because of the pandemic it's also the policies that have been pursued by this present government in in india the modi government i think has been very myopic in such matters they have failed to see the situation that was created earlier pre-pandemic and then during the period of covert pandemic the world saw actually how millions how people lack slacks of people had to leave their place of work go back to their villages their home towns why because they were forced in a way the situation forced them number one the government was not able to take them into confidence give them the confidence that you can stay here you will be taken care of health-wise food-wise some money in their hands they were not able to take them give them that confidence it's not just migrant workers who have found their means of livelihoods suddenly vanishing poor people in the country's villages are also struggling hard to survive during the period valera was away in hospital with her sick daughter her other children were left alone at home but the villagers were kind and helpful and looked after the young children for months when their mother was away foreign the lockdown took away valera's job in the eatery kovid took away her daughter [Music] now volera hardly has any money to survive india has been battling hunger for decades in recent years it achieved high economic growth and succeeded in taking millions out of poverty but the battle is not even half won remains widespread and last year it still had 195 million people or 14.5 percent of the population malnourished will the economic contraction now push millions back into poverty maybe if this lockdown or pandemic situation was to prolong it will have some sort of dent but now the vaccine is just nearby and we're hoping and crossing finger uh for that uh and with that positive hope and the various level of progress is being made uh and and the right policies and program in place uh i feel very confident in the early days we did see uh overt forms of hunger but now what we are hearing from reports coming from the hinterland from from different places that people are actually sleeping hungry so it's extremely difficult people do not have enough ration people do not have livelihood and they do not have hope also in terms of revival of their livelihood and on top of all this the pandemic is is there the the health system is crumbling it is not being able to respond to the health crisis so it is an extremely grim scenario that created in the meantime the battle against poverty and hunger continues the government is coming out with more measures to alleviate people's misery but how much will these measures help people immediately who are facing starvation and death [Music] the pandemic and the lockdown dealt a hammer blow to all sections of society especially the poor already struggling on the margins before the virus struck they are now living from hand to mouth since the crisis has snuffed out their usual means of livelihood 52 year old hassan ali was a migrant worker in a brick kiln in spite of working 12 hours a day the money was hardly enough to pay for his daily needs let alone pay for his children's education to supplement his income he bought an electric rickshaw about a year ago which used to ferry passengers in the town but ali's plans to use the e-rickshaw and earn a decent income came crashing down following the nationwide lockdown foreign hassan ali's 15 year old son hafizuh rahman is studying in class 9. hafizur has to work on some days to earn money for the family and cannot go to school on other days he walks 10 kilometers to his school and back sometimes when he's lucky he hitches a ride on a friend's bicycle india [Music] the family now faces a grim situation nature played havoc along with the virus and lockdown to ruin whatever chances the family had [Music] logged in foreign foreign since the virus struck tens of thousands of migrant workers have lost their jobs in an economy struggling to survive amid the raging pandemic it shrank almost 24 in the second quarter one of the worst contractions among major economies millions of people are also expected to slip into extreme poverty with all sources of income drying up hafizor was driven to desperation looking for a job he and a few others from the village went to the neighboring states of arunachal pradesh to work in but what lay in store in the neighboring states was something no one had bargained for a month of absolute horror began hafizur and his team were forced to work under brutal conditions eat foods which were harmful to human health and drink contaminated water they also suffered from various infections caused by insect bites [Music] foreign the torture continued for a month it was back breaking work on an empty stomach from early morning till evening and foreign only much later did hafizu find out that they had been sold as modern day slaves for a total of 300 000 rupees or less than 6 000 singapore dollars and they were told they couldn't ever go back home india's worsening economic situation has led to an increase in trafficking activities targeting desperate families who need financial help uh foreign and the state police now he's back in his village but he can't go to school has no job and money he is on the brink of starvation he doesn't know where his next meal will come from and how he can provide for his family members who are all dependent on him hello despite the insurmountable odds and extreme hardships young hafizur is not willing to give up he has no choice since he knows he has to stand on [Music] hafizu's suffering is not a rare case of misery and exploitation the dwindling earnings of millions of others in the country have vanished following the lockdown and economic slump even on the outskirts of the country's financial capital mumbai tens of thousands of workers are sitting idle facing starvation and penury how long can they continue their struggle without any signs of an immediate economic revival a city of palms once called manchester of india hundreds of thousands of power looms dotted the lanes and by lanes of this congested town on the outskirts of mumbai the commercial capital of india millions of workers from across the country flock to the textile hub that contributes to roughly 60 of the total cloth production in the country and also around the same amount of fabric for exports but the constant hum of power looms has now mostly fallen silent over 40 percent of the looms are now closed and owners have sold thousands of others because they can't afford to run them anymore fifty-year-old shannon ahmed is one of them he has lived in the textile nerve center for more than two decades and owns 150 power rooms but today all his machines are lying idle since there are no new orders for his fabric foreign has been an integral part of the textile hub for more than a decade like millions of his colleagues chaudhary has also helped drive the textile boom in the city hailing from a village in the state of uttar pradesh 1700 kilometers away chaudhary set up home in the town dreaming of a better future his friends in the village had told him that he could pick up the skills and thrive in the vibrant city since the industry was growing at a fast pace and life had a lot of promise until about two years then in late march tordrey's world like that of millions of others collapsed after the lockdown was announced the power looms ground to a halt and chaudhary found it hard to even survive in the textile town initially the loom owner tried to help but all of chaudhry's meager savings ran out leaving him with no option but to make the hazardous journey back to his village it wasn't easy his village is hundreds of kilometers away from biwandi and there were no means of transport available chaudhry still set out on foot lockdown [Music] foreign [Music] it was certainly a tragedy mammoth proportions to see the pictures that all of us saw of people walking back to their source villages uh little children on on suitcases a young daughter cycling back her father on a bicycle these were absolutely devastating stories and and it is surprising that the government could not anticipate at least they could have given few days of preparation time for the lockdown once this started they could have at least started train services which they eventually did but it is surprising it is a huge policy failure on part of the government and i would say both union government and state governments let me tell you the ground reality i will repeat more than 5 000 special trains transported more than 25 million people that is 2.5 crore people at the cost of 5 300 rupees per head by giving them free ration food and supplies tell me one country in the world which has been feeding 800 million plus people every month one country which has transported more than 25 million migrants and transported them to their destinations for free there have been hardships the issue is how you deal with these hardships there was migration and i know there's lots of people they were feared there was you know losing jobs they didn't know what to do because it came all of a sudden but the question is how did indian society indians responded to it and i know cases after cases people walk but you know everybody was provided for food water the long hazardous walk back to his village didn't bring chaudhary any respite the family went hungry most of the times surviving on whatever they could lay their hands [Music] on foreign foreign me facing starvation in the village chaudhary once again returned to the textile town he thought that with the lockdown being slowly eased the looms would start running and he would find work again is just hanging around waiting for better days to dawn days are spent sipping numerous cups he's often hunted by money lenders and haunted by images of workers dying on the way back to their villages one of the very serious outcomes of that lockdown uh was this massive displacement in the migrant labor force uh which resulted in a huge number of migrants suddenly finding themselves out of their jobs going back overnight but while that was one proximate outcome of the lockdown uh what gradually became evident over the months and weeks that followed was that the economic contraction was deepening uh the results were fairly widespread across various sectors of the economy and the impact on the labor market was actually not confined just to the displacement of migrant workers in fact it extended fairly squarely to formal sectors of the economy as well with the result that the labor market retraction has been fairly prominent this has had impact on both consumption demand as well as subsequent savings and investment demand of the economy so india along with south asia is right now one of the most severely affected regions and economies of the entire world the uncertainty and extreme financial stress are driving some people around the bend and it's not just happening in the country's small towns in the eastern steel city of jamshedpur a salon owner could not cope with the stress anymore [Music] 38 year old sham takur ran a busy salon in the market in the eastern part of the city he wasn't rich but he had a steady clientele among the residents of his neighborhood according to his wife anuradha the salon was a crucial lifeline for the family the cheetah chelsea but when the lockdown happened and his shop was shut [ __ ] savings vanished in weeks unable to cope with the financial struggle and provide for his family he walked to his salon one morning tied a rope to the ceiling fan and hanged himself [Music] cannot come to grips with the tragedy he was the sole earning member of a large family and now anuradha sees darkness all around [Music] it's completely heartbreaking people have to commit suicide because they're not being able to cope with what's happening around them so it is devastating and i would say it's a very strong reflection on the society and the governments we have and that's something that that needs to be addressed as any even one person sleeping hungry is a shame for the society i think it's very very important for us to start looking at you know give names to these real people these are real people these are not just statistics [Applause] economic strain and poverty are pushing people to the edge [Music] the country was doing very well in recent years and had even become the fastest growing economy that's now part of history will all the games in the fight against poverty be lost because of the pandemic [Music] india has been struggling with hunger and poverty for decades but since 2000 it achieved remarkable success in reducing absolute poverty according to the un 270 million people moved out of poverty between 2005 06 and 2015-16 in india between 2011 and 2015 poverty declined from 21.6 to 13.4 percent says the world bank but today the international labor organization has painted a grim picture of india's poverty levels it now warns that as many as 400 million indians including migrant workers and daily wage earners are at risk of being pushed deeper into poverty because of the pandemic hunger is growing now worsened so is poverty and many many other factors so now there are increasingly reports about how violence against women has increased in the post pandemic phase so the pandemic is obviously creating havoc and and that's something we probably cannot control but what we could have controlled and what we still need to do is a very very coherent and agile policy response uh to these challenges and that at the moment seems wanting it's not just a question of poverty deepening as an absolute feature in terms of more people becoming poor i think the character of the poverty is going to undergo a change and the character of the poverty is not just going to stay confined to basic definitions like rural poverty or urban poverty there's going to be a significant overlap there's going to be a spread of poverty across certain demographics because the pandemic has also produced situations where very unexpected kind of retrenchments have happened very unexpected kind of setbacks have been happening still in spite of the bleak scenario the government remains proud of its achievement in helping the poor breakouts of their poverty cycle over the last few years the world poverty international organization it has said that nowhere in the world have more than 75 million people been lifted out of poverty in the last three years and prime minister narendra modi has done that so i think you know we can argue about statistics but the fact is that you do not become a three trillion dollar economy leaving behind france and united kingdom if your people don't have basic sanitation and that's basic amenities [Music] but in reality a different story has been unfolding over at least the last few months since the outbreak began it's not just poverty in the villages [Music] urban poverty has increased as well it has deprived countless people in the cities ranging from domestic workers to daily wage earners of their regular incomes for months even in the nation's capital delhi life has become extremely hard for domestic worker chinta and her husband look dancer with barely enough cash to spare chinta and babu were forced to embark on a long arduous journey back to their village on foot just like many others [Music] but life in the village was no better there's simply no jobs available in the rural areas [Music] and all roads seem to have led them back to the city so they decided to return to delhi again [Music] and fulera begum in assam are living on their hopes and dreams the government meanwhile is considering the option of another fiscal stimulus package to kick-start the economy and alleviate their misery and pain it has already announced two stimulus packages totaling about 1.5 percent of gdp it also believes that a rapid economic recovery is likely when the pandemic ends but the news so far is hardly encouraging india has been ranked 94th on the world hunger index for this year the global index which calculates the level of malnutrition in over 100 countries shows india's hunger level to be serious what's worrying is that the latest report does not even take into account the impact of kovid and the lockdown will the poverty and hunger situation worsen as india grapples with the myriad challenges of kovid economic decline poverty and hunger the fact is we pulled out 75 million people from poverty as per the world poverty international uh figures in just three years and that is a huge number 75 million people is not a small number and people keep harping about this employment not being available to everybody let me tell you one thing from being a job-seeking economy mr narendra modi has categorically said over and over and over again we are trying to become an entrepreneur driven economy the fruits of development have been given to the last man or the last woman standing in the short term we don't want hunger deaths we don't want the corona crisis to become a humanitarian crisis seven months since the beginning of the pandemic i think now we can safely say that we have prevented a lot of those hunger deaths as well but poverty eradication remains a longer-term objective india is on a path to eradicating poverty in another five to ten years [Music] the coming months will indicate whether such optimism is justified for now however millions are living on the brink of starvation despite the government's best efforts as the pandemic continues to wreak havoc in one of the world's most populous nations many are unsure of where their next meal will come from or the fate that awaits them can india make the decisive turn towards progress and prosperity amid a raging pandemic and how long will it take for the country to steady the ship as millions struggle to keep their heads above water the answers are not known yet at least for now [Music] you ,True,False,False,False

https://www.youtube.com/cnainsider","byebye baby this month students across Singapore go back to school but the schools they go back to aren't the same as before [Music] reminder your mosque has to be one in all thumbs in this episode I returned to school to see how kids are coping in school amidst the kovat 19and damage they may have lived through home based learning or hbl but well they survived the school's safety measures [Music] I am at jingshan primary school to help out with preparations to ensure our children are safe in school they are expecting over 1,000 students back here next week several weeks of discussion the school decides to limit students to three a table but there's a problem with a shortage of benches classroom tables must be brought in kids must also sit according to their school registration number but sanctum Lavinia is one of the teachers tests with the canteen layout how many revisions of your canteen why did you have to have so many revisions we started off with just 5 - a table and we realized that as we review we found that the kids have a tendency to keep huddling together so then you have to change it to 4 per table as we keep reviewing the processes and we realize that the best now would be treat to a table so at least they have increased social distancing and more reminders are going to be in place the kids may be safe but we says ain't no fun anymore I'll tell you I mean the whole point of recess is to run wild and be everywhere [Music] cool you ready for school maker I last met seven-year-old Mika and his mother Eleana during the circuit breaker this is cool how do you feel about him going back to school just a little bit anxious of because you just don't know what to expect with the new safe distance in school do you worry that oh you know is it dangerous for him to go back to school yeah because I do not see that they put in a lot of measures in school Mika has been away from school for nine weeks [Music] - see awesome well let's get you back to kill him I do once Becca gets to his class he's in charge of taking his own temperature and recording it down on top of teaching duties teachers must also run through these daily reminders how to wear a mask how to dispose a mask [Music] how to wash their hands how to maintain a safe distance how to line up for recess was this the kind of welcome bag he was expecting even Micah's music class is now different any guesses on the song choice [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's finally research time but not before this and this kids have an assigned seat in the canteen today mika brought his own snack he had told me earlier he was most looking forward to playing with his friends at recess but in his school save distancing measures means no playtime Mika hasn't left her seat except to throw things away do you remember to keep a safe distance is it hard to remember no okay why do you have to keep a safe distance can you touch your friends why not Wow you know the virus of name can I give you a high-five this safe distancing marker is the children's new best friend in the school term I've observed that the probably ones are still very young so occasionally they forget to maintain that safe distance so therefore this visual cue is really helpful they just have to stand right there in the circle the teachers are also kept very very busy during this period during recess especially they have to be on the lookout for the little ones who get really excited and get close to one another and the teachers have to step in to remind them I've arranged to me to make us teacher to find out how teachers hold with younger students do you feel stressed having to teach and to loop after so many of these things we meet weekly I would be responsible for the 15th so it's more than 800 schools have been closed across South Korea as it battles a new wave of infections in and just days after schools reopened in May hundreds of schools in South Korea were forced to shut down again due to an unexpected spike in kovat 19 cases and that wasn't the only country that saw a new wave of infections in France saw 17 new cases in schools a week after reopening and over in Japan schools were forced to shut again after a new wave of infections among students all these overseas cases made me realize the importance of taking precautions in our local schools but have these safety measures taken a toll on our kids perhaps a double-cross tomorrow I get to my friend fine I'm gonna also get to see my teachers as well that's ten year old Harris I've only met him virtually during the circuit breaker he was telling me about his experiences with home based learning he's been back at school for a few days now I want to know how well he's been adjusting to the rules [Music] it's finally time for recess and Aries has been assigned the role of safe management ambassador his job make sure his friends keep one meter apart it has not been an easy job not really easy but I think just now you saw me there every few minutes I'm looking around just looking see if anyone's breaking news basically I'm the meaning punishment watching out for people who are so-called breaking the news you know so far have you had to report anyone actually we don't need hot this day we just remind them for example if you see someone it's not doing the right thing you like say excuse me you're not following the measures or something like that of all the new regulations which is the one that you find it the most difficult or you hate the most basically having to wear masks right almost 100% time there are many more rules now what happens if you don't follow the rules I don't know what how does that make you feel I can't go out so then which is a favourite part of the data perfect house that they weren't its PE because you don't have to wear a mask the first few days of eras in school was him trying to adjust to the new rules but I wondered how would he feel after having to do it for an extended period of time three weeks later I returned to Aris a school he is in the middle of a character and development class today's activity discussed some possible reasons why a child their age may be unusually quiet during this period my thing gonna do a quick survey told me on a scale of one to five how happy are you to be in school one meaning little bit happy five meaning very happy to be in school about four young men I think to because it's usually my phone or going to school is to talk with my friends and playing with my friends but because of this new SMM we can barely do any of that thank you everything we teach as mmm is just not the same [Music] hey good to see you again okay you know two weeks ago when I met you you had told me that during recess you felt a little bit like it was for prison how do you feel that I don't feel happier by feel more at ease cause now I want you to know me anymore cause I know other people on the same boat as me everyone feels that I would have been downright surprised if they didn't feel the same way what can adults do to make you feel even better about the situation perhaps they can install some VR hit stats along some VHS remotes so they can be entertained during recess okay let's sit down there and pretend room and feels even more like flying through space I see what is the one thing that you look forward to that the school will allow that you cannot do now well to finally run freely play soccer another thing is also the library our children could be hidden victims of the Kovach 19 pandemic a survey by UNICEF found that they were worried about being isolated from family and friends catching the virus and even dying from it it prompted the organization to develop a straw buck for children to help them better understand kovat 19 the title of this book is here in Singapore similar resources have been done be it through videos or ebooks but is it enough I'm going to speak to a school counselor to find out what more we can do so it's been about three weeks since school started have you picked up any mental or emotional issues that's related to covet nineteen measures the good things is that the children managed to adapt quite quickly but one thing we notice is new for them it's the social distancing where they have to keep a safe distance from one another and that's when they feel very uncomfortable especially for young children the antrum yeah it's not natural to socialize correct what is helpful is that the teachers have been giving the truant a lot of space to share about their feelings when they came back these safety measures could be around for a long time what is the long-term impact on the children's well-being I would think that children be very adaptable they will be able to innovate and find ways of instructing with one another do you think there's a case to be made for us as a society to be more creative and yet keep them safe for example in China they have the safe distancing hats in Japan the kids are allowed to go to the playground and in Denmark a lot of lessons take place outdoors so that the kids can have a bit more space and freedom do you think that will be in their children's interest if we try to think out of the box yes I would think so like in our school we have the hopscotch map out for them just outside the office we have quite a number done up for them and they could just queue and at safe distance and play as a team and that's one thing possible that we could do here and if you talk about the pucks in Singapore they could run at a distance from each other and they could be safe because there is enough space there I've been getting a lot of messages from boys and girls right across the country other than innovative safe distancing measures some countries have empowered their kids to ask tough questions to the people in charge so I decided maybe it's time we do something similar here in Singapore [Music] [Music] this generation of kids is growing up in the midst of a global pandemic so we asked students to send us any question they had on schools or covered 19 I'm taking these questions to the Education Minister on G come I'm surprised the little girl was asking when can I eat with my friends again I think she can but maybe not so closest diagonally across one meter I know yeah yeah so what do you think is it much fun eating during recess when that person is diagonally one meter we the friendship is still there even you have a meter apart yeah we can see each other you can still speak to each other yeah just have to get used to it okay let's move on to the next one [Music] why can't we be like New Zealand and wait till all the kovat 19 cases dropped to zero I read about this article about if this wave comes to Singapore and what changes would that mean in our school system so that's the challenge of a movie for past few months the virus will be with us for a while maybe a year maybe two years maybe even more so it's not going to become zero for some time and it's not possible for us to close schools for so long if there's a second wave that is what the little boys say what we hope is that every time there's a case we will have tested quickly isolate a person quarantine the people around them and so that you can spread to others and that's how we live we Cove it why do you have to go to school early it's good to go early sometimes then you stagger out they arrival then it's not so crowded I would like to know if we will have a vaccine in the near future if we ever find a vaccine for Kovac 19 will you make it compulsory for all students is it compulsory I've been used to work compulsory because it would be good for all of us to have it right yes I all the children you will get your MMR vaccinations and it helps you prevent certain diseases to get to you so what we won when we have the vaccine is the mixture is affordable and is available to all Singaporeans including our little ones makes it hard to breathe therefore I cannot have to treat well plus I agree with him that is more comfortable in the aircon but I give you two reason why is not so good number one - account the airflow is not as good it's more likely to transmit viruses so it's better to be open air and well-ventilated and number two aircon produces a lot of carbon dioxide so if you are environmentally friendly try not to use so much aircon if you're uncomfortable with your mask sometimes you can exchange it with a shield just for a while just to take a break many schools today have massless corners where kids can go there take a break take off their bus is that right yeah but they don't talk and then they put it back on you know adults sometimes have smoke bricks yeah children they have mass of bricks down the store in do you have food and how are they being affected by this what is your advice for children who are going through this pandemic and have to adapt to this new normal I have two girls once a teenager one just 20 both in school so they've all been very affected don't get to go to school and they really miss going to school and really they have it up to here staying at home the first week or so they learned how to cope one learn how to paint and do all kinds of things to keep themselves occupied but after three weeks four weeks I think they're really important so it's very good that now we interface to my song I've got some pictures and friends that's what the kids have drawn maybe you can take a look because we told my kids to draw what's cool is like to them now hmm particularly you want to point this one out this one is obvious they all like total defense fighting against the virus preventing it from coming to school I'm very optimistic this one C virus is here everyone got locked up but this guy here tells everybody others are saying oh dear I'm stuck at home he say staples I like to think that after drawing all this this is what the artistic I actually spoke to the artist and he says that school is was feeling like a prison what would you say to him obviously he had a lot of fun before commit 19 and now he see the school is different and I would say he must be thinking how do we get it all back yeah and so again I would tell him if all of us have to play a part and we can get it all back someday [Music] it's hard to tell if our kids are affected by covet 19 and all the restrictions that come along with it what I've observed is that the kids adapt really quickly to the new rules but I wonder if we as adults can be more innovative in how we help the children deal with the safe management measures so that they don't miss out too much on this part of their childhood [Music] ",True,True,False,False

https://go.gov.sg/govsg-channel-wa",so the eip continues to serve a very important function for singapore we cannot leave social mixing to chance and hope that it will happen by an invisible hand it is better to intervene upstream to preempt the problem and to foster mutual understanding and encourage integration from the start if we wait until racial tensions have started to bubble to the surface and develop and become entrenched it will become so much harder to heal those fractures and rebuild trust among different communities we recognize that the eip is an intrusive social policy because it acts against very powerful and complex social economic forces that are at play in singapore and all over the world and in its application on the ground the eip does have its rough edges and may cause difficulties for some owners looking to sell their flats and when the eip limits are reached for an ethnic group sellers from other ethnic groups are unable to sell to buyers of the constrained group in such cases the seller's loss may be the buyers gain a buyer from an eligible race will benefit from a lower resale price and would thus be less affected if and when they sell the flat in future but this brings little comfort to affected sellers particularly those who had bought the flat from hdb or on the resale market before the eip limits were reached and yet are now caught by eip limits and this is the group who can be financially disadvantaged and i understand how that they feel aggrieved they may feel it is unfair that they are personally shouldering the cost for a policy that benefits all of us in society whenever hdb waives eip limits to address its impact on certain households it is mindful that this may lead to even higher imbalances in the concentrations of certain ethnic groups in some areas so we are studying the situation carefully and are looking at what more can be done to help affected sellers the eip is by no means the perfect tool not the only tool to promote and ensure racial harmony we are very conscious of the trade-offs and will keep working to smoothen its sharper edges but it has an essential place among the range of tools and programs and policies and safeguards we deploy to protect and promote our racial harmony so let us keep in mind the largest social objective behind the eip even as we seek to smoothen its sharper edges we must always ensure that the places we live and grow up reflect the fabric of our society and that is how we continuously press on towards our ideal of a cohesive and multiracial singapore ,True,True,False,False
86,8Yo9OfPkXvU,CNA Insider,Singapore's Food Problem: Carbon Footprint Of A Food Paradise | Climate Change: A Wicked Problem,2021-03-22T00:47:49Z,"Singapore is a land of incredible food, and we eat plenty of it. But the food we eat has an outsized carbon footprint that we can no longer ignore. In this episode, Dr Janil Puthucheary makes surprising discoveries about which foods in Singapore are major contributors to climate change – spoiler alert, it’s not just beef. He learns that beyond meat, certain plant-based foods can also cause the destruction of our forests and climate. So, can we eat our way out of this problem? He speaks to those trying to produce and consume more sustainably to find out.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] it's already happening in some parts of the world and some scientists say that if we continue to produce greenhouse gases at this rate we could see an increase in insect pests global warming not only causes a rise in the number of pests but also increases their appetite [Applause] as it is in one day a swarm of locusts the size of tampanese and changi can destroy enough food crops to feed everyone in singapore 10 times over currently 10 to 15 percent of our global crop production is lost to pests but each additional degree of temperature increase could cause global yields to drop by a further 10 to 25 percent but while our food supply may be threatened by climate change our current diets are contributing to it from raising animals growing vegetables from processing to shipping if you eat you're part of the food system that accounts for up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions isn't it about time we reduce this figure and what if this could be part of the solution i think this is the hardest episode i'm going to do because i'm confronting something that's so central to life here in singapore in this series i've revealed how our plastic addiction is causing a strain on the environment that's disgusting i was just aware of all the plastic and all the trash and our need for more and more and more power is forcing us to look for alternative sources that aren't always readily available and how much solar we generate in singapore still very small we will always be limited in space unfortunately plastic and energy are they the only culprits that pop into your mind when you think about climate change perhaps you've never considered the impact of this [Music] what we eat [Music] we are a land of incredible food we go everywhere just to eat so so much of our food dictates you know our whole lifestyle in a way people travel from far and wide to eat here singapore is the best food i think very vibrant and very exciting the world acknowledges us for it singapore's hockey culture is now on the unesco intangible cultural heritage list we greet each other with it subtitle but did you know that globally our food systems have higher carbon emissions than the entire transport sector perhaps that's why the very first chapter of this essay collection about climate change in singapore is about our delicious chili crab i'm meeting xiaoyun the author of the essay eating chili crab in the anthropocene to find out why she chose to write about our favorite crustacean hi how are you how are you doing good good so i was looking at your essay in this book and now we're literally eating chili crab right i love seafood sifu is a big part of singaporean culture too i don't know is this going to get messy yeah i mean you're wearing so this is messy as well right the the subject this issue yeah so i thought that food was actually a very easy segue for most singaporeans into the topic of climate change so how much of a climate change issue then is chili crab this crab is 1.5 kg per kg is like 4.86 kilograms of carbon emissions we import about like 5 500 crabs in a day i think because of how the scale of his marketing as a tool for like attracting tourists to come to singapore and you know marketing our sense of like heritage and culture maybe it's not that sustainable right singapore imported 55.9 million us dollars worth of crabs in 2019 making us the world's largest net importer of fresh and chilled crabs by dollar value per capita especially when it's affected by monsoons crab supplies actually like face crunches of up to 30 i mean definitely the weather exacerbates this problem but also that our demand for this food has outpaced its ability to reproduce itself but surely that must be a global problem associated with increased consumption everywhere it's a global problem but like many things right we can't just like exonerate ourselves because as you know we are diversifying our import sources so our demand and also like global demand for these seafoods is actually affecting mangrove habitats and the mangrove forest has to be cleared from places like indonesia philippines india sri lanka and as far as the east coast of africa so that's a direct link because i've learned earlier in this series about how mangroves serve an important role in sucking carbon out of the atmosphere [Music] so do you think we as singaporeans need to change our eating habits for the sake of climate change i think it begins with realizing that cultural practices such as eating certain foods is no longer aligned with how we want to be because singapore is saying how we want to increase our climate ambition right so part of that is like eating more sustainably so your food choices does help you reduce your carbon footprint going plant-based supporting local farms would actually really reduce your carbon footprint do you think singaporeans are ready for this and keen for this i mean food is a central part of our identity isn't it i think we need to pursue singaporeans yes what do you think it will take to persuade them i think that's why we need to make it not just a an environmental issue i know we're in an episode about climate change but it's not just climate change you know and it's about like health health reasons being more plant-based or eating less red meat yeah so it's not purely about climate change though yeah it's a messy issue yeah i definitely think that okay okay we should just stop eating who am i kidding i don't just love my chili crab i love all food i'm sure most of us feel the same way but xiaoyon says that what we eat matters and if singapore doesn't take steps to reduce the greenhouse gases in relation to what we eat by 2030 the total emissions from the sector will increase by 19 percent this is according to a research team from a star after finding that most food-related climate studies were done about the us and europe they decided it would be remiss not to conduct one on our foodie nation dr john's team picked 13 of our favorite food items and used what's called a life cycle analysis to carefully calculate emissions from every stage of their production it took his team five months to do the math and now he's asked to meet me here and what did you find beef is the major culprit it's equivalent to 150 hours of leaving your 100 watt light bulb turned on at home this piece of beef yes just 250 grams that's about six kilograms of carbon emissions for this piece of beef my goodness so how does this compare with the other meats let's say i substitute my 250 grams of beef for chicken what effect would i have for the chicken is about 21 hours and 30 minutes that's about one-sixth of the effect yes that's right so 250 grams of chicken generates 875 grams of carbon emissions and then something a little bit surprising was a fish fish is a major culprit it's number four in the list partly also because we do import a lot of fish and one of the very carbon intensive fish is actually the salmon that we air fly from norway the carbon mouse that is added to flying the fish increases the carbon intensity i see local fish farms produce only nine percent of the fish we eat everything else is imported per ton kilometer air transport is nine times more carbon intensive than land transport and 50 times more so than sea transport i want to find out if people in singapore know the carbon impact of what we eat so i've got a series of foods here and i was gonna ask you to arrange them in order which do you think has the highest amount of carbon footprint which is the lowest would you give me a hint just take a guess so what should be at the top okay the beef all right the beets going all the way to the top you're very confident about this because meat's probably easily time to be transported faster so in general i think it's meat like mutton pork as well i think so i think beef goes high for the most part people know that red meats were the most carbon intensive when it came to emissions per kilogram where do you want the rice the rice uh rice that's the question near the vegetables yes yeah you're good you're good and i just feel like the vegetables and the rice should be less i think than the vegetables to me to me that seems about right so when it comes to carbon emissions by weight the order goes like this with the highest being beef followed by mutton pork fish duck leafy vegetables and fruits were the lowest then we decided to throw in a little twist and ask people to rank the foods based on emissions generated from the total consumption of each food item in singapore because what matters isn't just emissions by weight of food produced but emissions from the total amount we consume in the country so if i'm going to ask you then rearrange it on the basis of not just about the carbon footprint per food but also taking into account how much we eat would you have the same list or would you change it i wouldn't change it as much so you wouldn't change the order at all now uh all right right all the way to the left i think the rice can come up a bit right how fast you should rise you could face fish i guess normally rice over eggs why is that you think we eat more rice and eggs yeah because from what i've seen a lot of people eat rice didn't use my mouth okay i would say rice probably moved here to work maybe somewhere around here just an eggs as well uh it's gonna be somewhere here yeah chicken yeah about here like that [Music] but wait wait wait now then when you think about what we eat oh wait john go for it based on the consumption so our diet right we actually consume a lot of pork this makes it go all the way to the top it's second which is quite surprising rice eating rice eating rice so we eat a lot of chicken it goes up so we eat quite a lot of fish as well so that surprised me when i found out that actually fish has a significant cover for bread so beef actually goes all the way to the fifth spot after beef is eggs okay so quite a different story if you look at the emissions by total consumption in singapore beef is no longer at the top instead pork takes the dubious honor rice surprisingly comes in second followed by chicken fish then beef in fifth position i'm quite surprised especially with the rice rice cultivation is a significant source of greenhouse gases apart from the burning of rice residues such as straws and husks fertilizers in rice production systems could promote the release of nitrous oxide a potent greenhouse gas i mean there are many good reasons to eat a little bit less rice but this is yet another one yes precisely if i want to be a consumer that's conscious about climate change i'm a bit conflicted you know should i be eating more beef or should i be eating more pork on a per kilo basis the carbon intensity of beef is significantly higher than the pork so if it's just a one for one substitution you're just going to make the whole situation worse actually the best way to go is eat more of the vegetables i see i see in singapore our pork consumption accounts for 28 of our food-related greenhouse gas emissions because we eat so much of it 115 252 tons of it per year to be precise while all imported food generates emissions from processing and transport to singapore pigs like all livestock produce manure which eventually leads to emissions of nitrous oxide it comes from the treatment and storage of the manure that said by kilogram pigs aren't the greatest source of greenhouse gases i'm in the company of something that's a big contributor to climate change animals like cows and goats need management of their waste and housing too but they produce most of their greenhouse gas emissions in quite a different way as a doctor i've had to study human anatomy quite closely but today i'm going to try to explain the link between these animals anatomy and their greenhouse gas emissions a cow is a ruminant animal like goats sheep and deer of all the livestock ruminants released the most methane a noxious greenhouse gas why is the cow so good at producing something so bad [Music] ruminants unlike us live on a diet of plants that are hard to digest they rely on microbes in their stomach called methanogens and these break down their food releasing methane in the process this greenhouse gas collects in their gut they release this gas through both their front and back ends burping and flatulence but primarily through burping so there you have it these cows heating up our planet one burp at a time one cow can produce anything between 250 to 500 liters of methane a day if carbon dioxide with a thickness of an average blanket imagine methane as a blanket this thick methane is a greenhouse gas that has 86 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide nitrous oxide which we spoke about earlier is another greenhouse gas and it has 310 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide the only good news is that methane and nitrous oxide remain in our atmosphere for a much shorter time and there's much less of them than carbon dioxide but while our consumption of red meat like beef pork and mutton is directly contributing to climate change it's not just meat and methane we have to worry about earlier john from a star suggested that we should be eating more plant-based products like vegetables and fruit and less meat but i'm meeting someone who believes that food's impact on the climate isn't as straightforward as meat and methane you get the hipster version i get the traditional singaporean meal okay okay tell me about the foods that we have in front of us avocado largely produced in mexico you use a lot of water water usage can be associated with energy utilization as well you pop water that uses energy right you have to filter water that uses energy as well there's a lot of fertilizers as well which we all know fertilizers of course for the most part essentially from fossil fuels i thought you had the bad guy plate and i had the good guys plate but you're confusing me now some of this stuff is bad for the environment yes yeah quinoa is associated with issues of deforestation tell me my coffee is okay tell me tell me i can drink my coffee guilt-free coffee can be quite high greenhouse gas [Music] because again the land use implications of this depending on where you get your coffee mass production of quinoa and coffee requires a lot of land which in some parts of the world has resulted in deforestation and land degradation both of which reduce the land's ability to store carbon so there's a there's a movement to push vegetarianism and veganism as a way of dealing with climate change right it's not that simple of course right certain food products are associated with land use changes that are associated with greater greenhouse gas emissions like for example cutting down a forest we have to kind of take note that there are potentially environmental impacts associated with increase in demand of particular plant products as well and if we're not careful in how we're going to meet those demand then we could very well end up say with a situation where you know like for instance like we have an overexpansion of plantations like palm oil which of course we know have significant greenhouse gas implications right [Music] as global demand for food rises the amount of land needed to grow plants and rear animals often requires us to do this deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to use the land for something else trees capture carbon so removing them not only prevents future carbon capture it also releases stored carbon into the air as carbon dioxide to date total deforestation accounts for up to 20 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions how much of it is going on in our own backyard i'm going to meet someone who's crunched the numbers for the last five years so within southeast asia we clear about three million hectares of land per year mainly for food production and is this a number growing this is doubled since the early 2000s and this has turned southeast asia from a major store of carbon to an emitter of carbons so our sort of role in the global carbon cycle has changed as a result of this deforestation correct why is the deforestation getting worse so it's due to many reasons one of the major reason is palm oil production things like potato chips biscuits sweets gummy bears for example those all use pamela so palm oil is a major driver of deforestation within malaysia and indonesia which is a large land area within southeast asia palm oil is found in almost everything we eat from pizza dough to chocolate and even margarine the other food products like rice production for example yeah that can cause deforestation as well so every year almost 3 million hectares of forests are removed in southeast asia mostly for agriculture roughly double of what it was 20 years ago i wonder if we know how much land this really is given that we spend much of our time in indoor environments like this i devised a little experiment to find out imagine that's an area of forest how often do you think we lose an area this size [Music] like yali yearly i know every year every year it's much less than a year let me tell you you think about every day much less than that it happens much much faster 30 minutes maybe on a per minute basis 10 seconds 10 five seconds five seconds so every five seconds you think we lose a patch of force this size yes one second one second what if i tell you that you're very wrong it's much faster than that [Music] it's a second we are losing 20 times this amount of four oh just a lot it's a bit scary to be very honest i know that it was drastically losing away but i didn't know that it was this much yeah i feel kind of like short and sad i think we shouldn't like destroy the nature like this it should be stopped yeah it should be stopped but it's being done for our food shouldn't there be alternatives imagine that in one second we're losing more than 20 times this amount of forest in southeast asia well we can't undo all the damage but perhaps there's something i can do this weekend to offset it a bit but first i've got to do some calculations i'm calculating how many trees i'd need to plant to offset the average carbon footprint of one person's food intake in singapore our carbon footprint just from food is 954 kilograms per person we are a country of almost 6 million based on this number depending on the tree and how long we let it grow i've come up with a few numbers time to find out what the right one is singapore intends to plant 1 million trees over the next 10 years one of the reasons to combat climate change because trees have tremendous potential to suck the carbon from the atmosphere [Music] adrian from the national parks board is going to plant some of these trees i want to be a part of it the giant soup i think we'll just dig over here okay yeah and we need to really loosen the base because we want the roots to be able to puncture that base very fast and try to get water as soon as possible yeah so we have to keep the integrity of the root ball now we've got to slowly shift it in tell me how the tree's captured okay so you've got the leaves here they're green which means they have chlorophyll and so with sunlight water is going to go through photosynthesis right so the carbon capture is really taking the carbon dioxide straight out of the air yes through the process of photosynthesis yes do different trees capture carbon at different rates yes they do um so what we are planting here are the barrel cups so they are in a way hard wood trees because they have a high density of wood so they store more carbon than let's say uh a temperate tree uh in a temperate tree uh it has the dormancy during winter but tropical rain forestry don't doesn't have that so the tropical rainforest capture carbon all year round at a similar rate precisely so does the rate of carbon capture for a tree change over its lifetime yes it does um so um the good thing about planting a tree right is that it's young and so it's vigorously capturing carbon you know through photosynthesis it wants to grow it's basically like adolescent so planting is happening is very good so it grows very fast to the point where it becomes a big tree then it becomes a carbon storage bank right then it's still sequestering some carbon but it's not growing as fast so that carbon capture is a bit slower point of maturity how many trees do we need to plant to offset our footprint from food um we know that it's 954 kilograms per year per person right so in over 10 years about 9540 kilograms of carbon dioxide per person but at the end of 10 years the tree is still capturing carbon and increasing the carbon that's right so typically a tree will grow it will put on girth right and then at some point it will stabilize and if you take it to be at about maybe 50 years on average where it really stabilizes then you would need to only plant eight trees actually if i plant eight trees that will capture my carbon footprint from food for 50 years that's right but even then eight trees i mean for everyone in singapore that's like what 45 million there are currently about 7 million trees in singapore plus the 1 million trees that we are aiming to plant that's another 37 million more trees we need also this scenario assumes that our population doesn't grow and that we allow the trees to fully mature for 50 years do we really have enough land for 45 million singapore is small right obviously there's a limit to how much we can plant definitely but we try our best are there other limits to planting trees i've heard of you know stories where people have such ambitious targets right and what happens is that the care for the tree isn't calculated in and we do a lot of tree management as well you know along the trails you see here our staff are actually going in to inspect all the trees so i mean you have to factor in this sort of things that may limit the number of trees you plant so adrian and i planted three trees in about half an hour it's sweaty work but not impossible it's not hard actually it's just physical but do we have enough space for 45 million trees we have to do this it will capture carbon and it will have a lot of other benefits but it's not going to be enough to offset our total carbon footprint let alone the footprint that we have from consuming food well we're already reaping what we sow it's a vicious cycle our food production accelerates climate change which in turn hurts the availability of food paul tang co-authored the report warning us about this climate change expresses itself in the short term especially for example truly what we call the unexpected severe weather events especially in southeast asia typhoons are a classical example but the other symptoms of the immediate effects are things like monsoons being delayed extra rainstorms drought periods even uneven temperature so all those affect agriculture and then there's also the ocean temperature ocean acidification you know fish that we all love to eat are very very affected by temperature warming and sea level rise when sea temperatures rise oxygen levels in the oceans are affected and fish tend to migrate to cooler regions and in the southeast asian region our fish populations decline so other examples of a weather impact on a particular food that we like to enjoy here in singapore certainly i think rice is the best example because we all have to eat rice and most of our rice is imported from basically three main countries vietnam thailand and india most of indian rice is what we call rain fat rice so very dependent on the onset of the monsoon if the monsoon is delayed planting is delayed and there can be tremendous impact on how much they harvest in the end flooding is also a serious issue in many parts of india but also in let's say vietnam and thailand and flooding can cause losses you know anywhere up to five to ten percent of the entire crop can be wiped out yeah with sudden rain storms and heavy rain itself but are consumers in other countries starting to be affected by these problems the short answer is yes they are i think we see shortages of major staples philippines for example uh indonesia with much bigger populations and also where the affordability is not as high as singapore but the longer term is what we worry about okay let's say beyond you know 20 30 because if we do nothing you know in terms of global climate change we're going to see more and more frequent unexpected weather events so in the mid to long term yes we need to be very concerned in fact we import 90 percent of our food inevitably we're affected by the weather in other countries and we don't have to wait until 2030 to see the effect it has on our food supply when i embarked on this series i commissioned one of the largest and most extensive surveys in singapore on climate change we wanted to know if people in singapore understand the impact of what we eat on the climate we found that only seven percent of us said the environment was our top priority when it comes to choosing food but 38 of us prioritized food prices [Music] well the thing is it's all linked i'm going to meet the man who watches food prices like a hawk this one is uh is biome it's a spinach very popular as you know last year it was about a dollar for this particular bundle now it's a dollar twenty which is actually a twenty percent increase if you look at it that way and is that price rise linked to climate change if you look at what has been going on in malaysia there's been flood and rain over the whole of december till january so that is probably causing a significant disruption both in the production and the transportation of vegetables like these green leafy vegetables which are getting too much water are there other examples so apart from the spinach yes absolutely from the usa this is probably coming from florida the temperature that you see out there is quite warm with this one temperature and with growth of other sort of insects and what they are doing is it's actually moving to freeze to trees and destroying a lot of these orange crops so you can see the prices here it's five pieces for eight dollars that you see out here oranges have gone up by 7.5 percent on an average every year i see so if you could invest in oranges that would be a great investment that's caught over there that's card right there okay can i check the price of the cod how much the kg of cod is 80 so what's happening to the prices of cod so cot prices have been going up close to five percent a year over the last ten years i see that's quite significant but how confident are you that the price rises because of climate change absolutely so in the north sea because the temperature is increasing the production actually goes down remember these are colder climates they are more used to colder climates the production disruption means that automatically the prices will go up so there's just less fish absolutely so climate change can affect so many different types of foods absolutely what will happen this is my honest belief going forward climate change actually impacts food prices tremendously you will see that most of the population where food forms a very significant part of their budget they will have to change their food habits whether it's beet and fish or vegetables and grain our food prices are already affected by climate change we can try to produce food more sustainably but there's a limit to how we control production overseas and how much we do locally we aren't quite there yet so it seems like we have to look at eating more sustainably a group of scientists came up with a universal guideline for how to eat to sustain a healthy planet in a climate changed future a pretty specific guideline their recommended intake of red meat per day was up to 14 grams and according to the singapore food agency's 2019 figures we're currently eating more than five times that we're also eating almost three times their recommended amount of poultry and seafood when asked if they were willing to reduce their meat and dairy intake 56 percent of our survey respondents already have or are willing to do so [Music] as is alicia chan the executive chef of a cooked food and grocery store in singapore she definitely knows her way around the kitchen having cooked in top ones all over the world even at my first few jobs in the kitchen i was kind of horrified about the amount of waste that a lot of kitchens go through like we would import fish from europe and we would fillet them but we would throw away the bones and like the carbon footprint on that fish for you to throw away the bones and not do something with it just doesn't do justice to the fish so stuff like zero waste and sustainability have always been something that i've been quite passionate about i am getting her to take her sustainability journey even further and so she's embarking on the climate diet for a week [Music] if the whole world switched to the climate diet we could reduce food related carbon emissions by almost half equivalent to taking more than two-thirds of all cars off the road for a year but look at this you'd need to whip out a calculator along with your cutlery for this not really feasible for someone like alicia i would say at present my current diet is whatever is convenient i don't really have the headspace to plan my meals [Music] to help her out we found a team of technologists to automate as much of it as possible better.sg is a non-profit organization that creates tech products for good they've gathered a team of 20 just to work on this how to make it easier for her it's we had it broken down into just categories and ingredients and sean the development team actually came up with the generic list of ingredients that a normal user can eat on top of the data that we have from climate diet i think to make it easier it's to just make it intuitive for them and it starts to become like a habit where she enters every day sounds good the team has created a mobile app called climate diet.sg all alicia needs to do is key in her daily food intake and it will automatically tabulate the carbon emissions from what she eats chef alicia chan is trying out the climate diet what i'm having for dinner is just something i've gotten like that's like left over from work this diet devised by climate scientists and nutritionists from around the world is a detailed roadmap for how to eat in order to sustain a healthy planet but following the guidelines involves some obsessive attention to detail [Music] which is why i sought the help of tech team better.sg they spent weeks creating an app that would help alicia track the carbon emissions of everything she puts in her mouth [Music] i went out for dinner with my friends probably the first proper meal i've had all week hey so i'm trying to make good on my promise to eat less meat since yesterday's meat fest all foods have a carbon footprint we can't escape it we all need to eat [Music] which is why some companies in singapore are trying to do food production differently like the famed lab-grown chicken we made headlines around the world last december for being the first country to approve of it for public consumption investors are pouring money into agri-food tech companies in singapore placing their bets that the future of sustainable food will be in the labs not the fields while the main intention is to beef up singapore's food security could these products be a good idea for the planet [Music] too but will people have a stomach for this looking at our survey results nearly two in three are not willing to try alternative proteins like lab-grown meat insects and algae their main reason being uncomfortable about how their food was made i'm going to talk to some of these companies to find out how they plan to overcome the ick factor how are you i also want to know just how climate friendly are they i'm going to start with these so are these meant to be crab cakes it's made with microalgae protein flour it's made in a fermentation tank in a bioreactor we grow and harvest in three days compare that to be one and a half year water energy everything you know we are a fraction of what the conventional protein is microalgae are tiny cellular algae that photosynthesize and multiply in a bioreactor a piece of lab equipment in which live cell cultures can grow the result is microalgae protein flour which is an alternative protein to conventional meat like beef and seafood what about the energy required for your bioreactors energy required is only sanitization the algae grows in room temperature i think all of us are developing technology to grow food and nutrition in the metal tank why that is better is because that the conventional food and nutrition is grow out in the wild so we have to deposit i think this is meant to look like chicken and i presume it is chicken it tastes like chicken it looks like chicken it's actually chicken so yeah it is actually chicken lab-grown chicken in fact we don't really like to call it lab-grown chicken we prefer to call it culture chicken okay so there is meat that's meat but the difference is that there's no culling of animals and it's a lot better for the climate it's currently the chicken that is being shipped all the way from a particular region in the world across the globe it's a lot more efficient if i could grow that chicken locally in singapore for the local consumption each market could grow it locally for themselves eat just chicken is made by taking cells from a chicken feather and growing them in a bioreactor this mimics the inside of a chicken's body allowing the cells to multiply until they can be harvested to form chicken meat i'm going to challenge you the same thing what about the energy input into your cells culture we have empirical data there has been tremendous amount of research that has happened the quantum of carbon emission the quantum of land requirement the quantum of water requirement it's significantly lower because it's in a controlled environment that you're doing that is your chicken nutritionally equivalent to chicken yes it is we also feel that it's not really exposed to some of the diseases which could perhaps come due to improper handling of the conventional chicken so in fact i would say it's a shade better from that perspective and last but not least this taco just by tasting it alone are you able to pick up on what is the innovative ingredient i'm going to say lentils actually it's great that you mentioned that it tastes like a food product that you're familiar with right i think of all the ingredients that's put on the table the one from my company is the most unconventional one of the ingredients that is put in your taco is actually cricket powder cricket powder right so it's actually a cricket that is red in a closed environment and then it's harvested and processed into like a powder and then it can be used in any recipe protein is one of the nutrition values that is very high in cricket powder 100 grams of fresh chicken breast contains about 30 grams of protein but 100 gram of cricket powder contains about 70 grams of protein crickets are ravi's insect of choice because they are already consumed in some parts of the world but their biggest selling point is they multiply quickly so gram for gram of protein crickets produce only a quarter of the carbon emissions that chickens produce [Music] cricket cake instead of chicken anyone eating is a fairly emotional thing you're sort of putting things in your mouth how do you persuade people that these crickets chicken from a laboratory these are not words that people normally associate with food and you guys want them to think of them as food how do you do that it's some form of consumer learning that's required a consumer education that's required but once there's awareness increasing awareness amongst people they'll be increasing adoption as well so what we do is that we speak to many restaurants respect to many bakeries who understand how this product can be integrated into existing food options and they make food options like breads pizza dough pasta so you're taking something unusual but you're making it then look like something very familiar exactly right because that that actually removes many layers of uh of fear so if you can get over the ick factor these are reasonable substitutes but there are plenty of obstacles ahead like getting the product approved for sale lowering their costs to be competitive and getting the people to accept it what can we do till then [Music] alicia has been on the climate diet for the last week i'm checking back in with her to review how she did i was looking at the numbers and you've come in quite well below the recommendation yes or the diet yeah what's going on there were you able to log everything that you ate i would say i logged maybe about 80 of what i ate but due to the nature of my work i do a lot of tastings while on the go in the course of the day which it was very hard for me to log like i had a teaspoon of mashed potato or whatever it was okay when it came to making a choice between a meat-based dish or a soy based dish it was very clear to me while i was on the diet that i was going to go for the soy based dish you managed to have a fair amount of meat i just want to i'm just saying pretty much all of that meat happened on one night when i met my friends for dinner but i mean this is what's gonna happen with daily life you're gonna have a social life you're gonna go out for dinner with friends and you're not always going to have the option of having vegetarian options was that a friction in your day to have to think of every mouthful it definitely was if somebody was persuaded to try this what do you think they would be surprised at most um i think they would be surprised that it's not that hard and not that expensive if you put some effort into it so maybe you can give them a list of dishes or restaurants or places where they can buy food that would help them stick to this diet climate diet is a start it's a framework that helps us make thoughtful choices it will probably be some time before eating for the planet becomes a default rather than a challenge [Music] but for now i've learned that eating right can make as much difference as reducing single-use plastic or turning off our air conditioning from power to plastics a lot of change rests with policy makers businesses and scientists but when it comes to food you and i hold power every time we put something into our mouths [Music] the goal is simple eat less of certain foods especially those containing a lot of palm oil and meats the best part of a climate friendly diet is that it's better for our health imagine reduce our waistline and reduce lifestyle diseases and reduce carbon emissions and perhaps that is what the future should taste like [Music] you ,False,True,False,False

choose masks with a weave fine enough to protect us statistics tell us that about 97 of those infected develop symptoms within 11 to 12 days and about 99 will fall ill within 14 days which explains why it's a 14-day quarantine to keep the community safe and how do we decide that seniors should be among the first to be vaccinated well that's because we have data showing that it's 10 000 times more deadly for a 90 year old than a 9 year old [Music] so it was numbers like these that helped us form our first line of defense against an unknown enemy but apart from that data can also be revealing [Music] it can tell us how much life has changed during these unprecedented times and we can also draw from them lessons on how to survive and thrive in this post-pandemic world [Music] it's been over a year since the pandemic began and covet 19 has changed the way we live our lives door handles elevator buttons and even hands have all become covet coated booby traps [Music] and for most of us the long commute to the office has now become a few steps to our desk instead of long days stuck in meeting rooms we're now caught up in endless video calls and who knew the latest fashion accessory would be this a mask [Music] i can't remember the last time i shook someone's hand or performed in front of a live audience all these small changes hide a treasure trove of data revealing major social shifts normally i wouldn't get up close and personal with so many people but this time we're doing it for market research for science with safe distancing so if we're now a mask-wearing nation have our eyes truly become the windows to our soul and a pain to our wallets [Music] you see scientists have actually noticed that the pandemic has changed our relationship with our own faces but to what extent i'm going to study that starting with makeup hi excuse me so i did this review um you're looking for makeup today uh yeah let's see for eye makeup can we prepare for like our eyes [Music] because with the pandemic like we're wearing a mask the lipstick you can't really see it your eyes the only one you can see we have actually seen a drop versus a year ago for makeup however we are actually seeing like one-on-one increase in eye makeup so nowadays we are always meeting on zoom is there any particular color or type of makeup that has seen a pickup in sales in the past people actually are more into buying single color as well as dual color applicator for eye shadow now uh they have actually shifted more to the color palette where there are multiple colors when we weren't looking sales of eye makeup were reported to have skyrocketed all over the world and one of the world's biggest e-commerce companies alibaba even reported eye cosmetics going up 150 so for many the pandemic has changed long-held beauty routines and with masks becoming so ubiquitous the emphasis appears to have shifted to our eyes but are our masks hiding some serious upgrades underneath [Music] so we're trying first okay [Music] is it clear aligners are transparent forms of plastic braces uniquely tailored to fit each individual the shape of your teeth is captured using a scan [Music] and from this a set of aligners is 3d printed and over the course of between 12 and 18 months the plastic molds slowly move your teeth into the ideal position [Music] less painful and less awkward than metal braces this quest for perfect pearly whites doesn't come cheap the treatment can set you back anything from 1 500 to 7 000 us dollars open much more expensive than metal braces so at a time when some people are tightening their belts sales of clear aligners are taking off right around the back here there's a bit of misalignment at least two brands are reporting exponential growth i don't get it in this new era of masks and work from home why are people paying eye watering sums to sort out their smiles hey investment banking analyst tony is one of those people who paid more than four thousand dollars to get his perfect set of pearly whites what made you decide to begin the treatment why now why this year of all the years when the coffee heads everybody works from home every time i look in the zoo so that's when i started to really really seriously thinking about doing something on my teeth to make myself look confident and look better tony isn't alone four in ten singaporeans are now more conscious of their smiles with the surge and use of video calls [Music] it's not just orthodontists who are smiling all the way to the bank aesthetic doctors too are seeing an uptick in business so i'm heading from the dentist chair to the examining table scientists from the massachusetts hospital sent a survey to more than 100 dermatologists across the nation the results suggest a 56 increase in people seeking cosmetic procedures it's not just the united states cosmetic doctors and plastic surgeons around the world the uk australia japan south korea have all reported surges in bookings it's being called the zoom in singapore aesthetic clinics are also seeing a rise in enquiries and actual cosmetic enhancements done from eyelid surgery to face lifts to lip filler injections singaporeans are using this opportunity to get nipped and tucked dr adrian wee a plastic surgeon who's been in practice for more than 14 years fills me in on how this zoom boom has been keeping him busy what is it about zoom you know that has this big impact on how we view ourselves teleconferencing with programs such as zoom have led to people being more aware of the way they look because they're literally looking at themselves all day on the screen since everyone's worked from home might as well just get it done are you seeing more men coming in interestingly yes the past i think men would make up about maybe 10 of my aesthetic practice but now i would say it's about 20 even 30 percent this covet period has really been the catalyst i think for a lot of them to do stuff like droopy eyelids to correct the droopy eyelids or even get their eye backs done all right so doctor so with my face right how can you make it more zoomable for you you've got quite obvious eye bags so i'm just going to do a bit of marking minimally invasive techniques would be to mask those lines through the use of fillers if only this was like a magic pen and wherever you drew it the corrections just oh man then i'll be out of business place the pillar product right at the line there i think you look great wow okay i've just finished the procedure and it feels numb i can definitely see some improvement especially for my left eye the whole process took what 10 minutes maybe at most that's as far as i go there are clearly others who go even further dr we recently saw an uptick of 50 new patients in his clinic jamie is one of them so what procedure are you thinking i'm getting now it's a surgical procedure yeah it's called the scarless eye back you know can you see the second layer yeah just a bit yeah it's it's noticeable after you mention it but it's more noticeable on zoom call because for photos you can edit but on video is very hard the proliferation of meeting apps has created new phrases in our lexicon zoom boom zoom face zoom fatigue and well the latest i heard zoom body dysmorphia it means finding your own image in a group video call so unappealing that you can't focus on anything else but how often does that happen and why do we suffer from body zoom dysmorphia dr adrian wang reveals that he too has found himself becoming more anxious during the pandemic in fact it spurred him on to delve deeper into the psychology behind zoom meetings having to stare at your own face over a screen for hours on end seems to magnify that problem so people again start to obsess and dwell over what they perceive as imperfections and this can worsen their anxiety and their mental health is this issue just simply us finding ourselves more unattractive or is there something deeper in general i would say that no it's not a standalone problem by itself but it's an important component of many of the things that that stress people out because of of the pandemic how many people do you think in singapore have this are affected by this body zoom dysmorphia i see about 15 to 20 patients a day and most of them have work related stress from zoom and virtual meetings and you multiply that with with all the mental health professionals and counselors in singapore you come up with a pretty big number before the pandemic many people saw working from home as a luxury but when we were forced home or mass many found the office became a long forgotten dream destination [Music] in fact a survey conducted on more than 3 000 singaporeans in the middle of 2020 found that nearly two-thirds of those who worked from home reported feeling stressed in another survey around the same period 78 of those in the study said that they were anxious about economic issues while 37 said they feared contracting the coronavirus at malls or public places and this stress is manifesting itself in unexpected corners third straight day singapore has recorded more than a thousand new infections the region has seen more than three five million cases more than one million people have died in the coca-19 pandemic over the past year the world has been focused on the rising number of infections but it appears our single-minded focus on those numbers may have blinded us to other health issues i've never liked visiting the dentist but luckily this time i'm not getting my teeth checked or so i think i'm here because the national dental center singapore saw a spike in the number of people seeking endodontic treatment in 2020 endodontics a specialist branch in dental treatment that deals with problems such as complex root issues teeth replacements cracked teeth basically barely damaged teeth and i'm on the dentist chair because the spike in cases of damaged teeth has been so dramatic during the pandemic that dr tra from the dental center insists that since i'm here for his interview that i should get my teeth checked oh boy right put it together any pain on your teeth on your function um no not not usually any pain in the jaw joints uh no joints no okay any headaches in the morning headaches uh no not really are you aware if you're clenching or grinding uh yes just once in a while in a day oh day time i can spot a crack lying on the canine okay thank you doctor i'm just like super surprised that i have cracked teeth um it's due to my clenching cracked it can happen if you buy very hard foods like eyes and bones but people do not bite very hard foods so the majority of the case that we see as a result of clenching and not grinding there are distinct differences so grinding is like you wear off the teeth but clenching is you just bite them bend the teeth and then bend the teeth and then they crack according to dr choi the root causes behind teeth clenching are largely psychological in the past we did some research on it 38 of the patients they were tend to be moderately depressed in the center here our percentage of females to males about 80 percent females to 20 males in this dynamic situation there are issues of the mind the challenging times so i would anticipate this to happen more cracks and teeth often come about because of excessive clenching and grinding of teeth at night our teeth enamel is actually harder than steel in the day the bite force on our teeth ranges from 1 to 10 kilograms at night this force can go up to an estimated 30 to 50 kilograms imagine that so some of us could be busy grinding at night i wonder if the panama's changed other things that happen when the lights go out something i rather enjoy something that most of us probably can't get enough of i'm talking about sleep in a global survey by an app measuring sleep quality with 70 000 participants 37 reported taking longer to fall asleep since the start of the pandemic i've been getting way less sleep than usual and what is needed but then again i've also got a newborn baby to take care of i wonder if singaporeans are also facing the same sleep problems and i know just the people to ask the people who work here have you ever wondered what it's like to be a sleep doctor must be a dream job take a seat thank you dr kenny pang pioneer of innovative surgical procedures in the sleep medicine industry that's why you tend to find that your sleep quality is even poorer right now is passionate about helping people to get some quality shut eye yes since the pandemic i've seen at least a two or three-fold increase in the number of patients that see me for sleeplessness why is this so it's multi-factorial stress in the economy stress in their jobs as well and now that they have to stay home there's always tend to be some form of friction going on at home most of my patients can range from about 20s to about 50s and men women women more they tend to be more anxious personalities and more perfectionists compared to men men tend to be more type b they're more relaxed i would have thought that because more people are working from home and staying home longer then it is we have more time to fall asleep they take for granted that they can wake up later in the morning so they tend to sleep later at night we shift our clock backwards we mess up our circadian rhythm and a lot of times this can lead to sleeplessness or even insomnia so then what do you recommend is the best way to sleep a lot of my patients are sleepless for a short period of time and i teach them sleep hygiene sleep regularly every night 11 00 p.m to 7 a.m in a quiet cool and dark area they should not use any blue light emitting devices two hours before sleep no exercise four hours before sleep and avoid stimulants there's a whole checklist oh yes but it helps if you didn't sleep well or you wake up tired you'll be moody irritable short-tempered your relationships are affected your work is affected your so-called productivity is affected so your stress never goes up so this affects your personal self-esteem and your confidence as well clearly stress sleep and mental health are intertwined [Music] triggered by the stress and strains of kobe 19 we reach for the junk food [Music] and with work from home leaving us more sedentary than ever before many of us have gone from fab to flab [Music] according to grab the start of the circuit breaker saw double the demand for desserts such as frozen yogurt fast food orders specifically burgers and fried chicken also rose by over 30 during this period well it's no wonder that experts have coined a new term to describe a rise in obesity caused by kovit 19. kobe bcd [Music] so in a global survey conducted in 2020 over one quarter of all respondents said they put on weight in singapore the proportion is even higher one in three people said they piled on the kilos during the pandemic and of those who gained weight thirty percent reported an average increase of around five kilograms a weight gain that's the result of moving less and eating more thanks to the pandemic a reminder that covet 19 can hit us even without an infection in any given period the national cancer center sees a steady stream of new cancer diagnoses referred to the specialist here [Music] but from february to july in 2020 it reported a nearly 26 drop in new referrals [Music] what's the reason for this fall i think partly because during that period there were real uh worries about people entering the healthcare facilities especially when during the height of covet there were a decrease in for example breast mammography done during the period of time there was a decrease in colonoscopy done during a period of time and i think those decrease in screening could have contributed in a slight decrease in incidence of cancer during the period there might also be a decrease in the willingness of patients to visit the doctors one of the repercussions of someone coming in to diagnose their cancer a bit later i think if if the delay is about a month or two it's very unlikely that it will significantly impact upon this diagnosis but of course if the delay go on for months or months then there will be a significant impact it's always better to treat the cancer as earlier stages than later stages a study in the uk estimates that across 20 cancer tumor types just a six month delay in cancer referrals will result in over 9 000 fatalities and over 170 000 life years lost fortunately for singapore it has not come to that so while singapore's medical system did not collapse under the pressure of the pandemic the virus has brought us down in other ways and is hitting us where it hurts through a mess of new data we've seen how covet 19 can impact us even without an infection this pandemic has triggered a mental health crisis more of us are stress grinding our teeth and emotional eating has left many of us overweight and unhealthy but covert 19 has hit us where it really hurts no not there i mean our wallets global economies are suffering the worst recessions since the second world war the world trade organization reported the steepest drop in global trade on record from march to june 2020 and as a global trade hub singapore has been hit hard the city saw its worst quarter in history over the same period which also coincided with the start of the circuit breaker and from the unemployment charts it is not hard to see who the hardest hit are this is the unemployment rate of those in their 30s it rose from 2.3 percent in september 2019 to 3.5 in september 2020. this means that there were about 19 000 people aged 30 to 39 who were unemployed now if we take a look at the same chart for the people aged 40 to 49 not only do we see an uptick in unemployment for this group of people but the rate was higher and the rate of increase steeper but amid the dark economic clouds there has been a secret revolution going on during the circuit breaker cash was no longer king and e-payments took center stage according to dbs singapore's largest bank digital banking transactions rose 40 in 2020 compared to the year before there was an unprecedented drop in cash usage of 28 and in 2020 460 000 of us paid online for the first time what's more amazing about a quarter of their number which means 120 000 are aged 50 and up as the cashless society we have been talking about for years finally arrived riding on the coattails of a pandemic i'm banking on e-payment enthusiast xi zi kuhn to give me the answers i need so when's the last time you actually use cash to pay for something well i honestly cannot remember it's been so long ago i i can't remember i i don't believe i i use cash anymore i was here four years ago interviewing about payla and cashless payments and i felt like it didn't seem to take up until the pandemic happened do you think that that was like a catalyst for everyone to go cashless i think last year was a was it was a year where it all came together the needs arising from the pandemic where i guess people might not want to touch cash that much we partnered with government agencies to roll out these capabilities to educate a lot of these merchants on digital payments it's safe it's convenient and so we start to see a lot of adoption points there are already about 180 000 points where you can actually use payla when it came to corporate pay now transactions that was actually a six-fold increase smes were traditionally paying through checks have adopted digital payments instead would you say like you know this is the beginning of the end of cash well i would say this is certainly the beginning of a huge transformation a digital revolution one day in the very near future cash could be obsolete but there's one enduring truth where the money flows crime always follows and this pandemic has shown that criminals are one of the most resilient and adaptable players of the economy in 2020 reported cases of traditional crime decreased by 15.3 that's a drop of 4 000 cases and yet overall crime climbed 6.5 in the whole year that's because scams saw a near 65.1 increase in 2020. specifically e-commerce scams increased by 19.1 percent in 2020 compared to the year before and the total amount cheated tripled from 2.3 million dollars to 6.9 million dollars carousel is one of singapore's favorite digital platforms for buying and selling items but in the first half of 2020 they took the top spot for the highest number of scams on digital platforms most of the scams involved deals that seemed too good to be true and in 2020 scams involving masks hand sanitizers and thermometers grew at a feverish pace i don't understand how and why people still fall for scams like these as an online shopper i can tell if it's a scam just by looking at a person's sales numbers and reviews or so i think i'm at carousel's office in singapore and they want to put me to the test so yeah this is the account what do you think um zero followers zero following just join today it might be a fake account what's the difference between a new account like a legit new user and a scammer even if you're new some people will try to make it an effort to feel like a real person you can put out a profile picture description let's take a look at the listings and you can tell me what do you think okay so this is a 500 brand new packaging apple watch series six shipping register meal um it looks this this listing looks legit to me new accounts um they won't straightaway like post a very high risk high value listing usually i would think that it's like a sign of suspicious activity solin is the woman in charge of trust and safety issues at carousel her team uses a mix of artificial intelligence and automated technology to help detect and shut down any signs of suspicious activity so in 2020 we've deactivated about 50 000 accounts um this is to prevent bad actors from indiscriminately creating disposable accounts where they scam and move on scam and move on how successful has have these measures been over the course of 2020 we saw 67 drop in uh our fraud incident rate i don't really expect another huge spike like what we saw before but i think you know it'll not go away um in the early months we saw scams were around mass and sanitizers right and then during circuit breaker in april it's all about nintendo switch scan and playstation scan so as long as the next big thing is happening that's where the scammers are going to go to yes yes so the criminals have followed us into cyberspace and if there's one more thing we can gather from these numbers it's that while we love going online we love the great outdoors more than ever in fact we might be embracing this healthier lifestyle a little bit too hard nothing has turned our lives upside down like this pandemic since it began the only globetrotting i've done is on google earth tilt earth down whoa the only parties i've attended are virtual hello happy birthday thank you and all my meetings have been online wait a minute you see my virtual background also doesn't work so where's the silver lining in a survey commissioned by cna we're driving less we've also been taking public transport less on the other hand we've been doing more walking and cycling and 40 of us claim to be more active than ever before in 2019 singapore organized 116 races when the virus made such mass events impossible the runs went virtual and that's when running fever really hit virtual organizer 42 race saw the number of races in 2020 double compared to the previous year but what's the appeal of racing on your own for the most part virtual runs require participants to complete a certain distance by a specified date progress is recorded via gps tracking apps and devices with screenshots uploaded to the organizers as proof i'm meeting april chong a virtual race enthusiast since march 2020 she has taken part in more than 200 virtual races now she's teaching me how to prepare for one virtual run offers flexibility that uh you can get to choose uh your own venue your own time and your own distance then why the need to join a virtual run engine every day just run you know it's very motivating because if you set a goal that you want to do a certain distance then after that you complete it within your own targeted number of days it it feels good it all started um when i did a 5.5 kilometer over 55 days last year as in every day five point five kilometers yes i have to clock so it's like you know i've cut 40 days no i i have to finish 55 days so and then after that it became a habit so it's like right now morning if i don't start running it's just something's wrong yeah yeah like like no coffee you know so it's different from mass runs this one you're running by yourself don't you miss the social aspect of being with people everyone running together along like benjamin shows bridge and that kind of thing okay that's a different joy all together so if for those people who still likes to compete there's this leadership board and you can all track the runners you know who is first then you will run faster so what are the other benefits of virtual running um it builds up seminar you can start very uh short distance and then over a period of time if you can meet that and you get more motivated or you're more confident that you can do longer distance and then in the longer run you will get to want to do more things so let's get me started okay let's do [Music] this feel the sweat pouring down your face adrenaline pumping all through your veins deep feel ready at the start of the race time for glory push through the pain [Music] our new enthusiasm for running is also triggering a gold rush on running shoes so even as the economy is doing badly shoemakers are breaking it in decathlon singapore recorded a 41 increase in their running shoes sales between february and july in 2020 but what's all that physical activity doing to us knee slightly bent dr mizan avid cyclist and orthopedic surgeon gives us the bare bones truth 12. okay dr mizan was there any particular type of injury that you saw an increase in during or after the circuit breaker a lot of it was overuse injuries mostly of the shoulder and knee two of the most common exercises now in singapore are running and cycling so for running people are running further distances more regularly where they used to run 5 km a week they may now run 20 or 30. wow that's a huge jump ring your body is just not used to that to be overwhelmed with so much physical demand but we do see things like stress fractures as well and lots of long distance runners like marathon runners they have a lot of pain in their shins in the middle of your of your tibia right here okay and the way we we diagnose it is again from the history we know that they've suddenly ramped up their physical activity in a short period of time so stress fractures are just like tiny cracks in the bone tiny cracks tiny tiny tiny cracks enough to cause pain you don't need surgery so is this pandemic caused spike and injuries going to last we see different kinds of injuries right now we're all stuck in singapore alright no one's going on a holiday people are doing a lot of group exercises not just for the exercise but the social aspect of it but not everyone has the same physical level of physical fitness or ability just take it at your own pace if you have to slow down to catch your breath or to stretch so be it it's not a competition be it walking or running or cycling the pandemic has allowed us to embrace singapore's great outdoors forget the hot trendy new bars or restaurants national parks are now the hottest tickets in town 2020 saw nearly 50 000 people visit pulau bin nearly double the year before bugatima nature reserve drew more than twice its usual visitors hitting 75 000. wetland reserve saw numbers swell three times over to 33 000 [Music] and people aren't just enjoying green singapore they're also trying to nurture some nature back home in june 2020 anne parks announced plans to give away 150 000 packets of homegrown fruit and vegetable seeds the response was overwhelming they ended up handing out four hundred thousand packets instead in 2020 local facebook group urban farmers singapore also saw their membership grow by a third adding ten thousand new members why would a pandemic make urbanites like us grow green fingers [Music] all right jack jack young helps run urban farmers and he's a man who knows his peonies from his pansies i've got microgreens going this is this is red radish this is this is wasabi mustard yeah pinch of a whole bunch of it yeah thanks oh wow there it is wasabi yeah yeah so if you have a whole bunch of it yeah the kick just goes like straight through whoa and this is what you call organic rice yeah yeah yeah no pesticides so why do you think more and more people were picking up urban farming during the panama i think they had more time there's also the this thing about food security i could just come out harvest whatever i need go in and prepare dinner over here this is um rosemary um a mediterranean herb not easy to grow but we like it because my wife um does roasts like roast potatoes so it's chicken sometimes it goes with a steak oh yes oh don't make me hungry jack it's also therapeutic to just check out your plants so that that probably led to the increase so i mean apart from your corridor there's some greenery on other corridors as well you know have your neighbors caught on oh yes i started sharing like micro greens and just to encourage them to try and then from then on they moved up you know to to leafy vegetables and stuff so you planted the seeds in your neighbors so to speak and now they're wearing fruit yeah yeah in a way yes so this is broccoli this is broccoli yeah broccoli so this is this is the micro greens version basically seedlings you know [Music] do you think the interest in urban farming is here to stay so interest may wane you know um but there are those people who have found it fulfilling and definitely they are going to pursue this you know in the long term what are the effects of urban farming on us in the long run well definitely you see that there's a slight shift in the mindset you can actually grow crops within your house with technological advances things like grow lights hydroponic systems the authorities have taken notice of the needs of the people they have opened up lots of land for small scale urban farming which is which is really great while working from home has spurred some to take up home gardening others have clearly turned to home baking in singapore searches for the word baking usually rise just a little every christmas [Music] but in 2020 the searches spiked in early april after the circuit breaker was announced [Music] i'm heading to abc baking studio time to dust off my apron suit up and see if i have what it takes to bake it help we have a lot of first timer coming for our classes and why do you think there was this increase in demand currently a lot of people are working from home so they actually have more free time to explore their hobbies so yeah they come for baking classes you know out of all the different hobbies that we could do at home why baking baking is a skills that probably could bring them some side incomes so after baking they can actually sell their products rachel lowe picked up baking almost a year ago her baked goods however are for personal consumption only have you always been someone who bakes at home or is this something new to you well before a skit breaker i never thought of baking during the two months we actually stay at home so i have more time to make baking for me is actually therapeutic i should enjoy every single step of it i signed up for the whole cake course so i actually have plans to actually learn more techniques okay let's try what we have baked today yeah come here to try my medallions [Music] [Music] while kobe 19 has given us the opportunity to take up hobbies we wouldn't have done so otherwise i think it's safe to say that most of us want the pandemic to end as soon as possible and trust me if i could beat it out of this door i would with the vaccine roll out underway it seems like all the ingredients needed to end the pandemic are there [Music] if strict control measures in singapore hold up against new contagious strains most of us are unlikely to catch covet 19. [Music] but we still need to keep our hygiene habits up our stress levels low oh yeah and our emotions in check [Music] because if there is one thing the numbers have taught us it's this even if the virus itself doesn't make you sick watch out for the fallout from the pandemic because if we're not careful it may well be the fallout that will hurt us and that's why it matters ,True,False,False,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",uh so my question is about the number of uh recent suicide and attempted suicide incidents involving workers living in dormitories right um so my questions uh are what uh you know what is the mts assessment of the anxiety and unhappiness of workers especially those in more badly affected dorms and how had their welfare been looked after mentally and also whether is mental health increasingly an area that the mtf is looking into by formulating a more comprehensive plan to address these budding issues thank you thank you very much for the question we're indeed concerned about the fact that our migrant workers have been accommodated in in facilities uh under vetted regimes they have not been allowed to come out of the dormitories into the community freely and that prolonged period of isolation will obviously have potential adverse effects on any individual not just the micro workers but anyone who in fact has to be cooped up in isolation with very limited opportunities for social interaction so this is a concern for us the in inter-agency task force working with mom and various private stakeholders partners have in fact been looking at how to support the welfare of these migrant workers in a variety of different ways they've taken pains to help the migrant workers to celebrate holidays to make their stay within the lockdown dormitories as meaningful as is possible albeit within the the lockdown regime that they are in they've also offered help through a variety of ways with an opportunity for them to call in hotlines for help there are staff that come down and encourage workers to step forward if necessary for counselling so mental health has been a concern for that particular task force for quite a while ever since they started work in the dormitories we continue to work on this piece and they have the task force has a work group looking very specifically at mental health issues and they have involved various partners across many domains including counselors social workers psychiatrists psychologists to see how to better improve the support that can be provided to men uh to migrant workers in this regard uh the uh we are aware also of incidence of self-harm or attempted self-harm through suicide in some of the individuals in the dormitories this is a cause of concern and task force continues to look at it to see how to reach out to support migrant workers who have a needs uh uh that have to be addressed in this regard uh and they're looking at ways to to reach out and support them further uh this continues to be a work in progress so i i do not pretend that that work is completed that we have a very comprehensive system of support but the task force is committed to making sure that the mental health needs of the migrant workers uh are looked into supported not just now but there is a sustainable framework that would continue in the dormitories even after the outbreak is comes under control within the dormitories ,True,True,True,True
90,gD7k4o8JBJI,CNN-News18,Kerala Model Failing To Fight Covid? | Covid 19 Latest News | PM Modi New Cabinet | CNN News18 LIVE,2021-02-04T06:35:31Z,"During the high-level meeting over medical oxygen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi instructed officials to ensure that the plants are made functional at the earliest. “Ensure adequate training of hospital staff on operation and maintenance of oxygen plants. Deploy advanced technology like IoT to track performance and functioning of oxygen plants,” PM Modi said.

PM Modi on Friday chaired a high-level meeting on the augmentation and availability of medical oxygen as the country prepares for an imminent third wave of Covid-19. Meanwhile, vaccination for children 12 to 18-year-old is set to begin in India from September with Zydus shots.

With more than three crore COVID-19 cases and above four lakh deaths, one would think that Indians understand the graveness of COVID-19 and would abide by the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour of wearing masks and social distancing as the sacred law of existence; however, as the recent incidents of overcrowding have made it amply clear, that’s not the case

More than 1,500 PSA Oxygen plants are coming up across the nation. PSA Oxygen plants contributed by PM CARES would support over four lakh oxygenated beds, it was revealed during the meeting.

The meeting of the new Union cabinet has begun on Thursday a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi effected a major reshuffle, inducting as many as 36 new ministers. The meeting is taking place virtually.

A total of 43 ministers took oath at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Wednesday as part of the mega reshuffle.

The new ministers who took oath as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reshuffled cabinet yesterday assumed charge today. In a mega rejig, PM Modi brought in Sarbananda Sonowal, Narayan Rane and Jyotiraditya Scindia as Cabinet ministers while dropping as many as 12 ministers including Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar. As many as 15 Cabinet ministers, including some new faces, were sworn in at the swearing-in ceremony held in the Darbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhawan. There are 53 union ministries. However, these ministries will be handled only by 30 Cabinet Ministers and two Ministers of State with Independent Charge.

India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7, 30 lakh on August 23, 40 lakh on September 5 and 50 lakh on September 16. It went past 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, crossed 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and surpassed the one-crore mark on December 19. India crossed the grim milestone of two crore on May 4 and three crore on June 23. The 911 new fatalities include 439 from Maharashtra, 142 from Kerala and 62 from Karnataka.

That could be due to increased mental preparedness following the SARS outbreak. Associate Professor Vijay Kumar Sharma from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Sociology Professor Paulin Straughan from Singapore Management University discussed the research and mental preparedness among Singapore's healthcare workers.

psychological distress when compared with previous outbreaks that could be due to increased mental preparedness following SARS for a closer look we're joined by associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma in the NUS a young rule in School of Medicine and by sociology professor Pauline strong from the Singapore Management University thank you both for joining us I will come to you first a pleasure Vijay how much correlation is there actually between increased mental preparedness and stringent infection control measures versus anxiety and psychological distress levels among healthcare workers you know it started from the South period when in 2003 we were attacked by us there were about 238 individuals which got infection and surprisingly 97 which makes about 41 percent of them were healthcare workers and the mortality at that time was 14 percent so there was a lesson to us and that prompted us that we should be prepared that something like this can hit us again so in the car you know I take it back like this that probably we were anticipating there's something like kovat 19 we'll be coming back again so since 2003 we had implemented an Hospital very strict infection control measures they were training programs for masks hand-washing and they were very frequently done almost like six monthly everybody has to undergo that kind of training so that prepared us so what happened the as soon as we got this Cove in 1900 at least our all health care workers they were immediately mentally prepared that we can jump into this war field and then we can battle it out definitely so this was actually this showed that we were mentally prepared now one important thing in this fighting you know such an outbreak like covert 19 is that we should have knowledge and we should have confidence so we were prepared with the knowledge because Hospital had prepared you know education programs there was a transparency we were updated on a daily basis what was the condition of it 19 how old 19 gets infected how people get infected how to prevent yourself from getting infected all these things they were in place so that prepared from knowledge point of view and confidence we were trained strongly and for a very long period how to fight infections how to be clean how to prepare ourselves for this infection probably that prepared us to fight this battle so we were both strong in another confidence as well as mentally preparedness from our experience so professors Vijay saying that then how is the situation here in Singapore compared with other parts of the world that are also struggling and you know dealing with cover 19 so I can talk about the healthcare workers so I I told you about the about a Singapore story but what happened outside there are very very few studies which are available on healthcare workers what is psychological impact of this illness whatever we have we have got a couple of studies one came up from Italy one came up from China and it was seen that almost all work health care workers they were having some kind of psychological impact and it was at least moderate in severity you know it is big it's to be taken in account that both these countries Italy as well as China they were massively hit the the you know the magnitude of impact of covenant infection was immense the Italian studies showed that about 10% of those who got the infection they were actually health care workers so this was such a heavy toll they will definitely be having much more psychological anxiety stress depression and all kind of emotional reactions which was seen in media you know from Italy and China they were probably reflection of the magnitude of the scale of this event and we know we know it that Europe and best they were never prepared for such kind of attacks they never have suffered these kind of attacks its Asia Africa which have been going through all these attacks in between you know the epidemics they keep coming so we were definitely mentally as well as physically as well as from resources point of view are definitely better prepared and professors drawn we're one week into the circuit breaker now and already some tightened measures have been kicked in as a result of some who've been so testing boundaries if you like based on what you've observed so far are people behaving in in a way that's sort of expected during a time like this office let me thank all our healthcare workers I think that they really deserve our admiration and praise and for keeping things in control so with regards to the general public right I think we had the opposite right Vijay said that the health care workers the professionals were prepared for for the next infectious disease you know attack and therefore when Kovac came they were already the lay public on the other hand we've been so safe in Singapore we have been so used to having you know a very peaceful life so this came as a big shock to us right and when the measures stepped in that we had to vary our normal everyday life it took the Singaporeans along the time to get used to it because I just don't understand at one lever you know that this disease is so infectious and at another lever it is also difficult to break from norm habits because we we have lived in the very very densely packed society we're used to rubbing you know elbows with each other so therefore if I'm not touching you that's already the social distance in my mind right so what more there's 1 meter 2 meter thing so I think we had to learn and I think the way Flender had laid out you know the rules as they're lay it on was quite remarkable it demonstrated to me and made me realize that it was a step by step calibrator approach and in every stance you know government had trust the Singaporeans you know to to abide by the boundaries and when we failed then most stringent rules had to be stepped in had to be Roden because we had to protect the vulnerable so I think that at the end of the day most Singaporeans okay obviously when you go out to the streets now it's very empty people are law-abiding no one is crowding you out in the supermarket or in the hawker centres and we're trying our best to to be good citizens and to do our part we hear of you know those who are you know who break the rules because for whatever reason but most of them I think most cases because they don't understand but by and large I think the community has pulled together this is certainly one of the better places to be in at this time in this global crisis I think all of us who live in Singapore are very grateful that we are here so or in oh I think we're doing what we're doing out our best we can do better and I'm sure in the weeks to come we will demonstrate that we will be able to do better okay well thank you both for speaking to us this evening associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma from the NUS young Newland school of medicine and sociology professor Pauline stron from the Singapore Management University ,True,True,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",it's very squeezy and uncomfortable to having dinner inside the room it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail these aren't videos from a year ago they were given to us just a few weeks back it's been 11 months since the kovic 19 virus exploded in foreign worker dormitories and a total lockdown was declared since then dormitories have been cleared of the virus and migrant workers have gone back to work the pandemic put a spotlight on the 300 000 or so foreign workers who are housed in mass dormitories [Music] their living conditions provided the perfect storm for a pandemic to spread one year on i find out what's being done to control the infection in dorms and its impact on our foreign workers hi over the course of three months we contacted migrant workers for their stories in this episode of talking point i'm going to show you their lives through their eyes unfiltered later on this is my dormitory here is a playground before we played here but now it's totally restricted my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook so we have to choose cattle our dining area still empty we are not allowed to come here and eat we have to take our meal inside the room one room got 12 people if we want to go supermarket to buy something groceries we have to change our pass while some of our migrant workers live in accommodations such as rented and private housing about half of them live in mass dormitories all located in obscure parts of singapore it was in these dorms where coven-19 cases exploded leading to over 150 000 workers infected the government moved in to seal off the dorms began a regime of mass testing disinfecting the premises and instituting safe distancing measures by august infection rates dropped and the lockdown was lifted most workers could go back to work i asked those who live in dormitories to tell me what life is like for them now staircase also medicated we are not allowed to take staircase while we are collecting our food from the catering we have to take a long queue to collect foods or buy foods so all the migraine workers are depressed right now following all rules and regulation restriction video stood out to me the most so i'm giving him a call to find out more sakib works as a safety coordinator and has been living in singapore for 11 years it's been about five months since his dormitory was released from lockdown [Music] we are not really allowed to go out on the field or any playground we are not even allowed to gathering on corridor yeah we are only allowed to go to toilet use toilet and come back to our room we are not really able to go all those facilities system like cooking and sports zone or physical exercise because the restriction is still in there before covet 19 struck workers could access these facilities and congregate in open spaces freely so do you feel like you are still in lockdown yeah i do feel because i'm not really able to go out in community and i'm not really able to take any public transport and i'm not really able to cook yet and i'm not able to go to playground there is so many restrictions still in my room so i feel actually i mean [Music] i can totally understand why there are restrictions i mean even for you and i we've got all these new social distancing rules because of this pandemic but i can't help but wonder if the rules imposed on our migrant workers are a bit too much [Music] i want to experience for myself what life in a dorm under these restrictions is like i was denied access into sakif's dorm but i was allowed to visit another dormitory ten months ago this place was declared an isolation area it was one of the first few dormitories in singapore to be identified as a covet-19 cluster at that time about 7 000 migrant workers here were under lockdown one of them is surge good morning good morning prepare myself fast food packing so can you leave the room for work anytime you no no no like i only transport timing only i go back outside to minimize congestion workers can only leave their room for work at designated times so just now behind there is the last scan yeah this one last scan can go out for work hd wordpress this one permit green means can go out for work i am a healthy uh red means not allowed to work oh and how do they find out you know if you're green red yeah this one tasting surface blood test workers and dormitories are tested for covet 19 every two weeks all right thank you i'll see you at night while suresh is at work i noticed the barricades outside and inside the dormitory i've asked to speak to the man in charge of this dormitory i want to know if all of this is necessary jimmy why are there all these restrictions in dormitories these restrictive measures are very very important in order to indicate the infection weights therefore it's really really necessary to reduce the crowding and also our co-mingling of the workers within the dormitory so as you can see this is the segregation measures or even the new entry points basically ensure that we have multiple releasing points in this dormitory so as to ensure that the residuals go in and out of the dormitory swiftly and also go through the necessary checks so definitely the intention is to try to keep them safe and well socially distanced right that's right there's a definite lack of social interaction now have the workers gotten used to that well they have no choice practically we realize that they do need to have some social life they do need to entertain [Music] it's 8 pm and suresh has just returned from work as the residents here aren't allowed to eat in the canteen for now they can take away food from there or cook their own dinner something that this dormitory unlike at suckabs has provided for [Music] [Music] suresh after work what do you do in your free time after work for coming room after dress up cooking then makan go bed now see movies play games phone home calling just things so before covet what did you used to do when you were free before covet i sometimes free time i go out just i sometime only i meet my friends do you miss doing those things that you used to do yeah miss but no choice from what i see suresh is allowed to cook and it's not very cramped where he eats since my visit to his dorm the gym has opened up and communal sports have resumed but i'm discovering that restrictions differ across dormitories with some being more stringent than others and as i'm about to find out strict rules don't just apply within the dorms but even on the one day these workers are supposed to get their rest and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes [Music] i'm in little india typically on a sunday you'd see many foreign workers gather in open spaces like these to socialize or to play games but today it's noticeably quiet as evening falls i try to speak to some of the migrant workers but finding ones who stay in dormitories is proving to be challenging oh do you stay in a dormitory no damage no no i use the house no dormitory company house and i soon find out why your friends were in the dormitory what are they allowed to do they're allowed to two hour or one hour later three hour the government give the permission the dormitory people they give permission only they go out forever and so you don't need them a long time never sit there last time have contact but now they cannot come out you ever know what they do on the resident of they also they stay in the house or dormitory inside these workers i'm meeting don't stay in dormitories so they're not subjected to the same kind of restrictions since the pandemic migrant workers living in dormitories can only go to purpose-built recreation centers on their rest days these centers have amenities like fnb outlets a barber remington service and a supermarket i'm waiting for kavikuma he typically comes to this recreation center in sambawang once a week i want to know if that's enough for him hi hey kavi did you come for the dormitory yes how do you normally come here i just  only take the bubbly kavi is allowed to go to a recreation center only because he comes from a dorm clear of covet 19. still he needs to produce a negative swap test and apply for an exit pass he is only allowed to go to a recreation center assigned to him to apply for an exit permit like how long does it normally yeah so at least two days or one days before we have to apply and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes that's it yeah but no enough but no choice we are only allowed three hours are you shopping today [Music] so you mentioned that you are here for three hours yeah is that enough for you of course no enough because normally we are only a load work and come back to dom yeah uh only one day alone exit was to come here so also i only allowed rc i'm not going to other place so what do you think you missed the most mostly is that i cannot see my relative here because only i can see that uh my dormitory my co-workers this other thing i really miss thank you okay thanks so much man for bringing me okay thank you bye bye after seeing what a recreation center is like and talking to kavi i can see why he wants to come here more often just so he can maximize his time outside the dormitory but even then he only has three hours a week outside and that includes travel time [Music] go liberation center then come back send money only because so boring our company lori bring and bring back to home it takes one and a half hour left one and a half hour i really couldn't make my time to meet friends and have fun for me it's not enough because it's very small small small place it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail just go go eating only eating watching movie like that and then go on bed lying in bed resting that's why it's very hard from us hi i'm good thanks for having me these strict rules imposed on our migrant workers have been going on months after lockdown it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people and i'm about to find out the dire effects i've been tracking migrant workers to hear their stories about what life has been like since covet 19 exploded in their dormitories this is the picture i'm getting the dorms me no longer being locked down but some of these workers still aren't able to do the things that they used to like gather with their friends for a meal and this is not just within the dormitories but even outside on their day off but just being able to spend their rest day outside is so troublesome that many choose to stay in i'm meeting rashid early this year his company moved him to a private accommodation as his dormitory was too far from his current work site yeah hi how are you i'm good thanks for having me over yeah thank you also this is where you stay now uh yes it's my accommodation nice russia tells me life is better living outside of dormitory but i'm surprised to learn he is still facing restrictions if i extend dormitory they have all the rules given by the dormitory and mom and government also need to follow here also i need to follow but still i don't uh go around like shopping mall or anything i just go out for my essential to buy food only so even though you don't stay in a dormitory yes you still have restrictions yes why is that restriction is uh from government uh mom bca as i am a safety personnel in my job site so i need to follow the bca requirements all those requirements they have still now we don't have any approval to go outside like as before so how do you feel now that you can't really do those things it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people we also need refresh my our mind how do you cope with that kind of feeling like how do you make yourself feel better i doing a lot of voluntary job as i am mentally depressed last time so i trying to teach other person who also mentally depressed i'm a safety coordinator for jobsite in my company and my job to take care all my company people whoever working in my side or outside so i have to take care of their health how are they feeling every single person have different feeling so in this case few of them they say they are very bored because during kobe they cannot go home leave so they miss their family few of them they say they are mentally not so good advocacy groups have pointed to prolonged confinement and job uncertainties affecting the mental state of many migrant workers in singapore so much so that a government task force was set up in november to enhance mental care support among the initiatives deploying public officers to dormitories so they can look out for workers who may be showing signs of anxiety or stress [Music] after months talking to our migrant workers i'm taking what i've learned to the manpower ministry martin cole oversees all the plans rolled out by the ministry's new division ace set up to take the lead in the fight against covet 19 in foreign worker dormitories [Music] martin i've been speaking to some migrant workers after lockdown and they brought up some issues which i was hoping that you could answer so firstly within the dorms they're going back to work but they still have some restrictions my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook what's your response to that there are dorms that have on sweet cooking facilities now those that have communal cooking facilities that was where we had the restriction we were trying to control the the infection the transmission but we have already lifted it and we have invited dorm operators to apply to mom so that we are satisfied that the safe management measures are all in place currently we are staying at 10 this room is still 16 bed inside in terms of sleeping arrangements some of them have mentioned that yes there are fewer people but there's still the same number of bids in the room which means they don't have the kind of space that they need give us some time for the dom operators to do something about it we are working very closely with the dome operators to make sure that we continue with this de-densification effort i cannot go follow bus cannot go mrt is it true that dormitory workers are not allowed to take public transport at all for work activities we require employers to provide transport to and from work because when it comes to peak hour traffic the risk of transmission is the highest and when we have large groups of workers going out to work using public transport that's where we introduce this transmission risk in both directions between the dorm workers as well as the community but when it comes to other activities other than work while we strongly encourage employers to arrange transport we allow public transport because the transmission risk is a lot lower so migrant workers are allowed to take public transport as long as it is not during peak periods do you see the restriction on public transport changing anytime soon unfortunately for as long as kovit is with us i would say that i don't see it changing three hours you can go out and then come back that's it they're only allowed to go to the recreation centers and back for three hours when will this change we have already have plans to increase the frequency of visits to the recreation center and for longer and you can expect positive changes this quarter wow okay that's great news for them then given that we don't really see an end to this pandemic at this moment how would we go about improving the lives of the workers who stay in dormitories so we have already have seven quick build dorms that have been launched they have improved the specifications to improve the living environment for the workers as well as to make them more resilient to infection over the next the course of the year we will be launching more quick build dorms and to increase the number of paid spaces to about 25 000 quick built dorms are a temporary measure and will serve as a guide for more permanent solutions to our migrant worker housing so one year on because of all the robust measures in place covert 19 infection rates among our migrant workers have drastically gone down yes some are still struggling to adapt to the new normal but things are looking up this could be the future of migrant worker dorms in singapore more spacious rooms each with five single beds spaced at least one meter apart compared to a typical dormitory where up to 16 workers can share a room the room also comes with an ensuite toilet shower and sink outside there are also larger communal spaces like dedicated kitchens and shared amenities like a minimal thanks so a silver lining to this pandemic is that it has accelerated plans to improve the living conditions of our migrant workers but what they really hope for is to be able to rejoin the community i hope our restrictions have to pull out and giving us space to have release our stress i hope we can go around singapore and eat at the hawker center let us to go outside even once a month like that because we need to relax also our mind

94,GXNJtjBclXY,Sofia Wellness Clinic,COVID-19 in Singapore: The Silent Mental Health Crisis **Must Watch**,2020-07-21T05:57:30Z,"This video was conceptualized, designed and produced by my very talented friend, Ian from https://www.iandanmari.com. We had this idea of collaborating on a video when circuit breaker first started in Singapore, to raise awareness about mental health issues during COVID-19.

I hope that this video will help shed some light on what we are individually and collectively going through during this period of time, and as a reminder that all of us are fighting different battles. When you see someone making different choices or behaving differently from what you would, suspend your judgement and ask them how they are doing. Hear their stories, listen to their perspectives, and perhaps say, 'This must have been a tough time for you. How can I help?'

Please share this video with as many people as possible, thank you!

95,rxt3mpqVGPQ,CNA Insider,Thailand’s Mental Health Crisis: Why Is Its Suicide Rate So High?,2021-03-12T10:00:16Z,"According to the World Health Organisation, Thailand has the highest suicide rate in Southeast Asia, with a reported suicide attempt every 10 minutes. One reason is the lack of easy access to help for the mentally ill - in a land where severe depression afflicts over 1 million. 

In the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide rates in Thailand spiked by 22%, fueled by financial woes. The country's two main suicide prevention helplines, run by the Samaritans of Thailand and Department of Mental Health, saw a 70% increase in the number of calls. Long waiting times for a response resulted in a caller dropoff rate of 40% to 45%.

In spiritual Thailand, awareness of the science of mental health is low, as is the number of mental healthcare professsionals. To raise awareness among younger Thais, hip hop artistes AUTTA, BLACKSHEEP, MILLI from music label YUPP wrote the song ‘Nai Lao’ (https://youtu.be/YIgvov0RfK8), which encourages youths to talk about mental health. 3 in 5 Thais aged 15-29 suffer from mental disorders.

The Thai government has also launched Hope Task Force, which uses platforms like Facebook, TikTok and Line to engage with people in need.

AT P-LETTER IH WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH INCLUDING SELF-CARE AND GETTING TREATMENT OR DIAGNOSIS MENTAL ILLNESSES.

BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR PENTA LIST, BUT TO QUICKLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SEVERAL HOURS AGO, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CITED COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT. IT IS INTENDED TO SPEED UP THE REVIEW OF HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS OR AA PI COMMUNITY AND I NOW HAVE THE GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE OUR TALENTED GROUP OF PANELISTS.

HIS MISSION IS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL EMPOWERED ONLINE AND PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BULLYING AND PEACE. WELCOME TRACY CHOU. WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS NOT BECAUSE FIRST QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT TO ERIC NAM SO THE IMPACT RACISM THAT HAS AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE UNITED STATES, IS IT REALLY LIKE AN INVISIBLE CANCER FOR IMMUNITY'S OF COLOR. YET SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REMAINS A STIGMATIZED. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE WAYS IN WHICH SYSTEMIC RACISM HAS AN IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH ESPECIALLY FOR THE AA PI COMMUNITY AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND ALSO HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC EXASPERATED THAT REALITY. ERIC: YES AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION WHICH I THANK YOU SO SO TIMELY FOR EVERYBODY AROUND THE WORLD. IN TERMS OF MY RESPONSE, IS PROBABLY JUST. REPORTER: MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH FOR ASIAN AMERICANS HIM I THINK THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT ASIANS ARE QUIET, SUBSERVIENT AND WE LIVE WITH HIS METHOD OF THE MODEL MINORITY AND WERE ALSO TRADITIONALLY TO THIS DAY I THINK WE HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY SEEN AS AN AMERICAN, THERE'S ALWAYS-OR QUALIFIER THAT HAS TO JUSTIFY WHY WE ARE HERE. AND THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CONSISTENTLY UNDERLINES THE ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. AND I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS IT CAN SEEM MINOR OR INNOCUOUS TO SUMMON LIVING WITH THESE MISCONCEPTIONS FROM YOUNG AGE AND IN SOME WAY OF FORCES US TO ACCEPT THE MICRO AGGRESSIONS WERE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN WHATEVER FORM, APPEARS TO US AS HARMLESS OR THAT IT IS OKAY WHEN, AND VERY MUCH IS NOT. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS, PERCEPTION THE WORK ALSO LIKE THE PERPETUAL CORNER WERE OFTEN TOLD TO SUCK IT UP OR NOT CAUSE A SCENE. THOUGH WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO BE HERE AS IMMIGRANTS OR AS CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS. THAT IN TURN FORCES ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICANS TO INTERNALIZE AND NORMALIZE RACISM THAT IS FORCED UPON US FROM A SYSTEMIC LEVEL. I THINK WHEN THAT HAPPENS INCREASE THE SITUATION WHERE IF WE COME ACROSS AN ISSUE SUCH AS RACISM, WE MAY NATURALLY TEND TO SHY AWAY FROM DIRECT CONFRONTATION. I THINK FOR ME, I HAD SITUATIONS WHERE I QUESTIONED, AM I ALLOWED TO BE VOCALLY AGAINST IT. AM I ALLOWED TO SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST HOW MANY OF US WERE RAISED. TO BE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE EVEN HERE. SO AM I OVERREACTING, BEING OVERLY SENSITIVE. THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO. AND IT KIND OF TOXINS OUT OF RAISING THE ISSUE BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY, WE WERE NEVER ASKED IF THIS WAS A PROBLEM OR CLAYMAN HAVE A PROBLEM WITH US. I THINK HAVING A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE NORMALIZED SYSTEMIC RACISM, IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A HEALTHY MINDSET. FOR SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT COULD STEM FROM AND I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE THAT IS ALWAYS LINGERING IS THAT BECAUSE MANY OF US INTERNALIZE THESE ISSUES, WERE NOT VERY USED TO EXPRESSING AT, WE ARE NOT VERY USED TO ASKING FOR HELP IN SEEKING COUNSELING AND FOR MANY ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICANS IT CAN BE SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AND IT HAS BECOME STIGMATIZED. AND I THINK THROUGH COVID-19, IT MAY HAVE BECOME EXASPERATED OR EVEN WORSE BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT I GUESS HOW DO WE SAY THIS. THE EXTREMES OF THE RACISM THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEMIC A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE LIVED IN. AND OBVIOUSLY COVID-19 IS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY BEEN ASIAN AMERICANS, WE HAVE BEEN HIT IN SO MANY WAYS. AND THE AAPI MOST HARDEST HIT AND MUST PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE RHETORIC THAT FRAME TO COVID-19 AT THE START, A.K.A. KUNG FLU OR THE CHINA VIRUS FREE TO GO TO SOME ARE FUNNY, THEY HAD INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE AND LITERALLY VIOLENT EFFECTS ON THE AAPI COMMUNITY. THERE'S BEEN A DIRECT CORRELATION OF THE RISE WITH THE USAGE OF THESE TERMS IN HATE VIOLENCE. NO WONDER SOMETIMES IF THE STEREOTYPES THAT PEOPLE HAVE EVEN IF THERE KIND OF UNDER THE SURFACE OF US BEING MODEL MINORITY ARE NICE OR PASSIVE, AND WE CAN SURMISE ALLOWS FOR PEOPLE TO CARRY OUT HATE CRIMES ARE TARGET NATIONS AND ASIAN AMERICANS EVEN MORE WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRIMAND OR CONSEQUENCE. SO I THINK BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF HATE CRIMES, BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT BE HISTORICALLY WELL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, WHEN WE ALL OF THESE THINGS COMING TOGETHER. I THINK WE ARE RIGHT NOW AS AAPI CRITICALLY IN THE STATES WE LIVE WITH HIGH ANXIETY STRESS PARANOIA, AND PROBABLY A SLEW OF ISSUES THAT ARE STEMMING FROM THIS . WE FEEL ATTACKED AND UNSAFE AND I THINK IT IS ALL REALLY BEEN EXASPERATED BY COVID-19. I'M SORRY THERE WAS A VERY LONG RESPONSE. >> THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. IT MAY SEEM MINOR BUT FOR THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING IT, IT CERTAINLY IS NOT MINOR AND NOW DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY I WOULD LOVE TO PULL YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION CAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON WAYS SYSTEMIC RACISM HAS IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH. KSAKRAD: SURE, SYSTEMIC RACISM IS IT SOMETHING THAT QUITE VIOLENT AND TRAUMATIZING. I WANT TO PUT A PERIOD AT THE END OF THAT, IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS EMBEDDED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY CULTURE. FROM WHAT WE LIVE TO THE FOOD WE EAT TO THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE HAVE IN THE EDUCATION WE RECEIVED TO THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT IT IS THIS HIDDEN THING, IT IS WORKING VERY MUCH IN THE FOREFRONT OF SOCIETY. AND EVERYBODY'S LIVES IS A CONSTANT PRESENCE. WITH THAT, AT TIMES WE CAN BECOME A PRODUCT OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP A PERSON WHO HAS WORKED I OFTEN PUT TO WHEN WORKING WITH MARGINALIZED PEOPLE BUT HE ESSENTIALLY BELIEVED THAT THE PSYCHE CAN BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN WHICH WE LIVE. WE WERE BORN INTO. AND THAT IS OFTEN SOMETHING THAT IT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN IGNORED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THE MENTAL-HEALTH COMMUNITY. SO STIGMATIZED AND OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DID NOT HAPPEN IN A VACUUM AS WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK. THAT THERE WAS THIS PARANOIA ESSENTIALLY AND FEAR OF DOCTORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS. HE DID NOT HAPPEN IN A VACUUM AND IT DID NOT COME OUT OF NOWHERE. A LONGER TIME IN THIS COUNTRY, MEDICAL PRACTICES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICES HAVE BEEN LARGELY RACIST AND I'M DONE A LOT OF HARM TO THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO IT MAKES SENSE THERE IS A STIGMA TASTE AND WITH REGARDS TO MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL. MANY TIMES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT A PERSON IS FEELING AND WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING. SO I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE STIGMATIZATION A MENTAL HEALTH AS A PRACTICE, HAS BEEN LARGELY DEVELOPED OUT OF PAST HISTORICALLY RACIST PRACTICES WITHIN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE AND MENTAL HEALTH. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE LARGELY BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 DUE TO THE SOCIETAL DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY EXPERIENCED IN HER CHALLENGE WITH. AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY, THERE HAVE BEEN HISTORICAL RACIST PRACTICES BUT I THINK THAT WITHIN THE SEVERAL RESEARCH STUDIES SHOWN TO ILLUSTRATE THE PREJUDICES AND BIASES OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS CURRENTLY IN PRACTICING READ THAT MAY HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE LARGE DEATH RATES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WHEN INFECTED WITH COVID-19 AND ADDITIONALLY, THERE AREN'T ENOUGH TESTING CENTER SO THAT ALSO EXASPERATED THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ALSO MANY TIMES PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE THE FRONTLINE BROKERS. OR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SO THEY HAVE EXPOSURE TO COVID-19. SO ON THE SOCIETAL FACTORS REALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXASPERATION OF THE DISCREPANCY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND MEDICAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES THAT WERE RECEIVED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR WHICH MADE THEM A LOT MORE VULNERABLE THAN SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTRACTING AND DYING FROM THE DISEASE HAS WELL. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY I THINK YOU FOR GOING INTO DEPTH AND OUT TRACY CHOU I WOULD LIKE TO PULL YOU IN AS WELL IF YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY SEE INTO ONLINE HATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH REGARDS TO THE SCHISM. TRACY: THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS WHAT HAPPENS ONLINE IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT THAT HAPPENS OFF-LINE AND PARTICULARLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND EVERYTHING IS ONLINE ALL OF HER INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE, THE WORK AND PERSONAL LIFE SO EVERYTHING IS ONLINE RATED THE HARASSMENT WE ARE SING ONLINE REFLECTS THE SAME PATTERNS OF BIAS IN HATE, MISOGYNY, RACISM AND THAT ARE CORROSIVE THROUGH THE REST OF THE SITE AND ONLINE HARASSMENT IS NO LESS REAL BECAUSE IT IS ONLINE. AND THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY VERY REAL AND SIGNIFICANT. AND IN FACT, WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE DIGITAL PLATFORM TO BEING ALIGNED AND VERSUS THAT ABLE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AT A DIFFERENT SCALE. BECOME TUMOR WEST COAST OF PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT IS GOOD WHEN YOU WANT LOTS OF USERS ABOUT WHAT IS ALL NEGATIVE AND THINGS COMING OUT TO YOU AND WHEN KNOWLEDGE THAT I THANK YOU SO ACTUALLY THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED ANTI- ASIAN HATE ON THE STREETS. PEOPLE YELLING THINGS ASKED ME LIKE GO BACK TO BEIJING. PERCENT TO THE SKILL OF WHAT HAPPENS ONLINE. WE HAVE GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF THOSE KINDS OF COMMENTS IN A ONE EVENING. EACH OF THOSE COMMENTS CAN BE PAINFUL TO HEAR AND THE FEELING I GET WHEN SOMEBODY CARESSES ME ON THE STREET, JUST ONE BAD COMMENT. BUT WHEN IT COMES IN IT IN A FLOOD IN ITS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS PILING ON, HE WAS JUST COMING TO SEE THIS IS REALLY PAINFUL. IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT. I'M LUCKY IN THAT I AM NOT SO HIGH-PROFILE BUT STILL ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCE THIS. IT CAN BE SO EXTREME FOR ANYBODY THAT IS TARGETED FOR SAYING THE WRONG THING OR TWEETING ON THE WRONG STRIKE. SOMEONE JUST HAPPENED TO GO VIRAL, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT THAT CAN COMMENT IS ABSOLUTELY UNREAL. AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC, ORAL ONLINE, THERE'S EVEN MORE ON LINE BEHAVIOR A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE FRUSTRATED AND TAKING OUT THE NEGATIVITY ANOTHER FOLKS ON THE INTERNET. SO I PERSONALLY FELT A LOT OF THIS MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT AND HAD TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO I MINIMIZE THE, TO MYSELF AND SEE ALL OF THESE NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL SAY LIKE, JUST GET OFF-LINE IF IT SO BAD. THAT DOES NOT REALLY A SOLUTION. WE ALL LIVE ONLINE, SOCIAL MEDIA IS A FACT OF LIFE FOR ALL OF US. FOR MANY PEOPLE AS A PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENT TO BE ALIGNED TO GOING OFF-LINE COMES AT A VERY VERY HIGH COST. I GUESS THE FIRST STEP IS TO REALIZE HOW REAL ONLINE HARASSMENT IS, ON LINE EIGHT AND MANIFESTATION OF VITAMIN C OFF-LINE BUT JUST GENERAL SOCIETAL ISSUES SO ALL OF THIS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF RACISM JUST TRANSLATES INTO SEVERE HARASSMENT AND HATE THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN DIGITAL FORMS AS WELL READ. HOST: THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IN THANK YOU, IT IS NOT EASY TO JUST GET OFF-LINE. IT IS A PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENT WE CANNOT JUST DELETE OR SOCIAL MEDIA. MANY PEOPLE INSURED TURNING INTO DAY, FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS EVENT THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA SO IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO UNPLUG AS MUCH AS MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO NOW DOCTOR MARY YANG I WOULD LOVE TO INVITE YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THE WAY SYSTEMIC RACISM HAD AN IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH. MARY: I AGREE WITH WHAT EVERYONE HAS SAID SOME ACTUALLY BASED IN CANADA WHERE I THINK OUR ARE THE COUNTRY'S PERCEPTION OF RACISM IS THAT IT IS MORE, NOT AN ISSUE. IT'S AN AMERICAN THING. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS OFTEN LIKE A LOT OF COMPARISONS, NOT AS BAD AS THEY ARE WHICH REALLY JUST SERVES TO MINIMIZE THE REALITIES OF PEOPLE LIVING HERE, THAT THERE ARE REALLY BIG DISCREPANCIES IN MANY WAYS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT COVID-19 LIKE REVEALING LIKE WHEN IT'S REALLY BEEN HERE ALL ALONG TERMS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM INEQUITIES. AND HARASSMENT THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE WITH. HOST: THANK YOU FOR SHARING DOCTOR MARY YANG. HIS NEXT QUESTION TO DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY IF YOU COULD ANSWER FIRST PARTY TO SEE ANOTHER GLOBALLY THINK HOW COLONIALISM AND THE TRANSATLANTIC FLEET TRADE LAUGHED AND LASTING IMPACT ACROSS EVERY SOCIETAL STRUCTURE. HOW IS THAT LEGACY MANIFESTED IN THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES LIVING UNDER THOSE DUAL SHADOWS. KSAKRAD: I AM PERSONALLY OF THE BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL LIVING UNDER THIS SHADOW AND IT CAUSES US A GREAT DEAL OF PSYCHE HARD FOR EVERYONE. I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT JAMES BALDWIN AND PSYCHIATRIST LIKE A NON- OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT SUBJUGATION OF PEOPLE BEING NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN WHITE SUPREMACY. SO IN OTHER WORDS, WE ALL HAVE INTERNALIZED THE NOTION THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE LOWER TO BE EMPOWERED, THERE NEEDS TO BE OPPRESSION THAT HAPPENS. AND THAT NO ONE CAN REALLY EVER LIVE WITHOUT HER EXIST WITHOUT THE SUPPRESSION. AND IT IS NORMALIZED IN A WAY. I JUST FEEL THAT THIS CREATES THIS SENSE THAT IN ORDER FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE TO BE EMPOWERED FOR ANYONE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE IN POWER, THAT THERE MUST BE A SUBJUGATION OF ANOTHER PERSON. AND THAT THIS IS OFTEN DONE IT IN A VERY NONCRITICAL WAY. IT DOES NOT LEAD US TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH IMPRESS OTHERS WERE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEHUMANIZATION OF OTHER PEOPLE POPULATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. SO I THINK THAT IT CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL IF WE REALLY STOP TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THE SOCIAL POLITICAL STRUCTURES IN WHICH WE LIVE. IN RESPONSE TO AND SUPPORT. WE CAN ALSO SEE THIS AS A WAY TO RESIST IN A LOT OF WAYS. AN OPPRESSIVE STATE ARE OPPRESSION WITHOUT OURSELVES AND IN OUR SOCIETY BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A WAY TO HUMANIZE YOUR SELF. AND OTHERS AROUND YOU BECAUSE IF WE DON'T THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT OPPRESSION OR SUBJUGATION, THEN WE ARE BOUND TO DEHUMANIZE OTHERS AND MINIMIZE OUR OWN SENSE OF HUMANITY. SO WITHIN MY OWN PRACTICE AS A PSYCHOLOGIST, I REALLY LIKE TO WORK UPON THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF LIBERATION PSYCHOLOGY. WHICH WAS LARGELY DEVELOPED BY UNNECESSARILY DEVELOPED BY, IS ENHANCED BY MARTIN BORROW WAS A SPANISH BORN PRIEST AND PSYCHOLOGIST THAT WORKED IN EL SALVADOR. ESSENTIALLY HE SAID THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE IN DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS. SO WE NEED TO DEVELOP A CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SENSE OF LOVE AND PEACE IN YOUR HEART OVER THERE COULD ALSO BE VERY CRITICAL OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN OUR LIVES AND THE SOCIAL POLITICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH WE LIVE. ALL OF THIS IS TO DEVELOP A SENSE OF GREAT HUMANIZATION OF YOURSELF AND SOCIETY. THEN I ALSO TAKEN A STEP FURTHER. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO ALSO BE KIND OF A DINAR MINERALIZATION. A MAINSTREAM SOCIETY. OF WHICH WE DO HAVE THIS ECONOMY OF LOVE AND OPPRESSION OR POWER AND OPPRESSION. AND THAT OPPRESSED PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, THEY TENDED TO THRIVE WHEN THEY ARE WITHIN THEIR OWN SOCIETIES AND CULTURE. SIZES PEOPLE TO HELP THEM LOOK FOR THANKS IN THEIR CULTURE AND SOCIETY THAT EMBRACES THEIR OWN SENSE OF HUMANITY. THEREFORE THE HUMANITY OF OTHERS. SO I WOULD SAY THAT IT COULD BE HELPFUL IF OTHERS COULD DO THIS IN THEIR PRACTICE. NOT JUST MARGINALIZED PEOPLE BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, WE ARE ALL AFFECTED BY COLONIALIZATION IN THE TRANSATLANTIC - TRINITY. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY AND ESPECIALLY WHEN RESONATED WITH ME WAS THE MAINSTREAM SOCIETY BEING DENORMALIZED. AND DOCTOR MARY YANG I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL. MARY: I THINK MANY THINKERS, MUCH SMARTER THAN ME, HAVE SUMMARIZED RACISM ABOUT MONEY. LIKE THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE TAKING OF NORTH AMERICA FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE. MOSTLY RACISM IS ABOUT MONEY. IT IS OTHER THINGS AS WELL. IN MANY WAYS, THE REALLY COMES DOWN TO MONEY. SO I THINK WE SEE THAT IN THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND IT IS ONLY REALLY THE LAST TEN OR 20 YEARS THE MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH SERVICE AND SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND TREATED AROUND THE WORLD. I THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LIKE SUCH A ENLARGED BODY RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT THE RISK OF PSYCHOSIS IN CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION IS LIKE, . DIRECTLY, RELATED IT WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF RACISM AND THERE ARE MANY STUDIES, SEVERAL THE STUDIES THAT ONTARIO SHOWS THAT PEOPLE COMING FROM A PEOPLE ARE BLACK WHO IMMIGRATE TO CANADA ARE MUCH HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND PSYCHOSIS AND PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT'S REALLY PHYSICAL ELATION WITH RACISM SO THEY QUICKLY TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF MENTAL HEALTH OF THESE COMMUNITIES, AND DETERMINES A LOT OF THE FULL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHICH CAN AFFECT MENTAL HEALTH AS A WAY THAT THEY WOULD AFFECT PHYSICAL CONFIDENT DEFECTS, TEXAS PEOPLE HAVE TO RESOURCES. HANNAH LIKE WITH ERICKSON ABOUT THERAPY IN MANY COMMUNITIES BEING SEEN THE WHITE PEOPLE DO. AND I THINK THAT WOODY ALLEN MIKE SAID DIFFERENTLY INCOME FOR YOU. IT'S A SELF-INDULGENT THING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND WORK ON. AND TO SEEK SUPPORT FOR. SO I THINK HE COMES BACK TO MONEY. MONEY HELPS TO BUFFER FROM LIFE STRESSES. YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GAP TO IT, IT LEAVES YOU MORE VULNERABLE AND PEOPLE ARE OFTEN HIGHER RISK AND MONEY ALSO LEAVES YOU WITH LESS ACCESS TO RECEIVE TREATMENT FOR THESE CONDITIONS. I THINK THIS IS TRUE IN NORTH AMERICA AS IT IS IN LIBERIA, AND MANY OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES. WIT.HOST: ONLY THE PAST 20 YEAR, THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAS REALLY BEEN SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH SERVICE. HIS MIND BLOWING GOOD. ERIC AND TRACY, WOULD EITHER OF YOU LIKE TOO BAD WHAT'S IN. TRACY: SPEAKING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN ASIAN AMERICAN IS SORT OF A COMPLEXITY DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES AS A NATION THERE IS PROXIMITY TO BRIGHTNESS AND THIS IDEA THE MYTH OF THE MODEL MINORITY WHERE ESPECIALLY TECH NATIONS ARE OVERREPRESENTED, WERE HELD UP HIS MATED AND VERY WELL REPRESENTED AT LEAST IN THE ENGINEERING RANKS. WE ARE PRESENT. TECH IS CONSIDERED WEALTHY INDUSTRY SO FEELS OCCASIONS I MADE IT WITH A LOT OF PRIVILEGE IN THE IDEA OF MODEL MINORITIES OF ASIANS ABLE TO SUCCEED BY THEIR WORK ETHIC. REALLY IS NO TYPE BLACK RACIST TOOL THAT IS MEANT TO SEVER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HIT ASIANS AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE TREATED SO THERE LIKE SYMPTOMS THE UNDERLYING ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THERE'S THE PRIVILEGE OF THE ONE HAND WE HAVE POSITIONS BUT ALSO EXCLUSIONS WE STILL FACE WE SEEN A LOT OF THAT MANIFESTATION OF THE HATE AND STILL THERE AND QUITE PREVALENT PRE. IT ALSO LEADS TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHERE WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THE POSITION THAT WE HAVE IN SOCIETY. WHAT ARE THE SAME TIME WERE STILL BEING TARGETED AND KILLED BY MASS SHOOTERS. SO THERE IS THAT TRICKING US AND, AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT ON COLONIALISM. PERHAPS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE TRANSONIC TRADE SLAVE, BUT THERE'S ALSO COLONIALISM AND ASIAN THE LEGACY IS STILL PERSISTING AND I THINK THERE'S A TO SOMETIMES TRY TO FLATTEN THE AAPI AND THAT WERE ALL THE SAME, WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF COLONIALISM. LIKE BACK HOME, MY FAMILY IS FROM TAIWAN. THAT IS UNDER JAPANESE COLONIAL RULE FOR SOME TIME THE JAPANESE CALLS A LOT OF ASIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THE LEGACY OF COLONIALISM BUT THERE'S TELLING DEALING WITH THIS AS WELL READ WITHIN THE ASIAN COMMUNITIES WE OFTEN PERPETUATE RACISM AS WELL. WHETHER IT IS A STATIONS UP FOR SOUTHEAST ASIANS AND SOUTH ASIANS AND EVERYTHING IS INTERSECTIONAL. AND CLASSISM AND OTHER FORMS OF MISOGYNY IN ALL THESE OTHER FORMS OF BIAS THAT GET INTERLACED. IT IS QUITE COMPLEX. IT'S A DIFFERENT FORM OF RACISM WE HAD TO DEAL WITH HESITATIONS AND WHAT BLACK PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DO WITH. ALL OF US HAVE SEEN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTEST AND SEEN GEORGE FLOYD, THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF RACISM THAT WE HAD TO CONTEND WITH. IN AMERICA AND GLOBALLY THAN WHITE PATIENTS DEAL WITH. THE COMPLEXITY OF DOES NOT MAKE IT EASIER TO TRAVEL WITH. ERIC: SO YEAH, TO TAKE OFF OF WHAT TRACY WAS MENTIONING ABOUT EXCLUSION I THANK YOU SO SOMETHING I WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON FRIDAY THINK INTACT, YES, THERE ARE A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE ENGINEERING THE DEMAND WITH THE IF YOU THINK ABOUT FACE WE WERE EXCLUDED FROM A CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOOL. AS BEING IN WORKING IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. A COUPLE OF STUDIES LOOKED AT FILMS THAT CAME OUT IN 2019 AND THE STATISTICS WERE QUITE JARRING TO ME. ELECTED 1300 OF THE TOP FILMS NUMBERS 1300, ONLY 44 HAD AN API LEADER COLLATED OF THIS 44 FILMS WITH THE NATION CLINICALLY, 14 OF THEM WERE JOHNSON LIFE ABSOLUTELY LOVE. DWAYNE THE ROCK JOHNSON. I THINK IT REALLY GOES TO THE - I THINK THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR HELP ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS AND WE BEEN WANTING TO BE FEELING EMPOWERED AND EMPOWER OTHERS AS WELL. AND WE GET TO A POINT WE CAN DO IT NATURALLY AND IT'S CONSISTENT. WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS UNTIL WE GET TO THE POINT, WHENEVER THAT IS, WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT AND KEEP BRINGING IT UP. I THINK OF THE PARTHENON WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS STILL IN THE EXCLUSION APARTMENT I MOVED TO KOREA AND 2011. ALMOST EXACTLY TEN YEARS AGO. ONCE I STARTED TO DIDN'T MUSIC IN THE U.S. AND KOREA, THE PRESS WAS LIKE WHY DID YOU GO TO KOREA WHY DIDN'T YOU START HERE. INTIMATE, SUCH A FUNNY QUESTION. WHEN YOU SEEN ANYBODY LOOKS LIKE ME ON THE GRAMMYS ON MTV, GROWING UP I NEVER SAW THAT PERSON. STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW A KOREAN, AND ASIAN COMEDIAN ON TV READ FOR ME. FOR SOME TIME IN THE '90s AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOSH, THERE'S NATION PERSON ON TV. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE MINORITY, THERE LIKE WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO SEE YOURSELF IN A POSITION OF POWER OR OF INFLUENCE OR WHATEVER, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DREAM IT HARD TO IMAGINE IT BUT YOU ARE BECOME FOR FULFILL. AND I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY HAVE TO ACTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST IS MY FOURTH IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION. I CAN START MY CAREER, TEN OR 12 YEARS EARLIER, AND WHAT I CONSIDER MY MOTHER LANGUAGE OF ENGLISH, MAYBE THINGS WOULD'VE BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT THAT WAS NEVER A REALISTIC OPTION FOR ME. I WENT TO KOREA I AM SO THANKFUL THAT HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE DID MATTER THAT I WAS ASIAN, IT WAS CAN YOU SING AND PERFORM. WAS BASED ON MY ABILITY AND SKILL SET AS AN ENTERTAINER INSTEAD OF WHAT IS ASIANS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT BOX TO PUT HIM INTO. MASS AMERICA GOING TO BE OKAY WITH AN ASIAN KID SINGING A POP SONG. I THINK THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE ARE INCREDIBLY EXCLUDE FROM AND THAT WE HAVE HAD LEFT STRIDES AND A LOT OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS BUILDING FOR VISIBILITY AND INCLUSION. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WERE ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT WE NEED TO BE WILL BE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE. I THANK YOU SO ALL KIND OF TIES AND THE SYSTEMIC PARTS OF THIS AS WELL AS INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION AND STEREOTYPES AND OBVIOUSLY THIS TOPIC IS SO VAST AND SO COMPLEX. BUT DID WANT TO ADD FROM MY EXPERIENCE MY 2 CENTS ON THAT. HOST: THANK YOU ERIC FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU AS WELL. RESILIENCY, THIS IS A WAY TO DETERMINE WE OFTEN USE IT TO DESCRIBE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO JUST KEEP GOING DESPITE THE CRUSHING REALITIES IN WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED IT. SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU DEALING WITH THAT TERM PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY AND WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO PEOPLE LISTENING WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO WITH THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH IN RACISM. SYSTEMIC RACISM. ERIC: I THINK WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY ERASE THAT IT IS HARD. AND EVEN IF SOMEBODY SAID THAT IT'S A WAY TO SIMPLIFY IT OR MAKE IT EASIER, IT IS ALL RELATIVE AND IT IS THE BIGGEST MOST CHALLENGING THING FOR YOU PERSONALLY, ANYTHING I SAY IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. BUT I JUST WANT TO AGAINST ENCOURAGE WHOEVER MAY BE GOING THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES TO REALLY REACH OUT FOR HELP. AND NOT BE AFRAID OF IT AND FEAR IN PLACE VERY BLESSED SINCE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THIS NEEDED TO BE RESILIENT THEN YOU ARE PRIVILEGED, SO PRIVILEGED THAT YOU CAN HELP OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE GOOD TO . I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A TWO-WAY STREET, IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING, ASKED FOR HELP LOOKING UP SOMEBODY. THANK IS JUST A GENERAL WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE TO ANYBODY WAS LISTENING. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT BEING RESILIENT IS TOUGH BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE STRUGGLE OF REALLY GOING DAY BY DAY AND EVEN FOR ME, I RECOGNIZE THE COME FROM A PLACE OF PRIVILEGE SO I WILL NOT HAVE HAD THE SAME NEED FOR EXPERIENCING AND THE NEED TO BE RESILIENT. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED AND SOMETHING THAT CAN COMPLETELY AFFECT THINGS BEYOND JUST LIKE YOUR DAY TODAY, LIKE YOUR PSYCHE, EVERYTHING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND THE WAY YOU SPEAK WITH THE WAY YOU REACT TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS, IS A BURDEN THAT CAN CONSUME SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING. SO PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE, WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT. RESILIENCY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT UNTIL YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IT, YOU DO NOT KNOW AND IF YOU'RE IN IT, CAN BE INCREDIBLY PARALYZING TO EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN OPENNESS AN OPEN MIND TO REACH OUT AND REACH ACROSS THE BORDERS AND KIND OF ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP RATED SARNO THAT IS CRITICALLY HELPFUL BUT THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN DO, SEND GOOD VIBES INTO THE UNIVERSE. I REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE A PART OF THIS CHANGE THAT WE NEED. AS A SOCIETY AND AS THE WORLD. HOST: YES WE ABSOLUTELY ALL NEED TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP A BIT MORE. AND TRACY AND WONDERFUL UN WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU ENGAGE WITH THE TERM RESILIENCY BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND PERSONALLY AND IF YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR WORK WITH BLOCK PARTY AND HOW THE ADVICE TO GET FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH. TRACY: PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY, AND FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO CHANNEL IS MUCH RESILIENCY AS I CAN. IT DAY BY DAY. THE PERSONAL FRONT SPEAKING TO AN EARLIER TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, ONLINE HARASSMENT, I DO QUITE A BIT OF ONLINE HARASSMENT A VERY PERSISTENT BASIS. AN EVENT SO FOR A DECADE OR MORE. ""AND SO ON PHONE PERSISTENT I HAD TO GO TO THE POLICE MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY AND SOME FEAR OF MY PHYSICAL STOCKING AND THOSE ISSUES. AND GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE MORE CASUAL HARASSMENT AND I GET ONLINE AND THERE HAVE BEEN POINTS WHERE I HAVE WANTED TO JUST COLLAPSE IN THE QUARTER AND PRIDE HAVE DONE THAT AS WELL. I BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE THE HARASSMENT CAN GET SO TERRIBLE READ HOW THE PROFESSIONAL SIDE, I'M SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ONLINE HARASSMENT WITH MIKE KEMENY BLOCK PARTY, IT'S ALSO FRUSTRATING TO EXPERIENCE THE SEXISM AND RACISM OF THE TECH IO KNOW HOW MUCH ARTERY DOES AS A WOMAN TO RAISE MONEY FOR EXAMPLE. IN 2020, 2 PERCENT OF ALL CAPITOL MONEY WENT TO FEMALE FOUNDERS. 2 PERCENT OF ALL OF THE INVESTMENT GOING INTO TECH, SORRY THOSE WENT TO FEMALE FOUNDERS. IT PERMEATES ALL ASPECTS OF TRYING TO BUILD MY COMPANY. SAME WITH LIKE TALKING TO INVESTORS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND ONLINE RESPITE IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM. UNABLE TELL ME THAT, I'M IMAGINING HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. CAN I AM CREATING A PROBLEM WHERE ONE DOESN'T EXIST. IN ALL OF THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING BUT JUST THE FLIP HAVE IT, THE WAY I KIND OF TURNING AROUND IS THAT I THINK ABOUT HOW I CAN EXPRESS MY AGENCY AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. AND DOING A LOT MORE RESEARCH AROUND ONLINE HARASSMENT AND TALKING TO FOLKS WHO HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM . CAN BE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO ATTACK YOUR LINE. BEING PERSISTENT ABOUT IT CAN REPORT THEM OUR CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM SO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO MUCH EXCEPT IN EXTREME CASES. SO CAN FEEL VERY PARALYZING BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IT CAN DO. AND IN THAT. PERSONAL POSITION THAT I CAN ACTUALLY CHANNEL MY SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES AND NETWORKS TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND BUILD THE COMPANY THAT CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM USE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS SOMETHING I KNOW. TO TRY TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND SO IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING ABOUT THE WAY TO TURN AROUND AND SAY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY THING, THE ONE THING THAT I CAN TRY TO DO. NOT TO JUST MAKE A BETTER FOR MYSELF AND BETTER FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO DO IT. LIKE GOD IS HOW I KEEP MYSELF GOING EVEN THOUGH HE CAN BE REALLY FRUSTRATING. AND  I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK AND THIS PERSON CAN ONLY TAKE ON SO MUCH. AND IT JUST FEELS A LOT MORE EMPOWERING AND SOMETIMES I THINK OF THIS BATTLE IS ONE THAT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN ME AND IF YOU LIKE I AM DOING SOMETHING LIKE IF IT WERE FOR ME, NOT SURE WHO ELSE LIKE I'M IN SUCH A POSITION OF PRIVILEGE THAT I CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR US ON THE MANY PEOPLE SO FORTUNATE OR HAVE THAT EXACT INTERSECTION OF INTERSECTING OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAVING THE SKILLS TO ADDRESS IT. CISCO LIKE MY TAKE ON THE RESILIENCY, JUST KEEP PUSHING FORWARD. IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE BUT IS ALSO THE BEST CHOICE TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING AND IN TERMS OF ADVICE FOR OTHERS, I GUESS THE FIRST IS TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE. YOU ARE NOT CRAZY AND ARE NOT IMAGINING THINGS AND ALL THE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU INTO THINKING THAT. AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME IN THE PAST LIKE THERE IS NO SEXISM OR RACISM. JUST IMAGINING IT AND PROJECTING IT AROUND YOU. DON'T LET PEOPLE GAS LIGHT YOU INTO THAT. I THANK YOU SO SIMILAR TO WHAT I TRY TO DO, FIGURE OUT THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU HAVE AGENCY AND CAN TRY TO TAKE CONTROL SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL BACK. MY BE THINGS LIKE CHOOSING WHO YOU WANT TO ENGAGE WITH. IF YOU WERE TO SPEND TIME WITH, PEOPLE CAN GIVE ENERGY AND CHOOSE A WORK ENVIRONMENT IF YOU CAN IS MORE FAVORABLE TO YOU AND MORE WELCOMING OUR GET INVOLVED WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER SYSTEMICALLY. WE FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING EVEN IF YOU'RE STILL ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE SYSTEM IS VERY BROKEN AND NEEDS FIXING. HOST: THANK YOU TRACY AND DOCTOR MARY YANG I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE IT AS WELL AND YOUR ADVICE FOR RESILIENCY AND OTHER STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH IN THE FACE OF RACISM. >> PEOPLE THAT WE THINK OF AS THE MOST RESILIENT RARELY SEE THAT AS A COMPLEMENT. MARY: I THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK OUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THROUGH THEY HAVE TO BE RESILIENT, THERE OFTEN LIKE COMMENTS ON THEIR OWN CHARACTER SIX . THINK PEOPLE WANT JUSTICE. RESILIENCY THE CONCEPT OF THAT IS NOT. I THINK PERSONALLY IS A TERM THAT WORKPLACES USED TO TRY TO BRING OUT THE LAST FEW DOLLARS OF PRODUCTIVITY FROM THE WORKERS . LIKE I PERSONALLY THINK THE MANY WORKPLACE PROGRAMS THE HAVE THIS AGENDA, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T ADDRESS OTHER CONDITIONS ON THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH PEOPLE HAVE TO BE RESILIENT. I THINK ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE ALL HAVE TO DECIDE WE CAN ACCEPT AND TOLERATE AND AT SOME POINT, THE CONDITIONS WE WORK IN THAT WE SEE AS A SOCIETY, LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON YOUR STREET, AT SOME POINT IF YOU DECIDE YOU CAN'T TOLERATE IT, YOUR JOB IS TO CHANGE IT AND I THINK THAT GOES REGION EVERY ONE OF US. I THINK THE MORE AND MORE I DO THIS WHAT I REALIZED THERE IS A SYSTEM. BUT IN MANY WAYS, ABSTRACT THINGS THAT WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN, IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT EXISTS. THE WAY IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS AND PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM BUT THERE OFTEN ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN YOUR COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS IT IN WAYS THAT WERE WORKS. OFTEN I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE LOCALLY, MAKES THINGS FEEL LESS OVERWHELMING . AND OFTEN NO MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS IN HER CITIES AND THEIR PROVINCES AND STATES RATHER THINGS IN A HIGHER LEVEL JUST STARTING OUT WITH KNOWING YOUR COMMUNITY AND WHAT IS GOING ON THERE. BILLY CONNECTED AND I THINK IT CAN REALLY HELP. AND I THINK MINIATURE THE THREAT OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY ANYTHING WHAT KEEPS MANY PEOPLE GOING AND KEEP THEM RESILIENT IS HAVING THAT COMMUNITY CONSUMING DOING WHAT YOU CAN TO FEEL CONNECTED TO IT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SHARE YOUR SIMILAR VALUES. UNDERSTAND THE WAYS IN WHICH ALL OF THIS HAPPENS AT THE STREET LEVEL OFTEN THOSE ARE THE PLACES EASIEST TO CHANGE. MY LAST PIECE OF ADVICE FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH I JUST WANT TO ECHO TO GET HELP. IF THERE IS ONE MESSAGE SHE SENT HIM I THANK YOU SO REALLY IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT SELF-INDULGENT. THERAPY IS NOT JUST THE THING FOR WHITE PEOPLE, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR SURVIVAL. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR MARY YANG AND DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD IN YOUR THOUGHTS AS WELL. KSAKRAD: . [INAUDIBLE]. I'M SORRY. I BELIEVE THERE IS SELECTIVE RELATIVISM THAT IS OFTEN EMBRACED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESILIENCY. OFTEN TIMES, MAJOR CULTURE AND THE MAJORITY SELECTIVELY CHOOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCES ARE VALID READ AND THERE IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT THE CULTURAL SIDE THAT IS OFTEN PRESENT WHEN EXPLORING AND EVALUATING THE LIVES OF MARGINALIZED PEOPLE. THEREFORE, IT IS ONLY THE PRIVILEGED CLASS THAT AFFORDED THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AND TRAUMA. AND SUFFERING AND THE REST ARE TOLD TO KEEP PUSHING IT, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN . GOOD TO THINGS OFF AND CONTINUE WITH THEIR LIVES. I THINK THAT RESILIENCY HAS A PLACE ON A THING IT CAN BE IMPORTANT. BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF DENYING A PERSON'S HUMANITY OR NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF A PERSON'S DENYING THEIR OWN HUMANITY. EVEN MOST IMPORTANTLY. I BELIEVE THAT SOME PEOPLE FIND IT A LOT OF STRENGTH I WILL SAY BEING A BOSS. I'M JUST KIND OF KEEPING IT PUSHING BUT I THINK IT COULD BE A LOT OF STRENGTH AND IS FOUND IN RECOGNIZING YOUR PAIN. RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ARE AFFECTED FROM LIVING AN EXISTING. THE SYSTEMICALLY RACIST SOCIETY. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY AND WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION, UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN TO YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY, DOCTOR MARY YANG ERIC NAM AND TRACY CHOU FOR JOINING US INTO EVERYBODY WHO TUNED IN THIS EVENING.

103,PZq5mKhqfqc,The Straits Times,Coronavirus: Link established between Grace Assembly of God and Life Church and Missions clusters,2020-02-25T11:34:07Z,"Multimedia correspondent Yeo Sam Jo speaks with journalist Timothy Goh on the Health Ministry finding the link between Grace Assembly of God and the Life Church and Missions clusters. Singapore confirms one more cases in Singapore, and issues precautionary measures in response to the escalating situation in Daegu and Cheongdo. #TheBigStory #coronavirus #covid19 #southkorea #church #graceassemblyofgod #lifechurchandmissions",[Music] welcome to the big story I'm Dylan I'm coming to you live from The Straits Times newsroom this just in the Health Ministry has checked down the source of infection for Singapore's biggest coronavirus cluster and grace Assembly of God the cluster is linked to two one travelers who also attended The Life Church and Mission Singapore on January 19th the same day they arrived here both Church clusters are linked to a Chinese New Year gathering the mystery behind the linkages were solved using a new test that is able to detect infections even in recovered patients for the cluster The Life Church a mission we have established earlier that the source of the infection probably came from a couple from Wuhan these are cases 8 & 9 who attended the service at the church for the Grace Assembly of God Church cluster we have established that case 66 is probably the primary case of the cluster because he was the earliest to show symptoms among the cluster but we could not determine the source of his infection further investigation later on established that he had a Chinese New Year gathering which included two persons namely cases in between in 91 case 91 will be announced later today who in fact attended the live Church a mission on 19th January the same day as the couple from Wuhan we could not establish the link initially as both cases 83 and ID 1 were not ill during the investigation however further investigation showed that they were unwell previously subsequently serological tests confirmed they they had been that they had been infected with kovat 19 hence the link was established multimedia correspondent Yosef Joe is standing by at the ministry of communications and information hi Sam Joe what else can you tell us hi hi Dylan yes the Ministry of Health has just uncovered the mystery link between two local church clusters of course the churches I'm talking about our Life Church and mission Singapore as well as Greece Assembly of God this link which involves k66 as well as new case case 91 was established with the help of police and researchers from Duke and u.s. Medical School via a serological tests now to tell us more all about this I have with me journalist Timothy go who has been covering this outbreak right from the get-go hi Timothy all right so tell us more about this mystery link that has just been uncovered right can you tell us how exactly at a two local church clusters linked so there are billions if you remember with cases 8 & 9 now these were a pair from Wuhan who visited Life Church a mission service on the 19th of January this year at the same service was kiss 91 the latest case announced today he's 91 went on from that service to attend Chinese new gathering I had me onedrive you may remember this is another big cluster of cases this gathering to place on 25th of January this year and at this Chinese new gathering was case number 66 k66 as a tween ad or meal who happened to be the first case in the creases and we have got classed as well so it's basically that the pair from Wuhan went to a service infected case 91 who went to the Chinese new gathering in fact at k66 we then went the graces MB of God at crazy assembly of God k 66 then went on to attend a staff devotion meeting on the three 9th of January I started ocean meeting on the 5th of February where they infected several other staff from the church and then this stuff subsequently went on to a prayer meeting on the 5th of every and in fact at the congregation there so that's how this big cross that happened right so basically one Church Chinese New Year gathering then another Church all right so can you tell us why is the fact that we've established these linkages right why is this important and what does it mean for contact tracing and the outbreak situation in Singapore well it's a few very good news something that we should be proud of because it means that there is no longer a mystery source of infection between these two clusters now previously we hadn't really known what that links between the two classes were oh we're the first Greece SMB I've got patient had you know gotten his infection form but now that we can see that links between the two we can rest assure that there isn't a mystery spreader out there still carrying the virus and still infecting people so it's good news for us in Singapore that's good to know finally some good news also this link was established very importantly by a serological tests now for those of us at home who don't know what a serological tests is what exactly is it and can you tell us you know yeah how exactly does it work so I think many of us may be familiar with the common test for the virus which is the PCR test now in that case what they do is they take swabs and it detects whether the virus is still present in your genetic material unfortunately this conventional method of testing only works if you are still infected with the virus now in the case of case might be one however she discovered much later on when the virus would have really left her body so in this case the serological tests which looks at the antibodies in in a person was necessary to determine whether she had in fact been infected by the virus what happens is when you invective with the virus your body produces things called antibodies which fight fight off the virus and this antibody stay in your body for the rest you know for years from then on and so even though the PCR test may not be able to swab you and and pick up any virus in your genetic material after you've recovered the serological tests can still did detect the presence of parenting bodies in your body which means that you have fought infection and you have been infected with it before okay so antibodies will stay in your body for years that's it so that means can you be infected again with with the same virus yes so this is quite a common concern is this and the answer is technically yes you can't be reinfected with the same virus but the antibodies will fight it off and you know it shouldn't have any ill effects on you or very mild effects and during this time you shouldn't be able to spread it to to others as far as I understand okay thank you so much Tim for explaining everything and finally the mystery between the linkages between these two clusters solved so that's all I have for you I'm Sam Joe back to you in the studio Dylan well thanks em Joe that was multimedia correspondent Yosef Joe as well as generalist Timothy go reporting live from the National Press Center at the Ministry of Communications and Information the multi ministry coronavirus task force also announced one more confirmed case bringing the total

108,kKVXU_qCInw,Academy of Medicine Singapore,Impact of COVID-19 On The Future Of Clinical Trials,2020-07-20T03:09:08Z,,you okay so it's just past five so i'll kick off this uh webinar uh good evening everyone for thank you for dialing in on a friday evening uh and welcome to our live webinar on the impact of covet 19 and the future of clinical trials this is organized by the college of clinician scientists and academy of medicine singapore i am daniel tan one of the senior consultants at the division of medical oncology national cancer center and i will be your moderator today before we begin i just want to highlight a few house rules and you know there will be a question and answer first and foremost there will be a question and answer um at the end of this um sessions um at the end of the sharing session and i encourage you to include uh to ask questions along the way and we'll hopefully have some time for discussions at that time um during the talks we will be muting to enable the speakers to present without interruption um but as i said i think we will have ample time to discuss some questions at the end the webinar will be recorded and there will be uh cme points for the local physicians um and this will be followed up with by the college clinician scientist um as i said there are many ways to uh ask questions and we will encourage you know the questions to come through throughout the session um for the for the for the final um half an hour when we'll discuss them so i would now like to invite professor pierce charles a senior consultant division of surgical oncology national cancer center and current president of the college of physician science clinician scientist to give the opening address yes yes thank you very much thank you daniel well welcome everyone to this webinar uh we are very pleased to present to you a very distinguished panel today the kobe 19 pandemic has really been an event that's unprecedented in modern history the speed at which the pandemic spread the devastating impact on the economy and the very fabric of society and many of the of the steps taken to control and contain the pandemic such as social distancing decreasing traffic within hospitals while important they also directly impact on the ability to carry out clinical research at the time when clinical research itself is required to solve many of the challenges we see with the covet-19 pandemic and and some of the consequences of this were devastating in the early days when there was almost a major reaction to sustain all clinical trials with the advent of covet 19 we see many patients who depend on clinical trials for their therapy to prolong their lives such as patients on oncology trials on cardiovascular medicine trials and even in infectious disease trials being denied the very care that they need but we also see many positive things happening we see a lot of important processes being speeded up in clinical trials such as in the regulatory field such as in the use of telemedicine with patients on clinical trials and also even in the way irb processes applications and what we have learned so far has been very useful these are early days yet but what we've learned so far will allow us to address the rest of the pandemic in a more positive way when there are second waves and third waves coming in and what we have assembled today by the college is a very imminent group of panelists from oncology from infectious disease from industry itself but also from the regulatory bodies so i i'm sure you will enjoy their discussions and derive a great a great deal from their experience so enjoy the evening daniel back to you hey thank you very much professor ciao so you know as prof charles mentioned clinical trials are key to advancing medical science and you know for this reason you know we thought it'd be extremely useful to share um the experience in what in different stakeholders and what we've gone through in the last six months so our first speaker uh is professor david lye who is director from infectious disease research and training office at the national center for infectious disease in singapore and profly have been on has been on the forefront in managing covet 19. patients in singapore has been involved in multiple clinical trials uh including the rendez-severe randomized phase 3 trial recently published and it's real privilege for us to hear from professor lai for this first lecture of conducting uh clinical trials in the midst of a pandemic and give his perspective as an id physician professor line just on mute so if you're unmute yourself sorry thank you uh for the introduction and i shall now uh share my screen now start a timer so this is more show and tell to uh to give you uh some uh learning points from uh the last six months uh in this pandemic uh thank you for spending your friday uh evening with us so um this is an unprecedented i mean this is the overused one unprecedented pandemic but uh in in stars and mers we clearly did not as as so as the 209 flu pandemic we really did not do so well when it comes to outbreak randomized control trials but one of the things that is very very uh unusual about the coding pandemic is the number of uh therapeutic trials as well as remember control trials so this is just an overview published in april at that point there were 200 odd treatment trials 150 seven lcd see a range of uh of investment invested but one of the problems with all this highlight is that among the antiviral for example yes out of 70 to 55 lct but out of this lct is only 32 percent of krm so you will never know even if you've gone through this rct if uh if this new infection without any treatment if a treatment really works and of course uh in blue uh all the trousers in china and then the in in the in all ranges in us and green is in europe you can see how uh you know everything that was done in china uh were duplicated in due in in u.s and europe except that the output response was less effective so we can also see that i just checked this after today i think there are now one thousand only one or five hundred interventional trials of which phase one and two was about ninety and in phase three and four nearly five uh more than four hundred the number of lcts are really amazing now how do we decide that we had the first patient in in singapore on 23rd of january how did we decide on what investing agents to do so number one we know that we have no time for novel therapeutics so we have to do repurposed drug the purpose drugs must have some in vitro efficacy must be reasonably safe and must have some uh some possible mechanism action so we went back to stars and mirrors and you read this review in cross medicine for stars uh it will tell you that uh in in the clinical trials in south asians inconclusive uh common plasma interferon type one uh kalishra inconclusive and it says that 29 studies of steroid 25 inconclusive 5 are classified as possible harm so hold that dot and then in mers the middle east chronovirus uh it says that the use of any therapeutic immerse is investigational uh and then the warrant for the investigation is constant plasma interferon riverine and and kalishra and corticosteroids driven monotherapy and mycotonic acid toxicities exit potential benefits so this is what we have in geranium now very soon after because uh uh this is from the lab you know uh this wuhan state laboratory actually uh uh sequence a virus but was prevented from releasing the sequence initially so you can read the story of of dr shun um and you can see that we very quickly uh know that ramji servia was the most active in terms of the ec50 i will get the pointers on so ec50 and also has a very good selective index more than 100. whereas uh for chloroquine is a bit higher and the selective index is a bit lower now we want we were not going to go to faber perovia which is a antiviral which has never found a virus to treat because the ec50 is around 60 and the selective index is less than 10. and river variant as well you can see that the ec50 is more than 100 and selective index is less than 10 because they're unlikely to work so there are some basis for our selection these are based on variable e6 cell culture data so um now how do we get into drum discipline trial on the on the first day of chinese new year i got on to the whole treatment trial call um and uh and volunteered myself to be in the political writing group and among the brighton group is actually dr john beigel who is a national director in nih uh and through him uh he's the bi of the london trial uh we got singapore and do this uh in the niagara and drum district trial we are subsequently published england which is the one that anthony falci uh said is a standard a new center of care now but the owner of ram distribute is actually gilia it developed it for uh ebola and an initial uh contact of from gilead uh from singapore as well as from other countries we always get this thing back uh china is that was the epicenter we are running out of effort there it's not a commercial product and uh and so on so um uh professor frank hayden from us was a former chair of the cdc standard advisory board so he introduced us to uh do the julia leadership in the in the u.s but at the same time uh i've got dr lisa willis from vice the vice president in healthcare of the edb and dr freda also calls with head license and domestic who managed to link us up as well with the uh global leadership uh of gilia and that makes it a lot easier and then we also got into the two uh civilian moderate covet 19 rcgs uh as well so we got three uh trials in singapore in march now how did we go so i think this is very important people always think that uh you know it takes a long time so for example uh for the gilead you can see the bit of submission of ethics and a little approval uh for all three trials vary between uh uh actually now just look at the first two columns nine days for the gilead and eleven days for the nih acpd one now actually two is just uh it's because it's an adaptive trial so the the uh the review is much faster so half the time and hsa similarly four to nine days very very fast now i mean the the nih shark is actually everyday in trial so i don't think we sacrifice on on riga but uh people basically just over time they walk through the the weekends and the evenings another agreement agreement is always the backbend of any uh uh uh trials especially international uh uh multicenter trials you can see that uh for the gilead trials we got it done in 13 days but the energy trials because there was some question of how nih is going to deal with the data it took a bit longer but essentially we persuaded our lawyers that uh we weren't particularly interested to argue too much they were arguing we would we just want the trial started how about recruitment so one of the features of the pandemic trial is the speed of ethics review and regulators review people work overtime uh the same amount of questions was asked but we just walked over time we answered on the same day we don't delete daily there was no weekend there was no evenings okay and uh recruitment the gilad severe trial recruited 400 patients over 28 days uh singapore got the 60 in eventually the moderate trial took a bit longer because most people most doctors across the countries were basically preferentially randomizing their severe patients the act trial a thousand patients over 58 days and then acd to a thousand patients over 53 days so not just once twice uh over 60 sites across many many countries so the second thing is the speed of recruitment uh everyone was just you know not even it's not just in singapore even the u.s same thing uh doctors were referring patients uh for randomization and enrollment uh it was it was more my patient uh is sick is is is potentially dying can you get the patient onto the trial but we still have to go through the illegitimate criteria we still have to consent the patient the proper way uh and we have to be very mindful as well of this pressure to be on the trial because the patient may feel that you know i want to be on the shroud in order to survive so we don't compromise on that and there were patients who uh did not get onto the trial because after proper concept they didn't know the risk now this is to show you the rlb approval i got permission from dr bansit from nhg you can see that for new studies many many studies these are not all trials but these are all the good networking studies they were as of two weeks ago there were 274 studies approved by dslrb nhg this is one of two ethics committee in singapore and most of them are proof you can see within two weeks okay uh and for amendments uh a bit long of course there were some there were some stragglers a bit further out but it is really very fast coveted 19 studies uh were prioritized uh but of course now uh uh rlbs have now uh gone back to uh peacetime a bit hopefully and not sacrificed oncology trials and the neurology trials and the cardiology trials this time we take consent uh the this is my colleague dr barnaby young he went in there with full ppe uh you know all the documents were done properly but we cannot bring it out because we can't uh disinfect uh the forms so we give this back to the patient and they usually throw it away when they leave the hospital and then we print out that we we save it and then print it out of documentation and then for samples all research samples from codename patients are considered bsl3 so uh our staff don't go in but the phlebotomist or the nurse will take the samples and then double back and put in the ice box and then transfer the bsl through the same day so the other part about this is that all of the samples have to go to bsl tree uh and invention protocols have to be approved by american safety as well as individual biocide committees which may disagree so um there's conservatively in getting special approval for one of our collaborators for example immunology and this has impact on research it took us a while to get our data on flow cytometry uh out we're just starting doing uh single cell and whole exhaust sequencing work you know china had no problem they got it out two months ago and some of the european sites have also started publishing we are still starting okay we just got our transgenic works uh started a few weeks ago you know so these are just the impact on delay in in research because of uh biosafety approval and review just to show you that of course uh where the epidemic was uh uh uh us uh recruited most of the patient named trial but if you compare singapore uh versus south korea or japan we'd rather do very badly even some of the european countries with many cases switzerland uk singapore did quite well so we were one of the most uh highest recruitment sites in asia so we really went out there to randomize our patients since early march so now this resulted obviously in uh this is the nih report it basically shows that uh ram distribute expedited recovery by four days but it also shows that other patients on oxygen but not intubated he reduced mortality by 78 which is not something that a lot of people uh look at it did not work it has not worked in those who are intubated of course the the gilead trial itself showed that five days work just as well as ten days and that's important because we are still in short supply or from the service and you don't you know for each course that you you use to treat one patient you can treat two patients now we also try to uh through uh edb and domestic we linked up with regeneron they wanted a biotech a successful ebola monthly body and uh i worked quite hard to get them sampled from our patient in early march and they derived highly effective bulk antibodies uh unfortunately unlike the gilead collaboration was successful they decided to uh to do their trials in u.s and in south america they got a lot more they got 500 million from u.s government so we had some uh some less success feedbacks as well now the other thing about uh the other thing both mentioned is the recovery trial uk nhs recruited 12 000 patients since the epidemic hit them in in late march uh and they showed that uh dexamethasone reduced mortality uh in for 35 percent in the incubator 20 in those on oxygen uh so lesser under severe and it did not help patients if not oxygen now the particular recovery trial is that for those who are uh not an oxygen 10 percent die and intubated 40 percent die so effect whether is is reproducible in our cohort is questionable but i'll highlight a few things firstly they do not collect data the way a registrant trial or usual lcd does because the information is supposed to be linkage to medical databases okay that's number one number two that they do not look for a lot of adverse events so it will only if it's reported in the medical records they will collect it they only look for a few particular adverse events and the last thing is very important they will randomize is that it is an lct it's multi-arm okay but if the attending physician feels that it's contraindicated doesn't like it they can actually uh not randomize that so if you look carefully at the premium report that was released in preprint actually about seven percent of patients randomized with enough care actually received from uh that's another stone so so it is a bit strange but nevertheless it overturned the dogma that steroid doesn't work which i highlighted to you in the method in the systematic review for stars and verse so what is next uh we completed ac2 trial which examined the second verse of placebo now why why do i mention this no one think that a jack inhibitor will work but it was predicted by ai benevolent ai based in uk and they didn't talk to us we were so early countries we i couldn't get any biologists to test it and then i already tested it after talking to them and then they they went to trial with nih uh we we are now planning the third trial we were going to do any body but it was vetoed by nih uh that's a metaphor after the uk trial came out but the americans and the british just couldn't couldn't agree in u.s from the soviet center of care in uk taxable set of care and they would not compromise on that so we can't compare from this versus as a matter for example and there was this very very promising drug called erdogan is already available is as active as uh rundesver uh there's this rich backbone therapeutics but because mud bought over this drug it was veto even though bridgebreck was very interested to work with us but now we're going with interferon data now if you look at the old data from sas and mers it will tell you uh it doesn't work okay but there's now new evidence new in vitro data there's a science article just last week showing interferon uh alpha and beta depletion in severe kovi and also two parasites in hong kong and iran showing a fairly potent antiviral efficacy so we are now uh going to uh uh again a thousand patients with activity and in order to get onto a lot of antibodies which we think will work better than composite plasma we are also engaged with nih to do this multi-armed two-stage lcd that's all i have i know the questions later thank you for your attention fantastic um thank you very much um david for that um really fascinating insight to you know what the your field has done in the last six months and you really have stress test this drug development system um so i think a lot of concepts there that we can learn from and we'll again save some of that for the question and answer towards the end of this um this next few lectures um and we've searched gears now to um the oncology field and um it's my pleasure to invite dr daphne day um who's the medical oncologist from monash health in monash university um she's a medical oncologist with expertise in breast head and neck cancer and drug development and you know when singapore at least when during the pandemic oncology care was still classified as essential service and some of the studies remain recruiting although with some challenges and you know it really made us really weigh out uh some of the risk benefit ratios uh in in getting patients on clinical trials and um it's a pleasure now for us to hear from dr daphne day um so daphne please thanks thanks daniel and thanks to the organizers and sponsors for inviting me i'll just share my screen so it's my pleasure to present a perspective from a clinical trial cancer clinical trial investigators view on the impact of covet 19 on cancer clinical trials my topic is recalibrating risk and benefit ratios for oncology clinical trials post covert 19. so i'll start with um this concept of um risk versus benefit in clinical trials and i think that there's risk inherent in any medical research the central question on an individual level is is the patient adequately informed of the risks and are they willing to accept the risks in exchange for the potential benefit of participating in a clinical trial unfortunately covet 19 has introduced a new dimension to risk management in cancer care there's the risk of covert 19 exposure a hospital visit which we would have previously seemed innocuous might represent to a patient an unknown additional risk of covert nitrate exposure there's increased burden on hospital resources and risks to trial operations which i'll touch on later and on the other side on the flip side if the patient isn't able to continue on a trial there's the risk of disruption to their care um so this is an analysis from medi-data medi-data is a online data platform that many clinical trials use worldwide what this shows is a huge decline in enrollment between march to may compared to the same time last year in clinical trials across therapeutic areas and there's oncology they're highlighted in red so a decrease in enrollment of about 50 to 60 percent um luckily there's been more recently a leveling off of this decline in enrollment and the numbers are starting to rebound and of course there's lots of regional variabilities depending on how much covet 19 is impacting locally this is data from clinicaltrials.gov and the cancer research institute showing that over a thousand trials stopped that's terminated or suspended due to covet 19 including 200 cancer studies in march and april um so moving from the impact on patient enrollment i just wanted to touch on clinical trial operation risks um so because of extended timelines due to covert 19 there's milestone delays missing data is a huge issue due to a myriad of reasons there's protocol deviations disruptions in drug supply chain increased operational burdens and geographical disability disparities and i think these risks actually very complex multifaceted and far-reaching i think ken who's following me will give an industry's perspective and might touch on some of these points a bit more um in the next two slides i just wanted to um give local examples of how we managed the covet 19 risks during this period i won't spend too long talking about infection control and physical distancing measures the next point is about risk benefit assessment and this is particularly tricky so our institution and ethics board allowed individual investigators and the department to assess each trial and for trials that are deemed tier one or tier two we were able to keep the trials going new trials and non-therapeutic trials were on hold patients who are already enrolled on existing trials were prioritized but new patient enrollment we had to discuss on a case-by-case basis um phase one trials are put there separately so phase one trials is a huge part of my work and it's associated with more experimental approaches and generally more intensive procedures and it's therefore deserve separate um consideration but even outside of clinical trials um you know mirroring this process is the considerations in standard of care cancer treatment and my colleagues and i spent much of february and march i would say going through the current treatments for all the patients in our department and really re-weighing that risk versus benefit um ratio and it caused a great deal of angst and a lot of work um remote solutions we pivoted to very early we were able to use telehealth from very early on and it's now constitutes most of our um consultations of via telehealth we're lucky in our institution that we already had the infrastructure and technology but we just let the impetus before to adapt the technology documentation remains vital and together with sponsors we worked on rationalizing procedures and limiting those to just those that have a scientific purpose i think the next two points are very crucial so communication in particular it's really important that we support and inform our patients during this very uncertain time and on the point of communication i had a message for sponsors and cros so i personally found it very helpful to receive memos from sponsors and clinical research organisations about their contingency plans for each trial not only just on a practical level but um it gave me a degree it showed a degree of i guess understanding for frontline staff um and a collaborative spirit which i found heartening um lastly the risk assessment process is continual and dynamic so over the last two months we were able to go back to normal operations whilst keeping some of our remote strategies in place but in the last two weeks melbourne is in the depth of a second covet 19 wave actually a much bigger wave than last time with much higher levels of community transmission and metropolitan melbourne is backing lockdown we're in the process of reassessing our workflow again so this slide is just to show that the risk mitigation strategies i mentioned earlier have also been adopted globally with the top two strategies being halting new patient recruitment and i think also delaying new studies and using virtual methods um so tim is one of my patients and i just wanted to use his story to talk about how we work together with the sponsor with the regulatory um agency and with our ethics board to help him navigate through the challenges of covet 19. so he's a very well 50 year old policeman he works full-time from hobart which is the capital of um the island state south of the australian mainland very beautiful place he unfortunately has metastatic bowel cancer but with the subtype for which immunotherapy is highly effective and australia doesn't have um reimbursement for this treatment so he was traveling every three weeks from hobart to melbourne to receive immunotherapy via a phase one clinical trial he was deriving clinical benefit and was uh you know working from home e cog zero not working from home sorry working full time as a policeman when covet 19 hit and australia went into lockdown with border restrictions across states in march that introduced a lot of challenges for his travel and he was quarantined he needed to quarantine away from his family for two weeks every time he returned to hobart um so this trial was testing a six weekly regimen at the same time in a different patient cohort and those of you who work in a phase one clinical trial would know that normally patients wouldn't be able to switch between cohorts for obvious reasons but we actually sought special consideration to the sponsor and they performed pharmacokinetic modeling on this patient and allowed the switch which meant his travel commitments were substantially decreased and we were able to do telehealth for non-treatment visits and then as of two weeks ago we're backing lockdown with strict border closures um because of the melbourne issue and we hobart tasmania is essentially covert free so we wanted to keep him safe so we are working with the sponsor and regulatory authorities and our ethics board to move his treatment to hobart as a satellite site using teletrials as the model so this is a very good time to go back to my original slide just to emphasize the benefits of clinical trials to an individual patient it can be the best and sometimes only treatment option and can be life-saving and on a societal level it's the way we move cancer care forward and it can impact thousands of patients [Music] so i think covet 19 has undoubtedly had devastating disruptive effects to cancer clinical trials but at the same time it has forced us to rethink some of our old habits um and really to work out ways to you know overcome the challenges that we've been faced so i've just highlighted three um challenges that i've found difficult in my practice um and how there has been positive change as a result of the covet 19 response i'm not sure if other investigators empathize with this but administrative burden has become growingly um has grown with increased trial complexity and it has added a lot to our work burden um it's and it's being identified as a barrier to trial conduct we know through covet 19 that these processes can be simplified and they can be pragmatic and as daniel said earlier today we can cut out the fat in running clinical trials and i hope these changes will continue into the future another big issue in australia being such a vast country is that trials are run in tertiary centers um which introduces inequality of x of excess and through the use of technology we're witnessing trial decentralization which i think is going to be paramount in helping to broaden participation thirdly there's a lack of public awareness before covert 19 about what clinical trials are i certainly would have to explain to someone for five to ten minutes about my job but now more than ever there's a heightened awareness and an appreciation of medical research and i think as a clinical trial community we can embrace that and harness that um now this slide really echoes what david had already talked about and i've just put it there to show how much we can achieve as a scientific community in an incredibly short amount of time when there's collective will as david said there's over 2 000 active and planned covert 19 trials that are rapidly recruiting in response regulatory authorities have also been very agile and they've issued emergency guidances [Music] which really uh look at how we can um make trials more flexible and more patient-centric um and i think there's this shows that there's an appetite from a regulatory perspective um to basically reform clinical trials and i hope again that momentum carries over so in closing i just wanted to say that covet 19 has exposed the vulnerabilities of our current clinical trial infrastructure but it has also sped up and accelerated much needed modernisation and i think collectively with all the stakeholders we can move toward a more patient-centered and sustainable trial paradigm if we work together thanks thank you daniel that's it for me thank you very much daphne so let's move on and it's a nice segue into the next two stakeholders that we have sharing from now and it's a real pleasure to introduce dr ken lee um who's the chief medical officer in asia pacific for icubia and you know he's going to share on some of the operational impact of the global pandemic on clinical trials so ken it over to you thanks very much daniel and thank you also to the organizers for inviting me here good evening everyone so the next section of the webinar we wanted to give a little bit more color and then certainly the industry view uh to the impact of the pandemic on studies to carry on from what the apnea is nicely presented there and then to focus a little bit about how these learnings are impacting the way that we're thinking about the studies and and how they would look and how they would run in the post code 19 roll on the new normal is as everyone is saying so just having difficulty moving my slide here okay so it's firstly on in in terms of the the impact it cover 19 has really impacted essentially every stakeholder every part of the ecosystem for the studies sites were not accessible either through lockdown or they had other more important things to do investigators um not just the expected ones like respiratory and infectious diseases but a lot of the other specialties had to be broken into the front line as well and then they did not have time to run studies the participants because of fear of infection were less willing to participate or they couldn't participate as i love the example from i wouldn't say lovely but good example from from hobart by daphne our key staff clinical research associates research coordinators could get onto site as well interrupting a lot of important on-site work and some nl vendors and labs to do the testing the samples the investigational product these were also impacted in in many ways and you know the next few slides i want to show you a little bit of data to sort of give you a flavor for how how big those impacts are this is this is our own our own data in terms of where we are seeing the different countries uh in the asia pacific region and where they are in the ocean 19 pandemic and also to give you a flavor at the different times as they progressed through how bad it impacted us on very important things for studies that the site would be open to monitoring that recruitment of new patients was possible and patients who already recruited an in-flight could come back right so at the peak of the pandemic um we essentially saw more than 80 of our sites we couldn't get onto our recruitment dropped by over 90 and subject visits the patients who already enrolled and needing to receive care they 70 dropped from that of 70 this is what would be our usual number the good news is a lot of countries are now moving to the right of that of that chart now which is nice to see and for some of the countries like um like china uh nearly to back to a pre-pandemic level in terms of these three metrics here here you give this is a survey that we did for the u.s and then canada sites give you a side perspective but also i think in our conversations here with our own staff and also with investigators and very similar by the and these are the key challenges that they cite in during the pandemic a lot of things around the patient and we'll talk a little bit about how we're taking that on board recruiting engaging retaining then a lot of things around doing the administrative tasks around preparing for the monitoring visits keeping the file upkeep and so on and then on the right what they thought were important to help and i am very encouraged to see that in that middle column this column on the on the left here um that we take not technology and enable remote access or what seem to be something that will be very important for them that would be very helpful to manage your pandemic the rest of the reasons here you know additional stuff so that brute force approach probably not not going to be sustainable but as new technologies come particularly around all these patient things and role schedule and so on hopefully we'll see as these come into play more and more citations that these would be also important and helpful things in a pandemic the pharmaceutical view um so this is uh some best research of the top 50 customers and then data comes from the top 30 companies with public statements so i think the very nice thing to see here is that half the companies try to leverage some sort of technology to to enable their study to continue and to venture follow-up naturally a lot of them delayed new studies delayed existing enrollment delayed new trials but you know that if you look between their statements in april and may the good news is that um with in may the decisions have been really made to to restart and to get enrollment going and that's that's continued to hold true uh through through to july and then here at this current time so what does that all mean so you know i think the you know daniel asked the in the before um about how we're preparing for and what investments we made so actually the industry had been trying to figure out how to do trials better and you heard this virtual trial throw thrown around in many definitions but a lot of components of that virtual trial model was going to be important uh in this close covered world they're diff and these are some rights here so some of the most strategic things i won't cover today but the obviously simplifying of the protocol new types of study designs but then the other things operational methods like having to do a lot of the on operations on site a lot of study-based procedures can be digitalized in some way to collect patient report outcomes to collect other types of vitals and then in the patients right there's so much was said about patients um in the feedback so using using digital and technology to recruit to keep patients informed and engaged while reducing their burden and increasing retention i think these these are things that clearly were going to be important and i wanted over the next few slides to cover them in a little bit more detail so the first is if just look at the store that side thing i think we've been criticizing industry of being rather old-fashioned and it's about you know probably uh probably valid because we haven't really changed the way that our studies have run for a long time uh on the basis that if it's not broken like i fix it but um the if you look on the left side here so much of our activities are so dependent on being able to get to the site but if you look on the right there's an equivalent thankfully thanks to technology today either here already or very very soon to be ready to be able to do that at home or near to the patient to do tele visits or to the home visits to take the consent to send imp drug supply directly to the student to the patient then so many more devices that can collect all manner of vitals and um and another type of health data many of the essential instruments for diseases and have an electronic version so facial report outcomes clinical science assessments can now be done and of course usual things like chat and so on to be able to follow up on patients are now all possible and a lot of these were implemented as you hear later from symmetra and also from daphne before will implement what will apply during the course of the pandemic so then just moving to recruitment i know so much about recruitment and and i think it's probably one of the two most controversial things in the whole virtual trial ecosystem the first is gaining access to the health record to do monitoring and so on which is controversial the other is essentially how we can recruit patients i think the top is something we discussed previously from uh we're using more health records claims data so that we can find patients particularly patients known to design more quickly more accurately using some ai sometimes even but at the bottom there you know patient's not known to size and particularly for some indications we have not more oncology but a lot of the other more lifestyle-based diseases patients are not known to the sites and have direct patient and physician recruitment and referral techniques through social media through search search engine optimization other types of traditional media i mean you see you know advertisements for uh you know great examples from the wall street journal for uh for patients for clover 19 studies for example i mean it's probably a very dramatic version but certainly something heading in this direction in order to be able to find and to follow up and engage patients so that's another thing and probably good for that to be discussed a little bit later um the other piece is that we're also looking at how the ecosystem is going to look right and and definitely show that beautiful picture where the patient is clearly at the center and and that the study team is probably going to look the different in the post cover 19 world i mean the investigators there of course but will be supported by in a way different parts of a healthcare team right maybe the patient's practitioner phlebotomist to go to the home home nursing to do the follow-up visits they'll get a lot of data fed remotely through health devices um that that are propping up and getting better every day and of course we have our cras and our research coordinators and there's probably different members of the team that we're looking at and how who will complement this in the future right and maybe it's a hybrid role or something like that is to be is to be seen but there'll be someone managing the recruitment particularly on the the digital ways a study concierge a patient guide to to bring them through i think that that's clearly going to be you know very very different uh in the future but enabling really a very patient-centric approach i think the other interesting thing is um you know virtual trials uh has been around for nearly a decade actually the the first claim to having been done uh doing a virtual trial was nearly 10 years ago in 2011 by pfizer over active leather study um but since then you know we've not had all that many we've started and it's been very very challenging um and i think we're probably here at the moment um but thanks to well i'm not sure thanks for coming from a cover 19 it's certainly accelerating the interest of the industry the willingness to really challenge the status quo and changing um that and i think we do see that a number of the different components um [Music] discussed here today will will be implemented in the trials of the future that will not only help us to be a little bit more pandemic proof in terms of continuity but also enable patients to be a bit more set the trial being a lot more patient friendly the journey being a lot more pleasant uh so that we can run studies more effectively and recruit patients and engage them more more effectively as well and i'll just leave you here with a little picture of probably what the life is going to be in in the upcoming years you probably all the different stakeholders on the phone today will be engaging with screens like this and platforms like this across our devices via that mobile tablet or you know on a pc um because and then that's that's probably going to be the the new place um and i'm very encouraged by that because i think it will enable studies to be run better and to be certainly a lot more you know pandemic group in the future on that note thank you very much i'll pass back to you thank you very much ken um so lots of you know fantastic ideas and potential future for some of the way we operate clinical trials and you know i guess a lot of us often take advice from our regulatory agencies so it's very apt that we now hear from sumitra sachi dinardan who's a regulatory consultant from the innovation office and clinical trials branch and you know she'll be sharing with us on the topic of regulating clinical trials during a pandemic and she's really been you know really helpful to a lot of investigators and all of all of us during this time so um sumitra over the time over to you now uh thanks daniel i'm not sure if y'all are able to see my screen no if you try slideshow mode maybe that would show up there's a big gray screen there is it better now is that better now that's right that's fine okay so um yes first of all thank you thank you very much to the organizers for inviting hsa to share our experience um on regulating clinical trials during a pandemic um so i'm here to actually share with you our experience on regulatory facilitation as well as how we eventually helped to manage the impact of covet 19 clinical trials and also the impact of provide 19 on the future of clinical trials [Music] okay so basically is uh as part of regulatory facilitation um hsas i don't know uh angelina i think you you need to mute sorry sorry okay so as part of regulatory facilitation um hsa has actually been adapting with regulatory agility to accelerate the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines that are needed to combat the covet-19 pandemic so as part of that we provide scientific and regulatory advice to sponsors and investigators to advance quickly promising therapeutics to clinical trials uh we also expedite the review of clinical trials through rolling submission um and i'll share i shall share more about that in my subsequent slides to date we have approved about eight covet 19 clinical trials and we also provide regulatory guidance on conduct of clinical trials during covet 19 situation to sponsors and investigators so um i'm actually part of the innovation office and clinical trials branch of hsa where we engage sponsors and investigators in protocol development um collaborate with both local and international organizations as well as regulate clinical trials of therapeutic products and medicinal products we are also part of the international coalition of medicine's regulatory agencies called igra for short it comprises 29 members uh represented by hits of regulatory agencies and who is actually an observer so ignore conducts fortnightly teleconferences during the pandemic to discuss key regulatory developments and policies and to share information that can help to speed up the development of therapeutics and vaccines for covet 19. it's an authoritative regulatory grouping that urges the regulatory community to prioritize and not run large randomized controlled trials so key characteristics of covit-19 clinical trials most likely to generate conclusive evidence include methodologically robust study design and the use of robust endpoints sufficient statistical power to conclude with reliable results realistic recruitment and completion capacity and address an unmet medical need so as part of regulatory facilitation we've also accelerated covert 19 clinical trials this is done through early engagement with sponsors investigators through pre-submission meetings and these pre-submission meetings can actually take place as early as three to four months prior to the actual clinical trial submission to hsa and uh even when um uh preclinical data or manufacturing data is even not available yet we have also allowed for rolling submission of clinical trial applications uh where information can be submitted to hsa and on an ongoing basis before the formal clinical trial application and this would include like non-clinical data cmc data draft protocol and inform consent form and the investigators brochure uh which are submitted to hsa for us to take a look and give our feedback before the formal clinical trial submission and this has actually largely helped to reduce the regulatory review timelines as shared by david earlier on we also continuously engage with sponsors and investigators during the review of clinical trial applications and that has also helped to reduce the regulatory review timelines another part of regulatory facilitation is to provide access to trial participants so as shared by my fellow speakers earlier on uh we've allowed for telemedicine for remote consultation alternative ways of obtaining informed consent which i will elaborate later investigation products supply via direct to patient service remote study visits as well as electronic data capture using electronic clinical outcome assessments like e-pro devices so um as shared by my colleagues earlier on um so covet 19 has significantly impacted the conduct of clinical trials as you can see here and shared by daphne and ken earlier on so what we've done is um we have actually shared a regulatory guidance on uh conducting clinical trials during covet 19 situation and this was issued on 27th of march in that we actually provided important considerations for contingency measures but it's important that whatever uh contingency measure that you plan to implement you must always concer consider the safety of child participants as well as data integrity and quality so for example for informed consent i think some of the challenges that the investigators faced was for example if the child participant was isolated due to covet 19 then the hospital's infection control policy prohibited any materials from being removed from the isolation ward so as such what we allowed was uh for a for a photograph of the informed consent document that has been signed by the trial participant and the investigator to be taken and that to be actually transmitted uh you know electronically so that either a hard copy can be printed and certified as true copy and provided to the trial participant upon discharge or it could be also filed on site um or it could be even filed electronically and sent to the job participant by email another thing we've allowed is remote consent where consent is actually conducted between the investigator and the trial participant at different locations via audio and video calls and thirdly we've also allowed for electronic consent where electronic systems are used to provide trial information as well as to obtain informed consent so important considerations for informed consent would be to ensure that safeguards the right safety and well-being of trial participants are safeguarded uh data security confidentiality reliability integrity and quality are assured so i'd like to remind investigators that if you have any intention to roll out for example remote consent or electronic consent apart from consulting dsrb or your cirb as well as hsa it'll be important to also consult your it department as well as your legal department on um you know the impact on data privacy uh as well as acceptability of the electronic system that you're intending to use and it's better to do this early on rather than wait until you submit your protocol to the irb and hsa it's also important to ensure that basic principles of informed consent like information comprehension and voluntariness are assured and the regulatory provisions of informed consent are complied with so another part of enabling measures is actually investigation product supply so i think the speakers have actually discussed at length about direct to patient supply where their ip is actually delivered to the trial participants homes but this is only possible if the ip can be self-administered by the trial participant so we had other sponsors that approached us uh um about the possibility of you know uh admit administering the ip at remote medical facilities or switching the ip to a commercial supply because it's a local locally registered ip or switching the child participant to standard of care or even this continuing study treatment so regardless of the implement the contingency measure it's important to ensure that safety of child participants is paramount and ip security accountability traceability and compliance the ip storage requirements uh is compliant with and not to forget that the investigator is ultimately responsible for ip management for a clinical trial so there has to be adequate pi oversight another thing is about study visits so as you know because of quarantine orders stay home notice visit restrictions imposed by hospitals or even trouble in restrictions many of these child participants were unable to return to the study site for study follow-up so we have actually allowed for laboratory tests and diagnostic tests to be done at remote facilities as well as telephone consultations to be done via audio calls and video calls so then again a reminder to investigators for teddy medicine it would be good to actually consult your itd department on the acceptable teddy medicine software to be used okay because usually for clinical practice uh the it uh department would have already been aware of uh which is a recommended software to use for teddy medicine so similarly um it should also apply for clinical trials okay and important considerations would again be safety of trial participants whether it can be reasonably assured through the alternative efficacy and safety monitoring approach again data security confidentiality reliability integrity and quality are assured as well as there should be adequate pi oversight another thing is actually for sponsors so um as shared by uh ken so basically is uh performing on-site monitoring visits was a challenge and uh sponsors actually resorted to either cancelling monitoring visits or even postponing it during the coffee 19 situation or um if not move towards uh centralized monitoring of electronic systems or even remote monitoring so for remote monitoring i'd like to emphasize that locally if you're planning to do remote monitoring which involves remote source document verification where the source documents like maybe medical records of the participant needs to be transmitted remotely um i'll just like to remind um all sponsors and investigators that we actually do not recommend uploading identifiable source documents for the purpose of remote monitoring um so it has to be de-identified uh because this is actually to protect uh the trial participant participant privacy as well data confidentiality so um it would be recommended for sponsors to conduct uh to adopt a risk-based approach to monitoring and they focus on data and processes that are critical to protecting the right safety and well-being of child participants as well as the data integrity and quality again i i cannot emphasize any more but data security confidentiality reliability integrity and quality are assured and they also should consider the burden that might be imposed on study staff as well as facilities in having them to de-identify the source documents and upload it you know so that it can be reviewed remotely by the monitor so um in line with the theme of today's webinar um so covet 19 definitely has had an impact on the future of clinical trials and there's definitely a need to future proof and optimize clinical trials and this actually starts from study design itself okay um consider maybe implementing virtual visits um using uh electronic consent or remote consent okay or electronic systems uh as well as informed consent procedures um eligibility assessment and ip supply ongoing safety and efficacy assessments so um for example i think this has already been covered by my previous speakers so just to wrap it up so some consideration for sponsors and investigators is in the future would be telemedicine for video consultation um a lot electronic consent uh digital monitoring technologies for example using a an apple watch you know to monitor the patient's health status home visits where you send nurses to the participants homes to you know to do some study procedures like blood draws and even ip administration then supplying the ip via direct to patient supply as well as electronic clinical outcome assessments so virtual clinical trials it can complement traditional clinical trials but at present i don't think it would actually completely replace it benefits is that it reduces the need for face-to-face visits so as such it's more efficient and less burdensome to the trial participants it also allows meaningful and complete understanding of child participants conditions and responses but challenges would be safeguarding a privacy of child participants again data security confidentiality reliability quality and integrity cost for the setup and maintenance as well as unreliability because certain study populations may not be very you know familiar or keen to use all these electronic systems so whatever the case we would recommend that sponsors consult hsa as well as your irbs on the plans prior to implementation so i've come to the end of my presentation and welcome any questions if you have thank you thank you very much sumitra now i will come to the question and answer session um and we've got about just uh 15 about 15 minutes for this and we want to thank the audience for having posted some questions i thought maybe since we had a few questions on the regulatory aspects and i think this is something that is worth um discussing further you know how much of these um you know adaptations that hsa or the regulatory agencies have made in the midst of the pandemic how much do you think can be really adopted and applied to in the future because clearly you know i think it's unsustainable as well for everyone to be working around the clock like that but you know do you have a sense of you know what what how how how we should prioritize the kind of things that we want to implement uh sumitra maybe that question to you yeah um so i suppose um lessons learned would be uh like for example the use of uh digital technologies uh you know for virtual clinical trials i think it's the way forward um and i think uh collaboration is very important uh not only between pis and sponsors but also with your regulator and your irb um you know to work together towards a common goal and early engagement is very important um so like i mentioned you know we have pre-engagement pre-submission meetings uh even when the product is still early in its development phase and that has actually helped to sponsor companies to take our feedback uh and you know by the time that it's submitted as a clinical trial it actually speeds up the regulatory approval timelines um and also i think the change of mindset is very important because uh you know with digital transformation um i think it's uh like what ken shared earlier i mean some of these virtual uh clinical trial technologies it's nothing new actually but maybe earlier on before profit 19 there might have been some resistance um you know or concerns uh but now because we've had a chance to test them um and i think uh we are more confident of you know implementing them i would encourage sponsors and investigators to basically uh pursue you know these options when they are conducting clinical trials in the future okay thanks so we also have a lot of interest and uh some of the covert trials that um you know david had discussed earlier and some of them also relate to you know the concept of you know uh having trials that are there for access i i guess a few few thoughts about the the you know what david senses with regards to phase three trials certainly in a lot of um some instances we repeat some basic trials are done in different ethnic populations just so that you can you know basically better characterize safety and efficacy did you see a lot of i mean it looks like there was a wave of trials going on um you know in the covet situation were there as many metoo trials that you you know that that you think happened um and you know it was their streamlining of some of the regulatory approvals for example in in different countries and maybe that question to david and then to maybe just intro as well if you if you know from the approval side of things maybe i will answer some of the collective questions on this aspect now are there wasted trials i think certainly they are and what do i mean by that there are a lot of trials of sample size less than 100. uh it's not it is a repurposed drugs so people wanting to do a study on their own uh does not seem to want to collaborate and notice in the trials uh so this is a waste of opportunity lack of standard of care will not inform efficacy on a new disease with no proven treatment and uh so for example if you think about the khalifa triangular visible travels in china in wuhan they had the opportunity to inform the world if these two drugs will work if they have collaborated you know there are so many patients 80 000 patients in china but no they wanted to study uh traditional chinese medicine europa studies steroids study this and that there was no coordination so i think uh and then and the lessons will never learn you see it again in europe you see it again in the in the u.s now uh what about this controversial uh issue of gilead expanding the population now gilead was actually never really going to run the trial to answer the question if it works uh and but people asked for the drugs and they didn't want to repeat the mistakes of uh baramavia in pandemic where the drugs was imper iv and hyper was was made available without any research uh so they designed a trial to answer the question of duration and they collected on safety uh and it's primarily for access it was always meant to be for access if the initial data wasn't good they were they weren't going to continue beyond that so but once they knew that something was okay because of the smb then it expanded it to 6000 for the severe patients for a thousand for the modern patient it was purely for access now was there any benefit for other countries after the access i i don't know about the others but we were able to have some negotiation uh and uh and uh and uh but of course commercial supply is short and as we now know the u.s has mopped out the vote supply for three months now that's the important part of having a grandma's control trial because i can tell you that in march i saw a lot of liver abnormality and as doctors we have biases but if you look at all three lcps from gilead from nih from china compared with uh with with uh with placebo within healthcare there was no difference in the abnormality but that's the importance of lct even if a pandemic that kills people because they don't randomize you don't have placebo control don't understand of km you're never going to find out if there is benefit or that's how i think this is my my key uh my my key answers to the question thank you thank you david um and sumitra do you have a you know the sense about harmonization or regulatory agencies internationally in terms of accepting uh trials done in different countries or do you think that still that's that is somewhat um you know rigid framework no um um we we do actually harmonize with our um fellow regulatory agencies and we also prioritize so uh especially for covet 19 uh you know like i said earlier um we actually prioritized the covet 19 clinical trials and i think that actually helped to speed up the regulatory review timelines so i think uh definitely yes okay and then a practical question on on covet 19 um handling and and storage and shipping i i suppose there was a question then take this opportunity to also bring pierce into a discussion because he had been um helping with some of our policies so um you know in terms of um any um two two things so one you know any special kind of precautions for for shipping out samples uh in this question maybe to david mps and then whether or not we should be um you know how should we be testing should we be testing for covet for patients in clinical trials right i think i'll probably address that part of the clinical trials that do not involve disease so one of the impact on clinical trials such as cancer trials was of course that uh most of the trials was suspended and in addition even when we start we are not allowed to collect samples which of course defeats the purpose of many of the studies so so we look at that and we came up with a set of guidelines to say firstly if you were to collect samples from a patient and that patient obviously has signs and symptoms of coping 19 that's not going to work so no no clinician or no investigator is going to collect a sample from a patient who is sick so so the samples are going to be collected from patients who are well or not safe because these are not coveted studies so your only concern now is whether these are asymptomatic because if they are symptomatic you're not collecting them and if you are collecting from asymptomatics uh inevitably then the only risk is if you collect from the gi tract or the respiratory tract if you collect from the breast from the liver from the prostate there's absolutely no risk so we we put up a greater scale of risk so in our institution if you collect samples from the respiratory tract for example they have to be stored separately from the rest of the samples or the duration of the copy and there is an expectation that you need to make sure that they are covet-free before you do experiments on them but for the rest of the samples uh the normal rules should apply and that risk should not be increased so with that we restarted our research enterprise in fact before that we were really really bogged down maybe david can address the samples collected from covet patients yeah so we got a lot of that because you realize that the first wave was china and and you know it was really difficult to get samples out of china but when uh and singapore was the top of the lake outside of china and once hits us in europe was quite disappointed you know we dropped on the league table but nevertheless we're connected by a lot of people they want the virus they want the sierra they want everything it was it was really quite difficult because uh sometimes there was absolutely no hypothesis they just want it okay of course uh and and uh and sometimes it's a very scientific reason but uh but we we don't know what is the best field of transferring because it's all bsl3's data involved so essentially uh what we did in the end is uh we go through uh the international sharing platform the qho or sierra even to the uh national institute of budget standards and control and that's what we could process you know we send it to the international agency that regulates it and then and then they share it out among the uh uh the people that request it because there's proper documentation and all that and and all the requests come in from all sides some of them go to the minister's side and go to another design go to tms it was it was just crazy i think following from what david has said i think the common observation is that at the time where science was most most needed and most crucial a lot of the research done fell short of the standards expected of a good scientific research project so going forward david do you think there's a way that we can be more coordinated and less wasteful of opportunities uh i mean we can only do it within our sphere of influence right so uh in in in in march and february i talk to a lot of people i talk to a lot of people and how to explain to them now why do you want to do a study in hospital a why not do a student hospital b what can we just do together as a national work group and some people perceive that i was very cautious of being perceived as blocking people but because what we're trying to prevent is exactly what happened in china in a lot of countries with a multiple small study which never finished recruitment uh so um but once the evidence explodes is free for all i think there is there's a lot to argue for working together uh and uh because you get there faster i mean for example how do you recruit a thousand patients in less than two months it was just unheard of uh also pandemic and even during the pandemic for example a lot of industry trials they could not finish even 500. if i look at roche and and in sanofi ielts experience antagonist trial uh it was a lot slower than that whereas there are multiple sites in a lot of countries and the epidemic will increase and win in different countries you have you have a catchment area and i think that is the benefit of international all this under collaboration great so we have two more questions and then i think we and there so one is the practical question um and you know david this in the covert positive patients i guess we are told that maybe some regional participants were cooked and community spread or rates are different in different countries now would i mean i guess you would exclude patients from that and you would advise against them from being enrolled onto trials for now um and you know if you do pick that up you mean it depends on what trials you are in right if you are if you are in an id trial and you want them but but certainly if you got an oncology trial you definitely don't want to have a code positive patient it's now being shown that uh you know uh surgery in the coconut patient leads to higher uh respiratory complications uh so we advise differ or non-urgent surgery and and and and this virus is really it is really everything falling in together to become the perfect pandemic virus you know it has so many multisystem complications that we are just learning about it whereas the heart the brain you know the blood vessels and so now people are saying you know do we do we do we test more people uh and at one point we can't when germany started testing the pcr reagents supply went down when u.s uh rabbit the testing there was shock supply and so on but but now we can and i think our strategy and policy should be informed by uh by uh uh impact on practice as well as science okay and the last question i would just ask each person to comment because it's really you know speaking to the point of having trying to foster more collaborations how we're going to collectively change that mindset right of of trying to embrace these new technologies um and clearly i guess you know we start maybe with david then we go around the room but and you know i think yours the pandemic has really forced that in your id field do you see a lot of these things being applied to even now you know the next phases of other id research and you know is that something that you know you can champion and eat the way on well you see when we talk about how how efficient and how fast people work you know people that has impact on it right it really has uh all our lives have been turned upside down and i really don't expect that you know i i don't think it can continue for too long but i also hope that uh in in the future uh you know uh ethics and regulatory oversight and agreements do not have to take months and months because people now realize that you can do it more efficiently uh and then of course you know for for for for trials uh you know uh we have uh the activation was done remotely uh the uh the trial monitoring was done the training was done remotely and the trial was uh the monitoring was done remotely and uh and yet it was it is still fta uh uh accreditable so so i think these are things that we should learn but but i also don't don't think that we should um make the attics and regulators uh lose their sleep and their weekends sumitra um yes so i think that keeping an open mindset is very important um and you know basically that uh by embracing digital transformation i think it can actually uh you know allow the clinical trials to be conducted in a different way compared to the traditional uh methods um and also collaboration is very important so uh like i mentioned earlier um you know i think early collaboration so you know for investigators don't just only just consult your sponsors but also consult for example your it departments uh legal departments um you know get involved with hsa you know now you know who we are so um uh you know you can actually consult us anytime uh even your irb um so it's it's very important that everyone works together towards a common goal okay and um daphne um you know collaborate your your take on how we're going to push move the needle together i'm going to keep my answers short i just have a screaming one-year-old in the background um but yeah i agree with everyone that i think we've seen new ways of doing things um that we've been forced up out of our old habits i also agree with david that we can only sort of work within our own sphere of influence um but there has been a lot of um i think spirit for collaboration and i think there's a lot of uh momentum to change things can yeah so i i mean i think the changes are definitely upon us it's it's challenging the status quo i saw a question on the q and a we didn't get a chance to talk about it about a study that was rejected um so directed patient study with some home intuitions that's right and maybe you know you you can reach out to other like individuals like myself to look at that and we can talk more with each other see what we can do about that but take these practical examples and challenge them i mean homework fusion is probably one of the more complicated areas uh so we may want to also take some steps towards less controversial items like uh you know e-consent and you know patient report outcomes and things like that yeah but yeah if we continue to do that i'm sure we'll be successful and pierce as a trial list for many regional sites and you know chairing the college of clinician scientists what are your you know thoughts or how we can you know move make this ecosystem move i think what what the kovic 19 has shown us is that many of these clinical studies can be done with much much less fat so moving forward it is uh i wonder whether is is going we are going to see more and more pragmatic trials uh and in in many ways this is only possible if the regulatory authorities are in favor of that and in fact industry itself supports that so maybe these are two questions that we can hear from sumitra and and when you see pragmatic trials you mean like uh what this recovery trial where you build exactly because that's right you have a particular particular scientific endpoint that you need many of the other stuff are you required for registration purposes or for other purposes not related to the basic science to the fundamental science uh you want scientific answer that you want to so of course a lot of iits are more pragmatic in the sense but lots of trials as you can see during the the copy 19 pandemic are really bogged down because of all these other things so moving moving forward sumitra for example do you think the regulatory authority sees a better a bigger role for pragmatic trials and can you think you think industry will accept that yeah um i think there will be a definitely a bigger role for pragmatic trials as you mentioned because investigating trials always geared towards that um so over to yeah for sure i think anything that helps to do things more efficiently and bring therapies patients faster you know it's always going to be appreciated by industry that that's for sure right it's great okay so i think with now you know just past 6 15 so we've come to the end of our q a session i think thank all the participants and for the questions as well as the speakers for the active discussions and we hope that you have enjoyed um and and benefited from this discussion i also actually want to thank some of the support from roche who actually you know in part had supported this event so appreciate any continued feedback on this i think the con you know i think that what we've learned is that change is indeed possible and we really need to really kind of embrace this as we move forward and design clinical trials that are so essential to advancing medical science so thank you everyone for um the for for their attendance today so have a good evening all right thanks thank you very much thank you thank you bye have a good weekend b you ,True,False,False,False

has installed for me but I'm going in with an open mind you know. My name is Louis Chia you can call me Louis I'm a Fengshui consultant for Joey Yap
group and basically I'm based in Singapore Do you feel like it's a calling you wake up one morning you say okay! I wanna be Fengshui consultant Not really so, in fact I started as a
non-believer then it was because of the crisis the down turn was so bad that I
literally basically no where to go to I wanted to see what I can do to actually improve the
business and that's how I got into Chinese metaphysics and I also found out
that actually Chinese metaphysics it's like science in China and it dates back
thousands of years from my point of view I feel like I'm
not sure whether I believe in Fengshui Firstly, I wanna ask. What is Fengshui? Fengshui is part of the Chinese metaphysics so we talk about the five elements, you know
the fire, wood, metal water... lightning? No, there's no lighting. Our five main organs
divided into the five different elements the Chinese traditional scholars they
actually named the stars! Jin xing (metal star) , mu xing (wood star), shui xing (water star), huo xing (fire star), tu xing (earth star) So the five planets
the energy from the planets how they affect us So the five organs is like
different elements right? Yes. What is the heart? The heart is fire. Woahhh~~
The one that gives you life Is there a course or maybe a
degree you can take in Fengshui? How does one actually become a Fengshui consultant? Joey Yap Academy is the biggest,
academy school in the world that actually teaches Chinese metaphysics. Ya, the office is quite nice actually It's fancy, it's not what I expected.
I expected to go to some underground tunnel Basement... then the person down there okay,
what do you want to ask me? We are not those traditional Fengshui school that tells you about placement, colour...
Water fountain behind you Ya, then you have to hang...
Orb, crystal Ya, then you hang bbq pork here and there We are more into classical fengshui and
classical fengshui we actually really study the stars astrological movements Our solar system moves rotates and so forth and
different planets actually they give out different energy. Woah, I love that leh! in ancient China, so they don't have TVs they don't have instagram and they got no influencers to follow. so day in day out, they just look at the stars.
Note down the positioning of the stars.
Yes you're right! yeah they note the position and then they see how the whole states the
warring states and the country and so forth how things happen then they found out,
oh there's actually linkage! From what I learned so far it's a bit like probability and statistics. Not 100% is
confirmed plus chop he say this it would happen but is you can take into consideration ah?
Destiny is in your own hands. All these Chinese metaphysics
they will tell you about opportunity whether to grab the opportunity or not
depends solely on the individuals So what are the services that you provide? We can do a destiny reading which is your Ba Zi More of a personal reading yeah, we can also
do date selections for example wedding we can also do house selection.
TOO LATE! OH NO! 
James is actually behind the camera today so he might be saying hi we can also look into your health,
we can look into business. Okay so, maybe let's dive into this Based on the date
and time we will then understand that kind of energy that is imprinted to that new birth.
Which is this! Tell me the details!
Let's start with, Career :D Okay yes Let me tell you what I feel about my career first lah, before you say anything, okay~ Ya sure.
So we see whether it's really accurate or not I've always been feeling like doubtful about my career.
Like, I don't know whether to continue doing this, or like find a proper job.
So I don't know, a bit... STUCK. And then here, he has stuck on his page okay!
He write stuck here!! *ughhhh* So you are born on the 'Ji Hai' day which is exactly same as me.
Ji is basically earth and Hai is the Pig So what? Means I like to eat Char Siew? No no no, nothing to do with that. Last year was actually a 'Ji Hai' year and that happened to be exactly the same element as your day master okay what happen is
that you will feel doubtful on that year you will feel stuck you will feel that
you don't know why you are here what you are doing you you basically will feel
lost and emotionally unstable You'll basically feel frustration.
You felt that the world is not looking after you This year also leh, this year
the world like quite bad also ah? Devastating fires in Australia.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases it comes from China. this year things looks to be better actually
The year already almost halfway done!! Now, on career wise, moving on to this year
which is the Metal Rat year you tend to be more busier you will
want to go out and make a change and do something different!
In 2021, okay it's going to be even more exciting because 2021 happen to be a 'Tai Sui' year for you If you are single you might get married change your status,
That was exactly what we were planning! Oh this is so freakyyyy You might even change the place of staying
YES! In your career pillar Career pillar is a 'Xin' metal
basically you in your career you'll be more into like a dolling up make sure
that you are presentable you are very serious about your presentation.
One point is very funny because he said ""No wonder she looks so pretty to me lol"" HAHHAH In fact the chart also says that you are better off in running your own business
in a creative manner YAY!!!
You should you should be spotting trends
and in fact lead the trend. Based on your chart okay we can tell that you are a very good
connector you are very good at networking, breaking ice.. people will
tend to like to basically talk to you This year is actually your Noblemen and
your Peach Blossom year, that means this year you tend to have more opportunities
for helpful people to come by. But peach blossoms eh? Peach blossom means like? Peach blossom basically means network. Sociability, likability.
In fact if you are very high with your peach blossom you can create raving fans! Your profile is more towards wealth and output Will I be a millionaire???
If you put in enough, the right effort you can be a miliionare So now how to be a millionaire.
How to be a millionaire hahhaa Any bad news or not?
So far like very very positive Based on your whole chart,
you actually have a so called a cold chart that means you are short of fire. 
When you talk about health we can also see that fire is the weakest in terms of your health.
You have to be more careful on your fire on your related organs, so your eyesight, your heart. All these are fire related organs. I think for my heart right,
the only highest probability is that if James Seah break my heart lo What?
Then I will die from that T_T Okay heh, moving on~
Quite big arrow Is there something I can buy? Or something I can bring along to increase my fire? You should do more exercise. Oh no!!! Treadmill, running... Train your heart!
This is the worst news I've heard today *ANGST* Relationships! What is the tea? This month we call the 'Ji Mao' month What? Wa, my water almost spit out
Ji Mao? Which is your relationships,
you will feel a bit stuck. This month only lah!
Next month okay already? This month which is the Rabbit Okay the earth rabbit.
Rabbit you actually have a hidden 7K inside
Money? Means Seven killings. It's just a name~ *internally screaming* 7K basically means are changes a lot of
uncertainty, ups and downs so forth Things that  you can't really control.
So, relationships wise this month better better be more aware. In fact the best way to
resolve all this issue is basically awareness. When suddenly you feel like for
example emotionally unstable you feel like shouting already, you feel like killing
them oh then you control, Oh! This is the bad month x 2 I wanna ask you a few questions.
As you know that like Me and James are planning for our big day, maybe sometime next year? Like is it a good time?
Based on the charts, next year should be the change Okay, next year change of status
change of staying place and career and so forth so triggering the change, next
year will be a good year quality 2021. You will want to find a good day, the reason
on doing that basically is like buying shares. You wanna forecast when is the time
of going into the market when is a good time to pull up on a market depending on
different Ba Zi Charts we can tell based on statistics that oh this few
types of Ba Zi if you get married on these few dates they tend to have very
fruitful relationship. Smooth Sailing I won't tell you it's 100% accurate because the
human element still have to come in So would you recommend like couples thinking of getting married to consult first or they just anyhow pick what number they want
Er, I would say, everyone would want
a once in a lifetime marriage right? So why not, do it right the
first time the only time yeah and make it right it's a it's a big event
Yeah! Let's say if I wanna get pregnant Is there a specific year that it's good for me?
If you want to get pregnant, first thing you need to do is to look for a doctor.
do for baby then you keep
adding view this is a very very tiny Because some people will say
like oh if you have a chicken baby then your chicken baby will
keep fighting with you, that kind? Ah, this is very tiny small part of life. Some people do, caesarean date selection. 
What we are doing is that we backtrack which is the best
Ba Zi that the parent's actually want so you're actually bringing opportunity to
the child but whether the child eventually go that direction 
depends actually heavily on the child Others okay, going to something more generic? Interesting, I would say
Interesting points! Basically, this year will be a very emotional year okay in terms of the
whole global outlook, and then when we talk about as a water water year, the Rat is a water year.
You will have a lot of water related issue. For metal, metal the lungs is actually metal! So you'll notice that COVID Is actually a lot of people die
because the lungs got water! So this is the year of the *idk* the metal above water
that will create all these issues The very popular question
when will COVID subside? Bonus leh, this is a bonus clip! but I am NOT saying that you will
definitely happen but the forecasting looks like in July,
things will start to get better From this whole session I feel like 
Fengshui is a reference point At the end of the day is still in your own hands
because you might have my luck that the gods but if you're not doing anything then you're just stuck.
Yes It's like a road map, you have the road map you have the schedule planned out. You know like where you should roughly go. So, thank you so much for your time Ya, I've learnt quite a lot today this is really
like an eye-opening session If you guys wanna like ask him any questions or get into contact with him,

#TheBigStory #coronavirus #covid19 #ncid #shawnvasoo",to end off the show i'm joined by a very special guest dr sean vasu clego director of the national center of infectious diseases is here to tell us about how ncid has been dealing with the outbreak welcome dr vasu thank you dylan well dr vasu so much to talk about now let's get to it now most of the 90 patients here are stable and recovering but seven are in critical condition could you describe the range of symptoms you know what does a stable patient look like and compared to someone who's in the icu yeah so with covet 19 as you know this is caused by a novel coronavirus which now has been named saskov2 the range of symptoms in this illness is quite varied it ranges from unlike sars in 2003 it ranges from quite mild to more severe cases it is a bit reassuring to know that most of the cases 80 or so have a relatively mild illness and their symptoms quite like the common cold and the common symptoms include a cough about 80 or so would have a fever some would have a sore throat from our experience running nose is a bit less common than the other common cold viruses and then a smaller percentage of patients have a more severe type of illness about 20 have a more severe form of pneumonia but that does not mean that all of them have to go to the intensive care unit or the icu about five percent of these patients need uh added care and they end up in the icu and the main reason why they end up in the icu is because they have a severe form of pneumonia and they need some support for their lungs so generally they need some support with a mechanical ventilation or support for breathing yeah now doctor i think a lot of people are very curious you know take us through the whole process you know from being a suspected case uh to being a confirmed case you know what tests do they undergo right so i think we need to understand what a suspect case is so a suspect case combines both clinical and what we call epidemiologic criteria the clinical criteria of course being a suspect case you must have symptoms of the disease for example respiratory type illness or symptoms of pneumonia and then you must have some what we call an epi criteria epidemiologic link and that usually uh in the earlier days of the outbreak that included travel to china or to hot spots and then now we consider a significant epidemiologic link as one who if you had contact with someone who has a diagnosis of covet 19 that would put you in a suspect risk group so with that then the doctors when you suspect case will assess you the assessment generally besides taking history thorough history from you and examining you might also encompass blood tests because some sometimes blood tests uh might show us uh some clues uh of a viral infection uh in particular sometimes one of the white cells which is uh one of the components of the blood count that we do may be depressed we also might do a chest radiograph or a chest x-ray and that might show signs compatible with pneumonia and then the definitive test would be looking at whether we can identify the virus and usually we take what we call a respiratory specimen to test for that that is what that is done by what we call molecular tests and usually it comprises of a swap that we take either from the nostril or what we call the nasal pharynx which is the term which is a bit a deeper nasal swab or throat swap and we try to identify the virus through molecular means so if we identify it uh the virus then then that becomes a confirmed uh case yeah now doctor you know on that note you know um what treatment is being given to those infected you know what are their daily routines like right so most of the patients actually recover without specific treatment supportive care most of them who have symptoms which are quite similar to the cold they do not need any specific treatment in singapore we are admitting these patients generally to observe them and to make sure that they are well isolated that they recover well and they don't deteriorate so encouragingly most of the patients do not need specific treatment some of them need supportive care so some of them when they their pneumonia is a bit more severe they might need some supplemental oxygen which we can deliver through a variety of devices for example nasal prongs or of course those who are more ill then might need to go to the icu in terms of specific antiviral treatments there are many clinical trials and studies going on around the world there is no proven treatment yet for covet 19 some of the however from our experience with sars and mers we know that some antivirals have had some activity whether it's in experimental models or animal experiments and even some human experience so in singapore for example for some of our patients with more severe disease we have used antivirals and a common one that we have used more common is a drug that we use to treat uh hiv infection and that drug is called kalicha or lopinovia retinovir right that's the chemical name and then another drug that we use uh it's uh that we have been using for more severe cases and includes an injectable drug called interferon but we this has been the minority of patients and we generally reserve it for those who are in a more serious condition on our icu patients yeah now dr vasu let's talk a bit about the unsung heroes of course the medical staff at ncid how are they coping you know in terms of manpower and uh and everything okay so i think we are hanging in there and we i would say most people are pretty upbeat i think at least speaking from uh on uh from the healthcare worker standpoint on behalf of the nurses and doctors at ncid and also at tantoxin hospital uh all of us have been putting in extra effort i think it's not just ncid tantoxin but actually healthcare workers across the island and i think it's important to acknowledge that of course at ncid and at tantoxin hospital where all the patients are admitted to ncid we have seen the bulk of the nation's cases i think you just mentioned we had 90 cases so most of them have been admitted to us the they are keeping upbeat we have received a lot of encouragement care well wishes notes people have been feeding us and that's brought us a lot of encouragement cab drivers are not avoiding tantoxing hospital not ncid in fact i took a cab yesterday to work and i asked the cab driver uh uh whether he had any qualms about coming to the hospital and he said no and it was pretty encouraging to me so so all around we have had a pretty good support and and uh and ncid was really our motto is strong trusted and united in in in keeping uh singapore safe from infectious diseases so so we are um uh we were formed for that purpose and and right now in this crisis uh we are glad that we can play a role now doctor you know the outbreak has been uh ongoing for some time now um is there anything new about covet 19 that you know you could share with us that we didn't know of yesterday you know like in terms of traits or characteristics okay so in terms of covet 19 i think uh uh most a lot of information where is coming out of china where we have seen the majority of cases what we know about the virus noun is that the incubation period which is when from when you are exposed to when you develop symptoms the average is really about about three to seven days there have been some reports which has caused some concern and in recent days some people have talked about asymptomatic transmission and whether you can get infected from someone who is not displaying symptoms but i think it's important to note when we look at these reports that some of them have not had a very accurate history when the reports were made and sometimes in outbreak areas where we cannot rule out contact between multiple people or maybe a second exposures or transmission from the environment is quite hard to say from the one or two reports which have come out whether transmission really occurs from asymptomatic of people who have no symptoms what we do know is that because this disease has a variety as a wide range of symptoms some people have minimal symptoms that we that we know but we think that most cases of infection uh and human to human spread arise from people who are displaying symptoms uh who are coughing who are spreading spreading infectious droplets and that's where most of the transmission occurs i think it still remains to see be seen how much and whether asymptomatic transmission plays a major role if at all yeah so i think people need to bear that in mind and i think while reports come out they're always because this illness is uh you know there is a biologic phenomenon so sometimes outliers are not unexpected but we really need to concentrate on what is the main means of transmission what we best know about the disease and i think as more data comes out from across the world we would welcome that now you know doctor for those who are discharged how long are they monitored for you know are they still on a watch list right so when they are discharged as far as we know and also in speaking to our colleagues from china uh reinfection with the virus has not been well described or reported in fact most of our colleagues in china in our own experience we we don't think that reinfection uh is a prominent thing or that it actually there's no documented proof that it occurs so we know that in coronavirus infections when people are infected they do develop antibodies which we believe are protective when people are discharged from the hospital they go through a regimen where we do check their respiratory secretions and make sure they're negative twice 24 hours apart and they the fever has resolved and their symptoms have improved and then we discharge them at that point we also give them a follow up with us to our clinic to make sure they are well and uh and when they are discharged they actually go back healthy and they go back to their families and i think a lot of them do want to be reunited with their families who they have not seen for a while right now uh doctor just on a final note you know um it appears um that only those who are old and and and suffering from other ailments you know have died from this virus you know how accurate is this you know right i think uh from the chinese data the chinese released a study of over 70 000 of their patients and from their data yes it supports the the finding and and that older patients and patients with other what we call medical conditions at higher risk of dying from this disease however having said that coronavirus infections can sometimes affect younger people and as you know in china there have been several health care workers who have been younger who may not who have been exposed to the virus and actually have succumbed to the disease and they were not exactly in the older age group so we do treat this virus with respect while most people who succumb to disease in the older age group it is a virus which is new and like sars it has affected people of all age groups including people who are slightly younger so it is something that we need to watch out for uh but however you're right that it affects the people the people it generally affects in the more serious we are the older folks yeah well thank you so much doctor for coming in and for taking the time to speak with us okay of course that was dr sean vasu clinical director at the national center of infectious diseases and those were the top stories of the day keep up to date with news in singapore and around the world at straitstimes.com i'm dylan i'm see you tomorrow for more stories on a big story you ,True,True,False,False

About this series:  Four households, in four different Asian cities. Their circumstances may be poles apart. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, it's now very much the same. Uncut, uncensored and documenting life as it happens, this documentary looks at Asia's families coping with the biggest crisis of a generation. Live, love and laugh with these families, and see how the worst of times can also be the best of times. 
================
#CNADocumentaries #CNAInsider #CNATheFamilyAffair","In this episode of ""The Family Affair""... Singapore gradually reopens. But the new normal
puts the three Su boys in a bind. And in China, Wang Bin's bid
to make his mother rest... causes a misunderstanding. Asia is waking up to a new normal. For the last two months, we've asked families in four cities badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wuhan, Manila, Delhi, and Singapore, to film their lives... 24/7. Hello! These are their stories... filmed by them... told by them. ""The Family Affair""... like you've never seen it before. Because we're all together
in a pandemic. In Singapore,
it's been slightly more than a month since Circuit Breaker was imposed. Hello. Hello. And the Su boys
who have been cooped up at home are showing clear signs of cabin fever. But just as Lesley is about to run out
of entertainment options, there is some reprieve. It's the first day that hair salons
and barber shops have been allowed to reopen after being closed
for the first three weeks. The lifting of restrictions meant that Lesley finally has a valid reason
to legally bring the boys out. It's their first haircut in weeks. It's two weeks to the much-anticipated
end of the circuit breaker. But it's still not smooth sailing
for Singapore. Singapore has reported a record
of 1,426 new COVID-19 cases... Migrant worker dormitories continue to see
new cases of COVID-19. India, too, has been in lockdown
for nearly two months, but COVID-19 cases show
no signs of abating. Karan, the oldest son
living with the Guptas, has tightened house rules,
much to everyone's chagrin. Karan decrees that no one can enter
or leave the house, leaving Dolly pining for the stray dogs
she feeds at a public park called the Ridge, two kilometres away. But, a few days ago, Karan broke his own rules, escaping to a party
at a neighbour's house to de-stress. -Cheers!
-Cheers, guys! Guilty for having broken the rules
he set for his family, Karan decides
he will meet his mum halfway. He won't allow Dolly
her daily morning walks at the Ridge for fear she might catch the virus. But he will accompany her for a walk just around the neighbourhood
in the evenings. One week on, Dolly has found a new tribe
of stray dogs to feed. And partaking in this ritual, has changed Karan's mind
about Dolly's devotion to the stray dogs at the Ridge. But with COVID-19 infections
still rising, Karan does not want to risk
his mum's life just to feed the dogs at the Ridge. The Guptas will need
a more sustainable solution to Dolly's predicament soon. Over in Wuhan, Madam Huang is also trying
to come to terms with the rules that her son, Wang Bin, has set. Before the pandemic, caring for her grandkids
was Madam Huang's source of joy. However, despite recovering from COVID-19, Madam Huang is choosing
to keep her distance from the children. The role of caring for the children
has now been taken over by Grandma Han. But little does Wang Bin know that Madam Huang's anxiety stems from a secret
she's been hiding from the family. June 1, the day before Singapore
enters Phase One, the Sus are celebrating. They've survived two months of HBL, WFH, and CB, acronyms that are now on everyone's lips. While most restrictions remain, the Sus have found one big reason
to celebrate, because come June 2... We will allow children to visit
their parents or grandparents, once a day. Oh, my gosh! In the Philippines, the situation is also starting to look up
for Charles Gama, a nursing assistant
at Far Eastern University Hospital. In the last two weeks, the shortage of medical grade
personal protective equipment or PPE has eased, thanks in part to private donations. Still, donations don't always include
every single item needed. Charles has also been pulled off the task of screening COVID-19 patients
at the door, and assigned back
to the Intensive Care Unit. The risk here is lower because in the Philippines,
private hospitals like this one, do not treat COVID-19 patients. Cases once detected,
are sent to designated public hospitals. Despite the lower risks, Charles intends to continue
isolating himself at home. But after being away from his family
for three weeks, to Charles' dismay, his children
are no longer missing his absence. Okay, we'll start with letter...
What's this? It's a cat. And when Orion reaches
yet another milestone without Charles, Charles decides he has had enough. Okay, okay. Enough of being so near yet so far, Charles has an idea. Unable to resume her daily routine of
feeding her stray dogs at the Ridge, Dolly Gupta decides to channel
her energies elsewhere. She's setting up her home office, so she can resume her work
as a volunteer counsellor for one of Delhi's oldest NGOs
for mental health. Since the lockdown, the NGO has been trying to migrate
its systems online, so that volunteers
can take calls at home safely, and to be able to log their sessions. So Dolly, with her limited IT skills, has been struggling to get
the hang of things. But after two weeks,
she's finally ready to take the next step. And Dolly couldn't have jumped back into
counselling at a better time. Hello? Initial investigations by the Mumbai... Amid headlines dominated by COVID-19 comes news of a high-profile suicide. Mourning the death
of actor Sushant Singh Rajput who was found dead at his home. The suicide triggers a debate in India
about depression and how the pandemic might worsen
the condition among sufferers. It also raises awareness
about counselling helplines, including the one
that Dolly volunteers for. The nationwide lockdown is pushing
unemployment levels beyond the 25% mark, with more than 120 million people
losing their jobs, and over a third of self-employed
individuals shutting their businesses. And while Dolly
is now gainfully employed, Niyoshi, the newest addition
to the Gupta family, is hitting a dead end with her job. Niyoshi used to run a successful
interior design studio in Mumbai, specialising in offices. In December, she married the Gupta's youngest son Arjun
and moved to Delhi. At that time, COVID-19 was still
a distant problem. And Niyoshi thought
she could easily expand her business to the Indian capital. So instead of competing
for new project bids, Niyoshi finds herself struggling for space
in her mother-in-law's kitchen. It doesn't help that Niyoshi's husband,
Arjun, is busier than ever before. His tech start-up
is into cutting energy waste. He has been pulling late nights
in his home office, leaving Niyoshi alone... and bored. In China, Wang Bin's mother, Madam Huang
has also been cooped up at home. Her days were once filled
with household chores and child minding. Now, they are empty. But it's been a week
since Wuhan is declared virus-free. And Wang Bin is hoping
a walk with the kids would boost his mother's spirits. Madam Huang had assumed that Wang Bin
was afraid she is still infectious. Realising that
it was just a misunderstanding, Madam Huang relents. Over in Wuhan, despite being cleared of COVID-19, Madam Huang remains
reluctant to be seen in public. But with Wang Bin's constant prodding, she's been taking baby steps
to venture out with her son. With some time alone with her son, Madam Huang finally decides
to reveal what's troubling her, since the both of them were stricken
with COVID-19 in January. Madam Huang thinks
Wang Bin contracted COVID-19 when he accompanied her to the hospital
for her osteoporosis treatment. And she's been feeling guilty ever since. It's Phase One for the lifting
of COVID-19 restrictions in Singapore. And for the Sus,
a reunion is in store. The Sus are making a beeline
for Grandma Margaret's home. The government announced that... preschool will commence and it will only start with K1 and K2. So Tyrell went to school first. And it was also the day that
we could visit my mum. With community spread
not completely ruled out, it's been a cautious lifting
of restrictions. While visits to parents
and grandparents are now allowed, only two visitors are permitted
at a time. So with Tyrell conveniently in school, Lesley takes the opportunity
to bring the other two boys. We can't go, all three of us. Therefore, I only brought
Tilden and Tristan. I was so tempted to tell Tilden, ""Hey, Tilden, you'll stay at home
with Auntie Nia. Mummy's going to go
with Kor Kor somewhere."" I can't bring myself to lie to him. It was a difficult decision to make,
I have to say. Yes. So, not being able to go there
and hang out with them... We really played by the book. I think it would have been much better if maybe they allow
a family of four to visit. Because if we are married with kids, we already exceed
the two-person limit, right? Over in the Philippines, a reunion is also about to take place. The couple's children, Orion, Zion, and Gibeon, are unaware of their parents' plan. Charles is making a poster
to present to his wife, Jaja. The celebration is scheduled
at lunchtime. And for the first time in a month, Charles is going to step
into the house... fully geared up in a mask,
gloves, and gown... to protect his family. Can I borrow this for a while? Jeremie? Hello! At the Guptas, anniversary celebrations
are also about to get underway. What's this? We're ready! It's good. At the Guptas, dad and mum,
Jagatpal and Dolly are marking their 42nd year
as a married couple. And thanks to the pandemic, for the first time in many years, the entire family are at home
celebrating with them under one roof. The kids have a surprise
in store for Dolly, her favourite snack, jalebi. I’m a mother of three. I think it is important to acknowledge
that we make time... to be yourself, to be on your own, to enjoy the things
that you like to do. Jog, jog, jog... Joel is putting in
as many hours as he can to help Lesley out at home. Hey! Next, in ""The Family Affair""
reunion special. We revisit the families
we've grown to love... nearly two months on... to see how things
have changed for them. As more restrictions are lifted... even while the COVID-19 pandemic
drags on. Captions: IYUNO Media Group ",True,True,False,False

families in four cities badly hit by the covid19 pandemic wuhan manila delhi and singapore to film their lives 24 7. hey what are you doing making so much noise being an employee being a mother being a teacher i think it's ridiculous when you see your partner work for more than 15 hours a day you're just like what the hell am i doing now no hogs no kisses well used to make us retirement these are their stories filmed by them told by them the family affair like you've never seen it before because we're all together in a pandemic in the philippines life in the bustling capital manila is about to come to a grinding halt i have come to the conclusion that stricter measures are necessary there was already like rumors of having locked down i am placing the entire mainland of the sun under quarantine you have no choice you have to stay home in the next month most offices and establishments will be shuttered public and private vehicles will be banned on the road with lockdown measures in effect in under four hours many filipinos scrambled to get home they also rushed to stock up on grocery but jaja is one step ahead of them before it even aired i was searching in the internet animal fruits and vegetables existing for two weeks and longer one month but because [Music] so i was getting canned goods more of the frozen i also bought some beans like like red beans sugar salt toyo one sack of rice 25 some potatoes and sweet potatoes [Music] we have prepared for everything so we have a thermal scanner this bask i recovered in all the rooms 34 year old jaja nalos gamma knew exactly what to do when the lockdown was announced and that's because she has had a decades worth of experience responding to natural disasters in university she was a red cross student officer and has led several relief operations in disaster-prone philippines it's really thinking on how to plan on putting a plan for the day you're planning for the next coming days i make sure that if anything happens i always have something with me so but there's one thing jaja did not see coming in vitamin her husband charles who is the nursing assistant at a private hospital is redesignated to the front line his new job screening for covet [Music] foreign nearly one in five covet 19 cases in the philippines are medical workers that's the highest infection rate for frontline workers in asia [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hospital now depends on erratic donations of improvised personal protective equipment or ppe from the public to keep its workers safe the philippines imports most of its ppes from china but the lockdown in china due to kovit 19 earlier this year has disrupted supplies foreign is for them it's hazardous they take it seriously so some people okay i'll take his decision now my guys nine days after the philippines triggered lockdown india follows suit [Music] movement will not be allowed between cities for india's rural to urban migrant workers this news triggers a humanitarian crisis on an epic scale nearly one million migrant workers tried to flee indian cities after the lockdown was announced lockdown in india has resulted in thousands of migrant workers leaving cities like delhi without jobs and no daily wages to pay for food and shelter with no means to survive the three-week lockdown thousands began a desperate journey home on foot back to their villages but within delhi itself restrictions are not as strict as in manila though public transport is halted people can move about in private vehicles entertainment venues like malls and cinemas are closed but people are free to gather in private spaces so for the gupta family cocooned in a posh area of delhi life is sweet as ever [Music] let me show you inside during the daytime all the family members are working the respective places right and then for lunch and for dinner definitely we all meet together here in the living room because people have a tendency of overeating during this slow down like you need to walk out which can be a proper arrangement [Music] teams on everything one can do here i use my resources for the welfare of these families which i felt was a responsibility caused by nature like my family is restricted to the four corners of this house people in this family plus my other people [Music] and thanks to the industry and prudence of jagat power his wife his two sons and their wives will be spending the lockdown in a sprawling three-story building with the luxury of space and service these boys they're always out working or they're going out for dinner or for a party or for any social engagements this corvette it has forced the children to be staying back home they have been restricted to the household and they have seen the benefits the advantages the lofting that i see in the i've seen them for so long for a family full of ambitious working adults this is a rare scene youngest son arjun and his wife nyoshi dressed like iconic mexican painter frida kahlo have found time to cook up a mexican feast cilantro rice and then we have really spicy chicken smoked salsa charcoal corn and jalapenos mango salsa peppers and onion healthy sour cream and tortilla chips mascara i am personally extremely fortunate i am kind of sheltered from the negative effects of kovid so initially when this happened my initial reaction was complete denial [Music] karan is also joining in the festivities but he is visibly less relaxed special ingredients had to be brought back to the house to make this exotic meal which means contact with the outside world it's not a time for celebration it is not a time to enjoy yourself on a day-to-day basis it's a time to hunker down and stay where you are and try to stay safe so it troubles me when people go out and treat it as just another day in singapore an eerie silence is settling in the city [Music] a spike in untraceable covet 19 cases sees the lion city slowly shutting down entertainment venues are closed gatherings outside of school and work must be limited singaporeans are urged to stay home life in the lion city is slowly grinding to a halt except in the sioux family where it's anything but still it's a big shift of going out every day to the playground to staying home so it became dance freeze because i think it was something that i played in my childhood as well everybody clap your hand for the sioux family their usual outings to the playground the park and the beach are out of the question definitely it's noisier joel and leslie sue are raising three little men eight-year-old tristan is the eldest and is in primary too [Music] six-year-old tyrol is in his second year in kindergarten hey then there's the youngest four-year-old children [Music] to be able to create these moments where they remember that mommy actually had fun with us during the whole circuit breaker and not that mommy was just walking you know her ass off so those are moments i live for like the 5.7 million others living in singapore the sioux household are trying to get used to staying at home i'm ready to compare the day but my husband i'm forcing him to wake up and guess what i just saw the road and i told my husband can i take the bus like to get out here it's been i've been cooked up here for so long to help stop the spread of covet 19 businesses are encouraged to allow their workers to work from home as a retail and training manager for a cosmetics firm leslie used to travel a lot for work now she works from home hello [Music] not wanting to run the risk of contracting the virus the family takes the stay home warning very seriously what is [Music] and the other two kids have been doing a good job on informing them as well about the kobe 19 situation how do you think the virus enter your body [Applause] your face the coffee goes into my face through it to the eyes i think we have been very truthful with them about the situation on kobit 19. [Music] i've already explained to them if you get it you would be removed from your family nobody else can be with you in the hospital mommy they cannot be there with you is that what you want it's kind of like a scare tactic to get them to wear the masks but i think as kids they do not know how great the situation is [Music] what leslie doesn't know is that the situation is set to get gravel we will therefore impose significantly stricter measures this is like a circuit breaker from wednesday 8th april onwards we will move to full home-based learning for all schools their lives are about to be upended again while the rest of the world goes into lockdown mode wuhan once the epicenter of the outbreak is finally coming out of it [Music] wang bin's family part of 11 million people cooped up

confines of their residential compounds foreign [Music] the family has not shared a meal together for three months forty-year-old wang bin is looking forward to this family meal with his mother madame huang wife one li his in-laws and his toddler twins because this was what life looked like just three months ago one in 200 residents trapped in wuhan during the lockdown got infected wang bin and his

the soaring number of infected people by then even a 1 000 better hospital like this was at full capacity i [Music] six weeks after he was first quarantined [Music] could return to the outside world but only after thorough disinfection and this is his favorite video leaving the grounds of the hospital and heading home [Music] he made a difficult decision he chose to isolate himself for another two weeks foreign [Music] his wife already had to cope with managing the household and caring for the two toddlers the return of two family members in self-isolation only makes it worse [Music] [Music] wasn't the only one who had to be alone in his family charles gamma away some nursing assistants icu ccu and frontliner [Music] worried that he might infect his family charles moved to the servant's room two weeks ago while he could still see his kids he would not go close just stay there [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no kisses [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music]

of me i cannot uh i don't know how to survive another uh one month are you ready for dictation [Music] wait for me to call for you then you answer the question and the rest of you beast be very quiet otherwise i have to mute all of you you know mothers they wear many hats you're not going anywhere try to pay attention ken and children yes starting okay we are first and foremost a mother now with the circuit breaker in place we are working from home so we are still a paid employee and we have our duties to fulfill absolutely not we're playing against stocks and the kids are starting at home money here they'll come no tristan this is your dictation no no i they are just not so agile with their hands at this point in time so that requires help from a parent the food that the restaurant serves is it hurting you read this i find myself really trying very hard being a teacher to tristan who is a primary to child um trying to be patient to teach him my cousin wants to be a chef come on you get it wrong you're gonna write it five times for me okay even though you're not in school it's just really tough to manage being an employee being a mother being a teacher to your kids it's i don't know i think it's ridiculous to expect us to hold these three hats at one time uh okay i can hear another child crying [Music] can i rest fast oh you rested from what about 12 30 until yeah i think in one murder it's tough can i eat as well i'm very hungry [Music] i have a call again at three if i don't eat now then i won't have it this is my i'm eating i can't wash your bum bum it was a crazy experience [Music] yeah yeah no later yeah i was like trying to gonna pull my hair out you know on some days crazy so the timetable that the teacher gave um starts at 8am which is impossible because our timetable starts at 8am then when you never wake up i mean i'm not asking you asking why about that don't police me so that day when his pe teacher called i forgot the name and then i said oh by the way you know the time table that you gave to us i'm not able to adhere to it because i have three kids at home and i'll be using your uh a timetable as a check list of what i need to submit oh that's just like oh okay yeah sure no problem i'll inform the form teacher i don't think i'm just trying to live each day as it comes so i bought a bottle of wine and on the day that i opened it i was very happy i need to buy more wine for you i think i need another bottle just finished it i'll buy you a crate life i have to hi inspector this is supriya i'm very well sir how are you i hear there is a cluster of covet cases in my neighborhood one is 81 year old okay and second one about 45 okay four weeks into india's lockdown karan's wife supriya finds out there is a cluster of cases in the neighborhood just 800 meters from where they live so i found out that eight cases have been confirmed in our neighborhood at oprah but and the police are now starting contact racing which means anyone the family has been in touch with is going to be contacted they've been going to the local stores i'm sure people who live there are you know shopping at the same places for groceries or daily essentials is our household is it's in your backyard literally and you have to deal with it you know just guard yourself as much as you can against it the gupta's bubble of bliss comes to an end just like karan anticipated it was alarming and not just for me for everybody in the house and obviously not an ideal scenario but it was to be expected it was only a matter of time right especially with the way that it's spreading luckily karan was already prepping for this possibility he and his wife decide to drive out a lot further to avoid shopping in areas where their infected neighbours would have gone as an extra precaution karan even wears gloves at the store he also decides that this would be the last grocery run until the pandemic eases i've been telling everyone to stay indoors because there's no point in exposing yourself to something that you can't see coming and there is no point in taking unnecessary risk as the oldest son in the home while the country's rules state it is okay to go out for essential services imposes a drastic household [Music] and no part-time staff like drivers or cleaning ladies can come in even groceries have to be delivered okay so we've got most of what we'd ordered there's a couple of things that are not coming in the market but i guess times like these they're not really essentials they're luxuries so no strawberries we try and order as much as possible so that we don't have too much interaction but thank you so this is where we leave the veggies to sun for a little bit for karan getting his wife supriya to comply with the new house rules is easy but for the rest of the family karan is met with resistance i never knew that he has it in him to worry so much more about everything and it's surprised for a moment i thought he's gone crazy like what is he talking about over in wuhan wang bin is setting down house wolves as well in all the time he wasn't around to parent his toddlers their doting grandparents have made the toddlers clingy sweetheart [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello uh i haven't even looked into it because i've been busy over the weekend badly affected 90 down i was very very worried the income is zero already 10 turnover as singapore sinks deeper into circuit breaker things start to look bleak for the sioux household joel's income from running a cafe kiosk has dried up the circuit breaker really killed rco the circuit breaker is not just uh to break the circuit but it really broke my back it's a back breaker actually this heavy burden that i'm facing i don't really share with them as much as joel tries to hide his worry his wife of 11 years quickly catches on uh every morning and every night it was just me talking to a very angry man i felt i know that he has immense stress on him as a business owner so yeah i just had to tolerate whatever boots [Music] and then you have to be like the happy one at home because you have kids it was just mentally very draining so i tried to get that out of the picture so i can function as a mother [Music] everybody watch to not add to joel's stress leslie decides she will not pry into the state of his businesses unless [Music] we've been married for 11 years this year so you kind of know when you can kind of push the buttons and when you better don't yeah i recognized that he was very concerned like she said you know please don't worry about it i still have a job i can support the family i can still put food on the table for all of us because we're in this together be careful be careful in the next episode of the family affair you know the boys are coming to me for every single deed i feel like i'm just like on this alone okay all right physically and emotionally it's two different things there i said stop it many times [Music] you ,True,True,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider","In this final episode
of ""The Family Affair""... we reunite with families
we've grown to love. In Wuhan, Singapore, Manila, and Delhi... to see how their circumstances
have changed two months on. As restrictions are lifted... even as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. In footage never seen before, the families reveal
how the filming was done under unprecedented circumstances, why they agreed to be part
of this documentary, and how has being on TV changed them? Wuhan had been under
one the strictest lockdowns the world has ever seen. It seemed like
it would have gone on forever. Then... The lifting of the lockdown on 8 April left the Wangs with a tough choice. Should they allow professional crew
into their house? We began filming with the Wangs
in late April, 11 days after the lifting
of the lockdown. In the two weeks we spent with them, we witnessed Wang Bin and his mother recovering from the trauma
of being stricken by COVID-19, shared his heartbreak
as he folded a business, cheered him on
as he tried to start another... Two months later, we returned. While rain clouds now shroud Wuhan
in rainy season, the moods have clearly lifted. And what a difference in reception. Three grandparents
still stay with the Wangs. Wan Li's parents,
Grandpa and Grandma Han, who are on an extended visit
from Sichuan. And Wang Bin's mother, Madam Huang,
who like the city, has also experienced
a 180-degree change in her outlook. When we last caught up
with Madam Huang two months ago, she had already been cleared
of COVID-19. But she remained weak. It turns out the impediment
to Madam Huang's recovery was a deep-seated sense of guilt that came tumbling out
during the filming. But it isn't just Madam Huang
who's feeling upbeat. Across Wuhan, life has returned to the streets,
as active cases dwindled to zero. It's a development
that'll rekindle Wang Bin's desire to restart his business. In Singapore, the streets have also come back to life. The country is now into Phase 2, which means public areas
like beaches and parks are open. And dining in can resume. When we last met the Sus, Singapore had just entered
the circuit breaker phase. We saw Lesley struggling to cope with being a parent, teacher,
and an employee, witnessed Joel go from aspiring barista
to delivery driver, and moaned along with them
as restrictions were eased... far too slowly. When we visited them two months on, life in the Su household
is a world of difference. Meanwhile, Tristan, too, is missing school
as he used to know it. School used to be fun. School was where he could chat
with his friends. But now, being in school
means following onerous rules to keep COVID-19 at bay. Thankfully, there's one lesson where Tristan doesn't need
to wear a mask... Physical Education. No wonder the three boys
pine for weekends. This was their only form
of water play. During the two-month circuit breaker, public and private pools
across the country were shut to stop the spread of COVID-19
in these facilities. Tristan has said that when he swims,
he feels very relaxed. So during the circuit breaker,
I think he felt very trapped. Swimming, I think,
gives them a lot of freedom. Like a fish. Life is just going to be okay
when you're in the pool. In early July, India has become
the world's third hardest-hit nation. And its capital Delhi is
its worst-hit city, with over 100,000 cases,
more than the whole of China. Yet India has begun
lifting restrictions. We return to the Guptas in July. And the fear of the virus
is hitting home. Darshan, the family's
longest-serving helper, is running a fever, one of the symptoms of COVID-19. Booking a home collection
COVID-19 test in Delhi can take anywhere
between 24 and 72 hours, depending upon the availability
of a lab agent. But lucky for the Guptas, they were able to secure
a last-minute slot. In a few hours,
Darshan's COVID-19 test result was out. The recent scare is forcing the Guptas to stick
to their self-imposed lockdown for the fourth consecutive month. The self-imposed lockdown
is set by Karan, the eldest son at home. No one is allowed in and out
of the house. The family of six fought about it. Some defied it. And they finally decided it was easier and probably safer
to abide by them. The situation is so dire, authorities are now
incentivising COVID-19 patients to recuperate at home, despite the risks
to immediate family members. Home intensive care units
are gaining currency with those who can afford them
in India. The Guptas are in the middle
of turning their spare room, into a quarantine facility with equipment that would normally
be found in intensive care units. In the Philippines, cases of COVID-19 are also soaring. Barely seven weeks into the partial lifting
of the lockdown, cases have tripled to nearly 60,000. But by far, the family member most at risk
of a COVID-19 infection is Charles. Charles is a nursing assistant assigned to screen
for COVID-19 patients. When the production team
first met Charles, he was still quarantined
in a separate part of the family home, fearing he might bring the virus
back from work... Gibeon, hello! leaving Jaja to take care
of her three kids and elderly parents. Charles had been reassigned
back to the intensive care unit, which does not handle
COVID-19 patients. Still, it did not assuage
the family's fears. So Charles decides to go
for a swab test. The test took 15 minutes. Finally, the results... Negative. Despite finally getting help
from her husband at home, Jaja is contemplating
resigning from her job, which she is due to return to
after her maternity leave expires. As a home-based online tutor, Jaja needs a quiet home environment. That was still manageable before. But now... both Orion and Zion
are far more active. And they have a new addition... Gibbly. Jaja is working on a potential solution, but it comes with a catch. Jaja wants to leave her job,
but at the same time, she's worried about
the family's mounting expenses. She's got to find an alternative. If offered, Jaja's new job as a recruiter
and social media manager would see her drawing
double her previous pay. But there's a catch. Wang Bin is also seeing his business
getting back in shape. But now, with his businesses
on the mend, he's thinking of buying over
two more restaurants. Over in Delhi, amid worries of COVID-19... Right after Jaja's final interview,
she was offered the job. That night, Charles was on the graveyard shift and everyone else at home
had gone to bed. Jaja's plan to catch up on sleep
in the afternoon, when her children nap, is thwarted... when her nephew Jeremie fails
his science assessment. In Wuhan, Wang Bin is scouting for locations
for his two new restaurants, despite not getting
his wife's support for the idea. Wang Bin decides
he needs to bring Wan Li out, to see for herself that
the city is buzzing with life. But romance is not the real intention
for this outing, at least not for Wang Bin. In Singapore, Joel, too, is hoping to persuade his wife
on a decision he hopes to make. Since starting on his first delivery job
fetching fruits, Joel has taken
on a second delivery job: fetching specialty bread and snacks
to businesses and households. Giving him two steady streams
of income. So for now, Joel has put his plans of quitting
the afternoon delivery shift on hold. Supriya is booking
yet another test for COVID-19. This time, for herself. As her miscarriage was incomplete, Supriya needed surgery to remove
any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb
to prevent an infection. July 10, 2020. Lesley and Joel,
along with over 2.5 million voters, are headed to the polls in Singapore's first election
amid a pandemic. I felt it was very, very different
from the last election almost five years ago. I felt a little bit nervous about it. What's going to happen to policies? Every vote counts. I think it's very important for the kids
to know what election is about, because it really is
also about their future, right? Nowadays, the school talks
about current affairs. They're talking about elections. So the teacher actually
sent me a message. Tilden actually said, ""I want to
be a leader for my country one day."" I was beyond shocked to have lost,
like shook! This man who cannot even finish
his speech in 30 seconds. Even though I'm bringing home
less income, my kids look at me the same way. To them, I'm like their hero. I think the kids
really do lighten things up when things are looking down. The circuit breaker
lasted for two months. And I think all Singaporeans
deserve a pat on their backs. We all made it. We survived. We stayed home.
So, good job. The pandemic has changed lives. Oh, no! What are families learning
about themselves? And about each other. They have never met each other. Yet these families share
a common experience that's intense. Not just the COVID-19 experience, but having this moment in time
documented on television. Over in Delhi, Supriya is assembling
the Guptas together to watch themselves
on ""The Family Affair"". ...we've asked families in four cities
badly hit by the COVID-19... Supriya is a TV producer. And it was she who undertook the task of documenting her own family
under lockdown. With Joel out on the road
making deliveries all day, this would be Joel's first time
witnessing what goes on, when he's not home. Some people say, ""Why does
this husband not care about the wife?"" ""He just chucks the wife at home."" I honestly don't really care
what people think. My mission is to make sure
that she's happy. When it comes to emotions and feelings, he just does not express himself. So I don't hear a lot of things
I wish I can hear. Leslie is more emotional. Sometimes, emotions overflow. I'm very thankful and very grateful
for all the things that you've done at home. And being an awesome wife and being an awesome mother. You are welcome. And tears will flow,
and then I'm like, ""Oh my goodness."" I cannot handle. Jaja agreed to document
her family's life under lockdown for one reason. While watching themselves on TV, Charles and Jaja
are able to find inspiration from the struggles
of the other families. But it isn't long
before the show hits a raw spot. Grandpa and Grandma Han
took care of the children when Wang Bin was self-isolating. But they never realised how much
he resented their parenting style. Over at the Sus... How dare you! It was really just
a spur of the moment. There was the anger
and that's why I said it. I guess it's also a good thing that
Lesley gets to hear how I feel. Every time I engage with Leslie
in an argument, I always lose. Fortunately for Joel, it ended well. But over in China... Three days later,
Wang Bin makes the first move. I guess this pandemic
really helped me to think that I should not give up. Lesley is the one who kicked me
and got me going. My children are the pillars of my life. Captions: IYUNO Media Group ",True,True,False,False

A record 447 new cases were confirmed on April 15, of which 404 were work permit holders residing in dorms. Associate Professor Alex Cook from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore discusses the twin challenge that Singapore faces - one involving the dorms and the other is the local community spread.

The Straits Times, the English flagship daily of SPH, has been serving readers for more than a century. Launched on July 15, 1845, its comprehensive coverage of world news, East Asian news, Southeast Asian news, home news, sports news, financial news and lifestyle updates makes The Straits Times the most-read newspaper in Singapore.","in a Facebook post today Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reassured Singaporeans that the government will work with foreign workers especially those living in the dormitories to see through this difficult period this comes as John's continued to make up a huge majority of new kovat 19 cases a record 447 new cases were confirmed yesterday with 404 being work permit holders residing in dorms there are now a total of 3699 cases in Singapore and at least 1,800 people linked to dormitories who have tested positive for the virus nearly all existing dormitory clusters saw new cases yesterday with three new clusters identified at other dormitories a fourth cluster not @adam was also announced it's a building of shop houses at 2:30 for ballast erode and his links of foreign workers meanwhile another foreign worker dormitory man died large one in Mandi road has been placed under isolation there are now nine Dhamma trees declared as isolation areas where workers staying there must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days here to talk about the situation in the dorms is associate professor Alex cook from the sorcery Hawk School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore so prof the living conditions in the dormitories has been a talking point several migrant workers have been moved to the singapore expo and a factory converted dorms but most remain in the existing drums would this do more harm than good I think possibly so in viral disease II spread quite easily within close or semi closed environments such as dorms or schools and so on and so I think that one of the things that is quite big urgency just now is really to try to depopulate the dorms as much as possible to reduce the density within the living environments there how is that possible to reduce the density but effectively we need to find somewhere else for many of the workers to be mentioned some of them have been moved out to explore to other bases I think there's a kind of a national urgency to trying to find somewhere that would be include a quarter of a million people right well prof so far 17 out of the 43 purpose-built dormitories have been classified as virus clusters what are you expecting will happen in the coming days in terms of the number of cases are originating from the dorms I mean so far we've seen really quite rapid exponential growth within the dorms and the number of cases been doubling more or less every two days and I think that that's something that we can realistically expect they continue to happen over the next few days at least even if we were able to move it run out and get them in there's a lot of isolated facilities to stop transmission between the workers I don't know how realistic that is though and so I think that there's a very real possibility that we'll continue to see exponential growth perhaps at a slower rate but still it is quite feasible that by the end of April we could be looking at 10 to 20,000 infections amongst a migrant workers oh well with the benefit of hindsight were there any warning signs that the virus would have exploded within our migrant worker population could it have been avoided I mean in yeah in hindsight is always easy to say that all right everything you know migrants can be infected I don't know what we could have really done to try to prevent it because a lot of the issues that we're seeing are structural issues whereby if you if they were living in regular housing you're at last like your I living then of course then there's there's much less ability for the virus to transmit from person to person because you're actually able to isolate yourself from other people within the same building you are able to do social distancing it's not clear to me how it's possible for our migrant workers to social distance themselves in the way that the UI can write because they have a lot of areas that are shared right yeah in many cases for example they have communal toilets and everyone all of the workers on the same level of the building have to use the same common that how can you try to really prevent transmission between workers from even different rooms on the same level well Singapore's new cases are in the triple digits these days a daily high of 447 was confirmed yesterday but it's important to break down these wearing figures the Health Ministry reported 38 new local cases in the community yesterday what does that say about the extent of the community spread so we really have three different kinds of cases just now we've got imported cases we've got local in season we got the foreign worker cases so for our imported cases I think that we're doing a fantastic job with that we had a big run but month ago but then we've implemented policies so that they will not be put into quarantine at hotels and so on and that has the impact that they're effectively dead ends for transmission so we've cleaned over that over the last week or so we've had hardly any infections amongst us the local cases are are those that really is what the circuit breaker measures are targeting and I think that we're having we're seeing quite reassuring signs from that the number had been rising quite substantially up until the time the circuit breaker and then since then it has been plateauing and possibly dropping and so I would hope very much that by the end of the circuitmaker period that we would have been reduced a number of local cases that are amongst the general population I think - quite quite low levels so it's really amongst the overall numbers look terrible and that's because of the infections amongst our migrant workers yes of course so like you said the the number of local cases is plateauing but the but of course the cases in the dormitories are rising so I guess taking both into account how will that affect the circuit breaker period your schools gene professor T ogiing said that it would be prudent to extend the circuit breaker by two weeks what do you think yes the question on everyone's mind right how long we got a little bigger I personally think it's probably a bit too soon to be calling whether we should have an extent or not to the circuit being situated measures my wish would be that we get down to maybe around like 10 cases or fewer than that amongst local pcs per day because at that kind of a level that's level that the Minister of Health and develop these forces can maintain quite effective social contact tracing so I think that if we're able to get to that kind of a level by the end of the circuit breaker then it might make sense or to stop the circuit breaker then we may rise again thereafter but I think it's unrealistic to expect it will get down to zero cases by the anti circuit breaker and everything will be fine well thank you so much for your time professor well as your insight we've been speaking to associate professor Alex cook from the sauce 3 Hawk School

welcome pastor vincent and on on right here is prof uh paul tambaya and prof tambaya is from the nus department of med medicine senior consultant nuh uh president of the asia pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection president-elect of the international society of infectious diseases also serves actively in his home church at lutheran church and diner and i are privileged to know him and his good wife and he is my senior from san andreas school so singapore with that i'm going to ask pro paul to start off by giving a short introduction on this covet 19 virus and the pandemic and the the vaccine before we take questions so proper over to you can you hear me yeah great so i think you've heard a lot about this covet 19 so i don't really need to give you a lot of information there's a lot of information and a lot of misinformation out there but there are certain things that we do know for sure what we do know is that this disease is caused by the virus sars cov2 it is a virus which is related to the sars virus which appeared in 2003 first in guangdong and then it spread to hong kong to taiwan to singapore to canada to the united states but fortunately that virus disappeared after about 8 000 people were infected then for 17 years we didn't hear very much in 2012 we heard about the mers coronavirus in the middle east and then at the end of december 2019 this virus suddenly appeared in wuhan and right now there's a lot of interest in where this virus came from in fact pastor ben asked me this question could this virus have come from a lab and the answer is we don't know there are lots of labs all over the world who are working on viruses with an aim to developing vaccines because viruses have appeared every two or three years we get a nasty virus that goes around you know we've forgotten but in 2009 we had h1n1 then we had the zika virus then we had ebola virus in west africa and for most of these viruses there are no effective treatments and they're very few effective vaccines so lots of scientists are working all over the world on trying to produce safe and effective vaccines and unfortunately one of the places where this happened was in wuhan itself we don't know whether anything accidents happened again accidents have happened in 2003 in september about four months after singapore had been declared sas free there was an accident which occurred in a lab in singapore and one of the researchers was infected fortunately his infection was mild and he didn't spread it to anyone else way back in 1978 the last case of smallpox in the world was not somewhere in africa or in south asia it was actually in the city of birmingham and it was in a researcher and her family at the university of birmingham and it was because of a lab accident so we don't know what happened and investigations are underway what we do know though is that this virus is closely related to bad viruses and so the most likely scenario is that the virus somehow got out of the bat got into another animal and through some kind of illegal wildlife trade or or some kind of poaching it got into humans and then from humans it spread to other humans and that's what happened to the sars virus in 2003 it went from the bats into the civets and then from civets into humans but very quickly about three months after sars was declared a global health emergency the civet was identified by researchers at the university of hong kong as the intermediate animal and that was very helpful because remember stars disappeared around june of 2003 and then we heard nothing about it there was a lab accident in singapore in september and then in january 2004 we had two or three cases of stars popping up in guangdong and so what did the public health authorities do they zoomed in on the civics and they found a restaurant which was illegally keeping the civets and preparing them for food they they closed down the restaurant and no more sauce so four cases in 2004 and we haven't had cases of stars since then so i think that we need to give the researchers and the investigators time to find out what happened because we really don't want this to happen again you know we don't want another virus to pop out of the blue and then spread all over the world and create all kinds of chaos the good news about this virus is we have vaccines and that's what most of the conversation today is going to be about these vaccines have been rolled out incredibly fast i just heard on the news as i was coming here that we're at 40 of the population is fully vaccinated they're aiming to get uh to 50 and then they're going to open up more of singapore and so uh things are moving along pretty fast but again for some people that's a bit too fast and i think there are questions that many of you have raised and i'll leave it to pastor ben to take it from there thank you paul um for the rundown you could just just like it's all in your head you know so um so today we're gonna answer the questions that you've all submitted thank you for those questions there are many questions we have done our best to sort them out and to categorize them and to to put the similar questions together from time to time okay look i'm going to look at my phone in case our team sends me a message so i'm not looking for facebook or instagram messages okay in case you're wondering so today we're going to start with an opening question and then we're going to go on to some general information questions and then to questions of efficacy of the vaccines and so forth so let's let's start with the opening question uh prof paul mentioned earlier about the vaccine so my question to the two panelists is that first of all have you been vaccinated and secondly which vaccine did you receive so we'll start with the prof and then pass the vincent okay okay i got vaccinated very early i'm a healthcare worker so um i was one of those in the priority queue in january i received my first dose of five pfizer beyond tech and i received my second dose in uh early in february and i'm still here yeah i've also received my vaccination two doses mine is more than okay so i've also been vaccinated twice two shots with pfizer biontech that was in early part of june so we all vaccinated on the panel here um so we're gonna move on uh dive right into the to the questions right now on the general questions and what we'll try and do is in every section we'll cover all the medical questions and then we'll end the session with a faith-based or a biblical question so under the general questions we're going to start off with the mrna vaccines and the question that came in quite a few questions what is the difference um major difference between the mrna vaccines like fizer and moderna versus the traditional inactivated virus vaccines like cyanovac so that's the question and which one is more effective is what many of you are asking so i'm going to ask paul to answer this question okay i'll take the second part of the question first and the answer is we don't know which one is more effective you know you hear all kinds of things but unfortunately this is a very commercial field so every company is trying to tell you that their vaccine is the best but right now what it looks like is all of the vaccines seem to work because in all of the countries where they've been rolling out the vaccines once you hit a certain percentage of the population the number of severe cases the number of hospitalizations drops you hear stories about rises in cases but most of those are in younger people who have not been vaccinated who are on the low priority list and they tend to have milder illness now the first part is like slightly harder and the question is what's the difference between mrna vaccines and the conventional vaccines and actually there's quite a huge difference mrna vaccines do not contain any virus at all nor are they made from virus what they have is a set of instructions and these instructions tell the body to make a protein which looks exactly like the virus protein and then what happens is our body's immune cells will destroy that protein so they are trained to recognize this protein so the next time they are exposed to the protein when they see a virus or when somebody coughs in your face then straight away the body will produce this antibody will kill the protein and kill the virus which is which is carrying the protein and you won't get sick so that's kind of like how the mrna vaccines i was trying to find an analogy for this and i was trying to think of the ikea instructions you know which which to me are beyond understanding but i thought the the closest analogy i could have was was a recipe so mrna is a recipe the dna or the nucleic acid is all the ingredients so you've got to take the ingredients you use the recipe and you make the cake and then you eat it you see but so there's a lot of fear that you know the mrna will will change your dna but that's like the recipe trying to give you the ingredients it doesn't work that way it's it's a one-way street you see from the ingredients to the recipe to the cake the conventional vaccines on the other hand are using technology which was developed about 100 years ago from the time of louis pasteur what they do is they grow the virus in a laboratory and it has to be a high security laboratory because you can imagine if this leaks out then you get you start infecting people because they're growing the real virus and what they do is they grow the virus and then they kill it uh they kill it using heat uh formalin or some kind of radiation they kill the virus and then they inject the kill virus into a person and then your body sees the kill virus it produces antibodies and next time when your body sees the live virus it has antibodies which can kill the the live virus as well because it's been trained on the uh on the the kill virus again to use an analogy when your kid wants to learn how to ride a bike they have training wheels first so the the kill virus is like the training wheels so that they know how to ride a bike in in real life without the training wheels so uh so they're very different technologies but the whole idea is to train your body's immune system so that when it encounters the virus it knows what to do you know it's it's like when you know what time the thief is coming into your house right you're going to be waiting for him you know or you're going to lock up all the things you're prepared and that's what the po the whole point of vaccination is to prepare the individual paul i guess you mentioned that um they're all effective in some degree so if that's the case right um so why is sinovac another question right not treated the same as pfizer and modern even though it's also approved by who so yeah that's a that's a very good question and it's going to be a very real question because uh they're talking about vaccine exemptions for uh pre-event testing for for even for church services and the reason is because sinofac does not have registration in singapore so it's not approved by the health sciences authority of singapore which has approved pfizer and moderna only and the reason for this as i understand it is because they have not submitted all the documents that hsa wants now many of you have dealt with singapore government agencies and you know that the requirements are legendary and in fact i used to be a reviewer for the health science authority and i i did i think two of them and then i gave up because when they asked me to review uh one of the drugs they i said okay and next thing you know uh 13 three-ring binders each of about 100 to 150 pages appeared in my office and i had to read through you know literally more than a thousand pages of documents about the drug about the safety about all the trials that were done and and you know all the procedures that had been done so singapore's hsa is very very very rigorous in terms of its review uh the who on the other hand is not dealing with a high-income small island of 5.9 million people the who has to deal with people all over the world you know in africa and latin america and so they have to be a bit more pragmatic and realistic so i'll give you an example you know the drug of choice for the treatment of severe malaria is a drug called arthemita it's actually comes from the chinese herb ching hao su and it's highly effective it's in fact the most effective drug for treatment of malaria but it's not licensed in singapore and the reason is because no drug company wants to go through the thousand page dossier to get hsa approval for the drug so if i have a patient with severe malaria i have to go through a special access route which fortunately has been made uh relatively easy for us but you know it's it's a it's a procedure that has to be done so my understanding is sinovac has not done that yet and because they haven't done it yet the drug cannot be made available under the normal uh normal circumstances so it's actually quite a big deal that singapore is actually making it available in public hospitals even though it's not not approved by the normal route thank you prof that that's very insightful i'm going to ask you two more questions as a follow-up then go to pastor vincent so the the two questions that related is that with all these vaccinations two questions one is that will we need a booster jab that's the first uh follow-on the second question is that can we mix and match vaccines for for example we take first dose pfizer second those modern so two questions for you yeah those are very good questions um i personally belong to the camp that believes that we don't we probably will not need a booster jab and the reason why i believe that is i was involved in a study led by duke and us early on in the pandemic and what happened was they were trying to look at the t cell response which is one of our body's immune cells how they respond to the virus and they actually managed to get some volunteers who were people who had recovered from sars now you know a lot of the people who had stars were doctors and nurses and so they were very keen to help out i remember at the beginning of the pandemic some of them called me up and said hey i don't mind donating some of my blood you know for for research or for treatment and so what they found was that these people who had saw 17 years ago their cells could recognize the virus this covet 19 even though it was a different virus but because it was related their cells could recognize it so i think that there's a good chance that this vaccine will protect us for for several years we don't know i mean you know the virus has only been around for for less than two years but i think there's a reasonable chance that we may not need a booster or at most need a third dose like hep b you get three doses now the next question was about mixing and matching so this is a question which is under a lot of scrutiny there are studies which are underway in the uk in korea and in fact we've just started a study in singapore where it was in the news a couple of days ago so if you developed an allergic reaction to pfizer or moderna vaccine you can actually sign up for this study which is being done at ncid and they'll give you synovic and they'll see whether you you mount a better response than people who just got two doses of pfizer there's a theoretical reason why you might mount a better response because maybe each of the different vaccines is training you to training a different part of your immune system so when you put them all together you get a better you know it's like the football teams when you get somebody who is trained in england and somebody who's trained in germany and somebody's trained in france then you get everybody playing together there's also the risk that they can't talk to each other and then or you end up with side effects from from all all the different vaccines but theoretically you know you get the talented defenders from one school and you get the wingers from another side and the striker from with a different kind of background thanks paul that's helpful and to round off this section on general information i'm going to ask pastor vincent this question is faith-based and there's there's two questions here pastor vincent and some of them came in past few days and so the question goes like this is the global pandemic and the vaccine signs of the end times and the the question is related uh that some others ask which we're grouping together is the vaccine a mark of the beast that's gonna restrict economic activity uh like travel and so forth and public events so pastor vincent okay this is uh yeah very interesting question but it is a good question i think as as bible believing christians we are concerned about the end times and uh we need to be ready we need to be alert so i guess uh part of that readiness and alertness is also to look out for any thing that could be you know pointing towards this so it's a global pandemic and the vaccine science of the end times yes and no yes because the bible very clearly tells us uh you know actually throughout the bible but if you read matthew 24 mark 13 luke 21 which is basically a record of the teaching of our lord jesus himself about the end times this one the most comprehensive teaching from from the lord jesus in luke it says that one of the birth pangs or one of the signs of the end times would be pandemic you know pestilences of course there's natural disasters earthquakes famines wars rumors or wars there will be persecution and so on and one of them is pestilences so are pestilences one of the signs of the end times well the answer is yes okay that the context of the passage is that the disciples asked jesus when will this happen it means like when will the end come and jesus told them that the day and the hour nobody knows not even the angels not the son of man but there are signs or there are birth pangs that would serve to alert us all right not to alarm us we see all these signs we have to say oh let's be reminded that the lord jesus one day will return um so what so we are scared no in fact we should be looking forward to it but more important it kind of remind us how we should live our lives today all right and uh as as a good witness for the lord jesus so i think yes it is um but uh not just kovite 19 but many viruses as professor paul reminded us and probably there will be more coming uh in the future sadly is the vaccine uh the mark of the beast restricting economic activity like public events and travel i do not think that this vaccine for kovace 19 is the mark of the beast why do i say that because the bible clearly tells us that first of all if it's the mark of the beast the beast would have been here the beast is the antichrist and the bible tells us that we will bow down to worship this beast all right this person secondly the mark of the beast there will be the number 666 that will be printed tattooed whatever on our right hand and our forehead so uh i adopt the view and i hope you too that i take the bible literally when the plane sends make good sense signal other sense so i don't try to interpret it oh number 66 is spiritually is a sign of man well it is but if you say 666 i take it literally okay and not some hidden code uh so i don't see this vaccine putting this number 666 on my forehead or on my hand um could you leave the question on because there are actually three questions in that that one question uh maybe just the last part yeah is this okay easier for me to see that but all this pointing to the mark of the beast i think it's possible in fact i do believe it is i think what's happening is part and parcel of the development of a future some form of a one-world government and some form of a one-world economic system all right and uh and that's already happening with or without this kovit-19 situation with or without this vaccine okay but i think more and more things is going to happen that will kind of push us really the whole world towards some form of a global government exactly the shape and size and form i'm not sure some form of uh one world economic system that one i think we're already seeing happening the financial system of the world is getting more and more and more connected right and uh because of technology because all this would later on be usurped by the antichrist when he rise up and to use it to control the world and to persecute the believers so the bible is quite clear in saying that all these things will happen leading to the end times and so i think all this could be a part and parcel of preparing the world preparing us towards whether we like it or not accepting some kind of a one-world government some kind of a one-world economic system thank you pastor winston i i we kind of wrap up this section by by what i've picked up is that uh what paul said earlier on that when many are vaccinated the severe the severeness of the disease goes down so there was something that i picked up that's correct yeah and also hsa is very stringent and very strange extremely strange so so i feel safer from hearing that and pastor vincent about pestilences from matthew 24 and the beast is not here yet the forehead and the hand yeah so he was good at something yeah i was going to add something is that you know there are already restrictions some of you have done mission trips in africa or in south america and you cannot come back to singapore without a yellow fever vaccination certificate it's actually a requirement this is a who requirement you have to have a yellow book you have to have a chop they have to have a documentation of it so so this is not something new this has been in place for 30 years for because the the mosquito which spreads yellow fever is the same mosquito express dengue and it's all over singapore so the authorities are paranoid they don't want to get yellow fever coming into singapore so they mandate a vaccine requirement and like i said many of you who have been on trips to africa for other reasons have have had that and so and you know the beast hasn't come yet so so it's not for us to know i guess okay thank you okay so thank you panelists there was a very good section there we're going to move on to the topic of efficacy and and again we will tackle the medical questions followed by the the pastoral the biblical questions uh so the the question here um paul this one's for you they've been a few cases of those who were already vaccinated but they were still infected with covid19 so the question is how effective then is the vaccine really at protecting against infection so that's the first question and and then the second question um if the vaccine does not fully protect an individual then why are those who are vaccinated exempted from pet in events or travel for example or events i guess so paul very good questions um and and the re the i'll take the second one first again and so far there's been very very little evidence that anyone who has been vaccinated has been able to spread the virus to anyone else i know there's a theoretical risk and there's been one or two case reports from europe but by and large there have been a handful of individuals who have been vaccinated and who have got the disease and in fact there have been some especially those with severe underlying disease who have also got severe disease and you'll know from the united states there's a small percentage of individuals who have been vaccinated but they have still got severe disease and they have died but the number is small and i think the analogy is with for example the chickenpox vaccine now many of you would have had your kids vaccinated with the six in one or the five in one which includes the chickenpox vaccine and in spite of the fact of getting the chickenpox vaccine there are a handful of people who still get chickenpox but the thing is they tend to get it very mild they have maybe a little bit of fever they have a few spots on the body and after two or three days they're fine and that's by and large what the vaccine has done uh it has it's not a hundred percent at best it's uh in real life it's about 85 90 so that still means that one in 10 people are going to get sick but if they do get sick the vast majority of them don't get as sick as they would have if they had not been vaccinated again um i'll tell you a story i have a 72 year old grandpa who was admitted to a hospital and he's one of those who takes his grandson to children to a tuition and so this was about a month and a half ago when the tuition centers were being infected and and he had been vaccinated but he because he's so close to his grandson he ended up getting infected when his grandson was infected so i said to him i said you know do you feel bad that you were vaccinated are you infected he said no he says i'm 72 years old i've seen what happens to older people who get infected i just had a sore throat for one day and now i feel fine so this grandpa himself was was able to tell me that you know he just said he said in fact my grandson is probably sicker than i am you know that that because he had been vaccinated that that he had a relatively mild uh illness thank you so so about only one in ten may get infected and not as sick you were saying so that's right generally milder again you know the very old and those with multiple illnesses they do get sick but that right now you know where vaccine 1.0 we haven't got to the stage where we can we can completely prevent that and there's no risk of those who are vaccinated uh to spread the virus yeah you know they've been millions of people who have been vaccinated millions of people have been infected and like i said the in the published medical literature is less than a handful i would say less than those who can count on the fingers of one hand who have actually spread the virus in fact i'm meeting one of my students tomorrow to try and see amongst the super spreaders in singapore or the cluster the index case for each cluster my impression is the vast majority of them have not been vaccinated thank you and so on efficacy still pastor vincent now back to you the government this question came in has been encouraging singaporeans to get vaccinated as part of the safe reopening strategy so the question is this how do we respond as christians and the the other question is that do we have a social responsibility to love our neighbor and get vaccinated so two questions for you pastor vincent thanks uh pastor ben um thought both of us supposed to answer the theological and pastor okay i'll help you okay i answered the easy one your answer difficult and all these are very difficult questions okay so do we have a social responsibility to love our neighbor and get vaccinated well the first part is is obvious yes right we do have a commandment it's more than just a responsibility it's a clear direct commandment from the lord to love our neighbor of course the question here is does that is that tie in with getting vaccinated well this is where i think we have to to me we have to take a position uh a posture i tell you what i do i take a posture of faith and trust in the authorities and the experts that god has appointed over us so for example the ministry of health they have a panel of experts including people like professor paul dr leung and some of them you know i got to know that they are devoted followers of jesus christ and so i think my posture as a christian should be to adopt a posture of faith first of all faith in god and an expression of that would be trust in the authorities that god has appointed over me doesn't mean they're perfect it doesn't mean that i just naively follow but at the same time if i do not adopt that stance then i'm afraid that i would live my life with a lot of fear and suspicion and the bible clearly tells us that now god has not given us a spirit of fear but of of power love and self-control so i don't want to walk around with a lot of fear and suspicion and but and really if you think about it um who is easier for me to trust the panel experts appointed by the governing authority got appointed over me ministry of health all right and so on government authorities or some reports or youtube talks that i get from social media by somebody who i don't even know of course somebody i've been told that oh then you should go and find out well you know i try to read some of this and i get lost the more i read and hear the more confused i get and i tell myself even if i spend hours and hours plowing through all the information i will never have an expert knowledge like professor paul for example right i'll never never even close to what they have so what makes me think that i can make my own decision of course i do have a kind of a layman understanding of how the whole thing works and i think i make a choice to trust these authorities so with that they tell me and i have every reason to believe what they tell me is true or at least to their expertise and understanding is true that vaccination will help right will help to protect not just us but people around us so then the the the rational is very straightforward right i should do it not just for myself but for others in fact i would go one step further to say that we should think about others first that is the christian command right from the lord if i think about my benefit and my neighbor's benefit i should put my neighbor's benefit above mind right i mean the lord jesus set a good example for us he you know he has his status as god he never grasped but he willingly took on the form of a man and became a man and was obedient all the way to the cross and we are to emulate our lord jesus christ so i think when i look at the whole thing i said look the first question i ask is that if i if i get vaccinated will this help to protect other people around me okay the medical experts ministry of health tells me that it will i take their word for it because i choose to trust these authorities and many of them are devoted followers of jesus christ that god has placed over me okay so um that's how i would i would i would go about it yes maybe just one last point here pastor ben uh i i think you know if we think about loving our neighbor perhaps as christians we need to think about not just singaporeans you know we why don't we think a bit further and say look what about people around me what about people from poor countries right the many countries around us they don't have the money to buy vaccine you know their problem is that they don't have enough vaccine and i would like to think in fact if i have a chance to like suggest to the relevant authorities is that can singapore kind of devote some resources to buy vaccine for our neighboring countries who may not have the financial resources to afford it i think that's one expression of loving our neighbor you know and if if i i know our government participate i know singapore speed in this uh when i say kovacs kovacs program i would cheer them on if we double the budget triple the budget i say that's great let's do more because if we can help our neighbor not just within singapore but beyond singapore i think as christians we should applaud those efforts yeah i think pastor vincent just now reminded me i should also chip in because i'm also okay pastor as well so um some of you know that i grew up in singapore in san andreas boarding house he was my senior in school and many of my friends are foreigners so one of them just texted me recently and he told me that in his country of where he is right now he will only get vaccines at the end of the year he's the same age as me and so when i told my friend in this other country that my children are not being vaccinated he was so upset with the authorities where he is and he talked about corruption and all that so one of the other things beside social responsibility actually vincent i i feel thankful for the authorities in our country and how they are efficient and paul said rigorous and so so i feel a sense of thankfulness and and and actually what paul mentioned earlier on that the more of us who get vaccinated than the severeness of the sickness goes down as well so for the sake of the whole community we think that way and not just for myself even though i don't like that the pain because i just don't like needles but for the sake of the collective i'm gonna give up my my my fear of being punctured for that two seconds so okay thank you for that we've touched on a general information we've touched on efficacy we're going to move on to another section on side effects now many of you wrote in with questions on side effects and so the same format again will tackle the medical scientific questions and followed by the faith and pastoral questions so the the talk of the list that was asked by many of you were what was this given that the vaccine was developed so quickly and the studies are still ongoing how do we know that the vaccines are really safe and effective so so that that's um the the major questions now there are a few questions linked to that which i think i'll just stop there first uh paul i think i'll let you just come in first yeah thanks very much that's a very good question and it's a very real question but before i answer that question i received a text from a classmate who's a parishioner in your church dr wong he appointed he's a real pediatrician i'm an adult infectious disease doctor that the five and one and six in one do not include the chickenpox vaccine you have to pay separately for that so there's just a correction there but coming back to these these vaccines now the question is how safe are these vaccines and the answer is that we don't know how safe they are in the long term but we do know that the vaccines the first person vaccinated all over anywhere in the world was in the middle of december so now we're coming up to six months and so far um the number of side effects is real but it's relatively small what is good is that there's ongoing surveillance and through this surveillance especially in the countries of europe and north america and it's partly because although they accept the authorities they try and keep the authorities on their toes by by you know asking a lot of questions uh in the legislatures and various places like that so they have um very comprehensive surveillance systems to pick up on unusual side effects and the two that they've picked up on one is this heart inflammation which occurs in young men and it's uncommon it occurs in about one in eighty thousand to one in a hundred thousand now that seems like a small number but when you're vaccinating a million people that means that you're going to get at least dozens or maybe more than 100 cases so the key is that they've identified that this thing does occur and what singapore's authorities have done is very logical they just tell people don't do any vigorous exercise for for a week uh after you've gotten the uh the fisa or moderna they tell everyone that although the the studies only show that it was young men who who had this increased rate uh for young women there's a risk of blood clots which occurs again one in one to three in a million and this was first picked up in in europe in germany uh and they've actually done some very detailed research and they found out that there are certain individuals who have a special kind of reaction to the to the vaccine and it affects their platelets so that's why they end up with these blood clots it's a rare condition in a small number of individuals but that has also allowed them to to look out for for when this can occur and in fact in some countries this is more with the astrazeneca vaccine and the j j they've suggested that individuals young women maybe should use the fisa or moderna instead so fortunately for us that has not been a major issue with faisal moderna which are the two vaccines which are licensed here in singapore so apart from all the details i mean what this tells us is that there are surveillance systems out there in fact the international society of infectious disease which i'm the president-elect of we run a website called pro-med which picks up on emerging infectious diseases the next virus that we were talking about earlier and the sources are not just official reports but they also have people picking up on gossip on chatter on social media posts and what they do is they have a process they get a social media post they ask two or three other people in the country around there then they shoot it off to the official ministry of health and they try and get some confirmation so it's through this kind of uh networks that we get information about side effects and so far like i said for the last six months uh there are some but they seem to be relatively uh uncommon actually you covered on the follow-up questions i was going to ask you which is you mentioned that there's comprehensive surveillance and there is some risk but it's relatively small and i think you mentioned for young men it's 1 in 80 to 100 000 and for women it's one or three in a million for blood clots that's right and so so because i was going to ask you paul was that are younger people at higher risk but you mentioned that the this yeah yeah the thinking is that you know younger people have stronger immune systems and a lot of these complications are when the immune system overreacts so instead of just killing the virus or being trained to kill the virus it starts to kill some of our own cells uh in the case of these young men they think it's the heart cells or in case of the younger women with this unusual disorder they attack the platelets and they they cause blood clots in a very small number of individuals i see because of strong immune system there's a like over reaction sometimes right so that's excellent and so um okay thank you for that paul i'm going to move on this that there is this question you did touch on this in your introduction but this question came up as well and i think it's it's uh something that we can address is that is there any chance that the mrna vaccines can in some ways affect our dna yeah no and again as i said so earlier there's no chance that that can happen because mrna is is a single strand you know if you go down to marina to the bay area you see this helix bridge that's a double stranded and that's dna if it was rna it would only be one strand see so if you you can go from two strands to one strand but to go from one strand to two strand you need a special enzyme which is present in in certain viruses like hiv but the vast majority of viruses don't have it covet doesn't have it influenza doesn't have it it's called a reverse transcriptase so because it's called a reverse it goes the opposite direction but most of the time the traffic is flowing in one direction from dna to rna and it doesn't go backwards so it's just not possible really for mrna to uh to affect our own dna okay so one more for you paul let's move on to pastor vincent so paul there's been some cases where people when they pass on and they have coveted and they have something else so there is a concern among some people you read it in the press and and you read it in some some of the social media posts and also some questions that came in as well that that when it's not attributed to code it is there possible under reporting oh oh definitely and again part of the thing is um you know covet generally tends to kill people by causing a pneumonia a severe pneumonia so you start off with coughing you you have difficulty in breathing but there's another aspect of covet which is the the blood clots which covet itself causes not just the the rare side effect of the vaccine but you know people can die very suddenly from a blood clot so very often we've had cases where we we don't even suspect uh covet and in fact we had a case uh in last year this time last year there was a 72 year old woman who came into the hospital she had to all intents and purposes what looked like a stroke but the a and e mo looked at her x-ray and said you know this doesn't look like what an x-ray of a person with a stroke does and i happen to be on duty so she called me up three o'clock in the morning she said can i do a kobe test i said do whatever you want you know and she did the covet test and true enough it came back positive so so there are certain cases which you know um we don't expect but we are learning more and more about the disease and one of the things is it is true this sudden death could be due to to covet itself so therefore if that's the case then have there been any cases where there were severe side effects including deaths linked to the covet vaccine yes and this is a very good question it's a theoretical question because again we don't fully understand how the covid the virus itself kills people like i said in the majority of cases it's causing pneumonia so pneumonia very obvious you know you cough you have flame you have difficulty breathing but the other part the blood clots is the is the question that's the subject of a lot of intense research and the question is if if the blood clots are due to a body the body's reaction to the virus could that also happen with a simulated reaction which is what we are trying to do with the vaccine and in fact that was one of the intense focuses of research when they first developed the vaccine there was a fear that that would happen so they did studies on on monkeys actually and they they injected the monkeys with the the pfizer vaccine three different doses as well as placebo and then they they they put the virus into the monkeys and what they were looking for is whether the the vaccine would actually trigger what we call a more severe and overreaction kind of response and in the lungs of those monkeys there's a small number you know i think there were like three monkeys in each arm they did not see that over-response but but that is clearly something that we are concerned about and you know there have been all these reports and the trouble is that it's it's you know it's a strength of association that you need thousands of cases before you can prove and you don't want to in a way as a lay person you you know you're turning around and you're telling the doctor or the scientist you want me to wait for thousands of people to get affected but unfortunately until you have elucidated the mechanism it's very hard to tell from just the numbers so that's why the the blood clot situation with the young women in germany is very unique because the german scientists were able to figure out how it happened and they saw this happening with a few cases of covet disease and they also saw this in i think it was like six or seven women uh with the vaccination so they're able to test for it they develop the test and you know we can do that but we can't do that with the vast majority of the the other unusual uh complications so so i'll be honest and i'll tell you we don't know but so far from the millions of people in fact that they are injected with the vaccine there has not been a big rise in heart attacks or clots in the general public population paul i'll just give you one more question that i'm going to move on to pastor vincent so the question is this is that you mentioned early on that the the the sinovac uh that technology that developed satellite was 100 years old right and so the question is this what are the possible long-term effects of the mrna vaccines yeah yeah so again the technology that's used for the cyanofact vaccine is actually used in the flu vaccine every year that hopefully all of y'all are getting and what they do for the flu vaccine is they actually use chicken eggs uh embryonated eggs and then they inject the virus they grow it there and then they kill it and then they inject it into people so that is something and the they they put in a juvenile or something to make the immune response stronger and the adjuvant they use in sinufact is alum which is again very similar to what they use for the flu vaccine now with the mrna vaccine because they are not using actual virus and what they're doing is they're putting the instructions into the cell and they're making our own body produce the protein so there is a fear that this thing called autoimmune diseases now some of you know people with lupus lupus is a kind of nasty disease where the body's immune system over-reacts and instead of killing bacteria or viruses it starts affecting the joints it affects the skin it can affect the kidneys so that's an extreme example of an autoimmune disease so there's some fear that this vaccine may trigger off an autoimmune disease but again so far in the six months that we've seen for the mrna vaccine we have not seen a rise in autoimmune diseases although again some of these diseases take years to develop but and a lot of the doctors who look after patients with lupus or those with a strong family history of autoimmune diseases they've been very very cautious in in use of this and there are studies which are underway looking at individuals who may be at risk of autoimmune diseases but so far uh thank god there'll be no signals yet so paul thank you because we know that we know that this virus is very contagious and it can also it can be also be very fatal as well so so we are now talking about um the risk of the vaccine right so vis-a-vis a very dangerous virus yeah i'm going to share another story if if you don't mind as some of you know dr tam wait yeah she has she has written a series of books under the kite song story and she's married to um i think he's was a bible school teacher and his name was cliff tom clifton and he had a liver transplant as a child when you have a liver transplant your immune system is severely suppressed so you cannot deal with even mild viral infections and in fact you are not supposed to get live virus vaccines so they felt called to go to uganda to to be to go in the mission field in uganda and every one of us in the infectious disease field we knew them told them not to go and the reason is because in order to get into uganda or to get back into singapore you need a yellow fever vaccination and the yellow fever is a live virus vaccine and if you give a live various vaccine to somebody who's had a transplant who's had a liver transplant like her husband you run the risk of making the guy really sick from the from the vaccine virus but you know they prayed about it they actually um got somebody who was a world authority on the yellow who wrote the whole guideline who wrote them an exemption and to say that they could go into uganda without the and then we said you know what if you get the disease you could die from the disease you know uh but they were so convinced that that was where they were called to go and uh you know they went and they came back and god protected them but you know i wouldn't recommend that thank you for the the anecdote there um okay so so i've learned a few things here i've learned about the fact that the the the younger people and and the wrist there because of the strong immune system and that there's no chance the mro na can affect our dna and and that the the long-term effects are it's an open verdict but so far it's it's good it's promising it's been six months you were saying and and bear in mind uh people folks that we're dealing with a very aggressive virus out there so so we're balancing risk and and so our health authorities are advising us to take the vaccine so pastor vincent now i'm going to move on to you on underside effects so what would be the church's advice church is in big c i guess to people who are struggling with the decision to vaccinate or not to a vaccine i guess people uh the one who wrote this question are probably um unneutral and on the fence and and have some concerns and some fears maybe and so they're saying what would be the advice to such a person struggling with some of these concerns and maybe even fear deep down inside yeah i think well firstly i want to say i can understand that in fact initially i myself was i wouldn't say i was hesitant but i took the stance that i'm not in a hurry my wife is a lot more trusting those of you who know jenny because you know we are above 60 right so we we received the appointment thing uh quite early on and she like signed up the next day you know i took about i was i was a little bit later younger than my wife so i took about a month before i signed up partly because i was busy during those few weeks yeah i i won't deny that i had a little bit of discomfort initially but as i listened to the [Music] authorities you know dr kevin uh kenneth mark uh and they appear on the press conference regularly from what i read these are all very credible experts professor paul himself i i i was very assured okay that at the very least the benefits of far outweighs the risk and this is medically yeah so the concern if it is a medical concern like i said earlier this is what i advise my church members in kcc anyway that we should adopt a posture of faith in god and trust in the authorities that god has placed over us and not a posture of fear and suspicion because i think i don't think that's how we should live our lives whether it's this covic thing or something else because the posture or spirit of fear and suspicion i think can cause us to be well very fearful uh and nowadays we read a lot of things in the internet right not just this kobe 19 situation there's all kinds of all kinds of strange things circulating around and so if you have that posture or mindset you read something say oh yeah oh cannot do this cannot do that you know then i don't think god wants to live that way yeah so like i answered earlier already if it's a medical reason i think my advice to my church members has been let's trust the authorities and to clearly tell us is safe there could be some very minimal risk but the benefits far outweigh the risk therefore we should get vaccinated i will go along with that um but if the if the concern is something else master ben it could be i mean if going back to an earlier question that is this part of the mark of the beast is this part of the parcel of you know the antichrist preparing us to to be under his control um maybe i just add on a little bit more comment to that i do think that all this is part and parcel of the development towards some form of a one-world government some form of one world economic system because the antichrist the way he's going to control the world clearly in revelations is that uh it will through it will be through financial instrument all right without the mark of the beast you cannot buy and sell so that's very clear-cut and we can already see that the technology enables that i mean even 50 years ago you cannot imagine this happening but today it is very possible with the technology so the question is do i therefore try to avoid all this i think my answer would be we cannot avoid all this uh how to avoid all this get out of the whole system uh you know get out of the whole financial system i mean i can't even buy durians you know that would be i think that would be that would be worse you know i would take all the risk with the vice vaccine in order i got that i can have money to buy durians but you can't first of all we cannot get out of this but again you know what can i do go to a remote island and just live by myself plant some vegetables rear some chicken so that you know i don't need money to live i don't think that should be the mindset personally i really don't think so i think we are called to be salt and light we are called to permeate society not to isolate ourselves we are called to enter into difficult situation dark situations and bring the message of hope and light will that mean that we may subject ourselves to some risk the answer is yes but that's god's calling for us i mean this couple that professor paul talks about against medical advice in this case they went to the missions field and i'm quite sure they were mentally prepared that they could die there i mean the husband could die out there but they felt the call of god i'm not saying all of us should do that but i think the posture should be that look i cannot totally excret extricate myself this is where the world is going i need to be part of society i need to permeate i need to be around to be a light to be a messenger of hope and to preach the gospel to those who hear it but what's more important maybe just a one last comment pastor ben is that i think we need to be prepared for the end times all right we need to be prepared for the return of the lord the bible is very clear the signs you know just read matthew 24 mark 13 luke 21 there's quite sufficient information all right for us to see that so many things that is happening even as we speak is all part of what jesus said birth pangs all right and again it is not to cause us to be alarmed causes to be suspicious causes to retreat go and hide in a remote island it is for us to be alert it reminds me on a regular basis that i need to seek first the kingdom of god it reminds me that i do not put my my trust in money because if i put my trust in money one day when the antichrist uses up the world financial system and he's going to be able to control me but if i don't put my trust in money i live a simple life um you know then i will be in a better place to be able to uh continue to walk victoriously even when the time comes so we need to be prepared okay but we shouldn't be afraid pastor vincent i'm gonna i'm gonna just um hang on for a second i'm gonna ask you a follow-up question now now did this person uh who asked this question was about they're struggling and there's some fear issues you know so so um i remember towards the end of last year in my family group chat maxnet family it was very divided uh people who were against trump people who were for trump and so so i i'm going to apply that to to this situation now how would you advise the person who's saying that in my household there are people in my household who are definitely for vaccination right and then there are those who are in between like this this person and then there are those that are uh they are vaccine uh skeptical and they're not for it so so how would you how would you or maybe even even a sound group that has people like this so how would you speak into that situation that means that people are in different places uh so what should our heart posture be in that situation where where there are different perspectives and different views and convictions at the moment how would you speak into that okay master ben that would be a difficult question and that would be your category uh i i can i can i on to that you want to say something about that first uh well um so with the the trump thing uh end of last year there was one or two family members uh they were very hostile against trump and they wanted to kind of fight and go all the way and and that kind of thing so to to to de-escalate i i took a posture of being non-divisive non-divisive and i vincent this morning i spoke to you on the phone about something else and i think we spoke about megaphone diplomacy versus having a cup of coffee and a relational approach so so so in that that that debate about trump and and against trump so we de-escalated whole thing and just just took a posture of of listening and and relating so i would encourage people in this situation not to um this is not an issue to divide the church over the family over and the cell group mover so i think that would be the the the one thing i would add to this discussion actually can i give a perspective on that you know some of you know that there are two different kinds of polio vaccine there's an oral polio vaccine and there's an injectable polio vaccine and they were developed by two different scientists one was called jonas salt and the other is called albert sabin and the thing is both of them hated each other and they were very passionate about it it's just like people are pro-trump anti-trump you know if saul said black is white slavin would say white is black you know that kind of thing but ultimately the world ended up needing both vaccines because the we started off using the oral vaccine many of you will remember as a kid here to drink this oral vaccine but then this oral vaccine can eliminate the virus from circulation but it can also occasionally make people sick so now what we do in singapore is we give a combination of the injectable and the oral vaccine so sometimes i personally and again some of you know my philosophy has always been you know to encourage uh debate it's sometimes even as christians we have to agree to disagree it's like it's like paul and barnabas with the mission trips and ultimately i think god can can make use of sometimes disagreements although unfortunately most of the time they end up splitting churches and things like that well i think underlying that would be the the principle that we read in efficiency where paul says make every effort to maintain the unity that we have in christ jesus we don't create the unity when we are born again believers we have the holy spirit and in christ we are already united right our our part is to make every effort to maintain so whether it is a political issue whether it is a medical issue like this and so on i think the posture is to maintain to maintain peace now maintaining peace doesn't mean i don't have a position it doesn't mean that i'm weak it doesn't mean that i want to avoid conflict i think we need to choose our battles uh yeah i do i would i would discourage christians fellow christians i i would i would caution us not to get too how should i put it um worked up yeah not to be too worked up about some of this i think we should be worked up about more important things on the heart of god i think we should be more worked up about the plight of the poor yeah in singapore but even more so neighboring countries i i think i'm more worked up when i read about countries because of uh lacking resources they can't buy vaccines and people are dying i feel worked up about that you know i feel like can who do more can we singapore as a nation do a little bit you know i feel more worked up about that so so personally uh when i get into a discussion like this i i don't get too worked up and i i will do my part to to de-escalate master ben but i don't mind a good constructive discussion but hopefully if we are mature believers we can like what professor paul said we can agree to disagree and we can we can have a very animated discussion fully disagree and after that still go on eat durians together you know durians will unite us amen and the word of god so so winston i want to add something and and you know i've noticed in the past right in the 70s you know people can have a disagreement and they're very gentlemanly about it but but have you noticed that brothers that that in recent years that culture is very becoming very polarized and then the culture wars like we see in the u.s effect very divided societies and so it would be tragic if if our household our our society or our church is as polarized or as divided as some of these cultures that we see yeah you know a lot of people blame social media and that's the algorithm see so on my social media feed i deliberately keep one or two people as my friends who i disagree with so that at least there's some balance because otherwise i hear all one side of things and it makes me even more one-sided so so i have one or two vaccine skeptics on my social media feed and it also helps me to understand where people are coming from if everybody on my social media feed was pro-vaccine then i wouldn't be aware of some of these issues that people are raising so so i you know i read what they post and it's educational for me and at the same time i think it adjusts the algorithm so that i don't get all one side of the story that's a good point paul i would say that we tend to [Music] we tend to stick within our own echo chamber and what we listen to is all the same and so like don't confuse me with the facts my mind's made up already that kind of echo chamber which is what you're trying to say so thank you for that pastor vincent yeah i i mean to add on to that just now you mentioned about division it's true we see that not just in america i think all over the world it's just that we get news about america more easily i believe the person behind this ultimately is the devil you know the devil come to kill steal and destroy and one of the most effective way of destroying families communities societies even churches is division i think we all know that all right if you have been a christian long enough if you have attended church long enough you have experienced some form of a division within the church within your cell group or whatever and and so much relationship is destroyed literally sometimes overnight so i think we need to stand our ground i think we need to maintain that we will not let division come in um we need to have the wisdom of god when to backed off when is it that okay this discussion is not going anywhere it's probably going to hurt feelings to have the spirit of self-control to say okay enough said let's stop let's pray let's worship let's go and eat durians whatever you know i think i think whether it's a family situation it is uh within the church or within the community uh you see jesus came to to give life and life abundantly where the spirit of god is there's life and peace not strife and division so those of us who have the holy spirit if you believe in the lord jesus you have we carry that spirit and we should bring peace everywhere we go yeah and not contribute and maybe one last comment was the ban which is i think we all know social media is is not helping in this process all right i always encourage people in my church anyone i would talk to is that don't use social media for a heated debate i i personally find i don't read these things on social media honestly i find that any debate on facebook internet is just a shouting match in cyberspace nobody is listening to one another you know i think i rather sit down and have a constructive perhaps even a heated discussion with somebody than to be shouting in cyberspace and nobody is listening so i i would really say let's not let's not get into that don't spend too much time on the social media spend more time reading the word of god please yeah thank you that's a good time to to move on to the next um to the next section uh and this our final section for for tonight and after this i'm going to give you some time to wrap up and um so so paul um we're going to go to you first uh so paul uh they've been questions as well coming about treatment now not vaccinations but treatment so the question is can we treat covet 19 cases uh that means instead of vaccination why don't we just focus on treatment with drugs drugs like ivan mectin and hydro hydroxychloroquine yeah as other countries have done and so people have given examples of the u.s um and other countries so someone even quoted a a peer-reviewed matter analysis by brian laurie at all so paul could you take this phrase in fact you can definitely treat patients with ivermectin with hydroxychloroquine with any of the old drugs as well as the new drugs currently there's no restriction in singapore ivermectin is is actually available in singapore for treatment of worms in fact i just prescribed it a week ago to somebody who i suspected of worms so there's no restriction on ivermectin prescription but the reality is i think most of us feel that prevention is better than cure and so that's why you know we are looking at vaccination but at the on the other side of the coin is can we use the drugs to prevent infection and in fact i was part of a large study that was conducted by colleagues at nuh and in one of the dormitories at the peak of the outbreak last year and you know at that time there was no vaccine the poor guys were getting locked up in the in the dormitories and there was really uh uh they were the word that was used by one of them was that they feel they felt like they were sitting ducks waiting to get infected and so we we got permission from ministry of health we ran this trial we included ivamectin hydroxychloroquine the povidone iodine spray throat spray and zinc and vitamin c and we found that there was some benefit primarily in the povidone iodine and hydroxychloroquine there was some benefit with ivamectin but we only used a single dose we studied these people over six weeks but so so there pro may be some benefit but the benefit overall was about 20 even the weakest of vaccines is about 60 70 percent so so you know the difference is there and also a vaccine is just two shots you know you get pain in the arm two days whereas with ivormectin you've got to take it every week and you've got to take it for a very long time as long as the virus is circulating and it's it's not just one tablet it's four or five tablets for the adult dose so so i think you know that i think there's no harm in taking ivy mechan they do that in villages in africa where where they have lots of parasites and they they do mass treatment they take the whole village and that's been super effective in in getting rid of terrible parasitic diseases such as river blindness so uh so so there is no harm in it it's a relatively safe drug it's just a pain to have to take the drug you know four tablets every week for for a long time and you don't know whether when you could alternatively just get two jabs thank you so it's uh prevention is better than cure the efficacy is different and it's cumbersome so thank you for that uh i'm gonna move to pastor vincent pastor vincent how can we ensure that our church members i'm talking about those who are unable to take the vaccine because of various medical conditions are still included in some of our in-person activities yeah yeah ben that's a good question and this is a question that pastors have been struggling uh for the last one over years uh and i think um well maybe i can only speak for kcc um this is where i think uh being a smaller church times like this has certain advantages we have we have kcc we have not resumed in-person church-wide sunday service yet so since april last year we haven't had a normal sunday service i mean it's not even normal with all the social distancing i know river life that you have you went back to 500 and then 250 of course now it's back to 50 because of heightened alert measures uh and we do that for a few reasons uh one of which is that we we felt first of all we we felt that god wanted us to focus more on small group uh gatherings and that small groups better facilitate community building and relational discipleship than large group so i mean if you can do both and do it well sure why not but times like this given the size of our church and limited resources since april last year we have focused more on small groups so we don't have a problem uh of course now we're back to only five guests that's a bit limited we're hoping that it will go back up to eight very soon then uh cell groups actually can gather some cells a bit big they actually gather in two groups so we gathered in church at home groups on sunday morning they zoom the cells gather they zoom in to the service that is broadcast from our studio and then after that they have some time to process the message and pray for one another followed by lunch and that actually worked out very well for us um i mean i've heard many who shared that you know pastor vincent wow you know just the last few months i got to know my cell members more than the previous three years you know because now we're a smaller group in the home after that we have discussion of the message pray for each other followed by lunch and but is there a place for a large group meeting well yes so we have decided that we will only resume our first large group sunday service gathering when we allow up to 100 people without pre-event testing because of the size of our church 100 plus 30 people who are serving plus the religious classes for children which we can take up to 100 people i heard that would be sufficient for us okay so so i don't have the problem that pastor man i know you face because river life is a much bigger church so i don't have the answer for you yeah but i think i mean of course i know you would try your best to include everybody as much as possible i'm sure that's your pause you know i think the the government is aware of this and what i've heard that um again i'm not on official panels but i i do uh contribute to various uh uh different groups um is that there's a possibility that self-testing may be uh self-testing yeah you know right now you can go to a guardian or unity and you can buy a self-test kit and i think what they might do is try and um use that as an alternative to pre-event testing because pre-event testing is very costly it's time-consuming and and it's a pain and if you can show your your self-test result uh they actually do that some of the airlines overseas um you have to bring along the the cartridge where you can show that you've done a negative or or you do it yourself you know just before you come in so so for those individuals who cannot be vaccinated for whatever reason unfortunately i think there is going to be a mandate to do pre-event testing for them but to make it more more feasible there's a possibility that self-testing may come in thank you for that i our posture would be that because of the rulings there will be some activities that will require vaccination or pet and so but uh of course our posture is to love all those people the same whether they're vaccinated or not and to do our best to include them as we're allowed to love right so so do our best to include everybody and so that's our posture and so we have come to the the end of all the questions but before i i let you all go i i i sense to get the feeling that vincent wants to eat some durians but before you go and eat some durians so i'm going to give you um this last question this came in that let's say i i'm a member of the church and and i've got several leaders over me and they may have different views right so so so this is your final question okay before you go for durians is that how do i reconcile all these views what are some of the principles that um as you as you tune out right can you share with us to make a decision for myself because let's say we have some some undecided some who are for some who are against for example that are over me different views about this vaccination yeah well i thank god my church don't have that problem i don't know i uh wow it depends on how how divided the leaders are i mean ben as you know we as leaders we try to operate by the principle of what we communicate to the church as a whole the leadership uh should communicate a a united message right so very often we would have quite animated discussion behind closed doors and that's fine you know but after we prayed discuss talk maybe even bank tables but when we come to a decision when we face the congregation we try to give a consistent message uh so but if the leaders can't do that i think they have a bigger problem uh i'm not sure how to to uh can i interject i'm gonna give you my lutheran spin on this you know luther believed in the the vocation of a christian so uh so his argument is that god works through the baker the person who who the farmer and puts bread on the table so so my thinking on this is that this is one of the situations where i tell people to ask the doctor you know because i i respect pastors tremendously and when it comes to the ideological questions i would completely yield to somebody who has been trained and ministered to but when it comes to to you know this health is a tricky thing because it's very intensely personal like i said you know the missionary couple i talked about you know they defied the advice of all the doctors and in the end it turned out all right see so so i think you know god does make use of of scientists doctors and maybe this is something you can tai chi away i don't know no i think that's a good good advice uh professor paul yeah i think that's good advice i mean if i'm in a church situation like this my leaders are divided since this is a medical issue yes i think i would choose to trust the medical professionals yes credible medical professionals and so thank you pastor vincent so so paul one final medical advice or word for our viewers from you and now close yeah so again you know we are living in very unprecedented times we've had pandemics we've had viruses we had h1n1 most people can't remember but we were in dusk on orange for about six days at the end of april we we went back to to yellow uh even before the first case of h1n1 2009 reached singapore and when the first few cases of h1n1 2009 the government stayed at yellow they did not move to orange so this virus is completely different the reaction that the world has taken the impact that it's had worldwide is is just way different from zika from ebola from h1n1 so so this is a time where you know there's been a lot of confusion there's been a lot of misinformation but yet through all of this you know we've seen um sort of we've seen science come through it's it's had it's had its ups and downs they've been mis missed calls they've been miscalculations you know people talking about whether you needed to wear masks or you didn't need to wear mars but you know that's that's the reality you see none of us is perfect we we make mistakes and we learn along the way and i think right now um what we're facing is this this need to get back to normal and the way i see it the only way to get back to normal is to ensure that enough people are vaccinated so that if there is disease and there will be disease because the vaccines are not perfect it's going to be a mild disease you know we've learned to live with so many other mild diseases around there and as long as we don't have a disease which is filling up icu beds which is depleting our oxygen supplies you know pushing the hospitals to the brink then i think we can we can go back to normal and all the other things the missions the tasks that we've been given so so that's my perspective i know that this is like i said vaccine 1.0 uh the good news is there's so many other vaccines in development we'll get 2.0 3.0 which may be a lot safer we'll get more data you know within a year we'll know how safe the vaccine is after a year and the feeling i get is that it's going to be pretty safe from what we've seen so far thank you thank you to our guest panelists pastor vincent paul today we address the medical questions and the spiritual ones as well and we've given you a lot of facts and perspectives and so we we trust that you have enough information to make some clear decisions if you have some personal concerns still please speak to your family doctor now some of us may not be able to be vaccinated as yet because of some condition and some of us may choose not to be vaccinated and because of the current pandemic ruling they will be activities that require vaccination or pre-event testing so we love every single one of you and that will include every single one of you in all our events as as we're allowed to do so i want to encourage you to pray that in the face of differing convictions to walk with christ likeness and oneness we will do well to respect differences of view among us and recognize that the early christians didn't agree always on everything but they sought to maintain the unity of the church and i want to encourage all of us here to have the posture to make choices that are god-centered and the others oriented this is not always easy and i want to encourage you also to live out the principle of faith that was mentioned earlier on and the expression of faith is trust and this includes trust in the the those who are appointed authorities over our suspension early on and always choose trust over suspicion please know that we love you and we are praying for you and tonight we are glad that all of you can join us for the covet 19 vaccine and the christian and we trust that tonight has helped you a lot let's close in prayer together abba father we pray for all those who are joining in we pray for those in river life and those from our friends churches we pray a lot that in all the information that we've heard tonight in all the perspectives we've heard tonight lord that you have

#thebigstory #coronavirus #lawrencewong",mr. one could I just turn to what happened in Parliament recently you know many people were rather surprised at the emotion you showed when you thanked the people working hard to tackle the outbreak we'll just take a look at that clip here words are not sufficient to express our appreciation mr. speaker words are not sufficient to express our appreciation for all of those who have let me just rephrase that repeat what I said just now words are not sufficient to express our appreciation for so many Singaporeans going all out to fight a virus and I just want to say thank you to everyone who's doing their part mr. Wong was there anything in particular that moved you to tears in Parliament well you said many people were surprised I was caught by my surprise as well because I didn't expect the emotions to overwhelm me so strongly and the reason it did was because even as was go delivering the speech thinking about thanking all the people who have been working on this the images came to my mind of the people I've met through these past weeks the doctors nurses the health care workers at NTID in our hospitals in our PHP C clinics all of them working so hard and making so many sacrifices they they all look tired some look exhausted but when you talk to them they are keeping their spirits high and they are continuing to persevere and this is just in the front line but I've also met many people out this is doesn't a health care frontline but I've also met many people outside of healthcare who are also working extra hard because of the virus you have our teachers in schools they can care of our children the immigration airlines airport staff taxi drivers we've got our public officer officers doing so many things contact tracing working behind the scenes to arrange for housing so just as I was going through that part of the speech the thought and the images of all of these people came to my mind and like I said it took me by surprise to that the emotions that came and it overwhelmed me yeah that's very unusually you're quite stoic about the whole thing but you know it takes a crisis like this to seem to bring out the very best in the people and if you look at the it's also very hot warming yes you know that we have people like that out there indeed so and I think it's very heartwarming to see Singaporeans stepping forward and showing their appreciation to like that over the weekend or was it there was a concerted spontaneous effort to show up to give applause and to show appreciation to our frontline workers and and I do see more visible shows of expressions of appreciation and thanks to all our frontline workers so that's truly very heartwarming but I would say the best way the best way that we can really show pay tribute to them and show appreciation to them is for each one of us to uphold individual and social responsibility in abiding by the Advisory the guidelines that we have put out and each one of us doing our part to help slow down the spread of the virus so stay at home as much as you can avoid contact with others avoid unnecessary activities and minimize contact with people outside of your immediate family members right in other words do our part to give them as little work as possible yeah absolutely absolutely you ,True,True,True,True

The country's been reporting more than 150,000 cases a day. In January and February daily cases fell below 20,000.

So, how did India get from relative calm to its new crisis?

Workplaces, markets and malls have reopened, and transport is operating at full capacity. Big weddings, festivals and election rallies are also being held.

The result: a situation that one doctor described as a ""Covid tsunami"".

In response, the White House says it will share its stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines with the rest of the world. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

India reported a record number of Covid-19 cases for the fifth straight day on Monday while the official death toll also jumped.

Official data showed there were 352,991 new reported cases over a 24-hour period as total infection numbers crossed 17 million.

At least 2,812 people died which pushed the total death toll to over 195,000 — media reports suggest that the official death rate is likely undercounted.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has faced criticism for allowing large crowds to gather for religious festivals and election rallies in various parts of the country this year. Prior to the second wave, India had on average around 10,000 new cases daily.

But so far in April alone, the South Asian nation has reported more than 5 million new cases, sending the country’s health care system to the brink.

Hospitals have run out of beds and are turning away even critically ill patients. There is a severe oxygen supply shortage, partly due to uneven distribution across states. That has led to the deaths of many Covid-19 patients as the government scrambles to send supplies to the worst-hit states by road, rail and air.

“It has put a huge stress on the health care infrastructure, the supplies, oxygen because of the fact that the quantum of materials required has gone four times what it was in the first wave,” Naresh Trehan, chairman at Medanta hospital, told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Monday.

“We are struggling, actually, to cope with all that,” he said, adding measures are being taken to create more beds and ramp up the production of more personal protective equipment and medicines. But India’s “weak point” is the shortage in medical-grade oxygen required.

International response

The international community responded with promises to send India desperately needed aid.

The United States will send raw materials required for India to ramp up manufacturing of AstraZeneca’s vaccine locally, as well as therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators and protective equipment. It will also send a team of public health advisors to India from the Center for Disease Control and USAID.

That came after the United Kingdom, France and Germany pledged aid over the weekend. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter that the European Union is “pooling resources to respond rapidly to India’s request for assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.”

Last week China’s foreign ministry said Beijing is “in communication” with New Delhi and that it is “ready to provide support and help according to India’s need.”

Singapore state investor Temasek said on Sunday that it partnered with Air India and Amazon India to airlift medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators and ventilators from the city-state. The medical supplies were sent to the financial capital of Mumbai in Maharashtra and the eastern state of West Bengal, where cases are rising.

Big Tech firms like Microsoft and Google have also publicly pledged to help.

Local response

Corporate India has also stepped up efforts to help the country secure medical supplies to ease the strain on the health care infrastructure.

Indian media reported that billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries will produce over 700 tonnes of medical-grade oxygen per day at one of its oil refineries. It would reportedly be given to worst-hit states for free.

This specific experience is uncharted territory for every one of us. We try our best but, at times, our best is just not enough. We struggle, we cope, we overcome... at least we try. Some days, it is all good. Other days, the helplessness is frustrating. Watch our latest webinar on insights, tools and tips to deal with Covid-19 disruption.

Dr. Cherie Chan is renowned for her work as a Senior Clinical Psychologist. She is well-versed with various techniques and approaches to deal with stress, anxiety and uncertainty.",hello everyone welcome to this webinar insights and tools to cope with the covert 19 disruption my name is Neil Quartus and I'm going to be moderating I'd like to thank the organizer of this webinar which is the Singapore global network which is a division of the Economic Development Board it's a network of Singaporeans living abroad people who've previously worked or studied in Singapore and there's keen to move to Singapore you can register with the SGN I will send out those links and then you will get updates about events and also events like this I'd like to welcome dr. Shari Chan dr. chan is a clinical psychologist she's president of the Singapore Psychological Society she worked in the Singapore public health sector for six years but it's now in private practice that's enough from me dr. chan how can we deal better how can we better deal with this weird situation this weird disruption to our lives I know I think that's a question of the century right now and it will probably be for the century well thanks for coming and sharing this time with me I know this topic has been very well talked about I know that it's something that we have gone through quite a bit but it would be nice right to also think about some insights that we could have into the COBIT situation and you know why why are we feeling all these things as well so very quickly as we go through you know with this sudden lockdown or partial lockdown as they call it in Singapore you know you you have all these things come up right you know for Singaporeans yes away right you know we know who said that before you know everybody's trying to buy your favorite items on the NCC shelves you know there was a bit of a lockdown period for entertainment and the bars and entertainment industry so a lot of people went on for the last outing before the closure occurred you know and there's a lot of complaints going on around saying that we can't go anymore it's too tiring it's too hard do I hear you I'm in the same boat with you but of course for those Singaporeans that are overseas are even coming back you know they had to rush through this process I guess you guys would have a difference of set of ideas right you know it was hurry up pack you know should we go back should we know that we sell things off I've had personal friends who have been overseas and you know um various kind of maybe ministry work or even just studies and they've had to just pack up everything as quickly as they went there quickly they had to come back so it felt like it was kind of out of the world for a lot of us and I guess you know this space really is what we are feeling just like oh my god get me out of this space uh yeah so many questions that we might have you know for those who stay in in the overseas countries that you are in you know why did you stay right for those that we chose to return the Singapore why did you choose to return was it your choice you know I know many people who were forced to return you know whether by by the government or whether it was by family members were concerned for those who are split decisions especially families you know boyfriend girlfriend or even husband and wives right should we go back one wants to go back one doesn't want to go back you know and what's the decision really made for you or was it kind of made for others and I think when you think about some of these questions it leads us on it to you know what we would then feel you know upset happy you know relief you know and anything right everything could be present for us yeah yeah someone in the pre-event survey said I'm questioning my whole life's purpose as a result of this is that that's how does that come about that's instead of come on me actually yeah it is it is I mean you know a lot of us have have life centered around the idea of doing stuff so we're always doing work or we're going out right we're meeting people so with this southern closure and it was really sudden you know you had one day or two days to kind of react to it it does feel like a large part of our lives are taken away so it makes a lot of sense that you know we'll be questioning you know these deep kind of existential questions it might not be for everyone but for some of us it definitely brings a bit of a bell for us and is it a good time is it a good time to ask those questions or should you kind of Park them know ask it away there's no point in parking them you're gonna create a bit mountain of questions there kept parking them and I think that leads me on very nicely I clean you to the next slide I want about so you know if all the feelings that you have right if you feel let's say confused I'm sure all of us will raise our hands here right what's happening what's going on there's so many numbers every day what do we know or you might be feeling dead tired you know I had a rush back home right I'm living in a different time zone now I've got some friends who are working UK hours just because they come back to Singapore the company is doing UK right so they're still working UK hours that's weird you know I'm tired you know I've had people who sit there and they're really irritated of course right you know living in a small household you know not all of us have a good space for ourselves so you have crammed with five people six people I've known people who are staying in a house of eight people too much and what if you felt upset or maybe regretful I know some people will feel really upset with their choice you know they've decided to come back or they've decided to stay and then now they're regretting it and what if you know you felt all of the above well good news your normal house that tells me you're human that tells me that you're your part of the situation as well but whoa hold on right what about the other way you know is everyone feeling like that I don't think so some people actually feel surprised okay right this is something new you know it's a new day it's a new way of living I'm excited you know I want to try something different that's possible some of us might feel content I've got I've got friends who are really happy just being a bit pyjama days as they call it right just kind of lying down you know I can do my work and do an online course but you know I don't have to be out saves a lot of travel time some people are really happy you know if I especially if you're I would say more on an introverted side you know you're happy not having to meet people socially it's difficult you're like woohoo time to stay at home you know and some people if you feel really relaxed on loving and I and I want to highlight this because in some families although some are really I would say toxic in some ways there are many families who are enjoying the kind of time together especially those with young kids you know there's always this guilt right behind they're not spending enough time your kids in their growing years and this seems to be a time where a lot of people are actually able to spend time that they've always wanted with this this age group so it's not too bad and you're asking all right what about all of your births well good news again you know all these feelings that everyone is happy well good or bad news they are really valid okay so everything's of every feeling that you're having is valid let me pause here right because a lot of you will be like nah no I don't want that no no way I'm sorry you know one of the things I would have to tell you that they're really here to stay so I wish I could say get rid of these feelings you know move away from it but don't think so I've got questions coming in talk to Chen what are some strategies well I don't know it may be is it possible not what are some strategies for us to maintain a sense of normalcy during this period can you make it it will become our new normal which is interesting because my next slice about the new normal maybe I could go through that and that could possibly answer the question is that is okay okay but I will go back up one more to ask in fact uncertainty we had a ton of and certainly it's not a feeling is it it's a fact it's it's a suddenly we don't know what's gonna happen many people find that very difficult do you have thoughts about map no yeah I mean for me I think uncertainty is gonna be our new norm and to be very honest with all of us we are feeling really uncertain now because it's still very new and a very novel situation that we're in the problem with it as well as that is ever-changing all right so one day you know numbers are high the next day numbers are low one day people say it's airborne and other day they say it's not one day you have to wear masks the other day you don't have to so this causes everyone to feel really unsure and uncertain but as the cove it I suppose season goes on you know things to become clearer you know the information becomes more acceptable or palatable this uncertainty actually decreases along the way so you might still feel you know uncertain you might still feel insecure and sure but the fact of the uncertainty actually dies down so you know in Singapore they always give you numbers at the same time they are always using the same platforms to give you the space so in that sense where we get a bit of certainty and that's sometimes enough to keep us grounded if I Khaleda you mentioned introverts someone says in the chat what are some ways for extreme extroverts to cope with the situation apart from more zoom meetings people are really missing sociability contact know for sure for sure I mean one of the ways that I've I've known people do is they read aloud to go for exercise right so you're meant to go for an exercise maybe with one other person in the same household or you're meant to go alone what I've what I've had some people do is they run to their friends house or so their friends upstairs and they're like hey I was going you're on you know and then they continue running to the next place especially if you're living in the same area that's quite a nice thing to do I know you're not meant to travel out for for exercise by the best people in an area you know even if it's neighbors that you've you've not kind of talked to before maybe sitting at a distance just saying hi across across the gate you know it could be a nice way of just checking in with someone as well there are a lot of people who are doing this exercise stuff now everyone's a new runner or new cyclist so sometimes having you know in a sense running with these people but again we've safe distance images could be a way to make you feel like you're connected it was to be fair to all of us even even on zoom meetings but you don't actually feel connected so even I'm talking to you and you're hearing me it's not like we're in the same room and you feel each other's presence so the extreme extroverts are definitely going to struggle a little bit but you know it's not a lost cause do okay I've got tons more questions but let's move on and I'll work them in yeah no worries okay so what's on you normal right now we're just out just telling you guys so a new novel is you know this is a new fashion these days everyone's on a mask could be it could be a gray one a blue one a zebra how that one here it could be anything right black people people have done some like cat ones you know this is our new normal you know it could be also a new normal to just stay at home to stay safe right that's what the government is saying that's what everyone's telling everyone else to do in every country of a lockdown you want people to stay at home you do want people to keep going out even if it's just for groceries this is a new normal for parents as well you know you're trying to do well and your kids running out you know screaming away asking you for this and then and this you know you don't really have time or space to even pause right to do some of your work or Zumi things as we call it or even this maybe your kids in the background alright so this is gonna be on you known for a while and I guess all these questions will come Mountain right we blow out days you blow out nights you know we don't know the time of the day I have so many clients come in and tell me Cherie I don't know what day it is today you know I just know the dates you guys are meant to see you but I don't know what day it is you know family members become the only people that we see it's good for some people I understand it's bad for some because it could be very triggering for some of us and it's pretty boring right there's a lot of boredom this is too much to handle in terms of space and time so some of us might might have this fear of missing out when you look at videos probably zoom videos and every other videos that people always leave me to live out their lives so I've had some questions pre pre survey who's asking right my friends seem to be doing better than me everyone should be doing better than me what have videos there Instagram you know they want you to believe that they're doing better than you but you don't really know as well so it seems that everyone suddenly becoming more grateful you know everyone's have their own journals everyone's become a new artist and you run a new cyclist right everyone's trying to their hand at painting but what about me you're right am i like that you know am i really exercising more am i trying more when you look at some of these things it's like bit of a formal experience and for me maybe the real-life me is just that right now a couch potato I do is sit down you know whether it's what meetings where there's TV I just didn't sit in place you know and I guess sometimes these feelings of guilt you know shame hopelessness comes up a lot more for us as well so a lot yeah go for it I have a few questions families can we talk a bit a little bit about families because you had a slide of a family suddenly together um lots of people talked about that and um what do you do if your family relationships are not so good and and and you're suddenly together and and and it's not it's not easy yeah I know that's a very good question I think some of the clients that we've seen I've also been suffering and struggling with that so usually what I would suggest for everyone who's struggling your family is to as best as best as you can you want to be able to try to keep a physical distance so whether it's being able to stay behind the door literally right being able to stay in your room for a while being able to give yourself some time to shut off maybe it's a boundary that you want to set with some of these family members of course when I say this I know that you know if you're having this problem it is very likely that your family doesn't respect boundaries so easily as well so you want to be able to create a physical one so even if it's giving us half an hour a day to step out of the home even if it's giving yourself an hour two hours a day or as many hours as you can to stay behind your door if you have a room to yourself that would be helpful and that would be enough you know being able to play some music as you're around you know we've hit phones on sometimes give the impression that you don't want to talk to these people and and at times that could be a deterrent even if it's a face value one also yeah I would say that that's unfortunately what we can do you know when 10 times are difficult I mean reaching out to friends right would also be a helpful way you need a rent you know renting it to someone to make you feel like you're not alone that's probably what you want to target the loneliness of it I've got the opposite question here someone says can you talk about people living all alone because that's that's a quite different situation that's really that is very unusual to be on your own for weeks at a time Oh how do you deal with that hmm good question I do think that being able to stay alone has its own parks and benefits so you want to be able to create a place for yourself that is very comfortable so being alone you go to worry about other people having their own quote so you know having to give in to to design or whatever that might be so setting up a place that's really comfortable for you whether you like plants or whether you like color and putting it in the same space will be helpful I like to recommend sometimes having a kind of like a restful corner if I call it so it could be a place with your favorite pillows or cushions in your favorite books for example and every time you go to that corner it's really for relaxation it's really for just you know enjoyment maybe your favorite music with your with a favorite drink why maybe that would be my choice it was you know and also if let's say you know you have to stay alone but that's not my choice yeah you want to be able to engage in in social connections as much as you can so don't just scroll right don't just go through people's lives literally have a conversation a call with them you know literally speak to them or with a phone sometimes we've lost touch of that right and you want to play games as there's a lot of apps these days right house party is one of them but you're in the app together playing really funny stupid games with your friends you know having an online drinking session which is something that some of us have actually planned to do ourselves and yeah so it's kind of I suppose having a new new way of connecting even if it's not face-to-face at the moment great great tons of questions we should move on all right I suppose right how do we manage somebody's messy feelings so some of us are thinking let's not think about it that's not thing about it I wish I wish that too I I was always not to think about my feelings but the more we do that unfortunately the more pounds up just like a big mountain so what I would suggest right is acknowledged so it's like an ace you know a CEO right acknowledge come back to your body and just engage now what do I mean very quickly right acknowledging just means you know what what I said yeah my thoughts and feelings right now you know what am I singing anak managing really and where do you feel it in your body can you connect with it better don't just ignore it cuz it's ghosts gonna manifest into something else to be honest so you want to notice it feel it in your system you know and engage right what do you want engage with use your five senses what's around you what's going on you know if you're staying in your house all day can you just look up the window can you see what's happening outside blue sky rainy you know people walking downstairs you're walking outside you know is there a ways that you can really stay present coz when you're caught up alone sometimes are a lot of times just you tend your mind has to wonder and you start feeling whether the things are real or not so it can feel like you're in our alternate reality some especially with the lack of social connection so really staying present is one of the key ways to me that I would encourage all of us here to try but of course in this process it's gonna be you know I always say that Singaporeans tend to have a very we hand we tend to have a very I would say are very national kind of call believe about ourselves you know it's always not good enough or we're always not trying hard enough oh it's always something along the lines of criticism you know the toxic toxic parents or toxic family members you know will probably ring very much they're hit right now so one of the things that I feel would be important to acknowledge is kindness the opposite the exact opposite are being critical if you really show some form of kindness some form of compassion you know to yourself right now endemics right we tend to be more in touch of this critical feeling we tend to be more in touch of being helpless and vulnerable and what really happens after that is that you end up self blaming a lot that happens quite a bit and it's very common for all of us to do that because no one likes a B barnable and we just want to blame ourselves a lot for that so what is it that we can do right is show some kindness you know literally thank your brain for for coming up with some stuff you know telling yourself that you know this is a this is a new day or this is something that you've done for yourself today something meaningful that you did could be a helpful way of showing kindness to oh I want to come to me you had anger on the slide there and we had people said in the pre-med survey they said people having problems with anger particularly again this idea being stuck with family or it could be start with anyone but they're worried they're not managing anger well in this new situation and can you say more about that yeah so anger is gonna be so usually right anger it's like a first level feeling if I call it that you're usually not really just feeling anger that's just something beyond or below the anger that you're experiencing so it's and sometimes it could be worry it could be frustration it could be sadness but it just comes out as anger because that's the easiest way to express some of the emotions or negativity that you might be experiencing at the moment so what I would say is if you have the option option and opportunity or reflection maybe ask yourself deeper what is it that you're angry about you know what really is going on here am i angry or is there something else underneath that and when you get to know that feeling the anger subsides quite naturally to be honest but if let's say you know there's nothing underneath it that someone is really irritating you there's someone is really angering you I would say in this in this period you've got to really create a physical distance so if the person can respect your boundary you need to tell them you know I need a timeout right now we need to stop this assuming the person can respect the boundary if the person can't then you kind of have to create the boundary so it's like behind the oil give me a lot of the door just an hour either banging outside just a rights to stay in that space that's safe for you until everyone comes down and then you come out again it's probably the best way around that though we had the opposite question earlier in the chat and someone said their teenage child hitting them I don't know I'm not too seriously but but or being too physical how do you is there way how do you deal if someone's I don't know if they're angry I think it well anyway how would you deal with that with someone who's being angry towards you and possibly physically angry you know I know you're right so I think along those lines right it'll be important it also talked about families who might be experiencing some form of domestic violence in any way so a lot of the family is now stuck in the situation where you're living your perpetrator you're living with her abuser and it can be a very scary difficult time for them so although we can't get you out of the home one of the things that Singapore has been doing is they've started a national care hotline where we are accepting all these calls for help so we are we're listening in to calls that might need domestic violence kind of I would say help or support it could be someone talking on the phone with you it could be someone I suppose keeping you you want to be able to keep yourself as safe as you can if they get into a mode you know you you need your own safe space so I'll still say create a bit of a distance you might need to step up your home for a while before you come back in again yeah that's probably what I would say but there are some hotlines that you can call with in Singapore systems itself if you do face some form of domestic violence the Ministry of Social Care mainly by the men has a lot of hotlines under its care and those will be the ones to call straight away you might also involve the police zone so if let's say you're in a domestic violence situation and you can't get out of it city is a bit of concern you and then need to call the police in to help in that situation as well okay we can talk more about this at the end if people want some another question about contempt contempt other people being disrespectful contemptuous and which is very unpleasant it is it is that boils down a little bit of communication though so it might be you know being really assertive with the people in a home it could be validating them validating them and then stating your need so sometimes we people who tend to be very disrespectful it might be cutting you know conversations to to really short instructions so you don't have anything to kind of converse about it could also be just being really assertive about it so it could be you know I hear you but I I think this and I hear you but I think this and you become like a broken down recorder she goes sometimes these people need to hear a standard set of stuff before they get into the hit as well right I mean at this time I wouldn't ask people not to talk to each other given that we're already not talking enough but you know if that it gives you more safety that could be a way around it as well so you only talk about things that are I suppose things that you can if the things that you you partner you had a person seemed to disagree on maybe that's that's to be part you know you don't have to always talk about everything right now where possible working one more one more question these kind of negative issues because we were talking about kindness but someone several people have said how do we deal with the frustration of inconsiderate strangers flatmates neighbors people not following the rules etc it's very annoying how can we get them to behave better okay so I think in a moment in a more punitive way I know that we have an ad right that allows you to report individuals who are not so safe distancing that's really punitive that's one way I guess in other ways if you're staying with people who are a bit who are a little bit disrespectful or just unable to I guess support your boundaries it might be putting up proms or rules you know it could be sitting down with a collaboration with them and this is an agreement right this this is something that we need to be able to stay in this house together you know we can't do this because of certain things you know it sometimes is about education as well so we assume that everybody receives the same information in the same way but I can receive information differently from you even though it's presented in the exact same way so it could be just having a conversation about that understanding why this needs to be done understanding the links so you're literate or link a to B to C right if you do this this is the behavior this is the behavior what's the consequence and there'll be sometimes helpful when you chain it up this way for people to understand okay I've got one final question then we can go and keep talking my kindness this is so irrelevant someone says my dad is hooked on consuming news and it's kind of intrusive for the rest of us we maybe don't want 24-hour news and updates it's not what we want how can we steer his attention away from the news without risking a huge argument okay so there's a couple of ways around this I mean if you can be boundary with him he needs to be able to hear why you don't want to hear the news so a lot of us when we converse we just say I don't want to do it I don't want to hear it you know and we just leave it as that or we might just say yeah because I don't feel like it but it's not true right that there's something beyond that and maybe this person is to understand what's beyond that before before they are able to I guess a seat that's one way that's a nice way I suppose another way would be you know it could also be whenever he speaks up on the news you just give him like like a like a ignore you know you ain't know it's almost like no response you may just go but it's everything's flat well he talks about something else you you really go in for it Odette tell me more you know tell me more about that I want to know more about that and that's another way around that so the Assumption here is that if that wants to connect with you because he maybe once attention on you feels like that's the only way to get your attention then you switch it up don't give him attention when he talks about the news give him a lot more attention and we talk about something else that could be like a dog he's training me you're training training and sorry we were talked about kindness let's carry on but thank you so much these really interesting questions by the way yeah there's good questions though I'm enjoying it um yeah so I guess it's in the whole process of what I'm saying you also want to be kind to yourself because sometimes you're not gonna do the kindness of things you might feel really guilty like so even even in my suggestion right with you know training the attention of one of your family members you might feel like you're doing something wrong but you know is that is that something that you could appreciate that you're doing for yourself because we are very good right in Singapore to do things for everyone else we are very collective as a society but we sometimes don't do things for ourselves that much sometimes so you know maybe for us on in this piece of crazy crazy times these are the four things I'm thinking about that could be something that we could think about you know in in in this situation which sucks you know whether you're a US UK Singapore wherever right in this situation that sucks what are some small moments that we could still appreciate in the day right what was that something that we still did that we could appreciate for ourselves you know as couples you know you might have coral the whole day but is that something that you did in the day that you could appreciate as a shared experience or shared moment you guys cook together you know there's someone make coffee for each other you know as a family even though you hate each other sometimes when I steal moments where you could enjoy the peace so it could be you know someone's watching TV someone's on the phone someone's just sitting in a dining table but was there just a couple moments of peace then you could just enjoy before you know the chaos happen again and if you're single right if you're staying on your own could you try something new could you try something different so I've asked a lot of people it's also think about you know hey right in this situation if there's something new that I wanted to try there's something meaningful that I've always wanted to try but we always didn't have the time well we have a lot of time now and that's probably something that you know we could try it now and the good news is that no one's gonna see it anyway so that could be one thing so maybe so kind of round that part up right I guess the question really is how can we do all of these how can we do all of these even as we experience a sadness the frustration the guilt the anger that we are also gonna experience in other times of all day and I think that's really important because we it's not about just because I appreciate my small moments I will never feel angry I'll never feel upset I'm never gonna feel frustrated you are and they're gonna be here to stay and that's okay gives us human you know so maybe just along those lines and I'll finish this time for take some more questions yeah some cool things are trying letter-writing right we've long forgotten that but good news for me is that you know I never I go on trips I still write postcards to some of my friends so my friends you'll receive postcards from me when I'm on a trip given I'm not on a trip now I could still do the same thing I can still send postcards to each other one of the interesting ways to connect is where the person receives the letter receives the post I can have a call with each other you know it's almost you're you're you're connecting in that in a different way one of the other things they did was music right so you've seen so many zoom videos you know a whole choir has sang together or a whole Orchestra has played together I think that's fun that's something interesting to be able to do you know Sam flowers I just did that the other day as well right just send flowers or someone is always nice to receive a surprise during this time because it's nice to know that people still care and people so remember you even when were alone I had we had lots of questions about environment have you got any tips because some people just were so frustrated that they were trying to work for instance or study and they couldn't they just couldn't find a good place to study you've got magic space out of nowhere what do you do if you're finding really just practically difficult to do the things you want to do yeah I mean I think in this case it would be a two different thing so so one part of it we want to be able to to notice right some of the emotions that come up for ourselves so a lot of the frustration and anger that we may experience you want to be able to notice that and kind of kind of diffuse from it but I say diffuse I mean kind of take a step away from some of those emotions because a lot of times it's not it's not the emotions that are the problem is because you've is the relationship that you have with these emotions so you kind of don't want these emotions to be there or you don't want a few this way that's why you get even more frustrated and even more angry with yourself and not be able to get the work done so I would say emotionally first you want to like what we talked about earlier you wanna ace it you wanna acknowledge it you know make some room for it know that you're gonna feel it it's okay it is a moment of frustration that's one part of it so you don't feel so intensely and then practically you're right you want to be able to I suppose create a good space for yourself so where you can write always go to the same place it could be the same table it could be the same corner you know you could you could always use the same I've asked people to use the same pen before you know use the same watch before to make it really more consistent and comfortable for them I've asked people to kind of wear the same hoodie before you know so it let's say there's space that if you really worry to use the same kind of hoodie to keep them close getting comfortable it could be it could be a little bit of a blanket to wrap themselves up with that's one of the ways that I would sometimes make it more practical for you to you know I suppose find a place that could be yours of course right if let's say you have your room if you it would be nice to bring the nature from outside in so sometimes it's about having a view if you don't have a view create the view so putting a plan there you know it's about putting something that you like in front of you so that everything you feel that frustration all you know there's no space you can look at some of these things I feel a bit comma before refocusing that on what's important again okay I've got some questions about routine hmm in the pre-med survey someone said I hear I feel like I'm supposed to have a routine but I just cannot create one can I give the day structure do you have any tips well I think the question would also be are you a routine person cuz if you're not and that wouldn't work with you you know but I would say have a boundary so if you can't do routines it's okay that's just no problem in it but I would say have a time boundary for yourself so maybe it could be you know two hours of doing this right now I could with three three hours of doing something else right now so it doesn't always have to be worked first and play it could be play and then work and then play and then work work and more play you know so it could be anything so sometimes routines make it feel very rigid is that you have to do work in the day and then play a night for example I just want you you can just do it the other way all right and let's go by our if if you know having eight hours is too long cut it short just do something in the next hour do something the next half an hour again I've got a question the opposite question in the chat some people say how do you avoid the boredom they want to shake up their routine because the boredom of doing the same things every day you know bedroom coffee whatever work same go round and round and that's just out driving some people crazy I know it does um I think whatever you're doing or whatever these people are doing are correct so you want I suppose play around with your with the day so if today you start off with work maybe tomorrow if I start off with a TV show you know you wanna you wanna put in different things in a day sometimes to break up some of that that work boredom or even that you know the game that you're playing cause it can be playing a game your whole day as well or it can be watching that fix the whole day so what I like people what I'd like to suggest sometimes is having a personal project a Yankee coming back - I've had some people kill time by puzzles house is a big one right now everyone has a puzzle the more pieces the better the longer it takes you know but it's always just something that you want to do bit by bit - a personal project so for some people is a puzzle for some people it could be a painting for some people it could be just reading through their favorite book but just having I will say a goal to get to day on day that could be helping kicking the bottom a little bit I would say take a chance it was a step out you know where you can write you know mask on but take a chance to stack up maybe just walking around your house and then going back home you know it could be something as simple as that because to be fair it is really really hard to stay in your house for walls all the time and I wouldn't want to recommend that as well as much as I can so we've got some questions about work but I think we're going to cover that in the presentations and maybe we should we should go to that and then I'll ask those work questions yeah so actually the next slide is about work so I think for some of us here Oh before that I would I wanted us to think about it this way right let's call  you know it's it's so hot everyone sees have their own rules and instructions even me right I'm giving you some rules and or some sort of advice now but it could be all you know seriously and that's okay right if you don't think that everybody's great it's fine because you're doing the best you can you know I can only do so much in terms of what we say but really you're doing the best that you can and you don't have to follow another set of rules another set of guidelines there's really no a style we are getting through this pandemic and throughout this whole process I would encourage everyone to just for yourselves kindly you know if you're if you're only avoidable two hours a day compared to eight hours before just hold yourself kindly that's okay if you're not able to kinda have a good relationship in mom because mom is just so difficult again whole yourself Kylie right that's also okay quick before we move to work someone just asked this question I'm very curious what you're gonna say how would you deal with social media consumption is that a positive way to connect with people or or maybe using it too much do you have thoughts about how healthy that is what appearances yeah I guess it depends on what you're using social media for so if let's say you're kind of using social media for the news you know and that's your one way of news cause for me I don't I don't have a I don't have newspaper subscriptions so literally all my news comes from Facebook so I use Facebook a lot for news rather than just for conversation or friends so I think that's I support that's okay even if you're using social media a lot to converse your friends and just to connect I think that's fine as well I wouldn't say that so I wouldn't say that is a really I would say a tip of the balance unless you're all you're doing is social media and and because of that you're ending up having to have a lot of negative thoughts about yourself or a lot of comparisons on yourself you know or feeling like the whole wall is having fun except you then that would be a problem I think the question exactly said this social media comparison okay perhaps but your what you just said yeah are the people doing better son man yeah so I think again right if you feel like social media and you're seeing everyone whole was doing better just remember what social media is as well it never really says the real thing it always talks about what I want to show you so it's kind of like you know I'm gonna show you my best face you know the ones no one's really gonna show you all that all the other moments are heavy inside so for example right Instagram is going to capture that one square but you know this isn't another 24 hours or 23 hours in the day that could have been really messy and at once there was the best moment and that's all they've taken so it really is about that too and even if you do feel that people are genuinely having fun and you're not again for yourself kindly it's okay you don't have to have fun I can tell you I'm not having fun I have fun sometimes but not all the time okay okay so if you're working from home I was just thinking that you know I could cover very few or very quick tips on what it would be like to work from home being comfortable so you know to keep ourselves on track we need to tell people what we're gonna do if we don't tell people anything we're not gonna do it so you wanna be accountable right tell someone make someone you know check in on you keep each other accountable it could also be you know protecting what hours so a lot of times right because your work from home suddenly your what hour stretch you know I can't go out to seven eight ten emo comes in you know no problems I can I can read it just you want to hold itself back you know don't go straight into jumping into heavy to reply your emails if you can't give and really be protected about it I think one other things you want to reward is so so we we also don't do this often enough we kind of think that that's that's our role that's what we need to do by rewarding yourself through small mouth loans can be helpful to keep you on track as well as well yeah so many questions just on these things how do you cope with a boss that wants to zoom call with you every day and micromanage suddenly try and micromanage your oh I'm so sorry trying to micromanage you how do you do with it Ahava is not working I mean yeah but more generally someone else's boundaries with colleagues you know if they know where you are but they know you're at home you're sitting with you your computers right there and people under pressure perhaps to just let work cover everything yeah so I think having unlike my second point on a slide I think having a protector always really important so if you can't respond in the next hour or if you kind of really want that space and time to have the hour to yourself I think you can I mean I think all of us needs to actually we need to do this more kind of say in a hey right in the next two hours and I gotta be busy with something I'm not gonna have my phone by my side it'll give me that space and I'll come back after that so usually what people are afraid of is that if you don't do it now you would do it you won't do it further but when you give us an opportunity right to be able to tell them that you'll come back after certain amount of time it's easier for people to accept that so there could be a way when you communicate you know that you need the time when you need the space so how do i how do I convince my boss to take a break be really slow in your responses to him so that he has no choice but to wait for you and take a break in the meantime it'll be hard if we had I mean I don't think you can convince someone else to do something for you but I do think that you can you can shape the way you want to respond to him so you know it may be that you tell him like what I said have a boundary about it or it could be that you purposefully take a little bit longer to respond so that you can then have a bit of breathing space as well I think that's what you can do so you can shape your own behavior and hopefully in your shaping our behavior your shaping his behavior as well but you can't really change what he chooses to do eventually though that's outside your circle of influence and some people just one more question about work maybe some people worried no you carry on I'll come back to this I'll come back to my own question okay I want to know is a highlight one more thing though so I think some of you have raised questions about communication and just kind of how are we gonna engage because you know a lot of times we talk about clear communication but what does that really mean sometimes so especially when it comes a couple's you know you listen to me what are you really saying remember your bosses and all that right it's not what I hear can you stop and we get a lot of fights or disagreements so one of the things that I like to to do in these three steps really it's about being validating so validating doesn't mean agreeing validating really just means you're hearing the person so sometimes it's about saying you know I hear you I know what you're saying you know and that person just kind of pauses for a moment as well and you also want to be open right with what you're hearing so don't be so quick to jump in and cut them off or say no and I want to say my point we we have a lot of time for that right now hope to be able to do that especially if you're famous in place right so pause you know battle it hear each other out and then state what you need so the last part we're not very good at we're not very clear with what we need sometimes sometimes we don't even know what we the irony what is it in right now what is it you need for your partner right now what is it a unique from your friends right now I'd be able to state that so that people can kind of meet those needs you could help with communication I think so when is it you know so people ask her when is it too much you know do I have to wait too it's too much before I see someone or seek some help so my answer to that really is it never needs to be too much you don't need to wait to a point when you're kind of dying or you're feeling like you can't handle things anymore before you kind of ask for help you don't have to wait to your ostracize or you know you're you're to the point of no return that's a bit too late right so you want to give yourself a chance to be to notice some of these factors as well so a lot of the clients recently also brought up a lot worries more more worrying maybe more panic attacks most more sleep problems it's a little restlessness right it's a lot of feelings of helplessness and lost generally so when you do feel some of these things you want to be able to just kind of ask for help and you might be asking me you know how where what do I do the good news is that for Singapore or at least people in Singapore the Singapore Psychological Society has pro bono a reduced rate services up on our website you know we have a lot of clinicians or stepped up to Parliament at a time and you can make use of the the clinicians on the list to be able to get your help that you need so some people that coders have have used like telephone calls so just phone calls check in some people have preferred email responses some people have a put face to face in terms of online kind of therapy as well and that's all available with the therapist on board if therapy is not ready for you you don't really think you want it you know it's weird there's all sort of resource page for tips you know I'm managing anxiety whatever I'm talking about right now but all the work from home so what I raised with just three points but there's a whole article resource that we've written about that too so you can go onto the SPS website to find some of these resources you know if you know Singapore like I said there's a national hotline has been raised you can use that it's a 24/7 hotline webinars right like this and the next one that's coming up right you know three webinars also from the American Psychological Association there's a lot there's free stuff out there that the psychology associations are giving out so for you if you're overseas right now check in with your psyche associations you some schools are also offering free courses that however you know I know it's offering free courses for people just interesting stuff you know that you could try I suppose personally I've also liked the use of an app so that's one app that I'm currently on right now 29k no I'm not getting any money for promoting it unfortunately but it's in line right it's in line with what I'm talking about so this caused us on managing anxiety stress you know there's also causes on on the app that allows you to do some meditation relaxation kind of strategies I quite like it so yeah just showing it up to you guys as well great dr. Challa I think actually I'm gonna let you finish the presentation and then we're gonna save questions till the end because I just wanted to defend maybe five five eight minutes at the end but why don't you finish up and then we'll do questions together okay so I think I wanted to actually yes there's a couple of things I wanted to end off on so what are the major things I wanted to talk about is what if right what if I stay with someone with mental health issues so we've talked a lot about what if you have mental issues in in this period of time but what if you're already living with someone that might have meant our issue so we've got people who have talked about you know my mom is has autism my mom has dementia maybe oh my child has autism maybe my partner has depression maybe so what what can can we do take care of yourself us now this sounds very selfish but know right if you're not there if your mind goes you know goes out of whack as well you're not gonna be there to take care of these people who really need you especially during this very difficult time so you want to be able to take care of yourself as with some of the tips that we've raised earlier and all the resources that you have out there there's just so much you know I didn't want to give you more because it's just so much and you can just use your own ways of coping that you're already doing as well it doesn't have to be anything different but take care of yourself first validate so you want to be able to validate your partner validate you know yourself you know knowing that this is tough this is difficult you know be kind to yourself in that way and learn the symptoms right so let's say we mom have dementia you know she might be forgetful or not she might she will be forgetful Ward you know she will be really difficult you know understand these are the symptoms of the problem it's not directed at you it's not personal don't take it personally as much as you can talk it out rent it out you know again right this is where the that assertiveness comes in right tell your friends hey I really need this space right now I'm living with someone that's difficult please help me out here you know I really need to talk to some of you guys it could also be helping people understand what you really need so being able to express that better maybe having a time table your family as well so it's important to set boundaries where are the kids you know this is kids time or this is mommy time what is it anytime you know this is time that you guys have to go on your own or this is time for school that's one way around that too yeah and this is what I talked about earlier the physical distance I do think that this is very important so if you're living with somebody mental health issues you need to give yourself a bit of physical distance and space again right as much as you can so if you have someone that can help manage the child in some way let's see that's what you need you know it allowed that you know maybe we relinquish some of the control that you might have as well let's say your partner has depression or you know someone that's really in need validating a person and also asking for some space it could be 20 minutes just the timeout for yourself that would probably be what we can do right now in this very difficult time or you know one of the things that you could do is also seek therapy right so it could be seeking therapy for your partner but as an online service or even for yourself where you have that time as your own me time yeah okay so as I just finished off maybe generally I think I want to be able to leave you guys with three things so if you forget everything that's it today that's fine but remember three things okay just three things that simple right let's let's really work together on being able to connect so connect in all the ways that we talked about even through this webinar right tonight can I be the friends check every people you've not checked in in a while you know everybody would be will be appreciative I'm just in remember at this time so connect the next thing those contribute right so contribute effectively so don't throw water out and throw what you put water back in into your boat right so contribute how can you contribute many ways you can volunteer for certain things you know you're either able to still I suppose create resources for people around you that's one way to do it if you can contribute in terms of your I recently right we had a solidarity budget come out be a sectional $1 given to people people start contributing the amount people in need that's also one way of contributing even and during this time to help keep yourself meaningful and useful if you know contributing at work if you're still working yeah that's one one way to doing it and of course lastly write care that's all care you know care for yourself care for others right it's a typical time you know don't expect it to be any different right it's tough it's hot I kind of spent myself to feel on the top of my game the whole day as well so care care for yourself care for others give yourself breaks as you can yeah and stay safe everyone you know just stay sick thank you so much that's chant that has been so insightful and useful I have got a ton of questions now if you had a burning question please ask again but here's this one just came in lots of people on the call are students and I'll just read it out I'm graduating early next year and I can't help feeling the sense of dread and hopelessness because obviously prospects are not perhaps gonna be anything like they were going to be for students have you got any yeah what can they do cuz that's a tricky situation yeah I suppose so I don't know actually I mean to be honest I think I know that the certain sectors in the government that with the recent budget as well as other sectors that they've raised job opportunities if I'm it could be you know in health care or it could be in some for teaching for example where they've we've decreed it quite a lot of jobs for this purpose so there could be one way to look at it another way would be you know maybe giving us an opportunity to do interns instead of work straight away because if you're kind of looking for direct work which I know all of us want to and it's difficult I think giving us all options maybe it's an internship to start or maybe it's a volunteering thing to start you know and then building building your network again there could be one way of doing it it could also you just you know maybe being being a bit more entrepreneurial it could be you know because of the situation starting your own side business in some way you know it could be something that you you you buy and sell it could be something that you're baking forward to sell something like that you know it I guess you want to be able to expand your options even if it's a difficult time and not be so traditional about the one way of doing things okay so we talked a lot about about self care someone said I'm worried main concern is family members back in Singapore I'm staying in the UK for work I would appreciate some tips how to manage this anxiety that people you want to help but you you feel you can't help because you are just not there yeah I think giving them the resources would be helpful so if there are there are family members who might make use of some of these resources it could be quite helpful so even if they're older individuals let's say who don't do therapy and all that stuff hotlines I agree so all our hotlines right now on most of our hotlines right now are 24 24/7 if they're not they're also on throughout the day weekly right so having check-ins with your family service centers you know could be helpful just as some of the calling to say hi how are you doing that could be one way of doing it or even a national or even you know having our government agencies take care of some of the elderly for example they do do regular check-ins in terms of calls as well so calling might be helpful or even you right if you're saying overseas and you want to be able to do something back home for them maybe just about that check-in you doing that check-in and just getting in touch and staying in touch with them at a certain time you know so that there's always something that they can look forward to even though they might be really anxious you're able to kind of reassure them that this is still consistent for them giving them sample of my sister's you might help okay I'm gonna go from parents to children some people to questions some people are very worried she'll turn is spending their entire life now on the screen Netflix games how bad is that should people just say it's a crazy time you knock yourself out eight hours of Netflix a day yeah to say Oh again and you're gonna have realistically you want to be able to let go a little that conscious well it's you need the time to you know there's no that's not a pass-through about that of course if we had an option you know screen time will be cut short but because of all the online learning as well we are unfortunately on our screens quite a bit I was it if you could write if it is an option for some of us being able to target some games okay you know could be ball games alright it could be you know card games it could be things like that where you didn't really have to then be on the screen but it could still have family time together I think that would be a nice option I've seen families go out on like cycling trip so anyway first of all I know we do it one but doing something like that could also be helpful to get them off the screen but to be honest I think you do want to be too harsh on yourself if in the event that's all you can do right now again hold yourself kindly right that's if that's the best you can do that's the best you can do no rules are all that another question but about children exams around the world have been canceled summer exams someone said my children is just so disappointed you know this they work towards this for years and years and it's all gone and and I don't know the meaning it's a meaning issue their life has been about a goal and it's just gone how do we help them well it's interesting right so I know the IB programs have been ibeacon ideas have been canceled the a levels have been tweaked you know some of the exams for the master students I saw have been tweaked to an online one I think I want to understand all you want to help your kids understand that it's not well studying is not just about exams it shouldn't it should not be although it really it really makes itself out to be sometimes right but studying is really for learning right it's for it's about being curious about knowledge so it maybe it's about helping your kids understand that yes it is disappointing you know yes when we might not be able to showcase what we've learned over the years but honestly it's not a waste you know these are some knowledge that you've gained for yourself and it could be interesting if you could create some form of experiments that might help you put that knowledge apply their knowledge into a kind of real-life kind of games or real-life kind of fun I think that would be that would make more meaning of the knowledge that we learn rather than just kind of you know taking exams and and scoring for if I call it that yeah but it is difficult though III know I mean we're all part of this system as well so ok I've got two minutes I'm going to take two Christians and well okay I'll it's a relevant question how do we deal with grief and loss some some people are losing loved ones oh yeah so there's a test in psychology we always be notice as stages of grief right so you go from a feeling of loss sadness and able to denial then you accept it and you get angry you know you deny again so I would say just go back to my my idea of of acing your emotions right just acknowledge it you know it's gonna be a tough time yeah it's we're not gonna have the the funerals that we know that we have we've come to know right it could be a very different situation ever in but acknowledge that the that you will feel upset acknowledge that you will feel the sense of loss you know and maybe remember the person in a different way like gift some moment or try to celebrate the person's life in in your way that's meaningful for you I think a shift of that perspective might be helpful as compared to just focusing on the loss or the emptiness that the person the person's death or passing or maybe the separation might have brought a strong I think we're gonna have to stop there I think we should stop there I'm gonna say thank you so much dr. chan I would like to remind people to register people are saying wonderful sharing so useful tips thank you very much thank you for the great questions please register on the sgn website we will send out that link later you can download I didn't mention this you can download this presentation if you like from the handouts tab we will also email it out I would like to say that there is another webinar we are going to have another webinar on the 2nd of May so please log in again for that and yes I just like to thank the Singapore global network and in particular dr. Shari Chan for these you know really incredible insights it's been a really educational 60 minutes thank you so much see you soon everybody ,True,False,False,False

The Disabled Peoples Association of Singapore (DPA) organised its first sexuality workshop with speaker Martha Tara Lee, a clinical sexologist from Eros Coaching, in 2019 as part of their Di-Sex programme. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted their plans for subsequent sessions, but they plan to resume the programme in 2021.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",she was about ten years old she worked with her hands and her private paw she were trying to put things in a private heart shaking herself and I was like what's she doing espere we always focus on whether they can go to school so whether they can take care of their own daily living skills I never thought that sexuality is one issue that I have to endure [Music] I have three children all girls the first two are self twins currently 18 they have severe autism they will behave like someone that is probably one two years old [Music] my outdoor and stuff at first I realized that like it seems that she is trying to get some importance you cannot get this ghetto fast rate that they should cry and it was a nobody nobody's call you why are you crying [Music] I realize that is not effective because of her traits that if she wants she wants the more we go to her in fact her emotion just just she just met down with people with mental disability they may not understand what is going on but they may still feel the desires to have sex as they come into puberty they find ourselves getting horny most requests every day every day can be a few hours eventually she also does it in the school [Music] [Music] in schools they were trying to restrict my daughter because they can't give her past I think I'll keep her occupied so that she wouldn't think too much about the whole family go out shopping center and then you know sit down read she start to touch her pirate parts so we were trying to school her and then try to cover up and they've quickly bring her home mama we will not feel that when they go out until months later then a younger one starts about 1 year later [Music] I just bought her normal booster why she do it I travel both eyes AHA also I meant a blonde yeah as a nation we are very very shy to talk about such thing even to my husband also feels very I said my only saw her resolution is to give them the space to do what they want so when they are outside we will try to distract them [Music] I realized that we have to do something about them but I have no solution if you have no solution that we charketa sila desire a lot of time electric icing with the promotion at 18 right supposed to be at that stage that know you need a lot of emotional anxiety like a typical image at this spirit would be probably having about the relationship the kinetic so should i don't have much on trying to fill up and get for her and giving her more specific kind of encouragement which i don't do that much honestly when I used to rely strictly with my children and tapas and then okay I want this thing to be done so it has to be done but we didn't do that and we shouldn't have now I am more relaxed so every day I come I come let's have a half the people is kind of emotional assured I think one of the misconceptions is because we don't see representations of people with disability in popular media we just assume people with disability don't think about sex they don't have sexual needs they don't have sexual desires we opened it up to about 20 slots but I think we had about 50 parents before we had to close registration entirely [Music] when I start to share I realized the other pair of this model sharing okay so they also share in that way we start to understand also it's not only my family has this problem it's actually a quite common thing it's just how severe or how Wow it can be so the actually give some comfort was also not just about what I was teaching it was more like giving them an opportunity to meet each other to feel the support and also to ask questions that they didn't know who to ask [Music] for many years I'm also shy to talk about it and I find that it's not getting us anywhere this particular topic is very sensitive even to typical child typical adult but this is human I hope that there will be more kind of discussion group with experts and then you will empower parents that faces serious issue in this area to openly discuss you [Music] ,True,True,False,False

In a rare moment of emotion, Minister Chen Shih-chung cried as he announced Taiwan''s 11th case of the coronavirus. This 11th case is a Taiwanese man who had been stranded in Wuhan for weeks. Chen said doctors would do everything they could to save the patient. Chen Shih-chungCentral Epidemic Command CenterAll of us – upon receiving the result, we were so dismayed. But after all, that was the main point of bringing them back.Late Tuesday, Taiwan announced its 11th case of coronavirus. The head of the Central Epidemic Command Center appeared in low spirits. He pleaded for overworked medical professionals to muster the energy needed to save the patient. Chen Shih-chungCentral Epidemic Command CenterWe wanted to prevent patients from having to stay in Wuhan, where the health care situation is not as good and where they’re very likely to lose their precious lives. We want our medical community to do its utmost to help.While speaking, Chen choked up and fought back tears, before wiping them with a tissue given to him. His distress met a flood of encouraging comments from those watching on the livestream. A flight carrying 247 Taiwanese from Wuhan had arrived at 11:40 Monday night. Chen had pulled on protective clothing and a mask to meet them at the airport and oversee their transit to quarantine. At 6 a.m. he ran an inspection of a quarantine center in Central Taiwan, before taking questions at two press conferences, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. Late Tuesday evening, he announced the latest confirmed case at a third news conference. All told, the minister had been on duty for at least 24 hours straight.Chen Shih-chungCentral Epidemic Command CenterI am sorry for losing control of my emotions. It is just that we feel all of us did everything in our power.When speaking about the latest coronavirus case, the minister broke down twice, and he praised his personnel for their tireless work. Taiwanese internet users have responded with sympathy. On the health ministry’s social media page, comments of support have poured in for the minister.One internet user photoshopped pajamas on Chen’s image and launched a social media campaign, where commenters reminded the minister to get some sleep. Chen Shih-chung (2017.2.8)Central Epidemic Command CenterI’m stepping into the role of minister with caution and trepidation. I am taking the baton from Minister Lin, and so his policies will continue and we will strive for stability with our personnel. Chen, who took office in February 2017, is known for an unassuming nature that’s given him the nickname “Silent Minister.” A dentist by training, he was questioned about his ability to lead the health ministry and its annual budget of NT$700 billion. Over the years, he’s proven himself in a post with a notoriously low retention rate. Chen has now surpassed Chiang Been-huang to become Taiwan’s longest-serving health minister in history.Chen Shih-chung (2017.2.8)Central Epidemic Command CenterI would rather die in a fight than due to depression. It is my hope that when I step down, I step down without regrets.Amid China’s coronavirus outbreak, Chen has been hailed for rising to the moment and for selfless leadership in a time of crisis.",taiwan's health minister made headlines when he broke down in tears tuesday night over to coronavirus outbreak in a rare moment of emotion Minister Chen Zhong cried as he announced Taiwan's 11th case of the corona virus this 11th case is a Taiwanese man who had been stranded in Wuhan for weeks chance that doctors would do everything they could to save the patient all of us upon receiving the result we were so dismayed but after all that was the main point of bringing them back late Tuesday Taiwan announced its 11th case of corona virus the head of the central epidemic command center appeared in low spirits he pleaded for overworked medical professionals to muster the energy needed to save the patient we wanted to prevent patients from having to stay in ohan where the healthcare situation is not as good and where they're very likely to lose their precious lives we want our medical community to do its utmost to help while speaking Chen choked up and fought back tears before wiping them with a tissue given to him his distress made a flood of encouraging comments from those watching on the livestream so muhammad' idea a flight carrying 247 Taiwanese from ohon had arrived at 11:40 Monday night Chen had pulled on protective clothing and a mask to meet them at the airport and oversee the transit to quarantine at 6 a.m. he ran an inspection of a quarantine Center in central Taiwan before taking questions at two press conferences one in the morning and one in the afternoon late Tuesday evening he announced the latest confirmed case at a third news conference all told the minister had been on duty for at least 24 hours straight I am sorry for losing control of my emotions it is just that we all feel that all of us did everything in our power when speaking about the latest coronavirus case the minister broke down twice and he praised his personnel for the tireless work Taiwanese Internet users have responded with sympathy on the Health Ministry social media page comments of support have poured in for the minister one Internet user Photoshop pajamas on Chen's image and launched a social media campaign where comment has reminded the minister to get some now our visor Jason come to the chin chin sometime I'm stepping into the role of Minister with caution and trepidation I am taking the baton from Minister Lin and so his policies will continue and we will strive for stability with our personnel Chen who took office in February 2017 is known for an unassuming nature that's given him the nickname silent minister a dentist by training he was questioned about his ability to lead the Health Ministry and its annual budget of 700 billion and tea over the years has proven himself in a post with a notoriously low retention rate Chen has now surpassed jumping Huang to become Taiwan's longest-serving health minister in history in song I would rather die in a fight than due to depression it is my hope that when I stepped down I stepped down without regrets amid China's coronavirus outbreak Chen has been hailed for rising to the moment and for selfless leadership in a time of crisis ,True,False,True,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",on may 19th singapore started rolling out his covet 19 vaccination program to those under the age of 45. by the end of the year every eligible citizen and resident will be able to get vaccinated but these recent reports have made many of us question how effective the vaccines really are the patient had been fully vaccinated since early march but he tested positive three days ago in routine testing the 11 additional cases are linked to the first case at tantop singh hospital a fully vaccinated nurse i'm getting my first shot in a few days and i'm giving you an insight into my vaccination journey i'll be keeping tabs on how the jabs affect me and finding out all you need to know about the efficacy of the vaccines i'm here at the bonavista community club for the first dose of my coveted 19 vaccine to be honest i am very very nervous because i've heard so much about the possible side effects but i'm going to do this so come along before my shot i'm asked to declare any known allergies if i'm on certain medications and whether i've had a fever in the past 24 hours i'll be getting a dose of the moderna vaccine are you reading yeah on a count of three one two and three breathing without breaking it down very good it went in but it's not quite over yet immediately after the jab i'm ushered to a waiting area where i'm told i'll have to be observed for half an hour in case of severe allergic reactions that wasn't too bad when the needle first went in i have to say it was a little bit painful but i am so glad that so far it's been less than five minutes i don't have seemingly any severe reactions but i do want to know what to expect and i know that there's a doctor on site so i'm going to try and speak to him hi doc hey how do you have a quick chat for sure yeah yeah so what kind of symptoms are you monitoring for during this first half hour so for this 30 minutes um it has been recommended that we look for all the possible allergies that can happen after vaccination that can range from you know the scattered rash the occasional rash swelling of the eyelids and also the severe ones like breathlessness and shock that we call anaphylaxis have you had to attend to anyone so far well for the severe allergic reactions unfortunately zero no but we do see the occasional rash and sometimes swelling of the eyelids or even lips so what causes allergic reactions in both the pfizer bioentech and moderna vaccines one ingredient could be the main culprit polyethylene glycol it's a compound that helps to stabilize the vaccines it's commonly used in drugs and cosmetics and has been known to trigger allergies in some people so far so good for those of us being held for observation but we've been told to expect side effects like muscle aches fever and fatigue even after we go home okay so i've got the appointment card for my second job in 28 days as of now okay i should have done that but there was a bit of an ap feeling but i still feel good but i think i should take anything for granted i'm gonna head home and restart so far more than 1.2 million people here have been fully vaccinated vaccines work by giving your immune system a preview of a virus so it can learn how to fight it before encountering it there are a few ways to do this the two vaccines approved for use in singapore developed by pfizer bioentec and moderna both use what's called mrna technology here's how it works the coronavirus has a spike protein on its surface which enables it to enter our cells and infect us mrna vaccines carry instructions on how to make this protein which is harmless without the attached virus once injected into our body our cells start pumping out these proteins triggering our immune system which learns how to identify and eliminate these foreign invaders our immune system then stores the cells as part of its memory which it can rapidly recall to fight off the virus if we are ever infected by it with both the pfizer bio and tech and modern vaccines offered in singapore i want to know if one is better than the other so i've arranged to speak to professor wein young the co-developer of a covet 19 vaccine that is currently undergoing clinical trials my friends keep saying which vaccine should i choose what are the real differences between the two vaccines essentially there's not much difference efficacy of both vaccine is about the same it's about 95 the fisa vaccine is two doses 21 days apart the modern vaccine also requires two doses 28 days apart the main difference is that the dose of the two vaccines are different so pfizer is 30 micrograms a modena is 100 micrograms so i took a modern vaccine does that mean that it is three times more potent than the fisa vaccine no yeah it does not the difference in the dose is a very practical issue because they had to make a guesswork as to where the sweet spot for the dose of the vaccine is going to be pfizer narrow it down to 30 more than it narrowed down to a hundred i think in reality it's somewhere in between so what explains the gap between pfizer and modern the 21 days and the 28 days and does it matter it doesn't matter by and large the rule of thumb is that about a month apart is about right if you stretch it out a bit more in terms of the effect to of the vaccination it actually could be even better because you're giving the immune system time to learn the problem though is that people tend to forget to come back if you stretch it out what about side effects then does it mean that if it's a higher dosage you are going to get more side effects it does look that way at least in the phase three trial data where especially on a second dose the reaction to the side effects like tiredness the rate of fever and all that appears to be more common in the modern vaccine compared to the physical vaccine but we cannot be sure that it's entirely due to those what causes side effects to begin with is our immune response to the vaccine the side effects is in some way a good sign that your immune system is reacting to the vaccine right but for those who did not experience any side effects the data is showing that you are still getting a good immune response for a couple of hours last night i didn't feel anything that was unusual so i thought i got lucky and then four hours later wham the soreness set in in the upper arm area near the injection site it got uncomfortable enough that i lost some sleep in the middle of the night but otherwise this morning i was able to get up go to work no problem my arm i still can't lift something heavy but other than that no side effects i'm not the only one experiencing some discomfort after the first dose it has been 12 hours since i got my first dose of visor at 8 30 am this morning the left arm feels a little sore right here it feels like after a baby workout kind of muscle soreness and in the afternoon i felt a little tired so i took a nap after my first dose i experienced muscle aids on my left arm chills and the body for about two days for the first dosage three days basically i have muscle ache fever as of april about 20 percent of the population had received the full dose of the covet 19 vaccine but still community cases have been on the right and some of them are fully vaccinated how effective are our vaccines now what we're seeing are actually mutants mutants which are quite different from the original strand i've discovered that the side effects many of us experience from the covet 19 vaccine such as body eggs and fatigue are actually normal immune system responses and therefore nothing to worry about but some people say they experienced severe allergic reactions that landed them in the hospital this man posted a video of his soul and palm which he says lasted for 10 days after the vaccine while this person claims to have broken out in hives for a week after the jab doctors told him it was likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine as of april 18 there were 95 reports of suspected serious vaccine reactions out of the more than 2.2 million doses administered that's a mere 0.004 percent the reports include breathing difficulty fast heart rate and anaphylaxis a rare and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction so getting vaccinated isn't totally risk-free but thankfully severe reactions do seem pretty rare but there's been a recent resurgence of community cases the authorities are still encouraging people to be vaccinated despite an increase in number of vaccinated individuals getting infected and some of them had already been fully vaccinated vaccination doesn't provide 100 protection to find out how effective the vaccines really are i've arranged to speak to dr lyon nam dr leong has had hands-on experience managing several disease outbreaks including the sars outbreak in 2003. okay dr leong why are we still seeing people who get infected after they have been vaccinated now what we're seeing are actually mutants mutants which are quite different from the original strand in fact it's like the syllabus that has been changed so now when i used to score 95 marks with this standard syllabus exams i do worse off because i is a totally different mutant it's a totally different syllabus but even if we went back to the original stream the efficacy was only 95 which means while the 100 people there are five of them will still end up with an illness but we understand that to be mild what i'm hearing a lot is people around me saying that you see you see you get vaccinated you still can get infected so what is the point of getting vaccinated vaccination changes from severe disease to mouth disease and from mild disease to a asymmetric disease so our responsibility is not just about not falling sick with coveting but it's also preventing the severe forms which require oxygen or requires intensive care because eventually you don't want to destroy your hospital and your healthcare system how long will my protection last overall about 30 percent of us will have very long-lasting antibodies that will cope and the other 70 percent won't have enough antibodies you'll fall with time or they never mount adequately and in those cases all the more you need to remind the immune system by going for a booster vaccine when you see the 30 percent whose immunity or protection may last for a long time what kind of time frame are we looking at we're talking about years at the least eventually i suspect we will all have to do a blood test for antibody levels when the antibody levels fall to a certain low level we probably have to go for vaccination again wow how exactly do booster shots work booster shots work by jolting the memory of the immune system antibody levels fall but when you do a booster shot you shoot the levels very very high in fact superman high when that happens you'll be able to fight the virus even if it was a mutant are the booster shots interchangeable meaning if i start off with moderna i can take a pfizer booster if you think about the size of vaccinology you should be fine because you are stimulating the same protein again the same spike protein one good possible outcome is this we may be able to find good matches of different vaccines that will even exceed what we'll be getting all along with the traditional two doses of the same vaccine with my second job coming up i want to make sure i'm as prepared as i can be i've been getting a lot of advice from exercising the day before to popping a painkiller before the shot to prevent side effects i wonder if this is all true this one is my mom's favorite piece of advice drink plenty of water after the injection it will help true or false i've been learning about the efficacy of the covet 19 vaccines and it turns out the vaccines don't offer the same level of protection for everyone my second job is tomorrow and i want to make sure that my immune system is in top shape now i read somewhere that exercising the day before the injection is supposed to boost the effectiveness of the vaccine and i've also heard and read about so many tips to manage the side effects [Music] to help me separate fact from fiction is dr singh sian cho who provides medical support at some of the vaccine centers around sir good singapore see you thanks for your time exercising the day before my jab will boost my immunity and the efficacy of the vaccine true or false false the main reason is because some people when they do too much exercise the following day they may experience some discomfort from the strenuous exercise and that actually makes the immune system even worse than usual i personally experience quite a bit of saunas on my arm i was told that if i moved my arm a lot it actually helps true or false um that is actually true keeping the arm mobile helps to improve the blood circulation of the arm and prevents the joints from stiffening this one is my mom's favorite piece of advice drink plenty of water after the injection it will help true or false um it is true in false okay apologies to mommy why we do advise a light snack and adequate hydration before the vaccine and adequate hydration after the vaccine but sometimes over hydration may cause swelling may cause a bloatedness to some people who are not so mobile it can even cause water retention so we advise to just eat and drink as what one would normally do not necessarily have to do in excess alcohol can affect my immune response this question is a little bit complicated to answer chronic alcoholism definitely will affect one's uh immune system and it will dampen a person's immunity but having a glass or two alcohol wouldn't affect a person's immunity or the vaccine's efficacy will popping's paracetamol before the jab help no it wouldn't the reason being is because we don't recommend taking medication without symptoms for those who really want to maximize the efficacy of the vaccine is there anything we can do yeah regular exercise and balance healthy diet and most importantly is adequate sleep that would be the best advice to anyone to boost the efficacy of the vaccine even just one night of good sleep the day before can really helps to boost one's immunity okay this is it day of jab number two i got enough sleep i had been exercising and eating normally so i think i'm all good i can't wait for it actually i just want to get it over and done with thank you it's finally time for my second jab and i think i'm as prepared as i'll ever be okay so my arm was very very sore it lasted for about two days there was no fever so if i reported any unusual symptoms that might indicate an allergy like bad rashes or breathing difficulty i would be stopped from taking my second job but i've been given the all clear you wanna watch your grade yeah [Music] one two and three [Music] okay maybe watching the needle going wasn't such a good idea still it hurts a little less the second time around all right ma'am so resonation is done thank you so much and congratulations on your second vaccination thank you thank you so much yes thank you i'm counting down to my 30 minutes and then i'm gonna call home and tell the kids mama's fine it's been about 24 hours since my second injection all day today i had chills body eggs and felt extremely lethargic right now i feel like i've got a bit of my energy back so hopefully i can be back to normal by tomorrow now that i'm fully vaccinated i want to know if there are things i can do now that i couldn't before it seems i can now skip pre-testing for events that require them like weddings and performances i might even be able to travel to certain countries soon without the need for quarantine but i wonder at which point will we reach herd immunity that is enough people around us vaccinated and protected against covet 19 and once we get there will we get back some sense of normalcy to our lives for some answers i am darling professor suliya thank you for talking to us again the former clinical director for the national center for infectious diseases what is the magic number that we are looking at to achieve herd immunity at humidity we mean that those who are not vaccinated will still be indirectly protected because the people around them are vaccinated so they act like a kind of shield right initially we found out that third immunity can be reached if 70 percent of a population can be vaccinated but with the new variants they are more transmissible i think many experts around the world think that it should be about 80 but even then i will have to caution you that her immunity doesn't mean that the disease will go away or there will be no cases prof i think many of us are looking forward to the past whereby we need not have uh social distancing we can meet as many friends as we want and we don't have to wear masks is that likely to happen it's like looking into the crystal ball so we aren't really very sure but um personally i don't see this happening for the next three to four years at least to achieve 80 vaccination of the population the countries around us will still not be anywhere near that so that means travel will still be limited for the large part [Music] my own experience with the covet 19 vaccine was thankfully uneventful but i've learned that getting vaccinated may not make you completely immune but it does make you less likely to get severely ill or have symptoms should you get infected now for the next few years getting blood tests to monitor our antibody levels and getting booster jabs may become the norm even after we've been vaccinated but it's the right thing to do to help protect those around us ,True,False,False,False

Additional information: https://www.americananthro.org/AttendEvents/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2143#Responsive%20Learning%20Part%201%20Video","KRISTIN: So just to let everybody know, this is
being recorded, and we will have the recording available to everyone and
accessible, and it will include closed captions. We want to keep
accessibility mindful as we go through and switching everything to online so we
will have closed captions to our recording. We will also, when we do
introductions, do a verbal description too for those that are visually impaired. So
to start us off, good afternoon! Good morning! Depending on the time zone where
you are at. I want to first begin by welcome you to our webinar on COVID-19:
Fear, Stigma and Steps Forward. This is hosted by the American Anthropological
Association, the Society for Medical Anthropology, and the Special Interest
Group Anthropological Responses to Health Emergencies. During this time of high stress
and anxiety for everyone, we really want to thank you for joining us today. As
we've been hearing from our leaders, we all have a role to play in this, and
we're in this together. So it is our hope through the webinar today that we can
share some information, discuss ways to contribute, and offer a handle on how to
proceed forward. Before we jump into our speakers, a few housekeeping tips. First, a
disclaimer. This is a very fluid and ever-changing situation, so if you're
watching this today or even future recording as it gets spread
around, please keep the date in mind because information is situations could
change. For connection, if you are having trouble on Zoom, you could try either
reconnecting, if there is a glitch because we do have a large number of
people on, or you can also try calling in instead of being on the Zoom video, and
so the call-in information is listed here. For the zoom menu, two functions I wanted
to point out. One on the bottom menu, if you hover over the bottom of the screen,
the menu bar should pop up. There's an icon that looks like a microphone and
that icon allows a speaker to mute and unmute. If you could please keep yourself
on mute, that allows us to get some clear audio, especially in our recording, and in
addition another icon on that bottom menu is
a little message icon that if you click on that, it opens up your chat window.
There's already a lot of activity going on in the chat window, which is great.
This is where we would like you to post any questions, in this chat window. My
co-chair, Deon, is going to be helping collect those- those questions, that way
we can have all of our speakers present, and then have a question and answer
session. So throughout the webinar, if you have questions, go ahead and post it in
the chat window. So introduction. I am Kristin Hedges. I'm an assistant
professor of anthropology at Grand Valley State University. I am a white
woman with medium length brown hair. I'm currently conducting this webinar, with
approval from my dean, in my office. I'm isolated in my office. Right now, my house
is pretty loud with children at home, so I was thankful to get their approval to use
it just to conduct this webinar. I'm the co-chair of the Anthropological
Responses to Health Emergencies, along with Deon Claiborne, who is actually in
the chat window, collecting your questions. DEON:Hi. KRISTIN: [laughter] and just to give 
you some information about our group. Our group is a special interest group of the Society
for Medical Anthropology. We were formed in 2017. The purpose of our group is to
network among people in public health and social science, in any kind of
health-related circumstance, to rapidly develop a response to a health
emergency. So far our group has worked on Zika, Ebola, measles outbreak, and now
COVID-19. If you would like to join our group or-, we've got the link to our
Facebook page. We do keep things pretty virtual so we can quickly respond, and we
also have started an expertise database that is a quick 5-minute Google form. Our
idea is we would like to have experts already in the database, that way when
something new, a new infection pops up like this, we can quickly see who we
could turn to to ask for advice from. So the link is here. It only takes five
minutes. I think Deon is also going to post this link a few times throughout
the webinar in the chat box. We would encourage everybody, even if you do not
consider yourself an expert, there's some advice you could probably, possibly
offer, so please consider filling that out. So our outline, this is our line of
speakers, and I'm going to have each speaker, if they
could introduce themself, that way people can connect the video icon with who is
speaking and give a description. So we will start with Jennifer Nuzzo. JENNIFER: Hi, everybody. I'm Jennifer Nuzzo. I'm an
epidemiologist who works on outbreak detection response, and particularly, I
conduct operational research in collaboration with outbreak responders
to identify how we can improve response to future, you know, outbreaks, epidemics,
and pandemics. KRISTIN: Alright, Jennifer. And Jennifer, can you give a description
of yourself and where you're at for those that could be on our webinar who
are visually impaired? JENNIFER: Oh, sure, and I haven't turned on my video, because I've
found that the bandwidth in my- with all of us teleworking at home, but you're
not gonna hear- you're gonna hear a distorted voice, so I am also a white
woman with pearly brownish hair, and I'm sitting in a spare bedroom in my house,
with children, hopefully, that won't come busting in in the middle of this.
KRISTIN: Alright, thank you. Samuel Spies. SAM: Hi, I'm Sam Spies. I'm a program officer
at the Social Science Research Council, and I'm a managing editor of Media Well,
which is the SSRC's platform to track research on dis- and misinformation
across the social sciences and distill that research for a general audience. I'm
a white male. I'm sitting against a beige wall and a gray curtain. I have a black
and white cat over my left shoulder who will probably appear in the video at
some point. KRISTIN: Thank you, Sam. And Monica? MONICA: Good afternoon, everybody. I am Monica Schoch-Spana. I worked with Jennifer at the Johns
Hopkins Center for Health Security, trained in cultural anthropology, and for
the last 20 years, have worked on the role of the community in managing
epidemics and disasters, and also having the public engage in health emergency
policy-making. The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security is- functions as a
think-tank, so our role is to influence policy and practice in ways that would
reduce human suffering during extreme events and their aftermath. KRISTIN: And Monica, can you- MONICA: Oh yes, yes, yes. I am a white woman, mid-50s, proudly middle-aged. I am in my home, and my teenage son's door
is nearby. He may come stumbling out, because it's about that time for him to
get up, so apologies in advance. KRISTIN:  Alright, thank you. So this is the order that we
are going to go through our webinar, and then we will finish with a question and
answer session. So if you have questions throughout, submit them in the chat
function, and we will try to collate all those to get everybody's questions
answered, and we will pass it back to Jennifer to go ahead and start us off. JENNIFER: Great, thank you, and you're gonna drive
the slides, right, Kristen? KRISTIN: Yes, I am, if you just- JENNIFER: Ok, great. Go ahead. You can advance to the next one, thank you, great. So, and I'm glad that, Kristen, you gave the appropriate
kind of caveats about our knowledge of the situation and the fact that this is
very much a situation in flux, and what I'm saying today might very well be
different next week, and so just wanted to kind of reiterate that, but
nonetheless, I'm gonna try to tell you what we think we know now, what we still
don't know now, and despite all of that, what we think now might happen in the
future, and just to kind of set that kind of tone from sort of a- an
epidemiologic kind of public health perspective, and then hopefully, it'll kind
of inform the conversations that follow. I just wanted to say that this pandemic
that we now find ourselves in is one that our group has been tracking since
really we heard the first reports coming out of China of an outbreak of viral
pneumonia. As I mentioned on the introduction, I conduct operational
research to better understand outbreak response so that we can inform future
preparedness. I do this as part of the Outbreak Observatory, and one of the
functions of the Outbreak Observatory, in addition to doing these research studies
is also to publish a weekly blog, and so just kind of a screenshot here. On
January 2nd, we wrote about what was then being referred to as a outbreak of
unknown viral pneumonia in China, and most of our reflections in that post was
about how there were strong suspicions that this was due to a SARS-like virus,
but we tried to review what evidence, if any, existed for that. As you may remember,
when this first started it seemed linked to a seafood market in Wuhan China that
was actually, that- that link was actually how astute clinicians notified
health authorities that something unusual was happening. Having a bunch of
patients with having viral pneumonia in a hospital in the midst of flu season is
not, by itself, unusual, but the astute clinicians
had noticed that a number of them seemed to have an occupational connection to
the seafood market, and that initially kind of tipped off worries that that
would be sort of an unusual coincidence, and so they began looking at this market
as a potential source of this outbreak, and you know, initially, it seemed, just
from the data, that this was possibly due to some kind of point exposure at the
output of the market, that people who may have been there or work there may have
been exposed to something while they were there. We now know that that's very
much not the case. That this is a virus that's capable of human-to-human
transmission. It has expanded beyond Wuhan, and it is a virus that may not have
really been linked to this market in the first place. That may have just been a
place where a number of people infected each other because they were symptomatic,
and coughing on one of- an-another. Next slide, please. So what do we now know?
Next slide. As I mentioned, one of the things that we know now is that this is
a virus capable of sustained human-to- human transmission. This is one of the
first studies that kind of showed the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19,
and I think an important takeaway from this graphic I'm showing here, which
shows a sort of the first epidemiologic curve that plots the number of cases by
their date of symptom onset, is that this situation likely began much earlier than
we initially thought. Poss- the first cases possibly occurred in the beginning
of December. It's even possible that they occurred earlier than that, which really
raises important, I think, questions about what measures countries should take, and
there was clearly a fair amount of travel that occurred before anybody kind
of really started paying attention, and so I think a lot of our efforts to
try to identify where the virus went and where it is, you know, was possibly
blinded by not understanding when it, as early, you know, that it started as early
as it did. Next slide. Another thing that we
understand now about this virus is that it's capable of causing a spectrum of
illness, and so it's been reported over and over again, and this comes from,
initially, the World Health Organization that about 80% of the cases to date are-
have experienced mild illness, which is, you know, somewhat good news, but there
are clearly, you know, that leaves the remaining 20% that experience severe and
critical illness, and then ultimately results in death. There's been now studies
that have looked at factors associated with critical illness and death, and
here's just one of the studies that was, one of the early studies that identified
some of the factors that are associated with that, and as you can see, it's, you
know, a lot of these chronic illnesses that we often worry about, like
hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Some other risk factors, such as
cancer, you know, people undergoing cancer treatment, and you know, lung disease have
also subsequently be identified. Another important aspect of the- you know another
factor that's also been associated with more severe illness and death is age, and
we haven't fully done the the de-linking to see whether it's age by itself, or if
it's age as a function of, that's when you tend to accumulate a lot of these
underlying conditions, but nonetheless, you know the vast majority of deaths
have occurred among the elderly. Next slide, please. There's been some question about the
extent to which the disease affects children. Most of the surveillance
numbers do not seem to include pediatric cases. We have some studies now that had
demonstrated that kids can get the virus and can be infected, and they generally,
when they do, when we do find kids with the virus, they tend to have milder
illness and adults. Though, you know, a recent study did suggest that severe or
critical illness is possible, though, in a small number of documented cases. I think,
you know, for me, as an epidemiologist, when I look at these numbers, it is
somewhat reassuring just because we know, like if we compare it to flu, where
children are particularly hard hit by flu, this is somewhat reassuring, but you
know, I think this situation is again in flux, and so it's- the absence of data is
not necessarily the absence of the relationship, so I think so far early
encouraging data on children, but we should obviously continue to pay
attention to that. Next slide. So, that's what we know, and now just kind
of reflecting on what we don't know, and unfortunately these- these- these are the
big questions, and I think they really, you know, influence how we are responding
to this situation. Next slide. So as I mentioned, there is a range of-
this- the virus is known to cause a spectrum of illness, and I mentioned the
WHO data, about 82 percent of reported cases being mild, but it raises the
question of how severe is this virus, you know? What fraction of people who are
infected developed severe illness and die, and unfortunately, we just don't have
great numbers for that. iI you just did the raw math where you divided the total
number of reported deaths into the total number of reported cases, for a long time
you would get a 2% number. In recent weeks, that number has ticked up to be
over 3%, but this is, I think, a very inaccurate calculation, because it's very
heavily influenced by surveillance, and in most parts of the world,
surveillance is biased to find severe cases. There has been some interest in
looking at the Diamond Princess, if you remember the news reports about this
cruise ship that it was stuck off the coast of Japan for a long time, as a way
to kind of- as a, you know, natural experiment of what the case fatality was,
because it represented a situation in which you had thousands of passengers
potentially being exposed and limited diagnostics onboard, in order to, you know,
intervene and possibly interrupt transmission. Looking at that and sort of
trying to extrapolate that, I won't go into too much detail, it's possible that
the- the- it's possible to estimate that the- you know, in, case fatality ratios and
infection fatality ratios might be lower, might be closer to one percent or
possibly lower, but again, huge uncertainty here. We don't really know.
Next slide. There's been a lot of comparisons in
sort of fatalities to influenza, a lot of kind of, you know, the President of United
States for a while was trying to liken this to a seasonal flu. Again, with all
the caveats that we don't really know what percentage of those who become
infected are likely to die or be hospitalized, because we don't know how
many people are infected. We only just know the cases that we find, and we know
that we are over-finding, you know, over-representing our surveillance with
severe cases. Still, if we just do the raw calculations, which are obviously flawed,
this is still something that's likely more severe than seasonal influenza. Next
slide. These are kind of just pictures from the World Health Organization as of
the 16th, and just to show you that we're now in a situation where, you know, we're
approaching 200,000 cases being reported worldwide. This number jumps up
remarkably each day, and you know, many, many countries across the world are
reporting cases. I very strongly believe that these case numbers and dots on the
map are not truly reflective of the situation that we're seeing, in so much
as, if a country doesn't have a dot, I don't think that we can say that that
country doesn't have the disease. We have to remember that, you know, our last
pandemic was in 2009, and it was H1N1 influenza. Influenza is a disease for which
we have, we routinely conduct surveillance, where there is a
surveillance infrastructure it-, granted it may be weak in some parts of the
world, but there is still kind of a backbone to build upon. What we're
essentially asking countries to do now is to stand up surveillance for a
completely new virus, so I don't think we should assume that because a country
hasn't reported cases, it doesn't have it. I also don't think we should assume that
there aren't other factors that may have  influenced country surveillance beyond just
technical ones, and so, if like, as an example, if you look at the case numbers
in Russia, they're very small, and they appear appear to all- only be in people
who have traveled, which I just don't think is realistic
given how the disease is- is unfolding in other countries. Next slide.
Here's the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker that was that was developed by
Lauren Gardner, a professor in the School of Engineering. This is really one of the
best tools for seeing more up-to-date assessment of the number of cases, and as
I said, you know, we're- we've exceeded actually 200,000 cases, and as you can
see, this provides kind of, I think, a better picture of where cases are being
reported then the WHO, which you know is on a different time frame for
updating their numbers. Next slide. Right now, the situation that we're seeing is
that the majority of spread is occurring outside of China, and you'll see there's
going to be a series of news articles talking about how the- re- remarkability, you
know, the remarkable approach that China has taken and how they've really
dropped their transmission to the point where, you know, they're reporting a
handful of cases each day, as opposed to several thousand in the day at the peak.
Contrast that with Europe right now, which is really sort of rapidly expanding in
its number of cases, and you know, has been sort of identified as a hot spot.
Again, I'm always nervous just say that, you know, one place has it more than
another, because I still think that surveillance is so weak, but clearly, you
can't ignore the epidemics that are happening within Europe. Next slide. After, you know, China, after we got wind
of this, you know, epidemic that was occurring in China, and the fact that you
know it was growing quite rapidly, and it seemed to be capable of sustained human
to human transmission, a number of countries responded by implementing bans
on travel from China, and it's been a point of discussion as to the, you know,
effect that these bans have had. Consider me in the skeptical category, and one of
the reasons why I've been skeptical about the impact of these is that I have
believed that the virus was likely moving about the planet much earlier and
that countries that didn't yet have it were probably just not looking for it,
and here's just a graphic that was produced by a Council on Foreign
Relations and what it shows is the days after a country has ac- implemented a travel
ban or not, how its number of confirmed cases have grown, and what it shows is that, you know, a number of the countries that implemented travel bans
saw very large, you know, increases in their their epidemics, regardless, so it's
hard for me to take away from this that this is the right approach to
controlling this virus. Next slide. I mentioned that our surveillance is
biased to find severe cases, and it was also biased geographically for a long
time. This is guidelines from the CDC that existed up until very recently. We,
for a long time, made no efforts to find cases outside of anyone who had traveled
from China, and so, as we are claiming credit that the travel bans from China
that were implemented at the end of January bought us time, it's possible
that those bans reduce the number of importations of virus, but as this table
indicates, it spells out the criteria for testing people for
COVID-19.We were essentially only testing people who had traveled from
specifically, and if they had traveled from broader broader China, then they
needed to be sick enough to be hospitalized, so we never did the testing
for a long time to find out whether the virus was already circulating in the
United States outside of people who had traveled from China, and it stands to
reason if you reduce the number of people traveling from China, and you keep
your surveillance fixated on people who have traveled from China, you're not
going to find any cases or you'll find very few cases. Next slide. Everyone, right now, is looking at Italy
with much worry. Their epidemic is growing quite significantly, you know. I
think they're over- they're approaching 40,000 cases. Very high fatality reports
there as well, and in part, a lot of the worry is about how the demand for
hospital resources, particularly critical care, is about to outpace supply in in
Italy and availability, and there's been a lot of comparisons to case numbers
here in the United States, and people asking if in the United States, we are,
you know, two weeks away from being Italy just where our case numbers are. I think
this situation is absolutely cause for worry, but I do think there are some
social factors that may also be at play here. Namely,
that the epidemic in Italy is very heavily overweighted with elderly
patients, which as I mentioned are more likely to develop severe illness and
death, and we can contrast that with epidemics that have occurred in other
countries that have had younger patients and haven't had nearly the same kind of
strain on their health systems, so lots of context that I think needs to be
brought to an interpretation of these numbers, and particularly, as we're trying
to predict what could happen elsewhere. Next slide.
A question I frequently get from just family and members,
you know, just people generally, the public conversations that I have, and
also, crucially with members of the press, is how long will this situation last, and
in particular, are they referring to the actions that states and countries are
taking to try to stop the spread of this virus, you know, in many states, they've
closed schools, canceled public gatherings, in some cases, closed
restaurants and bars, here in Maryland, they just announced that they're gonna
close other stores, like shopping malls, etc., and I think we'll continue to see
kind of a wave of closures as governments become increasingly
concerned about the need to reduce transmission, in particular, so that the
health system isn't overwhelmed. All of these social distancing measures that
are being pursued are not necessarily in an attempt to change the number of
people who become infected in the end, but to try to slow it down and to spread
it out over a longer period of time, such that we have fewer people sick on any
one day, which hopefully will put less strain on probably over-already-taxed
health system, and that's really important, because there's this modeling,
this-this graphic I'm showing here has a bunch of kind of simulated curves of
cases and showing different scenarios. It was produced by Imperial College of
London, so a modeling group there, that have looked at various different control
strategies, and they essentially concluded that government basically has
to shut it all down, or to a lot of it, and possibly do it- a lot of it, for 18
months, and they used 18 months as a cutoff, because that's one of the
estimates that's been thrown around for the availability of disease. This is
obviously quite worrisome because it's hard for me to imagine that societies can
continue to function under this level of restriction for that long. 18 months is
also not a magic number, because although, it's possible that we could have, you
know, a promising vaccine at that point, it's not clear to me that we will have
any meaningful call quantities of vaccine at that point, and so I think
it's at least raising questions of what's to come next,
and truly, how long will this last? This is absent any kind of speculation
as to whether the virus will go away in the warmer weather. People are
speculating, but there's no data now to support that or to even answer that
question. This is just, you know, if the function of these measures is to slow
down the speed at which people become sick, what that essentially means is that
you pretty much have to maintain it, until do you find a way to protect
people, and even if we look at places like China that have been able to reduce
their infections through very, very aggressive measures, they remain
susceptible, and so, as they go back to work, as long as the virus is still out
there, they could very well see, and I think people expect to see a rise in
their case numbers again, and so the question is what do you do to stop that
or to deal with that? Do you have to go back to those measures? And I think
that's the question that no one has been able to answer, unfortunately, and this is
a question that I think cannot purely be answered in epidemiological terms,
because I think this is a societal question, about our values, and what we
think we can bear, and what we think are appropriate choices, and so I think this
really has to be informed by a larger community than just epidemic modelers.
Next slide. That was a really depressing slide. I didn't want to end on it, so I
just wanted to point to just some progress has been made in some countries,
recognizing of course that progress is- is potentially temporary, but here's
Singapore. They did not take the kind of aggressive approaches that China did.
They have been able to bring down their incidence in cases largely through
traditional public health methods of rapid case identification, isolation of
cases, quarantine, identification of contacts, and quarantining of contacts. They
didn't do things like close schools. They had a very kind of active- they had high
degree of transparency in terms of their case numbers and the epidemiologic
investigation around each of the cases. They had a leadership that was talking
about, you know, what to expect and talking regularly,
including the fact that, though they have had much success in their response, that
they should not expect that this will be a permanent situation, that they could
very well see case numbers rise again, particularly as the rest of the world
experiences cases, and they've acknowledged that Singapore can't wall
itself off from the rest of the world. I'll also point out that Singapore did
not have many cases over the age of 65 like Italy has, so though, I think we
should be inspired by some of the successes that they have, it's
questionable how much we can generalize from their experience. Next slide. And
similarly, with South Korea, people are pointing to South Korea as being
particularly successful. I think one of the- is, as you can see with the green
bars that are decreasing, they have been able to reduce the number of cases
beyond what would have been predicted just based on the initial growth in
cases, so if you've heard the term, ""We're trying to flatten the curve,"" here's
evidence that South Korea has. They have been able to do it through very
aggressive testing. They've tested more than 200,000 people to date, which is
above and beyond what any other government has been able to do. They also
have- so they're able to much more quickly find cases and isolate cases, and
they've also been very aggressive in their efforts to do contact tracing. They
have only been able to be that successful in contact tracing because
they're using cell phones to see who is in contact with each other, which is
potentially an effective epidemiologic tool. I think it does, though, raise
questions about, you know, whether that truly is the right approach. I think
there's a larger societal questions that have to be addressed before we just, you
know, think about applying those technologies, but I do think it shows
some progress, and I do want to kind of leave this more on a positive note,
because this is an otherwise kind of dreary topic, and I don't want to leave
everybody depressed. I think there's more that can be done, but I do
that we need to address these questions more fully and frankly with the
contributions of other communities that have rele- relevant research and perspectives
to bring to the table and not just have it be led by, you know, the modeling and
and the epi approaches. I think that's the last slide. Yep. Just my contact
information if anyone has any follow-up questions that we're not able to address
in the webinar. So thank you. KRISTIN: All right, thank you so much, Jennifer. [background noise] Now, I'm going to pass it over to Sam. DEON: One moment, one moment, Kristin, a quick housekeeping
note. Please, everyone, we want to capture all your questions. If you could please
put, at the beginning of your question all in caps, ""Question"", then it stands out
for those of us that are trying to find them all on chat, and we can make sure
that we get them to the speakers to answer. Thank you. KRISTIN: Thank you.
SAM: Hi, everyone. Thanks for- for joining us. I'm a little under the weather myself, so
forgive my voice if I'm a little hoarse. I'm Sam Spies. I'm a program officer at
the Social Science Research Council and the managing editor of MediaWell, which
is the SSRC's platform to track research on dis- and misinformation
across the social sciences and distill that research for a general audience.
I'm an anthropologist by training, and I studied responses to censorship at
online media outlets in Jordan. Can I get my first slide please? I want
to start with a couple of caveats. One is that mis- and disinformation research
involves a lot of uncertainty, and it takes a lot of time. So what we think we
know may look very different in say six months. For example, it's still very hard
to get a complete picture of what happened in the 2016 US elections. So
without independent access to platform research data about this outbreak, we're
unlikely to ever know for sure, in this crisis, how misinformation is being
spread or how disinformation is being propagated. Can I get my next slide? The
second caveat is that what I'm talking about today is synthesized from a lot of
research and news reports, but none of it is my original
research. So please, instead of quoting me or using what I say here as a basis for
social media posts, please get in touch with me, and let me point you to the
original material. You can do so through these contact links. This slide shows the
contact links. Our URL is mediawell.SSRC. org. Our email address is mediawell@SSRC.org. You'll notice that I'm talking about dis- and misinformation together,
and that's deliberate. The definitions that have become most prominent
distinguish these two based on intention. Disinformation tends to be defined as
false information that is deliberately spread in order to harm, confuse, mobilize,
or demobilize its audience. Misinformation is unintentionally spread
and tends to harm, confuse, mobilize,  demobilize. Intent is notoriously
difficult to measure, however, and what we see is that a given narrative can shift
constantly back and forth between intentional disinfo and unintentional
misinfo, and for people producing disinformation, that's exactly what they
want. The upshot is the dis- and misinfo narratives exist in this highly
liminal space online. I have a literature review up on MediaWell on this
definitional problem, if you're interested in learning more, but that's
the TLDR version. First, I want to talk a little bit generally about what we've
learned about dis- and misinformation flows. Most of this comes from and
pertains to the US because a lot of this research is prompted by the 2016
presidential election, but there are elements that apply elsewhere, and in
general, we need much more research into disinformation dynamics in other places
because we know that they're highly influenced by local context. If we look
around, it certainly seems as if there's a huge amount of misinformation
circulating, both in regard to COVID-19 and other topics, and in some absolute
sense, that is true, and it has had deadly consequences. For example, we've seen
dozens of deaths in Iran, according to news reports, from fake cures involving
bootleg alcohol, and people are quite legitimately scared.
Globally speaking, the dominant sentiment on social media surrounding COVID-19 is
fear, and the kinds of messages we see varies. In some places, the most popular
tweets are about celebrities maybe making donations. Elsewhere, they're about
cures that have been found, or theories the virus was made in a lab. Jake Shapiro
and the Empirical Studies of Conflict Project at Princeton have been compiling a
list of narratives, and some of their categorizations of the false narratives
are anti-China, non-vaccine remedies, speculations about
the source, a US bioweapons plot, and that this is a plot to weaken and
discredit Trump. Soon, the- Shapiro and his colleagues will be making daily updates
at the ESOC site, but in order to get a sense of how major this misinformation
problem is, we have to weigh the misinformation that's circulating
against the total body of circulating information, which is very difficult to
do, if not impossible, but it's possible that the percentage of false narrative
circulating within the larger conversation is maybe very very small.
It's also possible that the prevalence of bogus info may be declining as this
larger conversation grows. I'll return to this later, but one of the lessons of the
2016 US election is that effect stemming from the concern over the idea of
disinformation, expressed then as fake news, were greater than any measurable
effects that the disinformation itself had. Back then, we saw news reports about
tens of thousands of bogus accounts being taken down, but unless those
reports are put in context against the millions of non-bogus accounts, we don't
get a true picture of the issue. There's a study with a good indication that
exposure to election-related mis- and disinfo online was actually fairly low,
and that misinformation sharing behavior among most social media users in the
US is fairly rare. If we get more evidence that that's true, that's going
to be really encouraging, but what we also see is that there are some actors
who share a lot of myths and disinformation online. In the US mediascape, there are extremely dense and interconnected clusters of conspiracy
sites, social media influencers, far-right
organizations, and right-wing media outlets. Production and spread of mis- and
disinfo in the US is disproportionately higher on the
political right. This is not to say that US political conservatives are more
susceptible to misinformation, but it does mean that their daily information
environment is saturated with highly polarized, if not outright false
information, to an extremely high degree, and here, I'm referencing Yochai Benkler's work. The right-leaning professional news organizations, like Fox,
are closely interwoven with these clusters in a way that centrist and
left-leaning news organizations are not. With COVID-19, we do not know if these
same dynamics hold true, or if misinformation nodes are more evenly
dispersed, and if these clusters are not as dense. Another interesting point is
that the disinformation industry has some ties with what I'll call the
alternative treatments industry. Alex Jones makes his money by selling a wide
range of unproven dietary supplements that make claims to things like advanced
neural activation, and he's raised prices on the bulk food he sells on his site
since the outbreak. He's not alone. Other conspiracy sites blend health
disinformation with far-right conspiracies, and some sell supplement
products directly to their audience, and so there are certain actors who have a
commercial interest in further eroding public trust in institutions in general,
and particularly in evidence-based science and medicine. And this brings us
to COVID-19 and the current state of affairs.
There have been information vacuums, and we know that in the absence of good
information, people will look for any information. There's also a structural
disparity between information producers and misinformation spreaders, which is
that doctors, scientists, and public health officials are constrained by
professional norms and ethics, but our Facebook friends, our politicians, and our
grandmothers are not. One of the patterns I've seen in the
English-language Internet is a post that says something like, ""My friend's relative
who works in the health department says they're about to announce a new
restriction,"" and this is a classic rumor framework. It establishes a claim to
inside information that sounds quite reasonable but is completely
unverifiable. It also fits existing patterns of actual actions. Governments,
are announcing new measures all the time, and they're increasingly restrictive. I'm
speculating here, but I think it's reasonable to think that these messages
spread successfully because they so closely match the way that we
communicate other facts about our lives. Much of the disinformation that we're
seeing circulate is clearly commercially motivated. Jim Baker made the news for
touting a treatment scam, but I'm sure we've all seen lots of examples in the
past few weeks, and we find that this is true of missing disinformation more
generally. A lot of people are in it for the money, or perhaps more accurately, for
the capital, be it social or economic. Disinformation is a growth industry.
There's fascinating work by Ong and [inaudible] about the labor of
disinformation in the Philippines, and they show how easily and fluidly the
commercial intertwines with the political. Elsewhere, there are trolls for
hire, but it's hard to get a sense of who they are and how strongly they're paid
trolling is aligned with their own political orientations, or whether
they're really just in it for the money. We've started to see evidence that
unscrupulous PR firms and consultants are willing to use coordinated
disinformation tactics for their clients, further blurring the commercial and the
political. This is an area where we need a lot more ethnography to understand how
disinformation labor markets function in global contexts. The other dynamic that I
think we're seeing with COVID-19 is that much of the misinformation that's
circulating, for lack of a better word, seems to be grassroots. In other words,
some people, and again, it's very hard to say how many, are spreading conspiracy theories and fake cures from person to person in an organic way, and perhaps
with the best of intentions. Without independent access to platform data, it's
going to be impossible to know for sure if this is true. I say organic because
that tends to be the word that's used in disinformation
studies to mean the opposite of coordinated, like a coordinated attack
from a state actor, when we're talking about social media disinformation, but
organic is not a great term, because it obscures the way that social media
platforms and their algorithms juice content that they've learned will
generate engagement, and that's content that is polarizing, inflammatory, extreme,
and emotionally activating. So there's very little that's truly organic about
social media communication though this varies from platform to a platform, with
their- with their respective affordances. There was a report in Politico the other
day about audio messages on WhatsApp spreading virus misinfo, and Claire
Wordle made the point that audio is an emotional medium, and there's evidence
that emotion plays, or can play, a strong role in what content spreads and
resonates on social media. In terms of coordinated disinformation activity, or
inauthentic disinformation activity related to coronavirus, we have seen some
allegations that foreign agents are targeting the US with disinformation.
I've seen allegations that there's coordinated activity pushing conspiracy
narratives that the CIA is responsible for the virus, for example, and the
Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Lab published a post in late January saying
that fringe outlets aligned with the Kremlin are pushing
narratives that blame the US. However, I want to see more data before I draw
any conclusions about this, especially about how widespread this behavior is.
That said, what we've seen from the 2016 and 2018 elections, as well as elsewhere
in the world, is that disinformation producers are opportunistic and flexible,
and as disinformation narratives bubble up from dark corners of the
Internet, these producers see what gains attention, and they pivot their
sockpuppet accounts and their bots onto these new narratives. There's some
evidence that state-sponsored or state online disinformation efforts are
perhaps less centralized than you might think.
We need more ethnography about these actors to understand who they are and
how they work. All that is to say is that if there are state aligned actors aiming
COVID-19 disinformation at US audiences, or anywhere else for that matter, we
don't yet know how wide spread or how centralized those efforts are. Finally,
there's the role of elites in the promulgation of dis- and misinformation,
and in the US, as well as elsewhere, a major engine of misinformation on COVID-19 thus far has been elected officials. Our professional journalism outlets have
still not figured out how to consistently report on misinformation,
without amplifying it. Much of the US news establishment is still producing
stenographic, both-sizes journalism that reinforces existing power
structures and allows elites to act with rhetorical impunity. There's a difference
between publishing a headline that says ""President plays down coronavirus"", and one
that says, ""President pushes false claims about coronavirus"". I used to commit
journalism myself, and it's not easy to convince editors to make declarative
statements, even when they know them to be true, but we can, and we must. The news
industry is in terrible shape, but I think anthropologists can work with
journalists—God bless 'em—in their local communities and in their field
sites, and try to effect this change. And brings me to the idea of mitigation
and what we can do to promote science and evidence-based public health
information. Specifically related to health misinfo in the current
outbreak, the pump has been primed for a very long time. We've had health related
misinformation as long as we've had concepts of disease. With varying degrees
of good faith people, have promoted tonics and cure-alls for centuries, and
states have responded with various regulatory measures. I did a little
experiment earlier this week, where I searched for coronavirus cures. Next
slide, please. If you put coronavirus into google
shopping, you get nothing. This slide shows an empty search result page from
Google for coronavirus. They have turned off that tap, and this is great, and it's
an obvious and necessary mitigation effort, but if you put an immune system.
Next slide, please. You get this.
This slide shows Google shopping results for a variety of supplements, ranging
from about 19 US dollars to about 70 US dollars. I'm not here to say that these
products do or don't work, because I don't know, but I do know that they have
not been proven to work, and yet their messages exist in our information
environment. By the way, I love that this one—I don't know if you can see it down
at the bottom—it says ""Combat employee illness and lost productivity"". Doctors
say, to help your immune system, you should get more sleep, eat a healthy diet,
reduce stress, and get more exercise, and that's a hard message to convey at the
best of times, and these are not the best of times. We would all rather take a pill.
In the US, there's a forty billion dollar dietary supplements industry based
around the idea that we as individuals can take charge of our own health care
and that as individuals we know what is best for ourselves and our families, and
that kind of agency and autonomy is great, and we should encourage it, but I
worry that it comes at the cost of ignoring scientific expertise,
contributing to an information environment in which all facts are
debatable, rejecting vaccines and cures that work, and spending money on things
that don't, and that's the information environment in which COVID-19 made its
entrance, and that brings me to my next point, which is that we are all
susceptible to misinformation in various point- forms. Some of it comes through
advertising, some of it comes through news or social media, and some of it we
grew up with. To this day, I drink cranberry juice when I'm sick, because my
mother told me 30 years ago that vitamin C will shorten cold symptoms. It's not
proven to. I'm probably just drinking more sugar, and we all do this kind of thing. It's important to recognize that we all
do it, because there's evidence of the distinct third-party effect when it
comes to misinformation. That is that in this third-party effect, people tend to
think that other kinds of people, like their political opponents, are more
susceptible to misinformation. That third person effect may have significant
consequences for mitigation efforts, because people might be more likely to
support media literacy efforts aimed at others than regulatory efforts that
affect everyone. At the same time, while we're all
susceptible, there is evidence that some people are more susceptible to
misinformation than others, and that's people over 65. These are data from the
US, but I've seen some corroboration from Europe. People over 65 fall for scams
more and are more likely to spread bogus information on social media and an email.
Unfortunately, they're also going to be most susceptible to COVID-19 and other
diseases. In the US, people over 65 also show the highest increase in political
polarization but are the least likely to use social media. That points to other
factors, including intersections between social media and traditional media. Data
show that there's been a decline in trust in institutions and expertise in
the US for decades, and I suspect that the same can be shown to be true in many
other parts of the world, and sometimes for very good reasons.
Yochai Benkler has a compelling essay up on MediaWell that makes the case that
this crisis of histology is related to growing wealth disparity, in a sense that
political systems are rigged for elites and the neoliberal project. I mentioned
earlier the idea that, in the 2016 US election, the concept of disinformation
had greater effects and disinformation itself, and I want to return to that.
There's a widespread popular narrative that Russian interference on social
media swung the US election, but we have no evidence for that. The best data
sets that are available show no measurable effects on voting behavior
related to disinformation. Though, of course, measuring these effects is
notoriously hard, but the existence of disinformation itself has potentially
huge follow-on effects, and in some ways, that's what we really need to be worried
about. Dave Karp has an essay up on our site
that sums this up really well, and his point is that if the disinformation
environment undermines the democratic myth that attentive public's hold
politicians responsible for their statements and actions, then that
unravels the fabric of democratic society. I'm summarizing a lot here, but
the upshot is that the presence of disinformation can have effects, even if
the content itself doesn't have measurable effects on voting behavior. Disinformation doesn't have to convince in order to
cause effects, and I'm also going to try to end on a more hopeful note. By and
large, corrections on social media probably work. It is worth taking the
time to say, ""No, this is not true, and here's a credible source saying why.""
Doing that doesn't necessarily convince the original poster, but if you correct
someone that can have a positive effect on other readers, who see both posts.
Fact-checking can work, if it's done right. There are ways to do journalism
that debunk without amplifying, and with COVID-19, we've also seen the
social media platforms be more proactive, and more effective at slowing spread and
deemphasizing bogus info. In this instance, that's really good. They've
shown in the past that they're unwilling or unable to moderate content at scale
on other topics, and it likely helps that they don't need political cover to
address disease in the same way that they think they do to address
immigration or misogyny or Islamophobia or anti-semitism, etc., but they're doing
it now, and it makes me hope. Can I get my last slide please?
So I think it's possible to effect some change on the individual level.
Corrections can work. Reporting sockpuppets to the platforms can work.
Compassionately teaching our friends and relatives to be good information
consumers can work. As anthropologists, we can fill a huge hole in disinformation
studies about the labor practices of disinformation and how misinformation
functions differently in post-colonial contexts and in the Global South. We can
help journalists in our local communities, and that includes sending
messages of support when they get it right. That's all I have. I have tried not
to misinform you. I sincerely hope I haven't. I wish you all continued good
health, and don't touch your face. KRISTIN: Thank you so much, Sam, and next up is
Monica. MONICA: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks to Jen
and Sam for really engaging talks, and to Kristin and the organizers for this
opportunity to talk with you. I've been asked to clean up our conversation with
the topic of ""Now what? What do we do?"" So if I could have the next slide. For those
of you who are tuning in to the information strictly through audio, I do
not have graphics or images. It's strict text, and I will go through those with
you quickly. I just want to give an overview of my six points of action for
those of you on this communal call. The first is we need to remember who we are,
what is our mission, are our missions as anthropologists? The second is we really
need to seize this teachable moment. We know a lot about this space. We need to
educate a variety of audiences about what we know. Thirdly, we need to join the
pandemic response brigade. There is no single discipline who has an answer to
the complex challenge of COVID-19, and other outbreaks of emerging infectio-
infectious disease. Fourthly, we need to engage with the dominant narratives that
are being used to describe and organize the response to COVID-19. Fifthly, we need to do
research that cuts down the social risks that are associated both with the
epidemics and the official responses to them, and lastly, we need to be human. We
need to model for one another and for those of us around us what it is to
maintain human connections in a context of contagion. Can I have the next slide,
please? So when I was putting my talk together, I thought, ""You know, I'm going to
go back to our code of ethics."" Because I think, occasionally, we need to
recalibrate, particularly in what is now a global scale crisis of various kinds.
Of course they're local manifestations, but the world is having a problem. So what's our responsibility in this context? So we have out of the AAA
Ethics Forum, the quote that ""Anthropology is an irreducibly social enterprise, and
among our goals are disseminating anthropologic knowledge, and it's used to
solve human problems."" So here we are. We've been tasked with solving problems.
From the Society for Applied Anthropology, our code of ethics there
include, ""Provide training which is informed, accurate, and relevant to the
needs of the larger society."" All right. We're educators. It's time for education
during this pandemic, and then lastly, also from the Society for Applied
Anthropology, ""To society as a whole we owe the benefit of our special knowledge
and skills in interpreting socio-cultural systems"" and leading to
""communicate out our understanding of human life to society at large"". So, we
need to educate, we need to communicate, we need to train, and we need to do it in
ways that are accessible to a variety of audiences. Our next action, our second
action—next slide, please— is seizing the teachable moment. All right, there are
very urgent and waiting- weighty issues that are permeating this pandemic, and
they are squarely in our wheelhouse, all right? The first is—there are more,
but I just wanted to give some illustrations of our existing knowledge
base that can be used to intervene in this pandemic and reduce both physical
and social suffering, also political suffering, and the first question, or
issue, is that of stigma, right? And so we started when this- when this emerging
infectious disease first came on the scene that it originated or was first
detected in China, so we had all eyes on China at the time.
We had framing of the disease in terms of its Chinese origins, and because
people tend to, in pandemics, to sort the world into safe places, unsafe places,
safe people, and unsafe people, as a way to get a handle on an uncertain,
potentially, an uncertain, a fright- a frightening, and potentially, physically
dangerous scenario, people use mental maps to- to negotiate that- that threat
and that fear. At the same time, that can get mapped onto to pre-existing social
hierarchies, and- and that is why we see the xenophobia and the racism growing
up alongside fear with regard to this particular disease. Sadly, we are seeing
yet another spike in the use of naming practices to continue to perpetrate
stigmatization. We've seen the disease called, as being started by the ""Wuhan
virus"". I can barely say ""kung flu"" and also the ""Chinese virus"". So, this is not going
away. It's probably going to get worse in terms of the stigmatization that would
be attached to individuals of all backgrounds that may come down with the
disease as well as caregivers who treat them. We know a lot about human sociality,
okay? We can, as social scientists, identify those unintended, adverse
effects of social distancing, or non-pharmaceutical interventions that
are used to interrupt viral transmission. I think we need to come up with greater
instructions around how we preserve solidarity at the same time that we are
told to keep a physical distance from people around us.
A third area where we can weigh in right away—we don't have to do new research
here, folks—is the social determinants of health. Now, it's a pandemic. It's an
entirely new pathogen. So the virus may not discriminate, but its health impacts
certainly do, and if you look at past outbreaks, you can see that there are
uneven effects throughout societies that are riven with inequality. So during the
2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, we had racial and ethnic minorities in the
United States experiencing higher rates of complications, hospitalizations, and
mortalities. We need to weigh in on this. And then lastly, what else can we use in
terms of our existing research for this teachable moment is to weigh in on those
factors that would enable various individuals and groups to actually act
on well-intended advice from public health authorities about how to protect
themselves and their communities amidst the pandemic. Oftentimes, there's an
assumption that the public is ignorant, we just have to fill their empty heads
with information, and they'll do what we want, but we know that there are on-the-ground realities that can keep an individual, or a particular group of
people, from doing, what has been called doing and complying with and adhering to
public health interventions. So let's weigh in on these issues right now, and I
know many of you have already, okay? So let's use our existing in- a research
and knowledge base to counter- counter and raise awareness of these elements. I
think, too, we need to, you know, break down those classroom rules. We have to
reach non-traditional learners. For those of you who, like
myself, are struggling with the remote teaching experience, let's continue to
reach our traditional students, but we, right now, we have to reach out to
decision-makers, to journalists, to our neighbors, to, you know, our- the people who
retweet us. If we're teaching [inaudible] out there, let's- let's get something on
COVID-19 and the risks and benefits of social, or we'll call it physical,
distancing. Right before I came online, I got a call from Congressman Roger
Williams, who's my congressman in district number 25.
He had a Q&A by phone. My phone rang, I just picked it up, and he was taking
questions. I do hope that something similar is
happening in your congressional districts, and if it's not happening now,
then call your legislator, and offer your expertise and- in taking public Q&A, and
this particular disease. Next slide, please. All right. Joining the pandemic response
brigade. Right now, we're gonna have, or we're already in the
in the middle of an event, that's going to be protracted. It's going to have
blunt and widespread effects. It's also going to have deep and nuanced effects,
depending on various communities. Those attributes are going to severely test
our current public health and public safety systems. So we need to deepen the
bench of the emergency response workforce, and, for example, there are
interest groups within our community that have deep, deep knowledge about the
particular needs of specific groups. So the interest group Anthropology of Aging,
if they haven't, and forgive me if work is already going on here,
thank you. If more can be done, please do so,
but the Anthropology of Aging Interest Group can help raise awareness about the
challenge of loneliness that senior citizens, and I'll speak from a US
context, in the United States, experience on a daily basis, let alone during a time
of physical distancing. Anthropology of Children and Youth, parents and
caregivers are struggling with ""How do I help my child get through an environment
that is riven with anxiety in all the adults around them?"" Bring your expertise
to the table. The Alcohol, Drug, and Tobacco
Interest Group. Right now, substance users, who are accessing both peer support and
also support through behavioral health systems, are already experiencing
interrupted interruption of their support networks. Can you help think
about how it is that we can improvise? How they can improvise and and meet
their needs during a pandemic- pandemic setting? The mental health impacts, both
chronic, acute, and lingering after the fact, because recovery is going to be
long and drawn-out. That interest group needs to be weigh- to weigh in- to weigh in,
you know, the mental psychosocial disruptions with the pandemic and
responses to it are extraordinary and can be considered a shadow, I would have
called a shadow pandemic. Dying and Bereavement Interest Group. There will be
the experience of loss. There will be complicated grieving, particularly in the
context of rising levels of distrust, at least in the United States, and about how
well the response is being managed. Forensic anthropologists. I saw a note
from a medical examiner in a Georgia, state of Georgia,
county who worries that they're going to have problems. Is there anything that you
guys can do there? Next slide, please. All right. How about rewriting the COVID-19
narrative? I mentioned earlier the- the shadow pandemic.
Let's put mental health on the table. There is no parity right now in the
United States between physical and mental health, and it's not happening in
the pandemic. We need to work on that. Bring to the foreground the problem of
mental health. We need to broaden understanding of vulnerable populations
during the pandemic. Right now is very easy for political leaders to talk about
elderly being vulnerable to the more severe disease, more severe COVID-19
disease, and I do worry about my own elderly, frail mother, but there are other
vulnerable groups who are going unnoticed, or their needs postponed: the
incarcerated, racial and ethnic minorities, and detained immigrants. We need
to broaden our category, or broaden our narratives, around who constitutes a
vulnerable population in COVID-19. We need to also question reports of an ignorant,
selfish, and panicked public. Right now, communities are being framed in media,
oftentimes, as fear-driven, reactive, and irrational, right? Why stock up,
why have five gallons of hand sanitizer when 16 ounces will do for a month? So we
really need to dig into and help people understand what is really driving
collective behaviors or so-called panic buying behaviors? Is it because people
are facing a- an invisible threat, whether it's grave uncertainty, and where even doctors
and epidemiologists don't have all the facts just yet. Is it because they don't
trust the government and how well it is responding, and they're going to take
matters into their own hands? So this isn't about irrationality and
selfishness. It's about other- other things going on in the context around
them. We also need to capture those stories
and relay them in public discourse about pro-social and resilient behaviors,
because people are under a lot of distress, and we all need reminders about
human courage, strength, ingenuity, and resilience. So that's another way we can
rewrite the narrative, and Sam, we can talk more about this offline there's a
lot of concern about misinformation um but I'm thinking that people, are
treating misinformation much like they treat the pathogen, as if that's the
problem when it actually could be the well-being of the host. So you know, it-
with misinformation, we need to think of it as something that grows in an
environment of social fragmentation and political marginalization, and that it
alone can't do anything without that fertile soil. Next slide. Here, I would ask that we do research
that helps cut down epidemic social risks. I think we all need to recognize
that we're in a new phase of the human microbe and environmental relationship.
So the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board is saying that, you know, quote, ""We're
in a new era of high impact, potentially fast-spreading outbreaks that are more
frequently detected and increasingly difficult to manage."" That came out in
last September in their inaugural report. WHO reported nearly 1500
epidemic events had been tracked in 172 countries, all between 2011 and 2018. Much
like we're seeing a global warming, we're also seeing major transformations in
this human microbe environmental matrix. I think we need to grapple with that as
anthropologists, and Jen can weigh in this also. The science of epidemics and their
management is growing rapidly, and here, the microbiologist, the virologist, the
epidemiologist, the biomedically trained folks, and the computational modelers.
They- their science is outpacing ours, and we have got to get in the game, folks. We
have got to be at the table, and then lastly, right now, we're finding out that
the efficacy of certain containment measures is actually pretty- is not- is-
it's uncertain. It depends on the particular intervention, such as school
closures, but their socio-economic impacts are actually more certain. So
we need to help fill out the systemic knowledge we have about the risks and
benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and whether those risks
and benefits are evenly distributed. Next slide, please. And lastly, I leave you with this.
We all need to model human connections in the context of contagion. All of us
can do this. You may not know a lick about the history of stigma and
outbreaks, but I bet you do. You may know nothing about epidemiology, and as a
background for knowledge, it doesn't matter.
There are things that you, as a human being, anthropological or not, that you
can do. You can pitch in with groceries, supplies, and moral support, when elderly
and other high-risk groups must avoid public spaces. You can do that in your
community. You can help improvise childcare and meal solutions, when work
and school routines become disrupted for your neighbors. You can love on a
hospital worker, okay? They are going to be seeing less and less of their family
the more time passes. They're probably going to be worried a lot about getting
sick themselves, particularly given anticipated shortages in personal
protective equipment. They may see their co-workers becoming sick. They need some
love, folks. So if you can help cook a meal for their family, do it. We all need
to learn psychological first aid to help others cope with outbreak-related stress
and trauma. It's available for free. Six hours of training at the Johns Hopkins
Center for Public Health Preparedness. If you're a baker, bake some- bake so- bake some
muffins, and take them to your neighbor. Of course, you know, hand them over safely,
from infection control. I'm- and then connect with family, friends, and
co-workers via telephone, text, snail mail email, Skype, you name it. Do it, and I will
stop there, and turn it over to you, Kristin. KRISTIN: All right. Thank you so much, Monica, and thank you to all of our speakers, really.
We are running short on time, but I want to assure everybody to begin with that
we have been collecting all the questions, the great questions that have
been listed in the chat, and what we're gonna do is if you've registered for
this webinar, you are now also registered in our AAA Communities page, whether
you're a AAA member or not, you're part of that page. I have been already, on
that page, there is a library tab, where we can put resources and documents, and
I've put some on there already. There's been a number of documents that have
been shared in the chat window. Thank you so much for adding more additional
documents. So what we'd like to do is add them all into that library source, so we
have one place to get to them. If we don't get to any of the questions, we'll
post them in there, and if our speakers are able to, as time is available to them,
maybe they can reply to them there, and with that, I wanted to start, let's see, we
have a few, we have about 15 minutes left. So I- we have collected some of the
questions, and I know one that came up a few times. Jen, if you're still on here,
maybe you can answer it. One that came up multiple times is in earlier today, there
was a press conference with President Trump, who had used the phrase that [inaudible]
by the hour, and a few people had posted their questions in there, hoping that
maybe you could respond to that, if that is indeed happening. JENNIFER: I'm sorry, what was
that about the death, I mean, it cut out for a second, death toll, what? KRISTIN: President Trump
announced in a press conference that death tolls were going up by the hour, and 
a few people had questions. JENNIFER: I mean, I don't think it's by the hour, necessarily.
I don't think we collect data that rapidly, but yes, I mean, I think we should
expect every day to see new cases and deaths. Part of it is expanding, we are
expanding our surveillance, and as you probably have- if you've seen the news, you
know that the the number of tests we're doing is not even close to being enough,
and there's a strong push to try to increase the testing, so we will see
those things go up, the- as we expand testing, and you know,
just, the more people we find having illness, the more deaths we will find, of
course. That said we will not see an impact from the measures that we are
employing right now for some time, probably weeks. So just kind of hold that
in your head at the same time. KRISTIN: All right. Thanks, Jen.
I wanted to- we've got questions for each one of our speakers, but I wanted to give
a chance to kind of rotate around. Sam, one of the questions,
it seemed may be geared towards you, was looking at, there's lots of projections,
and as Jen even mentioned in- in her slides and the one kind of tough slide
for everybody, the big question is, ""How long will this last?"" and kind of looking
at projections, and one of the questions was how to look at, kind of [inaudible]
articles as misinformation, or how to kind of understand how people are
wrapping their heads around the length of this.
SAM: I don't know that I have a really good answer for that, which- which I think, as a
society, that's an answer that we all need to get more comfortable with. KRISTIN: Yes. JENNIFER: I mean, it's Jennifer, I- I don't have an
answer for it, either. I mean, from- from an epi standpoint, we don't have an answer
for the disease. I mean, I think everybody looks at China, and thinks, ""Wow, they've
been able to bring it down"", but like I said, that's- those effects are temporary,
and so I think we have to look simultaneously at two things: ""How long
does the virus persist in our society?"", and that's partially a function of- of
our response the measures we're taking now could stretch it out, will stretch
it out, and then we also have to ask, ""How long can we maintain this response?"", and
that's a totally separate question, and I think we haven't adequately even begun
to answer that, and I- this is- my worry is that the decisions about what responses
we're taking are purely driven by the disease numbers, and I think there are
larger factors to consider as well that aren't being discussed as they should be.
SAM: I think in terms of assessing articles and assessing projection, I think we need
to use the same tools that- that we've used in the past, which is: check sources,
weigh against what's been published and what we consider to be credible sources
elsewhere. There's, and then in terms of our sharing behavior, th- there's
something that- that people call the ""nudge to accuracy"" or the ""accuracy nudge"", which
is to- if you encourage people to think just for a couple of seconds about the
concept of accuracy that, before they share an article, that there's some
evidence that that can improve that- the sort of overall accuracy of what gets shared.
I'm paraphrasing a lot there, but- but that's sort of the idea. KRISTIN: All right. Thank you, 
Jen and Sam, for that. One question to you Monica. Someone had asked if there
was a good toolkit that you would recommend to combat stigma? Specific ways 
we think of as this progresses on and stigma continuing to have impacts and
ripple effects. Is there any toolkit you would recommend for people to kind of
turn to or refer people? MONICA: Sure. The Crisis and Emergency
Risk Communication, or CERC, Manual that comes out of the Centers for
Disease Control has some good stigma antidotes that- that are more communicate-
communication-based. At our website, at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health
Security, we put together a two-pager that describes stigmatization, xenophobia,
and blame, and then also gives top communicators, health officials and
elected officials, some tips about how they can frame the problem of COVID-19
in ways that enhance solidarity and mitigate stigma. Others on the line may
have other suggestions, but I send you at least there to start. KRISTIN: Alright, great, thank
you. We can add that- that link to our page too. KRISTIN: For- maybe this is for Jen or for any
of our speakers, there's a few questions asking around comorbidity. If we are
seeing, one, with people, is there any data on comorbidity actually affecting the
efficacy of the tests? And then another angle of comorbidity, thinking of people
with chronic conditions that possibly aren't getting the care that they need
out of fear of going to the hospital or going to their health care provider. JENNIFER: So I
assume the comorbidities we're talking about are things like the underlying
health issues, like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and I haven't
seen anything that suggests that the test wouldn't be as accurate. The test
just kind of swabs the back of somebody's throat, and then looks for the
presence of genetic material associated with the virus, so I can't see why that
would be less accurate, but I think the latter question about- about the whole
access to care and whether this will dissuade people, and- and even if they're
not personally dissuaded, I mean, we know that health systems are completely
pivoting to be cancelling other elective procedures, and basically, you know, trying
to reduce you know the number of people who are coming into their facilities.
One, so they can focus on the COVID-19 patients, but two, so that they can keep, you
know, infections out in people who aren't sick enough to be hospitalized, and this
I really, really worry about. I mean, we heard stories in China where, you know, if
you had- if you were being treated for cancer or HIV, you know, you basically had
to forego treatment, because they basically said, ""We can't accommodate you
right now"", and this is well-documented in- in epidemic situations. This idea that,
you know, there are ancillary health impacts, and I d- and I think, in
Monica's, you know, plea to kind of account for some of the social impacts
of the control measures, that we also need to account for the other health
impacts, and if we are, you know, it's not good if we save somebody's life from
COVID-19 but they de- they die of something else that could have otherwise
been treated. You know, in West Africa, as you probably, I'm sure everybody knows,
that, you know, the- when you added up all the health-related
deaths, the things, the health-related impacts beyond just the number of cases
was actually quite, quite large, and possibly dwarfed- dwarfed just the case
numbers. KRISTIN: All right. Thank you. For Monica, one of
the questions was, ""What would-"" I think everyone felt inspired with kind of
solid call to actions that we can do in our community and then also that
anthropologists can do and taking down the walls of the classroom. What would do
you think, will be the most important message that anthropologists should be
giving to either the public health workers or offices or who they're
working with on the local level? What's an important message for anthropologists
to send out? MONICA: Well. Oh, actually, if- well, there's a lot of
messages so this is an important message, but if you work with a community and
have both language and cultural competence in a local community that
sits at the margins or is marginalized from- from community life and health
officials are going to have a harder time to earn their trust, bring your
expertise to your local health department, and- and let them know that
you have both language and cultural insights that can help, and- and
particularly, if you already have some relationship with that community. So I'd
highly recommend that you insert yourself offer your- offer your skills
there. KRISTIN: All right, great. Thank you. Jen, another
question, or for any of our speakers too, thinking of seasonality, I know a lot of
people are wondering, and I know you mentioned in your slides, we don't really
know what's gonna happen with warmer weather. There were some questions in the
chat about are we able to gain any knowledge or thoughts to answer this on
the southern hemisphere, or what's happening in [inaudible], kind of thinking of warmer
weather? JENNIFER: You know, I think it's really hard to tell because of so many
differences in surveillance right now, so I- I don't see an easy way to do this
with current surveillance numbers. Just current case data. I do know that when
we were first talking about this possibility of seasonality, Singapore
stood out as a particularly uncomfortable example, because it was a
much warmer, humid climate, and they were seeing a rapid expansion in cases
despite those conditions. They've since brought their case numbers down ,but
through- through, you know, through aggressive public health measures. Did it-
was it also aided by continuing warmer, you know, the changing climate? I can't
really say. Coronaviruses, the ones that circulate all the time, do have a
seasonality, so I think there is some hope that this may too, but we also don't know
if the seasonality is purely a function of weather, and, you know, and its effect,
you know, on the virus, but also people's behavior changes in the summer, and we're
less less inclined to sit around and cough on each other. So if we- if we
artificially change that, because we are, you know, all homebound, its- it's hard for me
to imagine what's going to happen. KRISTIN: And there was another- a few other
questions, if I kind of squish them together, on demographics and risks. So we
know- we've heard a lot about the elderly. There's some questions if we can pull
any other data of other- other demographics that are susceptible. Do we
know any differences across sex, across ethnicity, across racial groups? JENNIFER: There had
been a question about whether- why- men seem to be more frequently reported
among the cases, and I think that that's largely been resolved to not being
necessarily a function of the disease, and if there were an overweighting of
men, it could have been more linked to social networks and- and who was
exposing whom, but so, there was one kind of question about that, but the data
haven't really continued that where we still see lots of women getting it. Other
demographics, no, and- and what we know now is that, you know, there's- there's these
underlying health conditions, and we know that there's advanced age, but
unfortunately those two things tend to go together, so it's hard to delink them
for age. We haven't done the studies yet. MONICA: Kristin, could I jump in here? Just like
we're trying to monitor for the impacts of physical disease, we also need to be
monitoring for the mental health impacts. I was talking to a psychologist a day or
two ago. She is worried about increases in rates of domestic abuse as families
are on top of each other during a period of intense social and economic distress.
So I- I think we need to have the- the surveillance systems in place also for
mental health impacts and to know their differential manifestations. Thank you.
KRISTIN: So we are running out of time, and I just want to acknowledge, I see a
few comments in the chat, I realize that we have not been able to get to every
single issue that we would like to discuss. Also that this is happening on a
global scale. A lot of the presentation was focused on
the America side. We don't want to exclude the rest of the globe. What I'm
hoping we can do as the discussion is to continue the discussion going forward
and continue this being an ongoing discussion and collaboration. So we have
the community's platform on the AAA site. It would be great if
we can continue and expand and have a more holistic discussion of all
different types of angles and topics and places in the world and recognizing how
differently this is impacting people globally. So please, we will try to take
all of the presentations, all of the questions that were in there that have
not been answered. We will try to post those in there, but I encourage everybody
to be active in there. I also want, before we have to close out, I want to mention
that this is a series of webinars being put on by the AAAs, and so there's
actually a Responsive Teaching and Learning Environment one, and the first
part of that happened yesterday. The recording will be accessible on AAAs. Part two is actually happening next Tuesday, on March 24th. The link is in
here. All of these webinars will be recorded and available. If you go to the
American Anthropology website, and then just go to webinars, and I also encourage
you please to fill out our expertise database. It's a Google survey form. It
only takes a few minutes to fill it out and that way we can actively gather
people and experts to respond. I also don't want to finish without saying
thank you, so special thank you to each of our speakers. To Jen, to Sam, and to Monica,
thank you so much for taking your time and sharing your expertise, and I must
also thank the American Anthropological Association, particularly Ed, Jeff, Scott, and
Gabrielle. They have been the ones behind the scene holding all the logistics and
putting it all together to- for us, so we truly appreciate all the help here. DEON: And-
as- and- and Society for Medical Anthropology for their support. KRISTIN: Yes. So
thank you, everyone. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of our discussion, and
we can continue having a discussion and connections and collaboration on our platform in the Communities. DEON: And- it's Deon again. I just
posted the link to the survey. Everybody's saying thank you so you, which we
appreciate, thank you, but scroll back, you'll see where I
posted it. At 2:30, I posted it. KRISTIN: All right. Thank you so much, and we look
forward to continue working together through our way through this. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 1: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 2: Thanks so much, all. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 3: Bye, everyone.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 4: Thanks, bye. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 5: Bye, everyone. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 6: Thank you. ",True,False,False,False

143,z-AbR66dkVQ,CNA Insider,COVID-19: How To Sell Beef Rendang And Fresh Fish Online | Making The Digital Leap | Ep 1/4,2020-10-20T12:00:14Z,"3 digital experts from Chope, Shopee and Love, Bonito go undercover to help 3 family businesses go digital. But instead, they uncover a tradition of strange fish, fancy lace and beef rending. Jumrin Isrin is the head chef of Nasi Warong Pariaman, one of Singapore's oldest suriving nasi padang stalls. But sales are down as COVID-19 puts the brakes on tourist arrivals and big catering events. With their competitors winning a head start on an online presence, how can Jumrin keep up when a staff shortage limits the food they can cook? When Jagjit “Jacky” Singh took over Bobby Fabrics from his dad, it was a thriving textile shop selling high-end fabric and lace to tourists. But with no tourists and his first attempt to get online a costly failure, can once bitten and now twice shy Jacky overcome his skepticism, or will he be forced to watch the business his father built die? Uma Naidu and her daughter Kisha are fishmongers and own a stall at the Tekka Wet Market. But with their produce bought mostly by foreign workers who are now stuck in their dormitories, where will they find new customers who can appreciate their unusual fish?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",they've been around for over 40 years last time business is very very good now people buy in from online in a fast modernizing society and a global pandemic that's keeping everyone at home these businesses are facing the toughest challenge 2020 was my worst year it's quite difficult because the rental is so high on the red dot wants to lend these traditional businesses a helping hand we've brought on board three digital stalwarts the problem is on the facebook or instagram they can't feel the quality these experts have conquered the online world but this could be their most challenging task yet we got limit our time i cook 10 o'clock if they order a bit late then i'm sorry you cannot entertain them how will they help these family businesses make the digital league [Applause] every morning i reach here around six o'clock in the morning [Music] israel is the second generation head chef of warang nasi paryaman regarded by many as the oldest surviving nasi padang stall in singapore last time this area a lot of food outlets are made by tents you know around this kandahar street area and when the nea demolished the tents they moved to beach road rocket center so they've been centralized there but warang nasi paryaman remained on the street and being one of the oldest nasi padang stores it thrived pariaman prides itself in serving authentic indonesian cuisine dishes like beef rendang i am gulai and i am bakar all the main dishes are cooked by charcoal from last time until now now we'll be is one of the best in singapore we still maintain the ingredients because we want to cook entertain this is our standard last time we got a lot of tourists coming here indonesian malaysian indonesian wherever they go they must eat nasi padang last time we got say one group of thirty one bus but now they cannot come enough lifestyle is so crowded you know this almost half carrierman offers delivery services on the pick and go platform we got another order got one more order from but managing delivery orders has always been difficult for a team unused to serving takeaways we tell them our customers if you really need our delivery you must call us around 9 to 10 30 11 o'clock sorry i cannot manage the delivery anymore because our food is running so quickly because we already pre-cooked the dishes if they order a bit late that's a problem right not enough workers there to do the packing to do serving no chilia i don't want to go with deliveries because if you want to deliver it you must have somebody permanently at the counter answer jamie don't like so many delivery we want to do the cashiering then we want to take care of the delivery we cannot do but the pariaman team might have little choice since the pandemic hit business at pariaman has fallen by 30 compared to the same period last year and until global travel resumes jumerin and yanti need to rely on deliveries and other digital avenues to stay alive meet the team brought in by on the red dot they're here to help our traditional businesses with a digital transformation well i went down to guangzhou parliament most of the people there could be my dad's age my granddad's age so they grew up together with pretty much dinesh balasingam is the chief business officer and a founding member of chope one of asia's largest dining reservations apps two weeks ago he visited the restaurant have we been coming back here for a long time 50 years okay i used to stay here okay so this has been here for a long time then yeah yeah vincent memories i've been eating here for more the good than 20 the food is it's authentic food so that's like one problem solved you know the product you know the quality is there yeah exactly yeah but the other different nasi palin stores just around the corner have kind of digitalized and still and they also attracted a younger crowd correct cannot scale basically right correct so what would you recommend for one person is that mata okay i'll try that was this soup or this one oh no more do you guys stock up after no no you don't i'll take the potato please is this sambal going they did kind of experiment like a tiny bit with like take away pick up and delivery on this app but once you make the order online it's not instantly confirmed so you don't know whether you're going to get item or not you have to wait for a call for someone to tell you live so it's not like exactly so that makes it like really very frustrating maybe there are other ways that we can look at that probably meal plans probably something where you can have a fixed idea of how many people um are going to be ordering how many days in advance yeah so they can plan accordingly right exactly the meal plans dinesh is referring to are set meals that can be ordered in advance from two days to even a month ahead [Music] just being at wara nasi paraman is very clear as a traditional institution it's a little bit stuck in the past talking to the customers and just watching the family work behind the scenes the joy they bring to their customers and through the connections that they have i feel that's so special and that's worth preserving [Music] this is where i grew up [Music] those days is a hub of textiles in southeast asia [Music] this is thai silk and this is raw soup from india and we have taiser embroidery it's all colorful and they use this for baju kurung and jacket skirt and we have a french list for dresses evening wear and we have japanese cotton and we have all these cotton embroidery from switzerland i helped my father to improve the business four times more i try to bring in all the beautiful items from switzerland italy germany so that we can sell as a unique quality this business means a lot to me but since the pandemic no weddings no festivities no gatherings means no customers for bobby fabrics and sales have dropped almost 95 percent a few years ago we had tried doing the sales online but they asked for sample every time we send the sample to them they sit looking at a computer and looking at the fabric is a lot different the orders doesn't come back to me and the course of sending the sample is also quite high and i lost about thousand over dollars this moment i generally continue business with so much thought how to clear i don't know also will our digital advocates be able to persuade father and son to put their past failure behind them and give digitization another try so bobby's fabric is a store along arab street where they import and sell a whole range of fabrics from all over the world rachel lim runs one of singapore's most successful fashion labels and she has an idea of how to take jackie singh's family textile business to the next level when i was in the store i got to really explore the different kinds of fabrics that he had and i must say that he really has quite an extensive range we have italy china india these are from switzerland how often do you source for new i bring in every three months i saw a few fabric shops but i think you have better choices you see mine actually is very exclusive the other shops all are selling the same items yeah yeah ours is a high end he's struggling now obviously also because i think he's also very heavily dependent on tourists so before kovit [Music] sixty percent my business is all tourists most of them like from myanmar they'll buy quite a big range but right now there's no no one can come in no one came so he's stuck because he doesn't know where to get new clients and doesn't know where to spread the word about what he has to offer basically i think what's important for bobby's fabrics would be to go online i think that's where customers are today i understand from jackie that he actually dabbled you know being online a couple of years back and he lost quite a bit of money so i think he has a bit of phobia in that area how do we get him you know on not just an e-commerce platform but more importantly on social media like facebook and instagram has been selling fish here for the past 15 years earning enough to raise her two children as a single mom [Music] seven years ago her daughter keisha joined her mom [Music] many here are second and third generation hawkers but as customers seek more convenient sources for their fresh produce footfall has dropped 16 in the past five years having a business is not easy she doesn't have anybody and my brother is not interested in the business this used to be teca in its heyday and this is techa market now kovit 19 has slashed business for most of the stalls here by more than half the pandemic has crippled their steady stream of regulars eighty percent of which are foreign workers now quarantined in their dormitories foreign [Music] elijah young is the head of business development at e-commerce giant shopee so pk fish i actually went to tekka market to check it out it's about 6 p.m which was quite interesting because most wet markets were closed in the afternoon yeah but they were actually open at 6. uma and kisha didn't know then that elijah has been brought in by red dot to help them hi hi i'm just looking to cook something for my mom she likes fish i was just not really sure what's good for soup you want to try uh batang or you want to try it which one is that what's interesting also is that they carry very unique assortment of fish that i have not really seen before or eat them because i wasn't really sure how i could cook this fish it becomes a little bit tricky yeah cause it's a little bit more red it's very rare but i think the key thing is that they are just not common fish that uh singaporeans would eat what's this one that one is coral torah okay never seen this before this is actually salt fish sun deep fried very nice many indian customers did buy this one very famous indian workers okay she really needed to reach out to a different customer base beyond the dormitory workers which means to the typical singaporeans like you and me to be able to buy from you so you want this yes but can i have it sliced ken i can do whatever you want okay when i was looking at how she packaged the fish they definitely wouldn't last if you try to sell them online because you just read the newspaper and for fresh seafood you definitely need some sort of ice do you have social media i do have okay cool can i add you on the social media k-i s-h-a n-a-i-i first one oh this is your personal one yeah do you have a phone professional i do have but i don't use that much social media is the fastest way we know to connect to to uh people and i've actually seen some of the sellers in her industry that's done quite well with live streaming especially when it comes to raw food it saves them a physical trip down exactly yeah i think what would be really cool is that we can get a local youtuber yeah local youtuber who is like a home cook that can actually cook some of a really unique assortment and how we can actually use that fish to make really delicious dinash can you cook uh i can't i can eat but i definitely know people who can cook for eating yeah you can get uh like personalities or influencers to come on board to share more about not just the kinds of fish that are available but also how to cook how to cook it elijah intends to get kisha to sell her fish through live streaming while rachel wants jackie to give social media another shot will they succeed in convincing both keisha and jackie oh she's better hello hi hello mr jackie nice to see you again yes i'm rachel if you remember i came a couple of days back right right rachel is about to suggest some strategies to help jackie make the digital league i understand that you actually have a facebook page yes bobby fabrics but it started off more as a personal page where you share more about your personal soccer updates things like that yeah one word of advice jackie i think we can have a personal account and a professional account solely for the company so i think try to keep it separate so that people can also know which page to go to for more updates on your store all right instagram you also have right yes so you have post in 2018 but since then it was not that correct the problem is they can't feel the quality no but i think it's important to also attract them to get them to calm down to ask for certain specific things that they saw online so we will be also connecting you to a fashion blogger to also help you with the instagram page although you may not see immediate results i think it's important because when they need fabrics they would remember that hey i transfer bombing fabrics i'll just go and check out i think this will really help you pivot in your business and i think more importantly for yourself right jackie to have that mindset to really embrace this change and new era of businesses beginning i do not need social media or facebook or instagram because my business was doing well but i willing to learn going to be a bit challenging but i will learn all these things [Music] hello hello thank you for having me at warang nasi paryaman dinesh presents yanti and jumrin his idea of creating fixed meal plans for delivery so one of the things we talked about for delivery was that you always ask people to order earlier nine o'clock ten o'clock eleven o'clock so you have time to process your orders to prepare daily we cook the same volume of dishes see like just now we have some pre-ordered this still we go along the line what we cook now only we put a bit extra even we have more deliveries we still cook the same volume of the dishes we cannot stock up too much of course which is why one of the things about meal plans which makes it great is people can order two days three days in advance so you know how much ingredients you need to buy then you can roughly know what you need and because it's a plan you can tell them these are the different things you can have meal plans are essentially easy ways for people who are not fans of making a lot of decisions on a daily basis about their food being able to plan in advance ordering a set meal for at least two to three days in advance that way restaurants get the information early they get to give like variety and also plan their inventory a lot better i want you to think about some meal plans that people you think would be able to order and we'll see how we can onboard you on maybe something better than your current delivery platform which is going to be very easy to use that's in advance minimal feeds at about five percent i think we can consider on this challenge accepted and we'll see what you can come up with with joomran and yante on board it's elijah's turn to convince kisha to take her wide variety of fresh and unusual fish online [Music] so i see you have really amazing fish and your customers they really like you they say they come because you're great and the fish is fresh okay and i wanted to see how shoppie can help you but do you do seafood yes we do we actually have some sellers that started doing live streaming on shopping you can actually showcase how fresh your fish is the goose the gills how red they are yeah yeah your customers said that if they are able to see that the fish is fresh and they be able to get their fish delivered to them in a cheap manner they are happy to buy online and we can actually help you reach out to a different target audience what do you think actually yeah i do want to reach out to different people live streaming as its name suggests involves sellers hawking their produce on social media for the customer all they have to do to make a purchase is to click on an icon in the comfort of their homes and the food is delivered to them the experts have spoken pk fish supplier will attempt live streaming next warang nasi paryaman prepares a new menu of meal plans on chope and jackie must bite the bullet to ramp up his social media presence i think jackie actually is quite willing to take on the task of you know digitizing the business maybe also because he feels that he has reached a point where he doesn't really have any other choice i think they were pretty receptive to some of the ideas especially yanti i think as someone who's maybe a little bit younger she's looking forward to new solutions or doing the business a little bit different uncle june a little bit more reserved i think what was holding kisha back was the lack of manpower but i think if she can hire a few staff to manage some of the things that she's doing and she herself given that she has the knowledge as well as the passion to actually introduce her products i think she will be actually great in front of the camera to do this live streaming herself ,True,True,False,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",india's prime minister narendra modi has for the first time sounded the alarm about the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the country's rural hinterlands he's urging villagers to keep informed about covet 19 and seek medical help if unwell is with about 343 000 new infections india's total tally has now passed 24 million experts blame india's second wave on state elections that went ahead last month despite escalating infections an investigation is underway to find out if kobe 19 protocols were followed during campaigning in the state of uttar pradesh alone more than 700 teachers roped in to help with the polls have died from covert 19. foreign joins us live from new delhi for more ishan prime mr modi finally acknowledging the crisis in india's countryside absolutely steve and it was only a matter of time before he did that because the numbers that we've been seeing from the rural areas have been absolutely staggering in the state of uttar pradesh the most popular state in the country almost 70 percent of all infractions are now coming almost 60 percent rather infections are coming from rural areas and india's largest state of rajasthan there about 70 percent of all cases are coming from rural areas so it's increasingly becoming a rural pandemic now prime minister modi pointed out that there are two very important things that people need to do first of all is the role of covert appropriate behavior so wearing of masks and following social distancing and experts are already poking holes in this theory because they are saying that the concept of mask if anybody has ever been to rural india doesn't really exist that a lot of people are not scientifically literate enough to understand how masks are going to protect themselves there not a lot of pharmacies in rural areas where the medical health infrastructure is extremely poor so uses of mass is going to be an issue in rural hinterlands and as for social distancing because of the scientific illiterate community the um adherence to social norms and protocols like this can also be very difficult to enforce now the second point that prime minister modi made about the role of local leaders and panchayatis that's going to be incredibly important i've been speaking to experts trying to understand how one does send across this message of the correct treatment and diagnosis of covert 19 and just the current understanding of one when one should go to a medical professional and they say that local leaders people who are trusted by the villages they have to play an absolutely crucial role but at the same time there are calls uh uh to the government asking for a renewed support structure for the medical health infrastructure because that's what's going to be absolutely important currently a number of people have to travel tens of kilometers to reach the nearest cities where medical infrastructure is available and because of all of these factors combined uh the pandemic that was once contained in urban centers is absolutely ravaging through the rural areas right now prime minister modi's also defended the vaccination rollout of his administration yes he has he said that the country is now on a war footing and that the government is making all necessary efforts to make sure that people are vaccinated on a priority basis the government has also clarified time and again through a number of health ministry press briefings that the priority at the moment is to give the first dose of the vaccine to people above the age of 45 and the expanded vaccination drive which includes people between the age of 18 and 44 is an optional one so states can choose to vaccinate these people if they've got the resources and it seems clear from the government's idea that um the priority right now is to protect the vulnerable groups now the government is saying that it does have enough vaccines and it's also hoping that it will have about two billion shots by the end of this year which will mean that there won't be a vaccine shortage but the problem really here is that the government is including a number of potential jobs that are yet to be approved by the medical regulators in the country and at the moment only two vaccines have been approved and the quota of those two vaccines is only good for a few million doses so experts are saying that instead of making promises to the government to the public that two billion doses would be available the government should ramp up the existing domestic manufacturing i may thanks for that update ishan garg speaking to us from new delhi ,True,False,False,False

John Lim: http://www.instagram.com/johnjohnah","hello everyone welcome to episode of in my opinion my name is John Lester and I'm patron I'll give you a very special today and she is our friend actually more a Lester's friend maybe you want to do a bit of introduction yourself so hi guys I am patron I'm currently studying in Peking University in beta I'm by entering scholar there and I'm right now holding up in Singapore with all of you very good very good okay so actually uh we power story super interesting and then like because she has come from painting right which is like the epicenter of sorry the country which has the epicenter of everything and eventually made her way to Singapore while still living part of her stuff in China right most of my stuff is all in China actually yeah okay so today we are having heard a patient here today so that we can talk a little bit about all these lists Kavita his situation especially from the perspective of somebody who has been to multiple countries and different systems within the past few months and then having made it back safely home yeah I think yeah there are a lot of times like we I sing opera especially when we discuss these topics it's always in like just taking the Singapore context in in in mind but it's nice to die once in a while just kind of like the way other countries see what they're doing and see where we can improve and what we have done well as nationally and I think like you'll be able to provide some valuable insight so maybe you want to save us a little bit on on maybe a quick recap of what has happened right since the time you were in picking University and eventually making about Singapore well I mean thanks guys for having me and for letting me share my story so what happened was that on January 21st which is when Wuhan went under under lockdown I was actually in Surabaya I wasn't in Beijing because in January it was our winter break for Chinese New Year which in China to collect rent Zia and all of the stuff other international students we were traveling around we some of us were in China some of us were not but basically in we were given no notice at all we just receive a message on WeChat saying that we were no longer allowed to enter our dormitories because of what happened in Wuhan and therefore all the universities were prohibiting international students or even any student even a local students from re-entering the dorms so all of us were just caught completely off guard all my stuff is though that I've been living out of a suitcase like a tiny suitcase for the past 4 months because I haven't been able to go back reenter China and I had to reschedule all my plans to figure out what I was gonna do because I didn't know I was living with just complete absence of any knowledge of what was going to happen next I didn't know when school will start I didn't know where to go so because I had a bunch of friends in the States and they said you know right now Southeast Asia and Asia in general is not the safest place because back then you know Singapore was the country with one of the highest rates of kovat 19 this was in January right you're saying there was in January yeah and then so I decided to go to the States because I thought everything would blow over soon and then from the states fly back to Beijing that was a plan but I ended up being stuck in the States for six weeks in February I mean so uh yeah I'll enter the States on February 10th and I left the state's March 25th where everything was just you know going downhill for the states for New York especially because I was based in New York for six weeks yeah okay so that means you're just done with your stay home notice laughs I have to stay home for the rest of the month so I guess yeah notice and I entered a lockdown or a country in a second okay okay so very good so like having been to China and then Surabaya and then after it to the States and then now you're back in Singapore I believe you have a little bit of a better understanding than most of us about what people are doing around the region so maybe you want to say that's what do you think of what Singapore has been doing for the nineteen situation as compared to all these countries that you have been doing well I think the Singapore government responds has been exceptional if you compare it to other countries so we conducted aggressive testing from the very beginning and way back in January we before we even got our first keys of carbon 19 we were already preparing for it because we have lived through SARS and we know that we are susceptible to such a pandemic because of our proximity and relationship with China and we have a lot of traffic from China so we it was it was inevitable that we would be hardest hit from you know if we didn't take any precautions so in that sense of aggressive testing our you know very clear communication channels between the people and a government and as well as the very meticulous contact tracing that's something that other countries did not do in early January I mean late January and in February until March where other countries believing that I mean I'm thinking right now of maybe the states because I was in the States and when I entered the states they were really no trucks of balance no checks on like who was who had come in I've seen a lot so they only asked me at immigration if I've had if I had been to China for the past 14 days to which I unset truly know I haven't and that was all no one took my temperature like no one scanned me for anything and I was no quarantine there was no there were measures because because I think they just thought it was so far away from China that it wouldn't affect them right I understand is like in fairy Allah this is what the states was doing if everywhere actually in Singapore February was loss contour injury yes correct it was pretty painful remember but life for some I think everyone was looking at the states as well because like like the states was seemingly doing nothing like I always say I always tell my friends dislike the Western eye consumer law Western media I think a lot of people do but it seems like the Western media were not caring about a core of errors or Co V 1900 at a time and then suddenly when the states when New York became like a new epicenter or like when he started more rampant problem in the States suddenly now all I can see on my Facebook and everything are Cobie related news and I think they're like a bit later on is the thing yeah it's quite interesting that like like even when everyone else was panicking they were just like chew mm mm if I remember that was the period whereby the politicians were saying like like oh you know it's gonna be all right we are like super ready you know there's nothing to worry about please go out and continue party yeah so when I was in the States and life was just going on as per usual people who are treating coab at 19 I got like a meme that was a very China specific mean and they were just basically very lackadaisical about it and because I was living with friends who are American citizens you know Trump I was watching Trump briefings and he's just like he was denying that a virus was the problem in February he said that it's as serious as the flu and more people die from the flu every year then you know at that point in time bankova 19 so there's nothing to worry about he's also very concerned for re-election because right now I mean if you were it's so the election period for the president in the state it's coming up soon so he was he was really like so preoccupied with things I move domestic politics and this this cut was kind of on the back burner you know he was also dealing with the Senate who you know they were trying to impeach him and then there was just a whole lot of things that were going on I think there was just not a priority for the states in February at all I'm guessing the citizens are paying for you know yeah it seems like it because today you know we've just seen I think the mean the USA has broken a number of records today we saw 2,000 deaths happen in a single day the US has the highest cases of carbon 19 more than any other country in the wrote I mean you can say that China hasn't been China's statistics are inaccurate because maybe China has been misreporting or China has been by not testing you know there's all these conspiracy theories floating around but like it's really opposition to look at that right now you know we look at what is in front of us and it does seem that obviously the States has the highest case look so far and even surpassing Italy which was kind of the epicenter of the crisis in Europe and cost this you know entire meltdown across the Europe region which then spread to America yep yep okay wanna go back to the point about like the reelection thing cuz in Singapore we are also kind of having our general elections supposedly this year so a lot of people I mean there's been like a lot of discussion about whether general election should be held this year given the whole Kovach problem so how do you think that like I do you guys think that like it should be shoes to be held and secondly like compared to the states and how Donald Trump seems to be handling the whole reelection thing cause we've kovat the things have always been okay and got these priorities right well I had I just had this conversation with a friend in from New York yesterday so we were debating about whether it's ethical to host an election during a crisis or after a crisis for instance Wisconsin they sue the governor of Wisconsin is I mean a Democrat but it's irrelevant for now because he tried to block the election there was being held in Wisconsin but the Republicans wanted to push it through because and I write in this period where people are not supposed to be going out because it's unsafe but because they still do that you know traditional like letterbox voting like the Republicans are essentially trying to force a very unsafe election whether it's either you wrote because you know voting is not compulsory in the States so I don't you put your line your life in the line to vote or you don't vote at all so you're forcing voters into this dichotomy and then so even though the Wisconsin governor tried to block this election the Supreme Court ruled that in this election was legal and a lot the election to take place so you so on you know on videos of people just queueing up not observing safety distances or people who just don't maybe just don't have mosques but then you know it's either you vote and have your voice hurt or not at all so in that sense it's definitely gerrymandering and I believe it was quite an unethical move to me yeah yeah but then and then maybe you could draw a parallel in this case to Singapore I don't think the Singapore government will host or we'll run an election during the pandemic period what I think is that election and election might happen immediately after we have been through the worst because crisises tend to privilege the incumbent governments and for in the u.s. like wartime presidents have always been reelected it's the same thing in the UK as well Winston Churchill was reelected after World War two because people want stability in times of crisis and if a president a leader has proven themselves capable of taking a country true a crisis people tend to wanna keep and wanna preserve make sense like this would be a human reaction exactly yeah so I think and I think I would see why the Singapore government would want to run an election after the price after crisis because this would definitely privilege their position and it would strengthen though there's of the voter base as compared to the opposition I think right now based on what you're seeing I mean politics wise right yeah definitely I feel ah citizens were very heartened by the effect wide wider by the actions of our governments now because definitely they a lot of positive effects on the general population but on the metal ethics like you mentioned I think I agree with you that like holding it right now especially during this very critical period is not something that should be the priority of the government if you truly the citizens are what you care for actually I'm very curious cos the government has been trying to push us icing up all I'm not talking about the US but in Singapore the government in trying to push us to like go forward go here the elections especially if the things die down a little bit so I'm just very curious as to why the government wants to push this forward so quickly instead of waiting here I think we I think is very important to understand therefore in order for a democratic government to work right systems systems and rules must be followed you cannot just be stopped because of something it just so happened that like this is X this is an extreme situation whereby if you don't think about it acting either way does not really give you the most desirable outcome one word one word well one would be problematic for the institution yeah will be for maintenance of the disease so which is the you know the way to act either way to ignore you or draw criticism right so I think it's not the not the right thing for citizen right now to question the government on election decisions the rediscovery ninety period because their priority I mean that trust is the trust in the government is what's important right now in order to in order to survive the situation then tell when they're thinking whether the decision is correct not you know what I'm talking about right because don't know the whole scenario is is a lot bigger than then I decided to is be well actually be is why I want to orbit researchers because is why I want that I view is a little bit petty compared to the emergency situation we're currently in yeah I think it's two things like firstly because according to the Constitution we have to have an election by next June so it's become like any government shouldn't violate the Constitution because the Constitution is what runs the country so that's point one but the second point is that I think the having an election is not necessarily a bad thing because it gives the population a chance to evaluate how the government has performed because when it doesn't necessarily always privilege incumbent because what it the incumbent does a bad job so then they would have to suffer for it at the ballot box but it is they do a good job they will be maybe disproportionately rewarded for it who knows but then so that's why in that sense it does give the population a chance to evaluate how the government has performed and in the Rif the examples that I previously raised about wartime presidents you know that tends to be the case that wartime presidents are usually reelected because the population is usually thing they've done a good job but that doesn't necessarily mean they didn't actually do a good job yes yeah yeah okay I think it's on we are talking we are talking early too much into politics here maybe we'll just come back a little bit too to how Singapore is working on this current co v19 problem right so help patient having having having been to this multiple countries right maybe you can give us a shortlist on what you think Singapore can do better as compared to what you've seen you know right yeah so I think what Singapore has room to improve in would be how we have had no the migrant workers in our community because right now we are experiencing a wave of infections and the first wave was back in January where we had you know Chinese nationals entering China entering Singapore etc and then the second wave we've corrupt that but in the second wave was when all our a lot of Singaporeans were returning from US and UK in March including myself that might have put the population at risk again because of the important cases and then a third wave that we're experiencing now is the wave coming from the migrant workers which I felt was a ticking time bomb I think the government did really well in sort of taking care of its citizens and then you know planning out these are amazing resilience unity solidarity these budgets to tide us through the economic recession that we are about to face the problem is these things don't cater or don't for migrant workers I think we've sort of neglected the migrant workers in our myths because what the government did in February and March was that they gave guidelines to dama tree operators but the fundamental problem is that these Amma tree operators were unable to abide by these guidelines such as social distancing and uh you know clean good hygiene the fewer less usage of communal areas because by the design of the dorms itself it's impossible for migrant workers to socially distance themselves from each other we have 15 in one room in one bunk and each of them have 4.5 meters of square space each and then imagine that you know everyone's trying to do laundry everyone has all your own personal belongings it's basically worse than BMT like the rooms are smaller than be empty rooms then you have the communal areas which are filthy you know we see reports of like cockroaches of lizards of pests you know trash not being clear just very poor hygiene in general in these communal areas because of the very nature of the space and then that makes it impossible for dama tree operators actually comply with the Ministry of Manpower guidelines back in February and March so even without Cove in 19 these dorms were already a big problem for the living standards of migrant workers like we aren't taking care of them enough and then carbon 19 has just exposed the reality to us that it's becoming a real problem because because once once one worker gets it you can almost guarantee that like 220 thousand people men in the same dormitory will definitely get it because the unallowed to leave like what a government is doing right now is that they're isolating each Oh sort of like a geometry of a case so five comma trees so far have been isolated that means nearly 45,000 migrant workers are in isolation what does isolation mean they can't even the colonies their rooms the guidelines is that they stay in your rooms and then for be delivered to them and unlike us you know we can go out for runs we can go out to buy food everywhere masks we can still live as normally as possible but when the migrant workers it's essentially you know the Adama trees are being turned into jails so it's a very different situation for them and for us right now yeah I think that's a very big play like criticism of the government so far like when it comes to the whole like how they have been handling Cove is that a lot of people in showing on the world live reactionary like government has been being very reactionary to what's happening so when back in like January of every a lot people were criticizing a girl for not closing like for not you know implementing like channel restrictions fast enough especially we've chained like the people from China and even now with the whole migrant worker situation like I think a lot of criticism work is coming towards a government for like not having enough foresight to see that this was going to be a problem and just reacting based on like oh now there's a huge spike in Thom cases let's do something about it so like what do you guys think about do you think the government is indeed being reactionary or is it just the product of this weird circumstances that like you can't really blame anyone for not being able to see like the future when it comes to these other things um I think our government has been I would I wouldn't say that they are not reaction to me but at the same time I would say like if there's a spectrum of reaction liability they are on the lower spec they are on the lower end of the spectrum now because I feel that despite what people may criticize about the government right this is a situation that is so new that no one in the world or no no Institute in the world is able to prop up properly like like wrap the wrap your heads around it so as a government there are many things you have to consider when the threat it's like I'm you can compare this to like war time you know so what time right war doesn't come at one go you know it escalates for a country so when a country faces a crisis like war right you will always start from a very low threat level eventually to a very high threat level and the difference between wartime and this is that war it's very much more predictable I mean it's real funny to say about war it's very much more predictable than this current new novel coronavirus so what happens is that our government has all these guidelines I believe since and from all the other operations that they may have to move forward but it's just that this situation changed so quickly they they have no choice but to work in a more reactionary manner than just like being able to act the policies and things are done it's not that simple and I feel that like 14 the government or being reactionary it's not the right way to do to approach this I think it could be if the if there's if there are critics to our government or the systems I feel that critics should be affected like during peace time during non-emergency times these were not things that were put at a top priority and that has nothing to do with reaction it's just purely no emphasis on on pandemic research and suffering and I think if you want to talk about that aspect of governance then every country in the world has been neglecting the aspect and that's why were in this situation right now it should be very fair to the Singaporean government back in January we were one of the first countries to implement a ban on travel to and fro China so despite because I haven't really been too updated with what Singaporeans on the ground have been saying I've just been looking at it from a distance comparatively the Singapore government has done a very good job if you want to look at Italy if you want to look at the UK and the USA however in this in the on for the case of migrant workers I think that was a problem that was just waiting to explode because in February you know a lot of NGOs such as transient workers can't you have already flagged out that geometries will be a problem no matter how much we try to contain a situation outside you know the dama trees are so you know physically they are in Singapore they are you know part and parcel of our social fabric even though they're not citizens so if they get it it's it's bound to spread to the community in Singapore who are not people who are not migrant workers because the pandemic does not discriminate yeah we are fighting a war right now even in a war is you know against Cove in nineteen so it's definitely not a conventional war but in the sense I think this was one of the Laguna's that we that the government might have overlooked a little bit because because yeah because they were really robust in all other areas I think I think what you mentioned is is very important and a very accurate to this particular situation I feel that in terms of preparedness for Singapore in terms of for for our government for our citizens right I feel that that the preparedness is extremely high and for most countries I would say we are already one of the top view in terms of protecting our own citizens interests but we forget that there are other people you know there are also part of our society which are people who are not necessarily citizens you know different different years of it could be purely migrant workers well in a world past I could be just long-term past people and that is where it becomes problematic especially for the lower tier workers who are housed in dormitories you know which is like what you mentioned disaster waiting to happen and I think I have this theory that like the reason why were in circuit breaker now is because when the first migrant worker infection was confirmed Singapore already the government already started to plan for this because the thing about Co v90 is that you will expose all the cracks in your system you know and in a move and a good thing about government being reactionary Alistair is that the moment this has happened right based on what they understand they immediately plan for I believe the immediate plan for this yeah I don't think okay I think that well okay well I think the government actions seem to be reactionary I don't think it's fair to expect them to prove you know if do we need to do anything else other than be reactionary especially when it comes to a brand new virus then one really knows about and sure there are some things that you can see coming and like maybe like the whole dum-dum migrant worker thing was a big problem that should have been soft button given how much strain the government has been on especially like didn't have a lot of other problems like economic problems trying to like even like getting all Singaporeans in line - not hot and not do stupid things right it was really quite a problem really much less like trying to solve any other problems so this is like I was saying you look about - meant all governments have many many things to focus on and it just so happened that this wave of kovat 19 this pandemic just came real quick and real fast and real surgical and all countries are paying for you right now yeah I think another interesting library fishing sheds an eye on this like like she also said that in China they basically just you see for what we check message and that the domes are closed and then they basically locked down Wuhan overnight and in Singapore when it was like a breakout measure like maybe gave us like five days and then the US right now compared ibly seems to be doing a lot less compared to other countries so like is this what you see as like a difference in the system or is it just a difference in ideology or what do you why do you think it's a difference in terms of govern government structure and maybe also politics so what happened in China because it's a one-party state it has the ability to shut an entire city off in the event of a crisis so when in in I rear international students we're not Chinese citizens so you know really about to reach a message telling us that we can't enter and in my flatmate had to fight her way back into the dorm to get like her stuff my my friends who were locked out of the dorms they were in Beijing but they went in the dorms at a time on the lockdown or they tried to leave the country but their passports their clothing everything at Central was back in the dorm so that was a huge issue there but in the Chinese government and a Chinese administration had no qualms about doing so so a lot of headlines that we saw in the wake of the Rohan lockdown were headlines saying things like you know China locks down an entire city any expense of human rights and human liberties then you contrast it with like one month possible at one month later and then Italy does the same thing where Italy starts a lockdown lombardi because there has an explosion of kovat 19 there well what the headlines were saying the senior sleepers were saying things like you know Italy locks down an entire region in order to save their citizens any expense of the economy so you know there was the same action but the the perspectives or that all the way that each action was portrayed was very different depending which government it originated from and I think that's definitely a maybe a little bit of sign of phobia at work in Western media but at the same time if you want to evaluate what they did so China the sacrifice a great deal in order to do to contain a virus and they took two months to contain it then you look at Singapore where we prepare for it but the thing is we eased into a near lockdown situation and even at this point in time we're not calling it a lockdown you know we so so it was gradual and so that ensured that you know our citizens were not shocked by it it also ensure that our economy was you know as least impacted as possible yes it's possible yeah correct as cushioned as possible so and then we've like active communication between all Prime Minister and the people there was something that was very much lacking in all other countries and cities so in Italy at the beginning of February they were telling everyone that carbon 19 is as serious as the flu it's basically no big deal it only affects you of your oat and if you're young please continue to go out and party if not our economy would collapse those what the Italian government was telling its people so when in that tract at an infirmary and set into lockdown entire regions people would is confused because people were like why you told us it was it's just the flu you know why are we he said I mean growing under lockdown because the Italian government realized that near their health care system was under siege it just couldn't take the influx have covered 19 cases and you realize they've got a real problem on your hands so it's it just boils down to good communication between the government people the honest and be upfront about what we're dealing with and that was what Singapore succeeded in doing the government was honest with us telling its people about the severity of the of the virus and that's why people started hoarding you know way back in January people were hoarding toilet paper were queuing up and int you see now now we're seeing that we pay across the globe because that's how people act in times of panic in crisis yeah and in the States as well like so what happened was that I was stuck in New York for a longer time than I expected to because I didn't know that things would escalate so badly I knew would get that but not that bad and what happened was that overnight New York and New York City like restaurants were suddenly prohibited from opening that all restaurants were ordered to close and the thing is that's way more serious you know the the estimation of measures were ramped up faster in New York because cases were also increasing at a higher rate and you don't then Singapore but that's because in February there wasn't much being done about it at a federal level yes I think I think for Singapore we are quite a lucky country because we are I would say our government is not as authoritarian as the one that is in China even though it is a lot more authoritarian than the one in I would say maybe the United States so as a result of that right and forcing some of the stricter and more harsh control measures in order to stop the pandemic that the citizens might not agree with right was something that Singapore quickly activate no and as a result of that I would say that we currently and we were originally improving along for for fall and I know in terms of the situation but right now there's another exposed crack in our system which I believe the government has very very quickly in a semi-auto Rotarian fashion right put in all the correct blocks to try to solve that and I think that's one of the things that we can be grateful for in our country because we're able to act on that without restricting too many of our civil liberties and personal freedom yeah I think it's very easy to like as I say in a start-up is so very easy to like just see everything that's what I've been doing in like a very tunnel vision way but I think is nice to kind of like take a step back sometimes to do it like the rest of the war and seeing like how the rest of the world in comparing was a sauce cause I remember as a period of time where we were saying that holding was like a war behavior and like men Singapore Singapore is son because you hot bomb the people every other stupid yeah yes I need the whole world owes it I didn't know I didn't know yeah I didn't know like sorry didn't I was the third world country so like it's so nice to like once I water sighs take a step back okay do you know what here's where we are compared to everyone else here's what I need to do better be grateful for we have a solar correct and I think this perspective is important especially if you want to be appreciative about what you have because when you have perspective you don't you start to focus on not the things that you don't have oh and it is easier to be grateful when you see the things that you actually have yeah alright I guess patient you have any final words you want to savor audience about this current situation I mean right now I think if you're listening to this from your house I think you're one of the lucky ones because we got to think about the people outside for working you know our essential workers who can't afford to stay at home so still being able to stay at home is something for middle-class people or like upper middle class people for someone who has a job who can do that it's for someone who is a citizen I mean if you're right now like if you're stuck in the migrant worker dhama tree you your freedom of movement is restricted you know you can go out and run there's just no space for you to be safe - away from someone who might be if that infected who might be sleeping right next to you so we're lucky that we don't have that you know some of us don't have to go through that but I think that's when we need to step in and support those people who have - so we know we're going to get a $600 hand out from the government think though the one-off payout I mean I'm looking to donate that and I'm looking to doing it you're like a migrant workers groups so maybe you can consider donating that to someone that you think needs it you know it might be a friend with struggling financially or family member or could be like an NGO you know I'll be putting some I'll be putting a link in the description with like a bunch of like organizations that you can donate to RG linked in the previous video but I'll put it on again just just just just for you guys yeah I think that's a very very nice way to end this episode because definitely we are I feel that we are very privileged Bunch especially the citizens who are getting a handout from the government firstly we have a stronger bond Monday is even able to give us a handout and try to support us during this time of crisis and being people who who are not in extremely dry I feel that if we have the ability to we should definitely reach out to help out the people who are around us you know in our country we're all in this together everyone is suffering everyone is equally a successor to the disease so if you have the ability to help out I feel that we should all try to chip in a little bit to ease the suffering of the of our fellow men especially during this time of crisis yeah and yes we have come to the end of our episode so uh thank you so much for joining us you will see more episodes like this especially during this a critical period also we'll try to get more guests around and then uh yeah you'll see more recordings like this so thank you so much for joining us today patient thank you for having me yes and we'll see you in the next episode bye guys [Music] ",True,True,False,False

This is now a reality for some Asian Americans bearing the brunt of increasing tensions between the United States and China.

The COVID-19 pandemic and US presidential race are creating the perfect storm, as experts warn the two countries could be heading towards a new Cold War.

As President Donald Trump blames China for the virus, two-thirds of surveyed Americans say they do not trust the country and Americans of Asian descent are increasingly being violently attacked.

101 East investigates what the battle of the superpowers means for Asian Americans.

because they believe it's a hate crime they actually planned this out they put kerosene in their pockets and they walk the street massed up ready to attack somebody they said they planned on setting somebody on fire if not that if that's not hate crime i don't know what the hate crime is [Applause] a jewish man was to get burned today and set on fire how would the nypd respond to that we [Applause] this cry for justice is being shouted across the u.s for months america has been in the grips of a racial reckoning thousands of people have been marching in the black lives matter protests demanding an end to systemic racism against the black people from every ethnicity and age are joining the rallies but now asian americans are rising up to fight for their own rights we can care for

hamm [Applause] they say they could no longer ignore what was happening to their community after the chinese grandmother was set on fire i was upset i was angry i was infuriated that could be my mother you know that could be my grandmother this attack in new york is not an isolated incident since the spread of the coronavirus i've been speaking with asian americans across the country who say racism is on the rise one guy tried to pull my mask down and they spit at me i've had 9-1-1 called on me twice by white people i'm the tone blue i'm the coroner virus in texas a burmese father and his

baseball bat he's chopping my face twice what is a this woman in new york was punched in the face as she walked to work my head was it hit the ground kind of like a basketball since march asian americans have reported over 2 600 incidents of racist abuse to advocacy groups researchers say many more are going unreported it's really hard but through this crisis a bold new generation of asian americans is emerging i'm a firefighter not a virus and they're demanding change i'm a chef a neighbor artist bus driver i'm a doctor i'm just tired of us being looked at as you know weak us being you know just allowing people to to step on us and over us and attack us we're not going to be respected if we're just going to be quiet and just take it said my mama came from a foreign land no silver spoon sticks in my hand fighting is something rapper chinamak has done his whole life he's been in and out of juvenile homes since he was eight as an adult he spent 11 years in jail for shooting a man

fans [Music] today he's recording a new track inspired by the anti-racism protests sweeping the u.s [Music] this time is a different fight it's a fight that i could live with you know it's a fight that i feel is is worthy because so many times i fought for nothing i'm telling you bro like this song is like the whole soundtrack of just the times in general yeah he flowing [Music] do you think this track is going to upset some people yeah but also nothing gets no nothing changes without you know people being offended how many people were offended when martin luther king stepped up and said what he said and did what he did yeah budget chinamax music may be confronting but he says america needs to face prejudice head-on racism has been a part of this country since the very beginning the reason why i'm focusing on you know asians and our plight that we are going through not just in america but the world is because nobody else is doing it nobody else is fighting for it yeah i mean we're going to l.a it's a message that's hid a nerve with other asian americans since their protest in brooklyn chinamak and his fellow activist william have been flooded with support everybody hitting my on the comments like we need you to do this here we need you because our people haven't been spoken for they're trying to call us out to come out to la san francisco where there's tons and tons and tons of asians it changes we've never seen people rally to fight against hate and racism in this way yeah but then when we speak up like oh it's not your time yet your issue it's not that important it's just a joke right i'm sick of that so there's no there's no more we're not waiting for permission anymore in a new york suburb william is busy planning the next rally hey how are you good good thank you for having me over is this your father i'm good how are you nice to meet you hi i'm curious to find out how his parents feel about his campaign but it turns out they know nothing

always messed up you know i have sanitizer with everything that's going on it's easy to forget that the coronavirus is still rampant here will says he didn't want to worry his parents but now his secret's out someone did a recap video so i'll just i'll show you this [Applause] wow so many people that protest yeah look at all those people that came out wow this is saturday some blacks some white people some indian yeah they all get together yeah yeah and that's my partner right here trying to match yeah that's great yeah yes yes yes yes are you surprised that william has been organizing

i am okay yes from bottom of my heart yes i am i am yeah thank you dad will's dad john says racism isn't new to america it was already thriving when he arrived here almost 50 years ago from taiwan even though this is a free country but it's a lot of racism going on in you know for generations but uh i you know i never never you know talked to my son about what's you know what what happened in the past they call you a [ __ ] sometimes they hit you in the back when you're working on sidewalks you cannot go to certain neighborhoods what this is about when these things used to happen to you did you fight back [Music] be honest with you no you know you just keep inside you and you just suffer you know john says he never complained but he also never imagined that his son will would have to deal with the same thing i kept it to myself i you know i cried to myself uh and because i didn't want to worry my parents i felt ashamed i would bring food to you know to school people making fun of the food you know the way it smells like they found every opportunity to make me feel you know that i don't belong why why do we you know deserve this what did we do to deserve this it's a question i hear again and again when i speak to asian americans about racism every single time that i've ever stood up for myself the room turns on me for disrupting the peace but you do have cheeky eyes but i bet you do have a small penis come on it's just a joke there is a dramatic rise since trump has been using the china virus it's okay to hate american asians because they brought you this this is where i belong and i want to fight for my rights get attacked stand up and fight back stand up fight back and i'm crying now you know stand up fight back right when i'm trying this out and i see everyone else really crying this out it brings me such incredible joy because we've all been holding you know this kind of stuff in [Music] no justice no peace no justice no peace as the campaign gains momentum chinamac and will bring their protest to manhattan's china town this iconic neighborhood has been hit hard by covert many of the residents are older asian immigrants who are disproportionately being targeted in hate crimes i'm asian and i'm willing to fight for my people and i hope that you guys are willing to fight for our people too they can't burn us all it's been a month since the chinese grandmother was burned in brooklyn the nypd still hasn't made an arrest and they're not investigating it as a hate crime protesters are outraged all right but when the grandma went to the precinct to report her hate crime you know what they said to her go home and call 911 true asian lives do not matter they will not respect us until we fight i started juvenile system when i was eight years old i was getting picked on every day i was the only asian face there then one day i woke up and i had toothpaste all over my hair i had piss in my shoes and when i stepped into the shoes i started crying and i walked into the office where the staff was and i told him hey i'm being picked on you know what he told me he said the only thing that will ever get you respect is if you fight this is what i'm fighting for now i'm going to put 100 in this and i ask all of you we need y'all to do the same [Applause] these protesters are passionate but both china mac and will admit there's only so much they can achieve on the streets with the election looming they want people to march all the way to the ballot box how you doing what's your name kevin yeah you registered a vote i am a judge you already should have voted all right are your friends registered all right today they're filming a special episode of chinaman's popular youtube channel pushing people to vote are you guys planning on voting yes yeah yeah this generation has to show zero tolerance for what's been going on in the country young people are certainly fired up it's another story entirely for older voters it's not that they don't have political opinions they just don't see the point of elections one after another older asians are telling us they just don't want to vote are you going to vote this year sir no why you know that though you're honest telling you you think so there it is it's not apathy or ignorance that keeps people from voting it's a lifetime of disappointment but across the hudson river in queens the sentiment is very different this is the chinese-american alliance for trump and they'll definitely be lining up to vote many here are first-generation immigrants from china foreign we left a socialist and communist country we treasured their freedom here now uh now it's in danger that's why we support trump they not only support the president they are true believers in some of his most contentious policies yes foreign stephanie liu came to the u.s 20 years ago she used to vote for the democrats new york for republican freedom means a lot to me because in china i have everything materially but i don't have freedom to criticize the government here i have freedom to say whatever i want one but i already noticed that so many americans they are they they're not where mega hat they are not to say i support trump they have to be silent majority i asked stephanie what she thinks about the surge in hate crimes against asian americans because of covert i don't think so you don't think asians are being attacked no yeah it's very isolating case look you can ask all of them nobody experienced discrimination and what about the president's anti-china rhetoric the president during the covet crisis has referred to it as the china virus kung flu do you find that offensive no not at all a lot of chinese get offended because they were misled by the chinese media and by sin it's just to emphasize this virus came from china which is true came from china i would rather die i will defend the right to saying china virus it came from china when you hear the president say stuff like china virus wuhan virus what do you hear racism i hear racist i have bigotry i hear just ignorance he basically put a target on all asian americans people that live in this country that were born and raised in this country right he put targets on us [Music] in the nation's most powerful city thousands are gathering to mark a historic day after months of marching for black lives china mac and will are again joining a mass rally against racism here in washington dc it's the anniversary of martin luther king jr's famous i have a dream speech black people shouldn't be marching for the same stuff martin luther king was marching for i'm tired i'm tired and i'm tired of asking for justice [Music] [Applause] my grandsons ain't gonna be marching for the same stuff my granddaddy marched for it's a day that will and chinamak will never forget i've never seen anything like this before i got chills like this is the same place where martin luther king stood this is like 57 years ago this is what i saw on on a tv on television we all are fighting the same struggle and this is so inspirational to see this and um it's just going to make me push it's going to make us push so much harder it's hard to believe that just three years ago chinamak was a convicted criminal in prison today he's leading his community in their fight for what do we equality what do we wanted now and we don't get it it's not something that you know i really want to do it's not something that i really was planning on doing it's not something that i'm saying oh this is going to be the rest of my life because i don't want to do this for the rest of my life but nobody's doing it it hurts to know that the same country that you're born and raised hates you you know or doesn't see you as equal this is my country i'm just fighting because it's the right thing to do [Music] you ,True,False,False,False

The centre says it's worried about Maharashtra as the daily Covid cases in the state rose to over 14,000. Meanwhile, Denmark, Norway and Iceland on Thursday temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine over concerns about patients developing post-jab blood clots.

Watch more videos: http://www.ndtv.com/video?yt",well our top focus story denmark norway and iceland on tuesday temporarily suspended the use of the astrazeneca oxford vaccine which is known in india's kovi shield vaccine now this over concerns of patients developing post-jab blood plots denmark was the first to announce the suspension after the country's health authority said that there were reports of serious cases of blood clots among people who had received the vaccine after which norway and iceland also have temporarily suspended the use of the vaccine the uk prime minister however has defended saying that the oxford vaccine is safe the aims director speaking to ndtv has also said that these blood clots could very much be coincidental well what does this really mean for the world's race against coronavirus we have with us dr jerome kim director general of the international vaccine institute joining us thanks so much dr kim for sparing the time and being with us i want to first begin by asking you about the new concerns around the astrazeneca vaccine do you think more research is perhaps needed is this a cause for concern no i think that the oxford astrozenica vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in randomized clinical trials which means that we've collected a lot of safety information and we really haven't seen the the issue reported with blood clots but as the aims director said you know when you do a vaccination in populations which are elderly you're going to see occurrence of blood clots naturally and it's really going to be important for the countries that have suspended vaccination to look into the cases and for them to come to a determination whether they believe the vaccine is safe or not importantly the european regulatory agency the ema has come out with a statement saying you know they believe that the vaccines are safe and efficacious and um but that they're willing to let the countries go on with their investigations right i want to also ask you about the other big question that's on everyone's mind whether the existing coronavirus vaccines in the world market are effective against the variants and if the vaccines do indeed need to be tweaked when will we know yes so that's a really great question and we ask ourselves that question every day but i think that the bottom line is that for the variants that we know and the vaccines that we have it appears that the vaccines are safe and effective in preventing disease from the variance particularly the kinds of disease that result in severe infection hospitalization and death but the data are still being generated there are two vaccines in particular that have shown an impact actual clinical trial impact in human subjects against the variants that would be johnson and johnson and novofx we have other vaccines that appear to have evidence that they should protect when we do tests in a test tube and we think that you know for instance the pfizer vaccine and the moderna vaccine the astrozenica vaccine will have activity and do in fact prevent severe infection uh with the variant cases but we just don't have as much information as we have with johnson and johnson and novovac which were actually tested in the sites that have the mutant viruses uh do you believe doctor came at the time when a lot of these vaccines were being developed which is the course of the last one year mutant strains was something perhaps that was not taken into consideration or or do virus mutations only emerge eventually after which they are considered uh as far as vaccine development is concerned so we had always considered the amount of mutation that was going on in coronavirus strains to be important in fact you know in the beginning actually in the early spring a particular mutant took over uh the infections in europe so we knew that it could happen right uh but it looked like that mutant was going to be sensitive to the vaccine i think that what may have happened is that during the the summer and the fall in particular as the third wave of outbreaks occurred very very substantial uncontrolled outbreaks are what drive mutation in the coronaviruses so when whenever you have these large explosive outbreaks you're going to see mutations develop in the coronavirus strains that are circulating the other important thing is there are parts of the world in fact the united states until recently was one of them where we didn't really know what strains were circulating because they weren't keeping up with the viral sequences they weren't able to tell us exactly what the sequences were right as the united states and other countries are now beginning to collect and analyze those will have a much better picture about the emergence of coronavirus mutants and this is very important now rates of infection were starting to drop and now in some countries they've started to increase again yes we're really going to have to keep a close eye on the development of mutations again vaccination is really important as many people as possible as soon as possible but actually also masks and distancing are still going to be important control okay so vaccines masks and social distancing all of those things are equally important but you've also talked about the pace of vaccination and i want to ask you uh you know say as far as india is concerned for instance what can a country like india do to accelerate the pace of vaccination do you believe it needs to be more liberalized in terms of who can go out there and get vaccinated so i think that countries are making these decisions based on their own internal sets of priorities certainly people who are elderly and in nursing homes are at tremendous risk it's very important to vaccinate healthcare workers because again they're on the front line fighting against uh the disease and and um and taking care of patients um but as countries prioritize who needs to be vaccinated they also at the same time have to ensure that the logistic systems are working that our ability to keep the the vaccine at the right temperature for instance uh is working and that we have adequate numbers of trained personnel who can deliver those vaccines uh in campaign mode uh around the world and so you saw what happened in the united states right it was very slow at first but they've now gotten much better at being able to distribute the vaccine and get it into people and that's going to be critical so if you look at most countries they start low slow and then they gradually ramp up and hopefully india will do the same okay i'm completely out of time but the very last question to you dr kim is about has other vaccinations suffered as a result of the kovit-19 vaccine and how long will it take for the world to recover or catch up in those terms yes and so in fact i think you're exactly right um we have some some data that would suggest that routine vaccinations uh were put on hold um both vaccination campaigns in some countries but also people were afraid to go to the doctor because of course that's you know a good way to to catch uh copic 19 so it will take a little bit of time as economies open up as as people get back to doing the things that they normally did we are really going to have to launch campaigns to catch up and this is critical you know during the ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo more people died of more children died of measles than of ebola virus so we can't let routine immunizations slip and you know countries around the world are going to struggle um to vaccinate everybody right for coronavirus and then they're going to have to catch up for routine immunizations also well i think that's extremely uh crucial as well routine immunization which has definitely suffered because of the covet 19 vaccination program is going to have to play catch up in the years to come thank you so much dr kim for sparing your time and being with us on ndtv thank you well i want to now shift our focus to the worrying india kovitz story and let's just look at the way the coronavirus numbers in india are looking at the moment there have been 23 800 and 285 cases in the last 24 hours this is the highest in over two months the last time we saw such a spike in cases this right here was in fact back in december of 2019 i want to just break down for our viewers the india covet curve as far as 2021 is concerned this bell-shaped curve right here is a cause of concern uh because as you can see the cases had dipped substantially towards the end of january towards february but once again when you come and you look at march and i'm just going to enhance this for our viewers to understand you can see this uptick in kovid 19 cases over 23 000 cases as of the last 24 hours uh let's also look at the states which are contributing to this rise in cases as you can see maharashtra continues to remain the worst affected with over 14 300 cases in 24 hours followed by kerala punjab karnataka and tamil nadu i want to also add here for our viewers that if you look at the difference between tamil nadu and say madhya pradesh and delhi the difference isn't much delhi has also seen over 400 cases in the last 24 hours as far as the madhya pradesh is concerned it's also seen over 500 cases in the last 24 hours so those are worrying pictures at the moment remember there's been a lockdown that's been announced in nagpur this is a district that's reported over 1800 cases in the last 24 hours and if you look at maharashtra specifically the chief minister of maharashtra has said that there could very well be another lockdown if the cases continue to rise i want to also point out to our viewers another worrying statistic that we're tracking which is eight of the ten worst hit districts in the country currently are from maharashtra pune districts are from maharashtra bengaluru urban and anakulam is also presenting itself a worrying story one of course kerala and one uh karnataka and again if you look at this the figures at the very end amravati jalgao nasik and urangabad all districts from maharashtra that are in fact in the worst hit districts that we're looking at right now i want to also highlight at the moment what the covet 19 vaccine numbers are looking like look at this so four days ago india had vaccinated 20 lakh people daily in one day as opposed to if you look at the figures right now yesterday 11th of march in the last 24 hours india has vaccinated 4.8 lakh so there has been if you look at this graph right here a slight dip as far as daily vaccination figures are concerned this is a cause of concern as well given the fact that india's covet cases are rising also there is a bit of a hit and miss as far as the targeted vaccination is concerned remember india is looking to target 30 crore individuals by july and if you do a bit of a back of the envelope calculation we need to be vaccinating at least 50 lakh individuals on a daily basis in order to be able to meet that target to talk more about the india kovitz story we have with us dr sunil agar she needs no introduction she is a member of icmr who and also member of the delhi covet task force and the india kovat task force we have dr rahul pandit member of the maharashtra task force thank you all very much for being with us dr pandit if i can begin by asking you uh maharashtra is presenting itself as a worrying story the the government yesterday in the press conference has in fact come out and said that they are concerned about the spike in maharashtra what are we to make of the maharashtra numbers uh thank you very much for having me on your show indeed maharashtra is a concern right now there are two distinct differences between maharashtra if you look at where the urban population which is mumbai pune aurangabad city then there is rest of the maharashtra and i think the cases in both the cases have both the places the cases have risen simultaneously but probably the reasons are a little bit different in the rural areas such as uh districts of nagpur and uh and talukas of nagpur probably there were large amounts of super spread of events it started with the gram panchayat elections and then you know the cases have slowly slowly gone up the contact racing needs to be brought up and there are some districts where the test positivity rate is around 15 which is very very high so one thing is very clear that in the last four days maharashtra has stopped the number of cases the text which the test which they are doing which is helping and probably the numbers are now becoming more and more higher because we are doing a lot more tests for example mumbai for last two weeks has been doing around 20 to 22 000 tests per day and the test positivity rate is less than five percent on most days except one day in between where it was seven percent right i think we need to increase our testing to bring down the test positivity rate that will help us in identifying the patients who are who are positive isolate them if required institutionally isolate them so that they don't go around uh mixing into the general population that has been another problem if i may just take one more minute to explain the patients who are asymptomatic which is the case right now most of the patients are asymptomatic they are very difficult to contain in their home so i think if they are not going to be basically contained in their home for a proper home quarantine in the true spirit then you will have to situation quarantine for these people very very important point dr pandit very important point that you're making you're actually saying that one of the strategies to contain the covet numbers in maharashtra could be mandatory institutional quarantine for anyone who tests covet positive can we then dr garg attribute perhaps this spike and i know the government's denied it so far denying any correlation but in your assessment as an expert would you say that the cases in select districts of maharashtra are rising exponentially and this could be linked potentially to variant strains yeah that is one of the it is one of the reasons you see that there are mutant strains which are more effective in nature our borders are very porous as we could see you know more number of cases you know in the vidharva district we are seeing more number of cases in tane and all you know all of the different parts of maharashtra but at the same time what i'll say is that along with that we have you know uh less of sanitization social distancing and masking also and night curfews are not going to help that is one thing which is very very important part unless people are following appropriate covet behaviors so what you said very rightly is that we do have mutant strains which we cannot deny which are more infectious but less severe but second part is also the people's behavior needs to be you know kind of monitored so that is another important part which we need to take into account it is it is a race uh as uh you know between the virus and the vaccine isn't it dr pandit are you worried uh there has been a slight dip in india's vaccination numbers we you know four days ago we were vaccinating over 20 lakh people a day uh that number is under five lakhs uh in the last 24 hours uh do you believe we we are now you know likely to miss the target that the government has set for july which is 30 crore vaccinations so vaccination is as important as social distancing masking and controlling of the pandemic because it actually helps us into protecting our vulnerable group the current target which we have which is 45 plus comorbidity or 60 and above is the population which is actually succumbing unfortunately whenever they have a covert debt if you look at the covered debt analysis in maharashtra 80 to 90 percent of the people who unfortunately have died are in that category who are above 60 or who have co-morbidity so if we vaccinate them as quickly as possible we will be able to bring down the mortality you know we need to save lives of course we need to control the pandemic bring the cases down but we need to save life parallely vaccinate 24 7 bring down the vaccine to the doorstep dr vaccinate 24 7 is something that the government has asked private hospitals to do but is it really happening and what more needs to be done to accelerate the pace of vaccination in india i think it is very important at this stage to you know kind of address this issue of vaccine hesitancy across and we need to focus you know according to the states according to the districts this message because we have got a very good communication strategy which works down from national level to the state level to the district level and to the block level today i went for second dose of vaccine and i could find not only what to talk of day and night we are not only getting the you know persons to get immunized in daytime also this is i'm talking of today itself right when i went myself for the booth was just empty okay so that's where we need to see that you know how we can improve our communication strategy and we do have a very good material and very innovative material which can be utilized but it has two states well a multi-pronged approach most definitely is needed to also inspire more confidence among people to go out and get vaccinated thank you both very much uh for joining us and sparing your time we'll keep a close watch on all these developments we're going to slip into a very short break but coming up on the other side we have a very special guest joining us from new york stay tuned welcome back we have with us diana berent founder of survivor co it is one of the largest and fastest growing grassroots movements connecting and supporting covet survivors in new york thanks for being with us i want uh to begin by asking you you know you're you're connected with kovitz survivors how big is the fear of re-infections how many re-infections are you seeing because of covet variants correct we have seen people get re-infected right now we are not being told our exact genetic profile of our positive cases um but we are seeing about uh 10 percent of our membership is reporting reinfection um i think it's probably a bit lower than that um in reality but we are seeing much more reinfection within a number of months from first infection than we anticipated all right and lingering and long hauler symptoms are emerging as an ongoing battle is this the new phenomena that we need to now be prepared for oh absolutely we are seeing upwards of one-third of people who contract kovid developing long-term covid and what's most interesting is when we did research to look for the most predictive symptom the symptom that would be most likely to show that you would develop long-term covet and it ended up being the people who were asymptomatic so this is not something that is happening just to the people who are the sickest in fact it's happening to some of the people who are the least sick and it is doing vascular and inflammatory damage to every organ in the body people are really really suffering um although some um i am happy to report are actually finding relief after getting the vaccine we're still doing research into that right now it's still anecdotal data but very interesting to follow thanks so much diana for joining us and congratulations on all the good work that you're doing for covich survivors there in new york that's all the time we have for in this edition of coronavirus facts versus nick thanks for watching ,True,False,False,False

152,XBkJlt9UeZk,싱과협KSEASG,"[AKC2020] Special Lecture 2 : Prof. Tony Tae Hyoung Kim, NTU Singapore “Post Covid 19 Era and IT”",2021-02-27T00:14:22Z,"Special Lecture 2 :
Prof. Tony Tae Hyoung Kim, Nanyang Technological University
“Post Covid 19 Era and IT”",good afternoon everyone thank you for attending this session so uh in my talk i just want to give a very brief overview of postcard 19 era and it okay so i mean uh as we know i mean we have this kobe 19 outbreak around last year in november right and then now it is impacting all over the world and all our daily life and school life in research life i mean they are all affected by this property 19 right so because of that i mean everyone here we are wearing masks and then we are also conducting our lectures and this conference virtually right and then we we are also relying on like a natural right so that we can still be uh still be connected with others right so so i mean overall we can say that i mean this uh phobia 19 is actually impacting the world very significantly then uh but what about the impact of call with 19 on information technology so is it i cannot say that kobe 19 is good or bad but i mean in terms of i.t companies uh like a business actually they uh they i mean they are really benefiting right so this is just one news article from guardians so you can see that i mean all the major i.t companies like amazon apple google and facebook actually there are shares soared especially during this kobe 19 pandemic right it's not because they are doing a very great business it's mainly because of the situation itself right and i believe many of you uh watch it like uh i mean youtube or netflix right so actually before probably 19 i've never seen movies through netflix frankly that was during uh this uh i mean circuit breaker i mean i also tried this netflix for the first time in my life so i believe i mean many people in the world i think they are using this kind of entertainment i mean programs so that they can be still connected and they can still enjoy their life right through this i.t technology and then when we talk about connectivity uh we can we cannot i mean we cannot miss like a communication technology so many people are talking about 5g as the next generation communication standard for connectivity right yeah because i mean we started from 1g 2g 3g 4g and then now we are talking about 5g right so what is so special about 5g compared to the previous telecommunication standard it's because when we talk about 5g it's more for connectivity okay for example uh this diagram is showing the evolution of telecommunication wireless communication so i don't know i mean how many of you are starting from 1g i can see a few of your professors may experience the 1g here but anyway so when we started like a 1g i mean it was for analog kind of communication right and then around 1990 when we had 2g we could start to text messages right and then as the communication technology evolves we can we can use internet and then we can watch video clips and we can send and receive data wirelessly right through this communication network right so i mean those are the benefits that we have injured from 1g2 4g yeah but in 5g actually it's much more than uh it's much more than 4g for example in 4g pretty much of the i mean communication that we are using is mainly for talking or using internet watching movies right or watching some like online uh video clips or something like that right but when you talk about 5g uh it is much more than that okay so as you can see from this right diagram in 5g we are actually claiming that we can realize many of these new connectivity for example smartphone and we can also implement smart business smart series smart transportation smart green and smart health care okay so they are i mean some of them are already here but many of them are not here yet but we are dreaming of realizing all this smartness which is uh facilitated by the realization of 5g okay and one um common word that you can find here is actually this smart okay so what's the meaning of smart right because when we talk about this smart i mean depending on the area that we are working on the definition can be slightly different but in general when we talk about this smart usually it means artificial intelligence right i think many of you know this event right this um hypergol and mr shadow lee so they played gold game which is quite popular in asian countries so so i mean i also watched this event and then i mean i myself also expected that the ipad would i mean might still not be so good i mean enough to win the game right against mr zelda lee but it turns out that i mean the arpeggio was much better than i mean human brain right so it was a very shocking event and then after this one especially in korea a lot of research efforts uh i mean moved to a year right so many people joke that i mean if you want to get some funding from government now if you don't include ai in your proposal title i mean you cannot get any funding right so that was some sort of joking that we had at that time okay but uh what is this ai i mean it's very complicated to explain within a short time but in general we can say that artificial intelligence is doing some computation still but in a very different way compared to what we have done previously in the conventional computing okay so this diagram is just showing an example of the neural network so neural network is something that is commonly employed in realizing artificial intelligence okay so okay so then how artificial intelligence can be useful right so you can see are they dogs or wolves i actually mix them because can you recognize i mean which of these are dogs and which of these are wolf it's really difficult right yeah i mean even i myself cannot really recognize even though i put these pictures in this one okay yeah so i mean the d3 they are full and the rest one two three four but they are all stuck basically they are dark okay and i gave you these answers and can you define can you i mean come up with a very clear explanation or mathematical models they can differentiate how these three are used and how these four dogs it's really really difficult right i mean if you can come up with those uh algorithm or some sort of mathematical model they can differentiate uh the differences between old friend dogs then i mean there can be a very good algorithm and then you can use it as i mean you can replace ai okay for that application but the thing is it is extremely difficult and no one has developed that kind of algorithm especially in this image recognition speech recognition object detection area so because of that we cannot rely on a conventional algorithm-based or mathematical expression-based implementation anymore so that's why this artificial intelligence has attracted so much so much interest from research society and then many people are working on it and this is just one example okay so yeah we can also use aei for speech recognition and other others yeah but in case that you can come up with a very clear mathematical expression and uh i mean you can quantify the algorithm then you you don't really need a yen okay then yeah as i explained i mean in some areas ai can be very very efficient and powerful but the question is to realize smartness in our society uh can we have this all power-like ai everywhere yes or no so this picture shows uh it shows the uh alphago server racks so as you can see it's huge but it's really bulky and huge and it's connecting a lot of gpus and memories right i mean so that you can actually play this cool game with mr lee okay but when you talk about the hardware performance of this airpod wall as you can see here this alphago is consuming one megawatt okay just to play one goal game with mr lee you have to consume one megawatt power while mr lee i mean as a human he on average he consumed about 21. okay so this alphago system is actually consuming 50 000 times more power right compared to human right then we need to we need to think do we really have to have this kind of ai everywhere or we have to use ai selectable okay especially this kind of powerful ai uh i mean personally i think it's a little bit difficult to employ this everywhere but when you need when you need to generate very impactful reasons or outcome i think we can employ alphago like high performance aen then what is the recent trend in ai especially in hardware so ai has been developed traditionally in software site okay so as uh doctor you uh is working on i mean software based ai i mean uh software area has tried uh has driven this ai revolution over the last few decades and then in those areas face recognition speech recognition image and object detection i mean those are the main target applications that people try to use for ai but the thing is as i just explained in the previous page uh software-based aei is actually run on some sort of super computers or some dedicated uh powerful ai system which consumes huge amount of power right so that is the bottleneck okay but but these days due to the development of 5g which can connect so many devices like billions of devices can be connected so in that case it's it's almost impossible for us to send all the data generated by all the connected devices to the central ai server and then sdai server to compute right that's very very inefficient in many different ways so so in our electrical engineering we are trying to actually distribute the ai computation from the server to edge so we call it edge computing meaning in 5g or in in our future smart society almost all electronic devices and sensors they can be connected because of the extremely high data rate provided by 5g and then instead of just doing ai in in the server actually each device can have tiny ai engine okay because for example if you are using a laptop then you can have a little bit more computing power then you can have a little bit uh powerful ai engine in your laptop but if you are uh using uh wearing a smartwatch then the amount of data that i mean you need to process smartly using your smartwatch maybe i mean maybe less than the computing power that you have to do using a laptop or a server right so in that case we can optimize our ai engine so that it can fit in this smartwatch platform okay so so there are many i mean different devices so we can actually design compact we call it tiny ai so we can develop tiny ai so that each devices can actually do some ai computation and realize some level of smartness of course i mean by realizing this edge smart edge computing we can decide uh many of the we can make this uh decision locally and then we don't need to send all the row or very critical data to the server so it can so we can have less communication and then it can be more secure right you don't need to send your i mean folder to the server and you don't need to send your like id number to the server for ai computation and then it can also consume quite less power and much more power and energy efficient efficient overall then we can spread aei almost everywhere okay through a 5g based connection okay uh this one looks a little bit uh difficult to understand but to realize ai actually we usually rely on some sort of hardware architectures that are called neural networks but if you really look at what is really happening in neural network there are a couple of operations that are extremely frequently executed okay and then we found out that multiplication and accumulation function of course there are also other operations but multiplication and accumulation this is not a very complicated operation but this one is happening so frequently but the problem is when you do multiplication and accumulation you have to send data and you have to read data from memory so that actually consumes a lot of power and limit the performance of the ai that you are implementing in hardware so many people try to make this operation very very power and energy efficient okay so then how can we i mean handle that uh power and energy bottleneck is currently it's caused by the hardware architecture that we are using uh i think many of you are using laptop now but when you open your laptop i mean you also have this kind of system so you have cpu right and then inside of your cpu uh you have like a computing unit and register file and cache okay based uh using sram okay and then uh everything is integrated within a cpu and after that you also have drams right so if you need more dram i mean you can open your laptop or pc and then you can add more drams right so drams can be used as second level memory and even after this one you can have what hard drive or ssd right memory as second level of memory solution but the problem is if you are using this very traditional hardware architecture for aei then pretty much of the power and energy you are just consuming to read and write data between cpu and memory okay so as you can see from this tag uh diagram for example if you uh i mean you are doing some computation which consumes only 0.1 pixel okay per bit but if you read data from dram it is consuming one nano joule so how many times 10 000 times right so here i mean for this operation you are not doing any computation but you are just reading data because you need to do some computer aei computation so that data movement alone is already consuming 10 000 more energy compared to the computation itself so how to make this value suppressed and close to this compute i mean computation uh power and energy i mean that is the real bottleneck in terms of hardware these days and if you can make it happen then i think the the software software-based ai can be easily migrated into hardware and then we can have much more powerful ai engines okay on the market too so at the moment there are several companies that are working on this area so they are trying to change the traditional computing architecture and then they come up with very specific hardware which is called a gpu or some company they are also developing application specific chips they can they can be used for dedicated ai operation okay but these two solutions they are still mainly for very high performance ai like what dr i mean you is working on these days but as i mentioned in the previous slide we are also trying to implement ai in edge devices right tiny ai so for that uh we have to come up with a very very compact form factor with i mean tiny ai capability so this is just one simple silicon chip that i mean our group developed it is mainly for human gesture recognition so we can actually process uh the image data captured from a camera and then this ai engine can actually recognize uh human gestures okay whether you are like a moving from left to right up down diagonally or you or whether you are doing some weird okay dancing or whatever okay so they can be detected without consuming too much power okay when you come up with very smart tiny ai solution so okay this is just some test region so as you can see i mean this chip is just consuming uh 184 microwatts yeah i mean compared to alphago of course i mean this ai is a very tiny one so i cannot compare this one with alphago but for gesture recognition you don't need alphago you can still use alphago for gesture recognition but i mean we can do the same function only by consuming 184 microwatts why do we have to use one megawatt just for doing this kind of tiny artificial intelligence okay so if you can have application specific optimized ai engine in hardware i think they can spread ai to our society i mean more easily and effectively okay so as a table so let me summarize uh recovery is affecting our society a lot but we are still uh want to be connected and then this will be accelerated after profit 19 mainly through information technology and our next telecommunication standard will be 5g and 5g is much more than just telecommunication itself so we are targeting to integrate targeting to connect like a billions of devices together so that we can realize like a smart wall and small societies and of course when you talk about smart that means artificial intelligence but we cannot use current software intensive artificial intelligence in so many places mainly because of the power and then the hardware performance is still quite limited yeah but if you can come up with very optimized hardware solutions for efficient energy efficient like a tiny artificial intelligence then we can spread ai to all the edge devices and then we can realize like a fully interconnected world with smartness okay so that that's my talk okay so thank you for your attention ,True,True,False,False

#CrescentRating #crTALKS #SustainableTourism",and i think here uh what i notice is that many of the governments are quickly jumping in to bail out um you know whether it is the airlines or the tourism suppliers but i think in regenerative tourism we need to look at bailing out the the damaged environment or the cultural environment we need to build that out you know and not bail out the perpetrators you know who actually created this uh environment i'm sorry but i think it could hurt the cruise companies or whatever but whoever has been guilty of the mistakes of mass tourism and ecological damage i think uh we have to be really careful about who is it that we are bailing out welcome to see our talk in the series of travel readiness conversations i'll be talking to experts thought leaders entrepreneurs key stakeholders on how destinations and businesses are getting ready to receive tourism after kovite 19. thanks for watching i'm fazal your host for today hi nisha welcome to our show thanks for your time uh so today we'll i really want to discuss with you um what the impact of kobe 19 will be on one of the topics that you are you're passionate about which is sustainable tourism and uh so let's let's get started so what you know first of all for for the uh invitation and i'm it's my pleasure to be here with you speaking about my topic uh passion that is sustainable tourism yes yeah so i think you know sustainable tourism was gaining such a lot of momentum you know uh last year um and you know you know people were really beginning to embrace uh and then we are hit with this kobe 19. so what what do you think the impact is going to be uh you know postcode for this uh this subjects like sustainable tourism over tourism and you know we had so many those kind of angles which were really picking up and what do you think will be the impact uh postcode 19. i think you've just touched on a really interesting about the over tourism you know we have shifted from the whole you know research and talks all about over tourism that was you know um the hot topic of 2019 i think you know yeah and uh suddenly in 2020 we are now in this under tourism thing right and everyone is now looking at what is this all about what does it translate to but i think um the under tourism also gave me such a time the slow tourism is not to me unnecessarily a bad thing because uh we have gone through i would term it as an ecological grief you know where we were actually witnessing how insensible we have been in the tourism industry with our haphazard development mass developments and um now is the time to really relook and at our mistakes that we have done and it's time to prioritize you know mindful and responsible development uh the pandemic to me has become like an equalizer you know it is time to to kind of bring things to a balance it's a really nice uh peaceful time i would say that's brought to a balance and what we would call as scholars we uses were transformative term you know where we are doing an evolutionary hopefully a resetting of new pathways and i've come to also look at the fact that maybe it's not sustainable development that we need to be talking about but let's look at regenerative forms of tourism what we mean by regenerative is it's not just to be to sustain or to be mindful but also to look at the kind of damage that has already been created and now to recreate the conditions in under which tourism can flourish you know whether it's an ecological environment or the local environment the cultural environment can flourish you know it's a very powerful word to use you know it's not just developed but to flourish so today i think we are beginning to be very careful about the word sustainable development but looking at perhaps you know regenerative development and what what this looks like yeah i mean explain what do you mean by regenerative tourism yeah so like what i mean it's not just to sustain or to attain it you know but looking and addressing uh how we have created this ecological grief and damage and how we could go about in a collectively uh address these conditions and re-look at our development again and creating a you know re-flourish flourish um in terms of our ecological as well as cultural environment and that's really what regenerative tourism is all about and i think here what i notice is that many of the governments are quickly jumping in to bail out um you know whether it is the airlines or the tourism suppliers but i think in regenerative tourism we need to look at bailing out the the damaged environment or the cultural environment we need to bail that out you know and not bail out the perpetrators you know who actually created this uh environment i'm sorry but i think it could hurt the cruise companies or whatever but whoever has been guilty of the mistakes of mass tourism and ecological damage i think uh we have to be really careful about who is it that we are bailing out under such conditions you know you mentioned you mentioned you know we did you know tourism did mistakes you know what you you know give us some examples you know maybe some some of the mistakes that i mean mistakes in the sense of course you know tourism is a is a huge uh uh um uh contributor to gdp so all countries try to increase tourism and all that so it's understandable so what what sort of things that they probably should have done differently well i think in terms of tourism development we should have been a little bit more mindful about the way in which we were doing massive forms of development we were not careful or sensitive to the locals living conditions you know um so these are just some of the things that re resulted in the whole uh tourist phobia you know over tourism conditions the reactions of the local people in in italy towards the tourists you know um we had actually dug our own graves when it comes to tourism and also i think mistakes in terms of masterism where we had compromised our profitability you know we were doing cutthroat uh prizing and uh killing each other uh to a point that we were cutting down on the quality of service that we were offering to people so these were some of the mistakes and it's time to really rethink and re-look and reset right i think it's true i think i mean i empathize and you know i i sympathize with the with the whole i mean uh you know the the sustainable tourism is key but we are here you know now you know we had mass tourism for many many years which has provided massive amount of jobs you know hundreds of millions of jobs in the tourism industry and and of course i keep uh hearing now yes you know uh not only you but some others saying you know yes we would prefer a smaller tourism industry i think that's that's good i assume it's it's good for the ecology the community but what will happen to the jobs you know i mean uh hundreds of millions of jobs at stake how do we solve that yes i think um very valid point that you have raised because certainly what has gone uh or what has happened you know the fear of travel to restrictions to contactless travel to digitalization all this is certainly going to result in the loss of lives and livelihoods that are in our industry and we we are supportive of you know we support so many different types of jobs and you know uh too many different types of people in our industry as well so it is certainly going to put us all in a very challenging situations i think we are already witnessing in countries which are highly highly dependent on tourism bali for example thailand for example you know but i think it's also a very important time like what singapore is trying to do here is to really look at our alternative tourism development you know um going back to sustainable development for a long time i always felt that tourism has been uh focused on the hubs in many cities you know whether it's say for example in malaysia it has all been in in kuala lumpur or in bangkok or in india's mumbai and delhi rightfully what tourism development is that it should be spreading the economic development to the peripheral areas it should go to the rural areas or remote areas you know this is the time perhaps to re-look at alternative forms of tourism development you know can we bring tourism to the peripheral areas can we spend some time to be more inclusive like what korea is trying to do is trying to be moving towards a more inclusive form of tourism uh including of course the handicap and physically disabled uh within their destination by rebuilding their infrastructure so perhaps you know we we could look at manpower to be put into this sort of tourism development we could also look at alternative business models you know maybe we could be overstaffed in our industry maybe that's why our cost of business has been very high and our profit margins have been very low so what singapore is trying to do is redeploy people in our industry to alternative industries that may require our specialized and very um high quality stuff uh giving a very good example is where singapore airlines staff are now put as patient ambassadors in the healthcare industry you know we train our hospitality people with really really high quality service orientation you know and the healthcare can benefit from that right and of course the retail can benefit from that i think this is where uh you know in cross-industry collaborations and partnerships are happening uh we are learning from other industries as well we are learning from the googles and and so forth to digitalize our economy so that uh as today you know we are noticing that customers have less time and we saw that pre-covet people are time poor you know not money poor but time poor and they want everything fast fast fast but our industry has been very slow to adopt digitalization we have been very slow to adopt you know technology and faster ways of doing business you know and again this is a time that we could train our staff re-skill our stuff so i feel that this is an era you know that has been it's providing us a fantastic opportunity if our industry is able to really look at that you know a redeployment working in collaboration with other industries maybe take it as a time where you know where we actually it's like service learning you know you you put them in another industry let them learn the best practices and then they come back when our industry is ready and this is when we can transfer knowledge you know there are certain industries that are doing really really well at the moment and they need people from our tourism and hospitality industry so can two organizations for example in singapore singapore airlines working with uh the cool tech hospital you know and they are exchanging labor today i saw another company which is really interesting from a tourism company uh in sri lanka and what they're doing is offering they said we want to keep our staff you know our staff from a marketing department we want to keep our staff from the um technology department and our our digital guys you know but uh we don't have enough jobs for them you know so we are now selling our services to anybody in any industry who would give us jobs so that we could retain our staff so what is that it's really about partnerships it's about collaboration it's about new business model why should you always be selling travel and hospitality related services why don't you sell you know your accounting services or your digital marketing services or something that you've been really good at your csr related services to another industry that may need it and you still can monetize true you know yeah yeah interesting ways yeah true i understand but i i think my i i agree with all what you say is but my my biggest uh uh challenge of understanding is that you know you know less developed countries uh where millions of them are deployed in the in the travel industry and tourism industry redeploying you know at a fast pace is not a viable solution you know it will take time and that will impact livelihoods a lot i mean yeah i mean if the tourism doesn't come back to at least some decent levels of what it was in 2019 um uh livelihood wheels will be massively impact i mean singapore is is such a small place so many things could be done we are a very developed place as well you know uh but small again fazel i would say that we have our own challenges and problems too we don't have something called domestic tourism we don't have something called regional tourism and therefore the crisis has provided us a very important uh situation where we re-evaluate what we are all about and i think it's interesting because crisis is what allows us to think about the fact that we cannot solve this problem being alone as a country on its own it's a company on its own because it's a wicked problem you know it's a complex wicked problem so it gives us this time where we have to look at collaborations we have to look at partnerships uh an expanded global consciousness you know i notice certain companies like there is one company here they provided coaching and mentoring services and they're saying that you know we offer these services but would you be able to donate a portion of the money that you're giving for this consultancy or coaching services to help a hotel in bali you know a resort in bali so someone in singapore offering a coaching consultancy work is saying would you put certain percentage uh of what you would pay to support a hotel in bali isn't that amazing you know where we are now looking at a very expanded you know form of global consciousness so i agree that certain countries may not have the the the money the power the muscle that we may have but we are also in being small presents a lot of crisis you know being big presents another problem you know but this is where we should start looking at how we could support each other globally you know and break down this borders yeah yeah i agree i mean my only thing is that you know i i think we you know we had good momentum uh on sustainable tourism and all that so i think it would have really turned out to be something but my my worry now is that i mean i was talking to thailand tourism the other day like you know they employ like four million people and two million people will go out a job now yes uh i mean how how do you you know working around those kind of problems it's not easy they are you know it's it's you know really not easy anyway i think that's something that we need to you know though as in the industry we need to really look at you know yeah but you know i i feel that this turbulence as we had seen in in other uh crisis although this is something very different you know but in this turbulence you would see you know some of these players will start to seep out they will fall out for sure new ones are going to emerge you know you may think that there's no space for new ones but i am very hopeful that new players are going to emerge from this crisis you know just like in the bus right and those who could not have good business practices sensible business practices are definitely going to be dropping out of the race and that's when i think evolutionary pathways are going to be created yeah i think the biggest issue biggest problem i see is that when there is a even a fast evolution of of the landscape the workforce has still time to uh uh re train redeploy and re you know uh to be to another uh another industry but this is so short notice you know uh so redeploying retraining in a shut such a short you know there'll be new players emerging will this workforce fit into the new new emerging players it's probably you know it's going to be tough yeah they'll be in a different landscape different so that that's the struggle that i have in understanding how how all this you know we say okay small is good but yes but we have a big issue how do you solve that issue you know that yeah that's that's that's my my sort of take on i mean yes i mean we all agree that we we should be small but then we have had a big problem but how do we resolve that because these people are not going to be redeployed retrained overnight and there are millions millions of them yes you see what i see is that um all these situations that are happening around the world the total turbulence you know i would see is creating dissonance on two sides supply side and demand side supply side dissonance because you know people are finding that you know we don't have money the profit margins or whatever we had is too thin and the business models are not working at the moment and therefore people are going to companies i'm talking about a supply side we'll have to rethink of new business models and i'm witnessing it all around me i mean it's it's i think the fatigue has already uh with it off you know people are now thinking the energy is being put into thinking processes i've been listening to really really interesting business ideas and it's quite amazing how collaborations are happening between technology providers and our tourism people that's quite nice the dissonance is also going to happen on the part of travelers you know travelers are sick and tired you know we are we're not able to travel people are beginning to rethink about what sort of travel i want to engage in what have i been doing you know traveling traveling traveling and maybe not even arriving at uh as a traveler or a tourist you know what kind of travel do i want so uh and and would i go back to the same form of travel to crowded cities you know people are saying no no no i wouldn't want to i want to be in remote places i want physical and safe distancing right now uh people are more conscious about their health today you know while we are distancing there is a need for social connectedness already so there's a lot of thing that you when you listen to travelers and what are they saying is that you are looking at a new breed of travelers coming up and that's what i mentioned to you earlier that you know maybe we should look at uh travel development at peripheral areas remote areas because people don't want to move to crowded uh places anymore let's go back in time okay let's think about in the 19th century you know when uh aristocrats right uh looked at travel as a form of like you know it's like a sanitarium you know they wanted to escape from the pollution they want to escape from the diseases right and then they went to the remote places you know they went away to seaside areas right uh and that is what is going to happen right it's like a sanitarium people want to move away to remote places so why don't we start thinking about development and that's what sustainable development is all about you know develop the outskirts develop the peripheral areas you know regional sort of tourism in destinations so um we might see that because of the dissonance that people are feeling at the moment that's a new breed of niche forms of travel travel behavior and that becomes a very interesting study for scholars or whoever is researching is that what is the psychology of the traveler of the postcoving era what is really going to happen yeah i think i think that's maybe we'll more little bit on to that one maybe you know what will i mean we at the end of the day so there are so many unknowns that no one's on that part you know how will the traveler behave and travel sentiments you know we are making a lot of judgmental calls on that anywhere currently based on some some evidence but anyway let's let's do that anyway uh what what do you think uh you know will be will be some of the behavioral changes and and sentiments of future travelers yeah so as i said environmental consciousness is definitely going to be there people are going to be thinking about health and wellness uh and i i know of some uh tour operators already planning of health and wellness forms of travel um it's interesting you know uh it's important now to really look at interpretation you know uh we have not really focused so much on education and interpretation and travel experiences so uh we put tourism attractions or tourism boards to really think carefully about interpretation when travellers are starting to travel again you know could we educate them um i was just having a conversation with someone and you know we have always been an industry that is always about our facial expressions we've got to smile you know that's what hospitality is all about but think about it in the future you're going to wear a mask and where is your smile going to be you know you cannot move close to people so when there's contactless travel how is service going to look like you know and and what would consumers or travelers want when it comes to service you know as we say you know trust is the new currency yeah what is this trust you know is trusting the operations trusting the destination but it's also trust between the host and the guest today you know that is going to to to create um a form of of comfort level you know when we start to travel so there's a lot of interesting things that is going to unfold and we have to start thinking about it and i think research has to move into this area you know to in the minds in the minds of the consumer or the traveler what would quality service look like in a contactless world yeah but but do you think that you know mosque will stay that long i think me people are going to be i mean a lot of people in the world you know we have we me we are masks so uh you know we if if if the option is there not to wear we won't wear i mean nobody wants to do that you know so i will will we not have a situation where as soon as things are getting better people are not going to get rid of the mask and so that issue of mask wearing will disappear is anybody's call you know i mean let me i don't want to be pessimistic about it i'm a very optimistic person but who says this will be the last of the crisis you know uh with pandemics i mean there's been a lot of research talking about pandemics and different forms of um you know pandemics that may happen you know so let's let's learn from this and say and we get pre-prepared you know for us to understand what is traveler psychology going to be like when a situation like this happens you know and we have to start thinking about what is this whole thing about trust and human centered uh communication is really important you know you have to realize that i use this word you know this infosication that is around us info obesity if you want to call it you know there's so much of negativity in terms of information of fear and and fake news and all that and as travel providers as destinations what kind of news are we going to be communicating with travelers uh the ideas of hope and possibility is very important yes i mean yeah you talked about i mean trust is a new currency as you say so let's let's say on how do you so you know from a service provider point of view like hotels you know attractions how do they build trust so the trust factor i think is open communication is very very important transparency and communication uh and of course you know that whole notion of human centered communication focus on on in what we call used to call you know empathy right brand empathy and design thinking but i think it's it's very important to look at the consumer and it's not about your organization and and saying what we are doing you know in terms of safety and health but turn the point around to the consumer and think about what is it that they really want when they start traveling right you know and that's what i mean intelligence today is very important intelligence in terms of research and understanding human psychology uh a lot of effort has got to go into that sort of new knowledge uh and i think from what we hear people are are the facts and the factual information that is surrounding us is there some of us it's of course some of it is of course fake news that's what i said you know intoxication is there but i think we should really redirect our communication and our marketing efforts to towards the consumer and understanding where are they coming from what is the comfort level what is the confidence that they want when they start to travel transparency in terms of demographics you know if you look at demographics for the next i mean because there are so many uh let's say assumptions or predictions or projections that certain groups of people probably will travel earlier the millennials will will probably you know be the first who will sort of start traveling your thoughts on that uh yes i agree i think millennials will be the first to go um i think there's lots of research done about the millennials even pre-covet and we know it's a market that has got a uh the power to travel the mindset to travel so that is definitely a market that we should be targeting the other i think is the high yield traveler because if you go into high quality high yield yesterday of course i was reading an article that talks about private jet uh seems to be picking up and doing really well um private islands are doing well at the moment so uh consumers with the high purchasing power who are able to afford to go to remote places where it's not crowded or to be in the private islands or you know getting a private jet or private charter of a cruise they would be the next one so high yield tourism destinations are going to see a comeback faster than other destinations that were targeting the mass tourists the budget travelers yeah right okay i think that's good stuff uh nisha thanks for sharing how about i think maybe one last question maybe you know people i mean singapore of course uh although you say that doesn't have a domestic market uh you know there is a domestic tourism numbers for for for singapore don't know how they how it's uh classified as but anyway but i think domestic tourism is where a lot of countries like malaysia thailand yeah indonesia everybody's targeting i mean everybody's trying to revive and they're they're doing a lot of things in terms of encouraging domestic tourism uh what could uh what could uh you know the stakeholders do uh in terms of encouraging domestic tourism at this point in time yes first of all you have to believe that you know domestic tourism has got huge potential it has been a neglected market you know uh we become brand ambassadors of our own destinations when we are familiar with our own destinations uh lots of research has gone to show that vfr visiting friends and relatives market is actually a highly attractive market and we never understood the potential of locals being brand ambassadors of a country so if you understand the potential what would you do is that you would target the locals to understand your destination really well one is of course to make money you know while the period you know where we are not receiving international tourists but i think you should be a little bit you know uh mindful of your objective too it's not just about profitability but what do we want our locals to do for us when the market picks up how do we turn them to become brand ambassadors and marketers of a destination all of uh tourism attractions or tourism products what kind of stuff i told you you know we should have interpretation and education as part of the way that we sell our tourism attraction and destination if we give people the right information the right tools should we look at tools in fact you know what sort of tools can we give the locals so that when the market picks up will they help us market our destinations should we work on the mindset of the locals to tell them how important tourism is when things pick up know your destination really well it's just like when i go to a hotel and i train the hotels i always tell them get your staff to know your your lunch products your dinner products your hotel room if you can't let your staff stay in your hotels rooms to understand your product and your fnb your menu and so forth so when they sell they sell with a passion and they sell with that conviction isn't it so it's the same you know if you want to sell your destination who should be the ones who should be your ambassadors and who do we trust word of mouth who do we trust our locals right so should we be marketing to our locals in a way should we give them the right tools to help us sell our destination what sort of education and interpretation should we give the locals so that when it's time is right they become our brand ambassadors to me i think that's more important than looking at how should we sell in terms of economics you know our destination to make up for the numbers until the tourists come and we ignore the locals and then go for the tourists you know that should not be the mindset today i hope that that shifts happen that we focus on the locals and let the locals do the selling thanks a lot uh nisha thanks for your time and uh pleasure to have you and uh hope to have you in our future sessions thank you so much for this opportunity and my best wishes to you chris in reading and ll trip and to everyone else in our tourism and hospitality industry we are in this together and we will come out of this together thank you so much thank you very much well that's it for today thanks for watching cr talks in the next episodes we'll be talking to more travel industry stakeholders on how the overcoming challenges to rebuild travel industry so join us on our next episodes until then goodbye ,True,True,False,False

year the 21st of June 2020 today we also celebrate Father's Day that is thank God for the gift of fatherhood and the many blessings which come with that responsibility our entrance antiphon the Lord is the strength of his people a saving refuge for the one he has anointed save your people Lord and bless your heritage and govern them forever I invite all of you to stand even at home and join us in the entrance Him praise my soul the king of heaven [Music] Oh [Music] [Laughter] [Music] song [Music] in the name the father and of the son of the Holy Spirit our men peace be with you and with your spirit brothers and sisters that is acknowledged our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words in what I have done and in what I have failed to do through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-virgin all the angels and saints and you my brothers and sisters to pray for me to the Lord our God may Almighty God have mercy on us forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life amen [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let us pray grando Lord that we may always Revere and love your holy name for you never deprived of your guidance those who set firm on the foundation of your love to our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit one God for ever and ever amen the first reading a reading from the Prophet Jeremiah Jeremiah said I hear so many disparaging me Tara from every side denounced him let us denounce him all those who used to be my friends watched for my downfall perhaps you'll be seduced into error then we will master him and take our revenge but the Lord is at my side a mighty hero my opponents will stumble mastered confounded by their failure everlasting unforgettable disgrace will be theirs but you Lord of Hosts you who probe with justice who scrutinized the loins and heart let me see the Vengeance you will take on them for I have committed my cause to you sing to the Lord praise the Lord for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hands of evil men the word of the Lord thanks be to God [Music] it is for you that I suffer towards that same covers my face that I have become a stranger to my nail into my

on sorrows for your love and your compassion your poor when they see it will be odd God seeking hearts will refine for the Lord lessons to avert on does not burn her surveys [Music] the C&O let's live a great hearts in your great [Music] the second reading a reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Romans sin entered the world through one man and through sin death and thus death has spread through the whole human race because everyone has sinned sin existed in the world long before the law was given there was no law and so no one could be accused of the sin of law-breaking yet death reigned over all from Adam to Moses even though their sin unlike that of Adam was not a matter of breaking a law adam prefigured the one to come but the gift itself considerably outweighed the fall if it is certain that through one man's fall so many died it is even more certain that divine grace coming through the one man Jesus Christ came to so many as an abundant free gift the word of the Lord thanks be to God let us stand to welcome the words of the gospel [Music] the Lord be with you and with your spirit a reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew glory to you O Lord Jesus instructed the twelve as follows do not be afraid for everything that is now covered will be uncovered and everything now hidden will be made clear what I say to you in the dark tell in the daylight what you hear in whispers look clean from the housetops do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul fear him rather who can destroy both body and soul in hell can you not by two sparrows or any and yet not one falls to the ground without your father knowing why every hand your head has been counted so there is no need to be afraid here worth more than hundreds of sparrows so if anyone declares himself for me in the presence of men I would declare myself for him in the presence of my father in heaven are the one who disowns me in the presence of men I will disown in the presence of my father in heaven the gospel of the Lord praise to You Lord Jesus Christ my dear brothers and sisters in Christ we all have our fears in life fear is a natural emotion in the face of danger theft Yunis all but now enemies want to hurt us so fear is something the springs from within us it is something that is part of being human even Jesus was fearful the garden Gethsemane when he was facing his passioned when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane he told the father if it be possible let this cup be taken away from him my dear friends those are natural fears fear of pain fear of death fear of suffering but the reason and the kind of fear this is chronic fear this fear is irrational unreasonable this fear comes because of our past experiences it is a psychological fear a fear that came from past traumas in our lives that we have suffered especially when we were young when we were molested when we were raped when we have been wounded when people have been violent with us physically abused emotionally abused so this kind of fears continue to lived very much in our minds and not only these fears happened because of abusers sometimes they happen because of accidents in life an airplane crashed when you have fallen from the heist after that you are afraid to climb anymore you are fearful of heights so that is why many of us we suffer from all kinds of four beers plus crow for beer fear of high fear of water fear of blood fear of animals your cockroaches and lizards spiders besides fearing human beings so all these are the fears that crippled us and paralyzed list these fears sometimes cannot go away like if you have been locked in a closet by your parents there is a fear of Darkness a fear of being alone and so most the phobias that we have are the result of unhealed from us that is why this kind of fears us pair arises from moving forward they continue to have a hole over us and we are afraid of adventures when dear brothers and sisters the truth is fear is an emotion that is neutral in fact fear can be something positive not necessary negative because we fear covet 19 then we protect ourselves we shield ourselves from those who could pass the virus to rest it is because of fear that we know how to prepare ourselves that become more alert to the potential enemies in our lives but those fears that creepers that makers unable to live freely to be ourselves to be the person that God has made us to be to live a life of freedom and joy and passion because we have it because we are fearful these kind of fears destroy us indeed my dear brothers and sisters what is the cause of fear the ultimate cause of fear Jesus in the gospel tells us this do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul fear him rather who can destroy both body and soul in hell the reason why we are fearful simply because men have lost fear of God no reverence for God rejecting God in their lived this is the real reason the root cause of all other fears and I will explain to you why because when we no longer fear God all these other fears worse effaced the world has mins letters atheistic philosophers secularists they all say that the reason why we are not happy in life it is because men believe in God God is the one that causes us to be miserable God takes away our freedom God prevents us from being us from being alive because of God we are fearful of judgment we are fearful condemnation we are fearful of punishment and as a result because of these kind of years we are crippled we cannot do what we like we have no free all the atheistic philosophers is the way to find true freedom and true joy according to them is to remove God from our lives when God is there they said men will lift and this is the message that is being perpetuated in the world today by secularist it is remove God and you will be free my dear brothers and sisters look at the consequences when you remove God there is no truth there is no morality there is no right no wrong and you live alived without wisdom when you remove God from your life what is your greatest fear now fear of the heft because if there is no God death is inevitable no one no one can run away from deft that is why the world fears most is death when Jesus said you should fear most is God not death because we too have it means that everything that you have all the achievements that you have made all the efforts you have put into the empires that you have built the money that you have accumulated the wealth oh this will be gone you can't even carry a sand with you when you die because the worst is when you are dead you are finished you have only one life destroyed today the world is promoting this kind of philosophy you know you only live once for more fear of missing out because you have only one there is no life after death so you better leave this life to the fullest enjoy make use of everything that you have don't worry about the future why should you sacrifice for your children's children watch do you sacrifice all humanity what you want to worry about the planet you will no longer be around you better leave and joy take everything out of this world because you need live want when you fear death this is what we do we think only of ourselves because after that you'll be no more otherwise if you sacrifice your life it means when you die if you had never enjoyed but to waste what always when you fear death at the end is your greatest fear becomes fear of enemies now every man is your enemy because every man is your competitor you want to have the biggest share of the pie you have no more money more pleasures more power you can't have more everything because you want to have move every human being is your enemy is your competitor and you get angry because this fellow is richer than you this fella can go for beautiful holidays lavish holidays I cannot oh now you're jealous now you're resentful and what do you do you kill you rob you still you destroy this is happening not just in this world in between persons even in touch internationally you look at the world today the powerful nations are thinking about themselves we are actually on the edge of globalization but all my country first my people first the the world's not important we must have all the riches we must be the most powerful militarily economically financially all the resources they belong to us the rest of the world they can suffer but we have one humanity why all these competition among nations when actually we are all one that's why the world becomes our enemy so what is the cause of death the fear of their what is the cause it seemed that is weiss importantly in the second reading so beautifully simple says this simple says sin entered the world through one man and true sin death enters their fair spread through the whole human race because everyone has sinned it is seen that causes us to die not just biologically but spiritually because of selfishness of greed of anger hatred even we you can have all the things of this world you are not happy you'll be miserable and if you enjoy all the things of this world you are addicted to sex to pleasures to food you will die because you don't take care of your health when you have no control over your passion over your body you destroy your body so you tell me isn't it true simple says sin brings death the wages of sins import houses is theft so it is not God who brings death it's our sins God wants us believe God wants us to be free now you are no more free because the world is here enemy your fellow man is our enemy that is your enemy you are living a most fearful life how could we accuse God as the one who has taken with our freedom in our joy again simple so beautifully he tells us this he says there was no law sin existed in the world long before the law was given there was no law and no one could be accused of the scene of law breaking yet their reign over all from Adam to Moses whether God has given us the laws or not we was you sinned ignorant II so long as you give will you go against the law of nature nature's law will punish you even though you might not know is sinned so simple is saying if God gives us the laws it is just to tell us now this is something that you are doing is going to hurt you at your body at your soul your brothers and sisters so don't do it so the laws actually meant to guide us the laws are not meant to punish this it's just like if you have a bottle I label it poison if I don't lay but you drink you also die but if I lay buddy you drink you also die a person that's not law doesn't know it's poison but doesn't mean it just because it is not written poison if he drinks it he was via life he was do that so the point is we are not in a position to actually overcome the law that is why you note it is so ironic er that the lost today in the world formulated by men it's not to protect men from God protect man from his fellow men this is the worst is the greatest irony laws have been formulated to protect you against your father men in case they still in case they dropped in case they violate your body laws and yet people still disobey the laws because they are not capable just because you know that law doesn't mean to say you observe the law in fact the world is saying do everything but don't get caught my dear brothers and sisters only Jesus st. Paul makes it clear only Jesus can help us to overcome fear overcome fear of death Jeremiah himself he was opposed by so many enemies and he said the Lord of Hosts you prepare justice I commit my course to you God is the one who would take vengeance for as God is the one who gives us life so my dear brothers and sisters don't trust in the world the world is deceiving you fear God and you fear the loss look a kind of slavish fear but because you're wise because the laws will set you free God's love will give us the capacity to live a life of wisdom and grace amen that is profess our faith I believe in one God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and earth of all things visible and invisible I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God born of the father before all ages God from God light from light true God from True God begotten not made consubstantial with the father through him all things were made for us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man for our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate he suffered death and was buried and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end I believe in the Holy Spirit the Lord the giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son who with the father and the son is adored and glorified who has spoken through the prophets I believe in one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the Dead and the life of the world to come amen Jesus oh jesus not to leave our faith in fear because God a father who created those noses intimately and loves us with an everlasting love we pray for the grace to be worthy sons and daughters of the father that our response be Lord hear our prayer Lord hear our prayer for our Pope Francis that his mission to a the dignity and worth of every person and his preferential love for the oppressed and poor inspire others to do likewise let

our Lord our men let us seek God's will by praying the prayer of generosity Lord teach me to be generous teach me to serve as you deserve to give and not to count the cost to fight and not to heed the wounds to toil and not to seek for rest to labor and not to ask reward save that of knowing that I do your most holy will are men [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] rhe brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty father may the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name for our good and the good of all his Holy Church receive O Lord a sacrifice of conciliation in praise and grandeur cleanse by his action we beaming offering of a heart pleasing to you Grundy's through Christ our Lord amen the Lord be with you and with your spirit lift up your heart we lift them up to the Lord let us give thanks to the Lord our God it is right and just it is truly right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God well in you we live and move and have our being and while in this body we not only experience the divi effects of your great care but even now possess a pledge of live eternal or having received the firstfruits of the Spirit through whom you raised up Jesus on the day we hope for an everlasting share in a Paschal mystery and so with all the angels we praise you as in joyful celebration we acclaim [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are indeed holy O Lord and all you have created rightly gives you praise for through your son our Lord Jesus Christ but the power and working of the Holy Spirit you give life to all things and make them holy and never cease to gather a people to yourself so the from the rising of the Sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name therefore Lord we humbly implore you by the same spirit graciously make holy this gives have brought to you for consecration that they may become the body and blood of your son our Lord Jesus Christ at whose command we celebrate these mysteries for the night he was betrayed he himself took bread and giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body we should be given up for you in a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of My Blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant we should be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me the mystery of faith you proclaim your death O Lord and profess your resurrection until you come again therefore Lord as we celebrate the memorial the saving passion of your son his wondrous resurrection and ascension to heaven and as we look forward to his second coming we offer you in Thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice Luke we pray upon the oblation of your church and recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of your son and filled with His Holy Spirit may become one body one spirit in Christ may he make of us an eternal offering to you so that we may obtain an inheritance if you elect especially the Most Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of God we blessed Joseph her spouse we blessed apostles and glorious martyrs and before the Saints on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help may the sacrifice of reconciliation we pray O Lord advance the peace and salvation of all the world he pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church on earth if your servant Francis our Pope tanned me your unworthy servant the other bishops or the clergy and entire people you have gained for your wound listen graciously to the prayers of this family whom you have summoned before you in a compassion o merciful Father gather to yourself all your children scattered throughout the world toward apart brothers and sisters and to all who are pleasing to you at their passing from this life give kind admittance to your kingdom that we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory through Christ our Lord through whom you bestow on the world all that is good through him and with him and in him O God Almighty father in the unity of the Holy Spirit our glory and honor is yours for ever and ever amen the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to say of [Music] delivers Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the Blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ [Music] though Jesus Christ said the apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you look not on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign for ever and ever amen the peace of the Lord be with you always and with your spirit and we offer sharda one sign of Beast [Music] [Music] Weehoo Lamb of God behold him who takes with the sins of the world blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lamb lord I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed our communion antiphon the eyes of all looked to you Lord and you give them their food in due season so that this meant the act of spiritual communion Lord Jesus in the gospel today he of Torah's not to fear but to fear for our lives not to fear enemies most of all not to fear daft boy cause you have conquered theft by your resurrection you have conquered Sindh Michael loved indeed simple houses if the sin of one men has caused so many to sin and to die and this race that you have done but Chase for us saved us all so Lord Jesus unworthy as I am to received you yet because of your love for me your mercy so this morning as I cannot receive a sacramentally I pray that you will come spiritually into my heart to live in me to dwell in me so that I will have the courage to be your weakness to proclaim you as the Lord in a very secular atheistic well run me Lord Jesus your grace fill me with your joy and your peace a peace that overcomes every fear in my life thank you Lord Jesus amen Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] he warned me well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let us pray renew and nourish by the sacred body and precious blood of your son we ask your mercy O Lord that what we celebrate with constant devotion may be our pledge of redemption through Christ our Lord amen my dear brothers and sisters as we know today we celebrate a Father's Day those who are biologically fathers and of course including the priests who are called spiritual fathers and during his father's days we really want to thank God for all the fathers who look after their children or spiritual children you know someone sent me a picture that says all girls love their fathers most because the father is the man the only man that will never hurt her it is true and not quite true through in a sense that all fathers surely must protect their daughters and their sons as well and should never do anything to hurt any of the Assurant on the other hand most fathers including spiritual fathers that was priests we all so weak we are human we do hurt our children by a harsh words by our authoritarian ways by the lack of understanding some out of weakness and I know that they even took advantage of their children the daughters sexually it is a terrible sinned witnessed witnessed a broken world so today let us pray for our fathers that they will be exemplary fathers reflecting always the compassion and the love of our family father so please join me as I pray over the fathers if your father is there with you extend your hands over him and as a family pray for your father's Lord Jesus we thank you for showing us your father's loved for showing us the face of your father one of compassion one of Providence one of security he's all rocked he's our fortress he looks after us he protects us and right the prodigal father always waiting for us to return home without judging us without condemning us Lord Jesus I pray that these gives these qualities of a heavenly father that are reflected in you as our Good Shepherd would also be present nor our fathers Lord Jesus you know how weak we are without your grace we would not be able to reflect your Father's love and mercy so I ask you Lord to grant our fathers these Grace's so that they can truly fulfill their roles as biological fathers and spiritual fathers to those entrusted to them though Jesus I also pray for forgiveness from those who have been hurt by their father's brief understanding that they too will come to know their father truly loved them even though sometimes they do not know how to express that love we ask for guilt forgiveness from all our children or those times that we have heard them instead of encouraging and strengthening them run healing or Jesus the bow fathers and children who have been hurting one another even though they loved so Lord Jesus I pray for this grace to the wisdom fidelity selflessness humility and forgiveness Thank You Heavenly Father for showing us the way amen so we give a ha wrong applause to your father's at home okay please pray for us and pray for us priests too because I know that as priests we have heard so many of you because of our calloused words at times our lack of patience so please forgive us and if your fathers have hurt you and just pray for them we are human beings we are just doing our best we could father's a mend the Lord be with to you and with your spirit your mighty God bless you all the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit amen go in peace glorifying the Lord by your life thanks be to God just some announcements dear sisters and brothers every third weekend of the month parishes have

156,Ql1XlSwm4Os,CNA Insider,Inside Singapore’s COVID-19 Vaccine Development: Lunar-Cov19 | The Vaccine Quest | Ep 1/2,2021-03-25T12:00:07Z,"A Singapore-based team at Duke-NUS Medical School have spent the last year working on a COVID-19 vaccine. How close are they to producing one and will it help end the pandemic?

Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and San Diego-based Arcturus Therapeutics have partnered to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. It is a self-replicating mRNA vaccine. So while the mRNA technology is similar to vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, this vaccine requires a lower dose.

From pre-clinical trial to animal testing and finally to human trials, follow the whole process of vaccine development to see how COVID-19 vaccines are being produced at record speeds. Meet the scientists on the frontlines of the war against the deadly coronavirus that has claimed millions of lives around the world.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] this might look like a page of random letters but to us virologists this paints a vivid picture [Music] so this is the genome of sar cov2 the virus which causes covet 19. [Music] it is the blueprint of the enemy that we are facing and hides its secrets so this portion highlighted in red identifies the key protein that the virus uses to infect human cells [Music] this is its achilles heel armed with this genetic information we have the tools to fight back against the virus we can start our quest for a vaccine there's growing concern as the wuhan pneumonia outbreak continues to spread the u.s has confirmed its first case of the wuhan virus the cdc has raised the alert level from one to two japan says that it now has a case of a person contracting this coronavirus here in singapore two more cases have tested positive we now have a name for the disease and it is covet 19. my name is wayne young i'm a professor here at uk us emerging infectious diseases program i'm the principal investigator here on singapore site developing the vaccine so this is where we do all the research on viruses the team that was working on this vaccine really people who have a very specialized set of skills [Music] rookie the always is looking at antibodies and which part of virus the antibodies target eugenia she's measuring genes to look at whether the vaccine is safe chiwei dr chen is trained in t cell so these are cells that get rid of infected cells and then esther has developed a mouse model because we need to know that the vaccine will protect against infection so these are the people that work in the team the vaccine team hello how i found out i was gonna be working on this vaccine is quite funny actually i think in march um prof we walked past our office and he just came in and tapped me on the shoulder and he went i need you to get me some mice and i looked at him for and then he said the vaccine worked and i said okay but at that point i had no idea which vaccine we were talking about i wasn't part of it in the beginning so then someone asked me oh why don't you just ask annyong so i went to him and i said you know i really would like to be part of the coveted response he said oh really i got ccd on the emails and then i realized this was really much bigger than what i initially thought it was when i first came onto this i didn't really know that i would be working on a project of such magnitude when we first found out that we were going to be working on the vaccine it had hit almost every single country worldwide there was so much more of an impetus to really get the work going this is the first pandemic caused by coronavirus we have rung the alarm bell loud and clear with the outbreak emerging in january a team was formed by the who in collaboration with the chinese authorities i was one of uh 12 international representatives to go on that mission when i arrived in beijing the country really had been brought to its knees the streets were empty there were no cars very few people as a result of what we saw in beijing and elsewhere in china we had fears that the world wasn't ready for this the speed of the spread of this virus is really unprecedented within one to two months almost every corner of the world reported to have the virus we come back to the basic principle how brand new pathogens can cause a pandemic sars cov2 has got some advantages which allow it to transmit very successfully the virus is highly transmissible infectious and it spreads through direct contacts and respiratory droplets the amount of virus in someone with covert 19 is actually highest right at the beginning of the disease even before the symptoms start about 80 percent have very mild symptoms or no symptoms you go around you meet with people you go to a shopping center you go to restaurants you share food because you don't know that you have the infection so this gives the virus a particular advantage in terms of spread so the community spread is is inevitable this is a model of a saskatoon virus to assassinate v2 right this looks like a crown that kings and queens wear and so that's how it got this name coronavirus these spike proteins here you can think of it like a key and the virus uses this key to unlock the cell to get into the cell and it binds to certain receptors that are on our cells in the lungs and then it attaches goes in gets taken in your immune system is like an army and what we want them to do is recognize this protein so that when the virus does get into you these soldiers will recognize bad and then they'll start to attack how vaccines work is to produce antibodies and the antibodies will then bind to these spike proteins and it'll block the spike proteins on the virus from binding to the receptor and going into cells which are in the lungs our body also makes a second thing and that's called killer cells t-cells are sometimes known as killer t-cells because one of their roles is that they are able to recognize parts of the invading pathogen in infected cells and can kill these directly infected cells and thus stop the infection from progressing any further the vaccines that trigger both the antibody as well as the t-cells they are the ones that you know hopefully will produce the best form of immunity hi joe how are you hey great professor how are you doing i'm good the vaccine we're developing is a partnership with actors therapeutics which is based in san diego this is the team from actuaris this is uh joe payne from the ceo of actors and neda the head of investor relations they are a biotech company that essentially develops genetic material as a way of delivering drugs we'll get the data to you soon yeah that's great news we also have some additional test articles that we're getting shipped and sending your way this partnership was really brought about by an economic development board edb of singapore in january edb connected me with actress therapeutics and that's how we started the conversation bye for now thanks bye okay [Applause] [Music] this is it this is where true innovation happened we're very proud of the scientists here this is where the vaccine was discovered and i think that's important to know singapore approached us in february of 2020 and they evaluated our technologies and it consummated in a deal that we would develop this vaccine together and singapore brought in the duke nus medical school at that time and we've been working on this vaccine ever since the arcturus vaccine candidate is a messenger rna vaccine we call the vaccine lunar cove 19. everybody knows what dna is you get it from your mom and your dad but it's permanent dna gets converted to rna and then rna makes stuff makes proteins and enzymes the vaccine we're making is in the form of rna so the idea then is that if we inject this into people then the rna will make a lot more of these spikes so it cannot make this virus it only makes the spike this is infectious but this is not without the virus your immune system learns that if they see this protein they attack so when you do get the infection which is this entire virus over here and they see these little spikes which looks exactly like what we fed them before your army comes out to attack how we're different from moderna and pfizer vaccines is we use this star mrna it's called self-transcribing and replicating rna which means our dose level is lower than conventional messenger rna vaccines our dose level is 7.5 micrograms that's very tiny dose my thumb it weighs around 10 grams and 10 grams of messenger rna is millions of doses so you can see that entire room is just full of freezers storing different types of vaccines there's unique challenges with working with any group that's distant in here we have refrigerators and freezers it's really important that we store things properly we are shipping important materials over borders and that can present some challenges if it's temperature sensitive materials we have to make sure that they're tightly controlled there's a difference between walking to another building on our campus versus shipping items to singapore [Music] the arcturus made the vaccine and they sent that to us and we are the ones that tested whether those vaccine candidates work once you give a vaccine to a person or an animal you will take their blood then their serum and they will test whether those antibodies are in there so these are serum that the company has sent from mice that were given the vaccine so they have vaccinated mice in the u.s and they sent us the serum to test for antibodies to sus kobe 2. they sent us down the vaccines as well and we tried the vaccines in a different mouse model so an animal model is what we generally do before we go into human trials and that happens to fall under my domain in the lab so in this case we use mice mice don't get infected with copic 19. they need a very particular type of receptor that can only be expressed in human lungs so basically the mice that we got are bioengineered mice that allows them to be infected with the virus every single lab in the world wanted their hands on these animals these mice were expensive [Music] this is a vaccine candidate from arcturus i'm preparing them now to deliver into the animals to test for the immune responses so first things first we would vaccinate the animals with different doses and then daily we would just monitor the animals and check their immune responses and whether there's any adverse effects of the vaccine on the animals obviously if the vaccine candidate is not producing an immune response if there are safety concerns in the animal stage that will halt your vaccine for sure usually to get a vaccine from where we are at now where we have an idea a starting point to the point of getting into human trials is about three to five years right but there's being an emergency of course we want to do this faster somewhere between four to five months and i think it can be done [Music] when sauce broke in 2003 i just joined the hospital so when they identified this as a sas chronovirus ii well it felt like um you know this is like sars again but with some real differences i don't think anyone could have anticipated how quickly it has affected you know the whole world it was only in the first couple of weeks of march that we truly appreciated the devastating nature of this pandemic it not only was a raging pandemic worldwide it was also a raging financial economic crisis nothing was this grave the synchronized global lockdown was something that we had never seen singapore confirmed 23 only nine new 142 cases of covet 19 infections most workplaces across singapore have shut as the country begins what's being called a circuit breaker so let me show you where our liquid nitrogen tank is this is where we store our frozen cells that we use for our experiments [Music] during the circuit breaker we were told to go on split shifts which is am and pm usually there's 16 of us in the lab and whenever we're upset that we have to support we complain a little bit but when it became split shift it was only essential people that were allowed to come back so this is the biosafety cabinet we do all our sterile work inside here it got mentally draining because you then felt like you're fighting a battle on your own it also got lonely because we are used to let being being together so the research for the vaccine is actually being carried out at two different labs uh one over there at duke and u.s medical school and over here in academia building where the viramex lab is during the circuit breaker period because it's just yourself sometimes you can be like rushing around doing 10 different things at a goal experiments are such that we can't just put it aside and run off i'm leaving a note for the next shift so that they know what to do and that requires a lot of coordination between the aim team and the pm team we would leave messages on napkins put it on boxes as simple as please do not remove this in terms of doing experiment laboratory work this is very difficult and because of covet lockdown flight schedules are a problem because air travel has decreased it's taking longer and longer for us to get the things in that's another very challenging thing that we've had a lot of the filter tips and normal tips have been in short supply we've even had to change the brand that we used because the tips have a backlog for about six months a lot of countries had gone under lockdown which meant that consumables even as simple as pipette tips factories were not producing it at the rate they were before so this is the cold room where we keep some of our reagents that we use for the vaccine trial this room is four degrees so it's a room that's like a walk-in fridge an assay is a test that we used to identify for example whether there is antibodies that target the sars2 virus reagents that are specific to size 2 for example for antibody detection didn't even exist right this is a new pathogen but as companies created these there was a huge demand for these limited reagents people started working on vaccines right which means everyone's fighting for the same resources so right now we're ordering reagents consumables for the antibody assays that we're running we're also trying to find replacement brands one thing the pandemic did was it actually brought everyone together by distributors and vendors they knew of how urgent our work is and they will try their best to accelerate it and get it to as soon as possible vaccines take a long time i i cannot emphasize how long that actually takes with how fast this virus is spreading we cannot take 10 to 15 years to develop a vaccine we need to do this much faster without sacrificing safety without sacrificing the quality of the vaccine we needed to shrink this 10 to 15 year process into literally a year or a year and a half so everything happens sort of at the same time as the situation gets worse across the world a lot of the deadlines actually got pulled up i think aing young got the most front of the deadlines and he will come and you whisper to me i think he needs to be faster and i'll be like there's nothing much i can do about it there's obviously a pressure do this as fast as we can and be successful in what we're doing the fortunate thing is that now we're in possession of a lot of technology that was not previously available we can still get that richness in data that would in the past would have required us years to collect it's not so much a race with other competitors but rather a race with a virus right because the slower we are the more the pandemic will cause society in terms of lives and economy so of course the team will have a cool long hour still to you know work weekends 24 7 sometimes right it's pretty late sun is set very few people are around so now this is the last sample that i'm loading for um this set of experiments i'm shui and my role in this vaccine trial is to study the t-cell responses towards this vaccine it has been a bit of a rush to make sure that we get everything out in the quickest possible time and so washing is complete and now i can turn off the machine during this period i don't have a free second usually the american company they're based in california they wake up when we go to sleep basically as i come home around 10 11 all the emails start coming in we had one very long experiment that dragged on to very late at night and so when i finally finished it it was about 3am i'm just packing up for the day i brought in a lot of snacks i brought in like coffee to just keep myself mentally and physically awake full throughout this long day [Music] yeah there were so many long days i've lost count at the peak of the experiments we would start at 4 30 am in the morning and we were in at 7 pm grab a quick dinner go home and work on paperwork all the way and then we restart again the next day [Music] we are just coming in to check on some animals and some of the cell cultures in the lab it's relatively quiet because it's a sunday morning most of us will work on the weekends the work is really exciting right now there was one weekend when we were in animal facility and it was the first clue that the vaccine was working in a live model and for an hour it was just me with the results and i was the only one who knew just how good the vaccine was and i think that that's our feeling sort of overwhelms all the other hard work that you had to put in all the sacrifices you made on the weekends and yeah at the end of the day it's worth it but i i wouldn't mind sleeping in once in a while i'm looking forward to that [Music] so the devastating impact of the global pandemic affected some of the biggest drivers of global growth tremendously there was no tourism there was no travel wide range of activities from hotels to airlines to restaurants and so on that came to a standstill the entire world was shutting down so my husband's in korea right now he was also working on a corvette project there a vaccine project and i was getting involved with the vaccine project here so we decided we will work on these and once the board is open again we'll meet up but then as time went on and we realized there's no end to this we were getting quite frustrated uh him on his side me on my side we do a lot of whatsapp skyping or he'll play piano and i'll listen to him while doing something else i know he's trying his best but it's not easy definitely not hello [Music] i'm sri lankan and in march i had a flight ticket to go home and because of the lockdown my parents said since i'm working on something very important why don't you stay there and for the first time i can't fly home it's actually scary it's scary because i tell my parents i'm like please don't get sick because i can't come i constantly have to tell them hey you know wear a mask don't go out especially my parents please don't go out my grandmother is very very old my father is a heart patient and also has underlying asthma so he's really at the highest risk to get covered get sick with if he gets infected we're actually smack in the middle obviously i'm working on a vaccine for everyone's benefit but i'm a bit selfish too i'm working on it because i hope a vaccine comes out and my family can get it my my parents my grandparents my friends and i can go home and see them when i get tired that's sort of what i think about you know this is this is this is why it's worth doing this bye guys take care love you bye [Music] a very good friend of mine her father-in-law lives in new jersey so he got sick and he was on a ventilator for about a week she messaged me that day to say that he passed on it really hit home that this is a virus that kills and then she said you guys need to work much harder much faster and and i thought yeah everything that we do every day that we come in the grind while it's very tiring it makes a difference even if it saves one life it makes a [Music] difference [Music] this is the edit spot reader and this tells us the t-cell response to the vaccine the experiment is almost finished and i can finally analyze the data and conclude this experiment actus actually gave us two different kinds of vaccines and we didn't know how these will actually play out would they actually generate a good immune response or will they just kind of sit there in a body and do nothing when we actually saw very robust responses to one of the vaccine candidates it was awesome okay so basically each column represents a single animal the results we see here is that we detect many spots on this plate and each spot represents a t cell that is responding to the vaccine this is a very robust t-cell response and this is very promising towards the development of a vaccine singapore's covet 19 restrictions will be eased with the start of phase two i'm alec cook i'm a modeler here in the school public health at nus i'm going to take you through to the operate room usually for the outbreak team only but i'll make an exception for you guys this time early on in the pandemic my research team got repurposed to work on developing models that can help us understand how the covid pandemic was going to play out so this is one of the models that we developed early on in the pandemic this shows you how many people in the population would be infected by the time we reached to june so the basic reproduction number is one of the key quantities that we use to understand a novel outbreak it tells us how transmissible a virus or bacteria will be if the reproduction number is one then you have one person advanced one person affects one person you never really have a big epidemic if the reproduction number is two one case could infect two people who infect four people who infect eight people and so on until a very large fraction of pop patients infected so if the reproduction number is below one then the epidemic will die out by itself at one extreme you've got incredibly contagious viruses like measles at the other extreme you've got viruses which actually don't spread very easily such as influenza but the reproduction numbers closer to one for the sarcovirus we think probably around about two or three which actually is quite large if you do absolutely nothing to try to control it around about 80 of the population will be infected at the end of the first wave for us to control the pandemic we need to reduce the transmissibility by half from two to one and that means reducing our social contacts by half or vaccinating half the population so this is where the rest of the team are so another thing that we're doing just now is looking at vaccines and how much we'd have to vaccinate in order to protect the population to stop all the infections get rid of the guys in red one concept which is very relevant in the context of vaccination is heritage immunities what does that actually mean card immunity is when you get protection from those around about you you may not have been vaccinated but if enough people around the butt you have been vaccinated and become immune that way then you get protected because the virus cannot reach you now we know that some people who get vaccinated don't get the response they need so the ones in black received the vaccine and got protected the ones in grey got the vaccine but the vaccine didn't work for them the ones in green would be protected from those around the bottom so if the vaccine efficacy is 70 in order to make sure that there's only black green green and there's no red here then we need to vaccinate somewhere around about 80 percent of the population in order to reach herd immunity through [Music] vaccination [Music] so right now we're entering into a bsl3 facility which is a high containment facility for infectious diseases bsl 3 stands for biosafety laboratory 3. in the bsl3 facility the pathogens there are potentially life-threatening and we do not want them getting out so if you look to the right over here this is a gathered area it's protected place and only for authorized personnel because this is where we house the live virus for the kovit 19. this is a cctv camera that looks at everything that's happening in this facility you see every single lab you can see what everyone is doing and who's in the facility so now that we know there's an immune response in the animals we now need to go and check whether the immune response is protective so we will go in to infect these animals with a live size cov2 virus this is called a challenge trial so a lot of things happen in the bsl3 is actually quite exciting this is where we infect the animals that been vaccinated with the live virus so this is benson he's our facility manager he runs the entire facility here nobody gets in or out without him so this is what we call a papr which is a powered air purifying respirator each of us wears this in the lab and this clips onto our system about here and as you can see it bubbles up and it keeps us breathing filtered air all the time in the labs to ensure that we don't get exposed to anything so beyond this door you can't come in with us anymore because it's a containment corridor and right past these doors is where we house all the live viruses so this is excess control and only researchers are allowed to go past here in a usual vaccine development process you would have all your animal data ready packed up before you go into a phase one human clinical trial right now in singapore we hope to start human clinical trials alongside the efficacy testing in the animals any clinical trial in singapore needs two things right you need to convince the hsa the health sciences authority that you have done all the necessary studies to show that the vaccine is safe and that it has a chance of working and then we need to go and apply to the ethics board where they will then review the ethics of the clinical trial what i'm doing right now is uh trying to collate this immunogenicity information right i'm working through the weekend a lot of us are working through the weekend trying to get this data analyzed graphed summarized and sent to arcturus so they can update hsa you can see here actually when we give the mice just saline solution there's no response but when we give the vaccine so the red lines are the vaccine responses beautiful antibody responses these antibodies that are produced by the vaccine also protect so it can block infection [Music] so we have to make sure that we cross all the hurdles the safety the likelihood that this thing will work and that is done ethically i don't foresee any major setback from the regulatory submission because the data has been very good i think there was a sense of urgency we were behind the other vaccines that were being produced in the states and in oxford [Music] i think the speed at which we've been able to work has really surprised everybody even those of us who are working on it every day we've just had the first publication of a clinical trial coming out of our uk vaccine trials phase one study there are two important findings one is that the safety profile of the vaccine looks very reassuring which is good news and secondly the immune responses that we have seen particularly with two doses of the vaccine are very good indeed in order to make this assessment of how well does the vaccine work and we need quite large numbers in the clinical trials so here in the uk we are rapidly moving towards more than 8 000 people vaccinated we're working with our colleagues in south africa and brazil and over the next month or so about another seven or eight thousand people will be vaccinated in those settings as well if we can get an effective vaccine that will allow people to get back to normal life hopefully after they are vaccinated so that people come out of lockdown and economic activity can be restored back to hopefully near normal levels so it looks like we just received news that we got the approval from hsa to start phase one and two trials um i think we're on our way hopefully we can start this next week or so just gonna catch up with esther gunn so no no clinical signs no no nothing yeah this is great i mean this means that the vaccine works to protect 100 of the vaccinated animals from lethal infection with suscob2 i don't think it matters at the end of the day that we are a few steps behind as long as this is a product that would give ideally the best chance of long-term university everything is pointing towards this being a good vaccine potentially a chance for one dose vaccine obviously this is still in an animal whether it works in humans in the same way we don't know if it's successful then we have a vaccine if not then we don't hi good morning everyone [Music] i'm dr jenny low i'm the principal clinical trial investigator for the luna cough 19 vaccine in singapore okay subjects will be registered at the reception we'll fill up the health declaration form we have just gotten the approval from health science authority singapore and our ethics body so this meeting now is to discuss the logistics to start the trial so the phase one and two trials basically ask primarily is the vaccine safe and then does it generate the immune responses in a sizeable population usually in hundreds the phase three trial you now need to vaccinate tens of thousands of people where you compared the vaccine with another group that got placebo and asked whether the group that got the vaccine has reduced rates of disease [Music] because we are now in a pandemic environment and time is of excellence we are combining phase one and two together by doing so there's no cause in between and that potentially would have saved us several months of work we are looking to recruit about 100 healthy volunteers ages 21 to 80 years of age in one room we'll have two subjects each so the safe distancing can be maintained this trial is unique because of kobit 19 pandemic situation we need to put in additional social distancing measures logistics is also more challenging in terms of planning the timeline i think for safety probably 15 minutes between each dose yeah great we will start at 10 and every subject there will be a 15 minutes interval okay but we will take another okay so we're all ready [Music] so right now what we're doing is really getting ready for phase one we just want to double check everything is good to go for next week when we heard that we got the green line for phase one we were actually quite excited everyone was excited we've been walking since march a lot of us have gotten very little sleep we're still getting very little sleep but it was actually quite exciting phase one two trial is about to start right now it's somewhat calm but very soon we're gonna start getting hundreds of samples coming through today is screening day so i'm going to brief the first batch of volunteers that have come in hi good morning everyone i'm dr jenny lowe i'm the principal investigator for this trial that you're here for screening today this vaccine is a new vaccine which means that it has never been tested in humans before after you have read through the consent form you will be given time to think through whether you want to take part in the study in reality the scientists working in the space of emerging infectious diseases are constantly aware and worried over the next outbreak you know or the next pandemic we have been partnering with duke and us medical school to accelerate this clinical trial process we have been practicing for such a scenario so susan everything is looking good now my coordinator will bring you next door to finish the rest of the health screening on retrospect we are glad that we have done those practice rounds now we are mentally and in many ways are physically ready for it as well [Music] once you have decided to take part in the study we will then proceed to do a physical health check on you before you are allowed to be enrolled into the trial [Music] we're all very excited the team has been working very very hard to get the trial up and ready to this stage we're screened quite a number of volunteers and we can start vaccination of the first batch of volunteers next week naturally there's a little bit of transportation but we are confident that we have put in stringent procedures checks and that the trial will proceed smoothly the pace with which vaccines are being developed is unprecedented but so is the problem you've got essentially the the worst disease outbreak for over 100 years we have new vaccine technologies we have very high financial investment and an unprecedented scientific collaboration so for this phase one clinical trial the doses will be tested in ascending doses so for example we will start with a very very small dose at one microgram as a single dose and once we are assured that there is no safety concern then we will move on to the next concentration and for the phase one trial we will go up to 10 microgram we will then select the best dose based on safety profile and also the immune response that we see in these subjects for all phase one and phase two vaccine clinical trial safety is the main end point that we are evaluating good morning susan how are you good if all this well then we'll proceed with the dosing today okay very mild side effects are very common from any medicinal products or vaccines that's actually the body's immune response to the vaccine if any subjects were to develop any symptoms that are of concern to the subjects health and long-term outcome we will have to report the study and evaluate we're all trying to complete phase one and two start phase three as soon as possible there's several vaccines now in the phase three trials astrazeneca collaboration with oxford university uh mondenum uh pfizer in collaboration with the bioentec you know the chinese have couple of vaccine companies that are also in late phase clinical trials [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you have countries who need vaccines urgently hosting companies that have produced vaccines they have these numbers that is required for trials especially phase three efficacy trials and this is why not just sinovac but others as well americans british german they are also looking at working with these countries and the vaccines once tested once approved will be made available in sufficient magnitude to this population so the country that hosts these trials obviously will accrue benefits from it thing at the back of everyone's mind is whether or not a country will try establishing some kind of quid pro quo you know they provide vaccines try to get something else we don't know for sure until we see things china is also very cognizant of the fact that their leader president xi jinping stated very clearly that as far as china is concerned the vaccine that they produce is going to be a global public good qing [Music] good morning how are you feeling today good [Music] the volunteers have to come back for a total of eight visits and every time they come back for the visits we will take blood samples from them it can be quite a sacrifice on the volunteers so we are very appreciative for all the volunteers that have stepped forward actually for this trial the response from the volunteers have been rather overwhelming and positive everybody wants to try to play a part in this fight against kobet 19. we got a lot of phone calls and email requests from people around the region unfortunately because the borders are closed we ended up having to turn down many of their requests [Music] we've just collected the blood samples from our volunteer so after this these tubes here will be sent for processing then it will be analyzed as a clinician scientist naturally i am very very curious to find out the results of the trial but we will have to wait until the trial is complete [Music] there is always a possibility that this simply may not work in humans we will certainly be disappointed but ultimately this is a very inevitable part of clinical trials where things may fail and they can and do fail actually we definitely hope that the vaccine that we are working on is going to be one of the contenders hopefully by doing that you know we can show the world that singapore also has the capability to conduct this type of research and development on vaccines and therapeutics in singapore the first batch of human samples have come into the lab [Music] there will be no such thing as a vaccine with no side effects increasingly there's a group of what we call the anti-vaxxers you may have to censor me because i really hate anti-vexes the question is if we have already licensed vaccines like pfizers and maternities what do we need to continue with this development

with the link in the description. Singapore is not known for its subtlety. From the minute you land and see the world’s
tallest indoor waterfall inside the airport, you’re inundated with beautiful, clean,
and green architecture. The sight of extraordinary, lush buildings
is so common that it almost becomes boring. All the rest, though, pale in comparison to
one. What the Eiffel Tower is to Paris, or the
Opera house to Sydney, the Marina Bay Sands is to Singapore. You just can’t visit without taking a photo. In this one, small, resort area is the famous
Gardens By The Bay, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, outdoor event piazza, convention center, theater,
art and science museum, luxury mall, two floating crystal pavilions, and, finally, 3-tower,
55-story hotel, with the world’s highest pool on top. Altogether, the Marina Bay Sands resort cost
$5.5 billion, making it the 5th most expensive building in the world. Perhaps the only subtle thing about it, is,
oddly enough, also, the reason it was built: the casino. Singapore has long been a popular destination
for tourism. Beyond its use of English - far more than
its closest competitor, Hong Kong, it’s also well-known for its beauty, lack of crime,
and cleanliness. As an aviation hub with one of the world’s
best airlines, it’s also cheap and easy for Asian travelers to get to. From Bangkok, 116 US Dollars, roundtrip, on
average, and 2 hours and 15 minutes, $219 and 4 hours and 44 minutes from Taipei, and
$318, and 8 hours, a quick hop, relatively speaking, from Sydney. But, back in the early 2000s, Singapore found
itself losing to its many regional competitors. It’s share of tourism in the Asia-Pacific
region shrunk from 13.1% in 1991, to just 5.8% by 2004. This, was attributed, in part, to its lack
of natural physical attractions, a symptom of its small size. Today, Singapore has only 1 of the 1,121 total
UNESCO World Heritage Sites, its Botanical Gardens, and, at the time, none. Neighboring Malaysia, meanwhile, has 4, Vietnam,
8, and Thailand, 5. All three of which are well-known, inexpensive
destinations. To stay competitive and revive its national
image, the Singapore government surprised everyone in 2004 when it floated the radical
idea of legalizing casinos, four decades after making them illegal. Culturally, casino gambling was considered
destructive and fundamentally at odds with the country’s very conservative mentality
and willingness to ban or regulate just about anything. Social and religious groups protested, a rare
sight in authoritarian Singapore, and 30,000 people signed a petition in opposition. “Casi-No” bumper stickers could be seen
on cars and hundreds of polls, surveys, and dialogues were held. It soon became known that the city-state’s
then 4 million people were roughly evenly divided on the issue, and calls were made
for a referendum - an indicator of how passionate the public had become. Then, in April of 2005, just 13 months later,
it was all over. The government announced it would allow the
construction of not one but 2 casino resorts - one in the centrally-located Marina Bay,
and the other on its southern island of Sentosa. For comparison, Sydney debated the merits
of opening casinos for a full 6 years. But, for the Singaporean government, this
quick, effective, and sometimes contradictory decision making, is characteristic. In 1987, for example, its family planning
slogan was changed from “Stop at two” directly to “Have 3 or more if you can afford
it”. In any case, the government had made up its
mind and began soliciting Request for Concepts from interested bidders. Importantly, the government invented the now-popular
term “Integrated Resort” to describe a single development with an attached hotel,
convention center, entertainment, theme parks, luxury retail shops, fine dining, and yes,
a casino. This was its billion-dollar hint to bidders
- although they were interested, first and foremost, in developing one of Singapore’s
first casinos, they were to be designed as iconic and symbolic national landmarks. Of the 19 submitted proposals, 14 were shortlisted,
and 4 continued with formal bids. Finally, in May 2006, the Las Vegas Sands
Corporation was selected for Marina Bay, thanks to its proven success in Nevada and Macau. Also crucial was the architect - Israeli,
Moshe Safdie, who, at age 27, had designed Montreal’s famous Habitat 67. Safdie’s impressive proposal for a 3-tower
block design was cleverly modeled after playing cards. Each of the three towers would be composed
of two structures - one flat, and one curved ten times more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This unique concept breaks conventional rules
of architecture in that higher floors actually become larger and larger, until they reach
the hotel’s three, most expensive and luxurious, “Chairman Suites”. As if not ambitious enough, there was only
a 27-month window for construction, which required a 4-day cycle, meaning an entire
floor would need to be completed every four days to stay on track. The Singapore government argued that a hotel
this grand deserved an equally impressive pool. It was decided that a three-acre, 340-meter
long park would be built on top, complete with jogging paths, four swimming pools, an
observation deck, promenade, restaurants, spa, and 900 species of plants. Called the SkyPark, it resembled a ship sailing
above Singapore. Beautiful as it was, the park presented several
significant challenges. First, how to get it up. Ultimately, the hull was constructed on the
ground in 14 sections, then lifted into place, at a slow, safe speed of 46 feet per hour. 16 hours to lift each segment all the way. Second, as infinity pools, the water needed
to flow evenly to create the illusion of falling off the top. This, despite the fact that the 380,000-gallon
pools also laid on top of three 55-story towers which would sink over time as their foundations
shifted, each at a different rate, and all susceptible to wind. To protect against this, four joints were
placed beneath each pool, capable of moving up to 500 millimeters to offset any changes. Getting the pool from Indiana took more than
30 cargo ships, and the park alone was, itself, a $150 million project. When it soft-opened in 2010, the Marina Bay
Sands was neither the world’s, nor Singapore’s tallest building. Rather, it turns heads for somehow being somewhat
absurd, fantastic, and iconic, all at the same time. It’s one of those few buildings which retains
its beauty no matter the angle, vantage point, or time of day. Inside the hotel, visitors are greeted with
a stunning hollow atrium. The pools create the sensation of swimming
on top of skyscrapers. While the other side of the SkyPark offers
a view of the garden and endless flow of container ships passing through the strait. The attached mall, with its indoor canal,
is somehow just as impressive. Further south is Resorts World Sentosa. It features a more family-friendly environment
with an aquarium, water park, Universal Studios, wax museum, hotel complex, and Singapore’s
other casino. Although less architecturally impressive,
Resorts World Sentosa is remarkable for its sheer density of attractions. Unsurprisingly, both locations have been hugely
successful. The Marina Bay Sands has quickly become the
world’s most profitable casino and been a huge source of growth for the Singapore
economy. As of 2018, the tiny city-state receives more
international visitors than New York, Dubai, or Paris, and only fewer than Macau, London,
Bangkok, and Hong Kong. This was and is the best case for legalizing
casinos - here, or anywhere. Proponents argue it’s “easy money” - that
there’s no faster way to create wealth out of thin air. Amazingly, Singapore’s two resorts contribute
between 1.5 and 2% of its entire GDP. They create an estimated 20,000 jobs directly
- in the form of dealers, inspectors, hotel staff, entertainers, cashiers, slot attendants
and so on, and an additional 30-40,000, indirectly. Not only do they attract more tourists, but
also higher quality - business travelers and VIPs. On the other hand, some are skeptical of the
economic benefits, suggesting increased tax revenue is offset by increased expenditures
in the form of enforcement, infrastructure, and, not to be forgotten, the social costs
of casinos. While the majority of Singaporeans admit to
gambling themselves, in some form, most also believe casinos are unique in the way they
encourage addiction. Their interiors are designed with the express
intent of keeping players inside as long as possible, which, for a small minority, leads
to pathological behavior. This tiny group of people then disproportionately
cost their communities in the form of lost productivity, bankruptcy, crime, welfare,
and, of course, the suffering of their families. Casinos, unlike races or cruises, are available
24/7. It’s said that a casino within 10 miles
of a person’s home leads to a 90% increase in the odds of that person becoming a pathological
gambler. One 2005 study also estimated such a person
costs themselves and their community $19,711 on average, a year. Casinos also target specific culturally vulnerable
groups. For instance, by adhering closely to Feng
Shui principles to play on superstition. Still others, accept a combination of these
arguments. They argue that players will travel to wherever
gambling is available - the only question is whether to capture their spending locally. In the U.S., for example, states are more
likely to legalize casinos when their neighbors do first. In Singapore, gamblers have always had easy
access in Malaysia, Indonesia, and on cruises. This was one of the primary rationales for
Singapore’s decision back in 2005 - why not benefit from what’s already going to
happen? But, although it would do the unthinkable
and open the door to casinos, it would do so in a uniquely Singaporean way. While every other gambling hub in the world
flaunts its casinos for all they’re worth, Singapore has been very careful to balance
profit with the attendant social costs - arguably, at great expense. From the very beginning, the National Development
commission stipulated the casino could not occupy more than 3-5% of the total resort
space. The original plan for a strong Venetian theme
and monorail connecting the casino to the ferry terminal were later replaced, at the
insistence of the government, with the SkyPark and pool. The resort is also the company’s only property
where the location precedes the “Sands” brand in its name - a subtle reflection of
the projects’ focus. The original architect, an expert in casino
design, was later replaced with Safdie, who was instead known for impressive and unique
architecture. The two gaps between the building’s three
towers grant a view of the sea beyond it. It complements rather than intrudes on the
skyline, in contrast to most casinos. In practice, this means the Marina Bay Sands
is neither as tacky as Vegas or shady as Macau. It’s an immediate, iconic, symbol of Singapore. You might spend hours shopping, eating, swimming,
even stay at the hotel, but aside for the occasional sign, you may not even notice the
existence of the casino - where the company makes roughly 70% of its profit. For its part, the government has also taken
tangible steps to reduce problematic behavior. Family members can request their loved ones
be barred from gambling, those under 21 are forbidden from entering casinos, and ATMs
are not available inside the gambling areas. Most significantly, Singapore residents are
required to pay an entry fee of $150 or $3,000 per year to access each resort - neither of
which are allowed to refund or reimburse that fee. Today, ten years after their grand openings,
most people would say Singapore has succeeded - it’s reaped the economic benefits while,
at the same time, managing the effects. Still, in hiding its casinos, it runs the
risk of also hiding their damage, their casualties, their hardships. By taxing dubious behavior, Singapore not
only deters it and profits from it, but also risks economically depending on it. After Singapore is sanitized, making itself
clean, green, and its vices, unseen, it’s easy to forget what’s lost. If casinos, economics, and the economics of
casinos interest you, you’re going to love my upcoming 30-minute documentary about a
very related topic. I’ve been saying this for a while, but this
time, I promise, it’s written, recorded, and coming quite soon. In the meantime, you should listen to the
also related story of how two mathematicians applied their genius to the game of blackjack,
and then used their knowledge to win on wall street. This story, called “Fortune’s Formula”

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] uh now that's a lot of parcels since the covet 19 pandemic online retail sales have more than double so delivery services like ninja van have been working round the clock which is why today i am here to help out and to witness what big shoppers we are so kim how many parcels are we looking at delivering today uh for us between 100 to 120 today uh but for the whole of the country i expect about eight to 100 000 and that's an average day for us for 80 to 100 000 is an average day what happens during those like mega online sales that's a totally different kettle of fish we're looking at at least three to four times that sounds like 300 to 400 000 parcels in one day i would say around there that's what we're expecting this year wow what are we buying [Music] this one [Music] bought this leather jacket which looked really cool it was really cheap found out it was fake leather i had not worn it once this little tripod baby over here uh i thought it was big enough or strong and sturdy enough to hold my dslr camera which i'm recording from but um i realized the ring light that i purchased it came with a tripod screw as well so that's where my dslr camera is and this is still with me so i thought that five dollars would get me this giant roll of ribbon but who knew it was only one too long so it seems like quite a few folks bought things which did not quite turn out to be what they had expected but i guess because of the price it's almost a risk you don't mind taking online shopping is a very addictive hobby it is see what i bought a mouthguard and what this is for is to wear on your face and put a mask over it so that you can breathe and talk easily and i bought about 30 pieces of this only stuff guess what none of them wants to use it you know why because it looks like a dog muscle up so none of them wants to wear it oh my gosh that is so funny that my wife bought a few two probably like a dollar each or something things we buy like many i find myself spending about 20 more online as compared to pre-pandemic times so in this episode i want to find out is it really worth it to shop online and are we buying more than we need well first i want to get to the root of why we're shopping more online so besides the fact that it's convenient why would you choose to shop online you get to see a lot of variations of the same product sometimes you can get stuff people online recently we bought a lot of furniture from taopao for homeland and uh i think it's at least 30 to 50 percent cheaper as compared to the normal physical shops those people i spoke to say they shop online because of lower prices i want to know how much cheaper things are online what i've done is i've got an online and an offline bargain hunter and i put them too a shopping challenge [Music] 63 year old eric chong loves scarring stores in search for the best bargains 27 year old emilyn wong shops for almost everything online both shoppers will be tasked to buy these items three pieces of cod fish one men's polo teeth one bottle of face serum a pair of wireless bluetooth earphones one packet of xl size diapers and one box of 50 3-ply face masks [Music] i've given them two weeks to look for these items on my shopping list i'm back today to meet emilyn and eric i've asked raven she a digital marketing expert with over 10 years of consulting experience to join me in reviewing their shopping call ah so you've got all your shopping here we'll start with the cod fish first what are your prices okay emily 38.85 eric 39.60 micro fish i bought directly from the seafood wholesaler for frozen fish i think the online will definitely get a better deal because generally we will buy inbound and the degree charges will be waived let's take a look at the next item these shirts that you got show me the prices online 23 16 offline 1990 wow eric not bad where did you go offline shopping for this polo tea and i call up to various shops and i went to that shop that has that special promotional sale so for for brands for fashion brands i think it's a tiebreaker because generally uh there are a lot of different sales mechanics online and shopping malls because of what's happening they also give a lot of discounts from shopping mall white or store white discount let's move on to the next item and that's the this face serum right eric 37 emilyn 20 90 wow that's like almost 17 different for this okay so you really got a good deal on this what do you think raven for beauty products actually you can have a lot of options to ship from overseas there's option for group buys bug purchase you know so definitely i think this will be an online bargain all right let's take a look at the next item and it's these extra large disposable diapers okay let's take a load of prices emily 18 eric 21.95 okay for my diaper i got it online um they had a bundle deal so it was 72 for four packets they actually shipped it to my house but i have to buy four i actually have a one and a three year old um basically we we have not purchased any wet wipes or diapers uh in store before except when we really ran out like because of pool planning if otherwise we will always buy in bulk let's move on to the next item wireless earphones okay these are bluetooth headphones okay let's review the prices online 1390 off like 39.90 wow this one's a big difference eric yours is almost 20 bucks more so i've compared the two and they are you know almost exactly the same the specs on the box say they're exactly the same but the model number is slightly different and the price we've seen a big difference why is that the case so some of the some of these brands actually create uh products from different countries okay so they have a local version as well as a global version so that might explain the difference in terms of the price but also when you go for online they actually tend to carry a wider range of product available so they can have a newer version and a slightly older version even though the specifications are the same but in store sometimes due to limitations of the you know the retail space you may only be able to carry the latest product 53 plymouth online 5.50 offline seven dollars they actually offered me two options for my modes of shipping so i can have it at one dollar forty nine cents more if i get it shipped to my doorstep and i also can get it at 5 50 if i were to collect it from my nearest pickup point to my place which is like five minutes walk away so the online shopping experience turned out to be about 20 cheaper in terms of savings so should we all shop online i think uh for items like non-perishable products it's probably better to shop online because there's a lot of different platforms marketplaces that you can get different discount vouchers and stuff like that so the jury's out prices online for some goods can be almost half the price of goods in store but as i would soon find out self-control is literally thrown out the window when it comes to online shopping go and claim all your vouchers and go and shop till you drop but is it solely due to cheap prices once you come back and what you keep coming back that is actually its checkmates i've learned that some online products can cost up to half the price of the same item sold in physical stores especially for beauty products electronics and non-perishable items that can be bought in bulk but does that make us buy more than we need so i took it to the polls on my instagram account i asked people if they bought more than they need when they're shopping [Music] online yeah there you have it 68 of us buying more than we really need to online i guess we all like a little bit of self-control i want to know how shopping platforms get us to spend and spend and spend it's one day before 10 10. and i'm heading to shopee singapore a homegrown e-commerce platform guys welcome to the countdown two fan

seven six five four three two one okay faster exit the stream go and climb all your vouchers and go and shop till you drop okay all right cause you guys have less than 24 hours so it's not nice i'm meeting taiga wang the man spearheading the team in its marketing efforts so the big sales like the nine-nine which you guys introduced in singapore the 10-10 you know 11-11 how genuine are these promotions and discounts because they're happening all the time during the big campaign seasons the back end we actually work with all the different sellers to curate the products and for them to give us the special prices during these promotions now on normal days of course they don't offer a good price as during the promotion period i know shopee also has its daily midnight flash sales between midnight and 2 a.m is there a science behind this timing we realize for the singapore users there's a strong preference of coming to the platform after 11 pm and they tend to stay a bit a bit longer till around 1am that's why during this period of time we pack in a bit more promotions [Music] online shopping platforms can spend millions on advertising and marketing gimmicks but wait that's no different from what brick and mortar stores do too so why do i seem to get more hooked while shopping online i want some answers marketing professor ernst singer is going to explain it to me over a chess game so a lot of these online retailers will offer you things like massive discounts time sales cashbacks all to get you back online with them but is that so different from a physical shop it's a little bit like a game of chess you want to win so how do i win well actually by predicting what you will do right i need to look several steps ahead and what we see is that online retailers are actually very well suited for doing this the main advantage that online shops have is that they have a large amount of data that they can actually use how are they using it well actually the data would be used in all steps of the consumer journey say when i subscribe or log in boom step one once you create an account i actually start gathering information on you for example what is your gender uh what is your date of birth i would also what what interest do you have what products do you typically shop for we observe your click stream data so we know exactly which product you have looked at yeah what moment in time do you do you browse do you browse late at night early in the morning around lunchtime how often do you browse our website how often do you browse before buying a product and what if we go to the landing page retailers also observe where do you actually come from google for example where did you come from social media or maybe did you click on one of our banner ads by tracking you they can work with advertising platforms and show you banner ads or display ads for the products that you are interested in we're trying to find your triggers we could even try to sell these products to you in a different way for example if we know that you're very sensitive to the opinion of others okay yeah we could clearly highlight the reviews for these products we can give you testimonials sometimes we also actually like to deviate from what we think we will work sometimes we give you some more random suggestions if you do click on them then we have completed your profile a little bit more all right so i've got my shirt i've checked out i've left the shop so what i can actually do now is to follow up with customized emails push notifications what we also see increasingly is that firms rely on gamification where we encourage you to keep coming back to our website okay for example each time you log in i could give you an additional point or an additional coin or token once you come back and once you keep coming back that is actually when it's checkmate you're hooked to our website [Music] ecommerce platforms can be purposefully designed to nudge consumers to keep coming back and hopefully buy more if that makes it difficult to resist online shopping i need to know how to turn the table and best stretch every dollar that i have to do that there's one more thing i need to find out how to snag the best bargains online you can see um cashbacks up to 90 90 percent shopping online can be addictive and if it's hard to resist i have to know how to get the best value for my money okay but here's the thing every single time i try to buy a product online i'm faced with this problem the same item can come up with at least three different prices and sometimes the price difference can be more than 50 i wonder if i should always go for the cheapest option one of these items with multiple prices is the philips air fryer nicholas lee oversees the sale of kitchen appliances at philips i'm meeting him to find out what accounts for the price differences so nick help me understand why there can be so many different prices for an air fryer like this one it's confusing steve isn't it if you look at e-commerce in general it's kind of split in two parts we look at platforms like lazada and shoppies so lazada has lazada mall shopping mall q10 mall that's where we as philips have an official store on their mall right then you also have what's called the marketplace and then there are other resellers so on platforms like shopee lazada and q10 philips has an official online store on these platforms are also other retailers these are resellers some of which are not endorsed by philips but even within your official stores the price variation is quite large as well i mean your e-store is 4.99 on the zada it's four four nine on shopee it's 409 that's a huge price difference each of these retail platforms even when we are operating the store ourselves they are applying different pricing tactics the platform can add an additional discounts or vouchers to consumers so that the price that you see is actually lowest they can try and bring you as a consumer into their e-commerce ecosystem such that when i think of buying anything online i go to these guys first correct so i want to take a look at this list of other stores now how are they able to offer these prices they could be a new reseller and one of the strategies we see is you know i offer this actually at zero margin or maybe i even offer it at a loss it might be one special price on one well-known item right um and and that brings you into their customer base and then you say oh actually they have a lot of other interesting things to buy right so at this 327 price he may not even be making any i don't actual money thank you for making any money i think that's a loss the devil is really in the detail if we look at the different options here um okay one doesn't include a warranty one has a local manufacturer's warranty yeah what does that mean because i see the rest all come with international warranties is that standard for you guys that's standard philips has a standard two years international warranty you are fully covered you know parts and labor is obviously part of that so why is it different and not an international warranty i don't know what they are specifying there but it already smells a bit fishy i mean is this a reconditioned product you know is this a product someone bought somewhere else right maybe i was not quite the model i wanted right so i send it back right then what happens to those products right they then come back into an eco system where someone will resell it maybe that's also why some of the products don't have a full warranty or why it can be so cheap because it's a reconditioned product and how can i tell whether it's a reconditioned product or previously returned product so each airfryer is also shrink wrap that's to ensure that it arrives to you in good condition if you see that that original packaging is no longer in place that's a good signal that this perhaps has been returned by someone else so cheaper isn't always better products that come in a lower price may have different warranties or might not even be the original product if buying the cheapest isn't always the best option how else can i get the most for my money while shopping online i'm meeting cher mia the resident online shopping expert from financial blog seedly she's an avid online shopper who even shops for toilet paper on the net so we all love saving money do you have some tips on how we can save more money while shopping online there are a couple of websites that actually consolidates promo codes for us so users can scroll through and see what promo codes are eligible for their own purchases so this is one of the common websites another way is using telegram channels for example sg code so sg code is one channel that consolidates promo codes as well so users can subscribe and they have regular updates of promo codes okay so promo codes what else so another way to save money actually is through cashback schemes socialback is an online platform that offers users cashback when you make an online transaction through their merchants so what you can do is download the shopbacks extension button so when you enter a website which is eligible and you make a successful transaction you'll actually get cash into your shabbat account which can be withdrawn as real cash how significant is the cash back or the rebate that i get for year-end sales especially we can see um cashbacks up to 90 percent 90 so if i spend 100 i could get 90 back really but that's um we realized that this high cash back rates are mainly for niche products so for example your antivirus software or like your vpn products and how do i know whether this is the best time and the best price to be buying a certain product one tool we can use is the price tracking tool so the price tracking tool allows us to see the price history of items to help you make a more informed decision on whether to buy the product right now so usually these tracking tools are for specific websites so for example for ali express you have ali price then for shopping effect we have shopping price tracker and then for amazon we have camo camera camel keeper and honey you know i've always shopped online and i still think it's well worth it especially if you take the time and effort to do the research in order to secure the best deals but i've also learned that my online shopping experience is customized in more ways than i realize and it's all part of their plan to keep me hooked and i keep coming back to buy more stuff question is even knowing all that i know now with a big sale like 11 11 coming up what will i do well i guess i'll keep my eye on the most attractive deals while still watching my wallet ,True,True,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",at the heart of every singapore shopping mall there's a store or two that sells sweet promises in a company in front of them lines of excited customers willing to wait just to get their hands on one thank you i'm talking about bubble tea we all love this sweet treat so much that they designed this just for this so in this episode i want to find out what's behind our obsession with this drink which we already know is loaded with sugar and calories and what this addiction could be doing to our health milk tea from bubble tea stores was the most popular beverage order on delivery company delivers platform in 2019 a head of coke and coffee in 2019 delivery sold around half a million cups of milk tea a 46 increase from the year before and that's just from one delivery company [Music] but that's just delivery orders i wonder how big bubble tea really is in singapore helping me make sense of it is marketer joanne hall who's monitored the trend since the first bubble tea landed here in the late 1990s and this is the new keys she's launched at least 10 bubble tea brands in singapore including this one at suntec city needless to say she's also a big fan of the drink what do you guess on how many stores they are and how many brands bubble tea so i don't know like uh 200 maybe it's double double 400 more than 400 and that's only the major brands and you want to guess how many brands there are 20. okay more than double again in nearly 50. wow okay and these are just the big brands which means they're still individual shops exactly okay and remember during the lockdown for bubble tea as well people literally went out to the stores to kind of cue for them [Music] and how did this whole craze begin so it began i think in the 90s do you remember that this doll in the night markets where they shake the bubble the tea and actually it was a bubble tea it's actually froth in the tea oh i always thought the pearls were what they call the bubbles yeah in the beginning there were no pearls it's frothing tea it started with that and then the bubble burst about 206 it came back again because i think the budget flight started people go to taiwan and at that point it came with bubbles so it's like bubble tea are we looking at this becoming a part of our culture like you know having cafe culture having a coffee every day i'm very confident it is here to stay because a lot of my friends our customers my clients customers they have a cup of bubble tea every day some of them every week it's just like people having their copy every day it's a necessity bubble tea first landed in singapore from taiwan in the 1990s and has gone through a few ways about two years ago competitive retailers introduced more creative and innovative flavors all fancier and much more colorful than the original pearl milk tea [Music] now i see flavors like milk form alasan and oolong tea topped off with creamy [Music] mango matcha latte a blend of mango puree with green tea and milk creme brulee strawberry latte a combination of the french dessert with strawberry and strawberry taro latte a sweet mix of taro milk with strawberry pieces [Music] and as you can see more creative bubble tea also means the price of bubble tea can now match that of gourmet coffee so why are we hooked to an expensive drink that is also unhealthy what do you like about bubble tea i like the milk tea actually i like the why do you like bubble tea how many cups of bubble tea are you buying today two one for each of you is it how often do you drink bubble tea in one week how many cups will you drink three a week how would you order you tell me one week how many cups three cups [Music] it's no secret bubble tea is loaded with sugar a cup of milk tea with pearls typically contains eight teaspoons of sugar that's two teaspoons or 33 percent more than the daily recommendation from the world health organization for both adults and children a cup of brown sugar pearl milk tea contains even more sugar about 18.5 teaspoons that is three times the daily sugar recommendation from the whole and let's not forget the calories a medium-sized cup of milk tea with pearls contains 355 calories that's about one-fifth of the recommended daily calories for a healthy adult the tapioca pearls which seems to be the favorite among fans make up a third of the 355 calories we know consuming all sugar and empty calories is not good for the wasteland but i want to know what else are bubble tea addiction is doing to our bodies so to find out i have to be part of the problem and for one month i've decided i will drink the same amount of bubble tea a typical bubble tea lover in singapore drinks and to arrive at that magic number i had earlier asked bubble tea lovers how regularly they drank bubble tea so every week how many cups would you drink maybe one in a week days by the weekend so i've heard some people like go almost every day after school during exams week i usually drink everything it's a good snack i posted a poll on my social media asking the same so it ranges from once every week to more than four times a week in fact some of them even sit they drink bubble tea every day i guess if i take all that into account the average will be about three times a week well i guess that's the amount of bubble tea i will be subjecting my body to helping me track the effects on my body is dr vincentia he's a family physician with an interest in men's health and well-being he's also someone who has cut sugar out of his diet and has never ever drunk bubble tea so doctor i'm gonna go on this bubble tea experiment what would you be monitoring in my body during that time the main parameters in your blood test and looking at uh your sugar levels your lipid level your cholesterol level in other words or level inflammation in your blood as well as your liver function test and why look at those areas over time a high intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates in the form of the toppings can lead to delicious effect in the blood like raising the blood sugar sugar intake has been associated with increased inflammation and bloodstream which is again a bad thing i got my blood drawn blood pressure measured and weight and height taken what else can i expect to happen to me well with the sugar and the bubble tea you can get sugar spikes when you take it too often so when your blood sugar goes up and down up and down throughout the day you might have mood changes well you might feel tired when sugar is high and maybe you feel irritable when it's low so i might be really cranky throughout this whole shoot we'll find out and see my experiment starts today i'm choosing drinks as they are with no reduced sugar i'm gonna go 100 [Music] there you have it this is my very first cup of bubble tea i got a matcha tea with a whole bunch of stuff in it and so for the next 30 days three cups of this stuff a week well let's see what it does to to me i start off my challenge feeling curious about what effects if any this bubble tea experiment will have on me and as the days go by i start to look forward to my next sugar fix which makes me wonder if there is something else behind this beverage that has got us hooked another day another cup of bubble tea it's mid-afternoon and normally i go out i grab a cup of black coffee [Music] i'm carrying out my bubble tea experiment with some trepidation after all bubble tea is not my beverage of choice somehow that first sip always shoots this message to my brain which just screams out this is so sweet but after a few more sips because you don't realize that anymore it's mid-afternoon and normally at guard i grabbed a cup of black coffee been substituting it with bubble tea which got me thinking is our collective love for bubble tea by choice or by design [Music] i've arranged to meet lim suru she keeps a close eye on retail trends especially on how retail businesses attract their customers so our meeting place of choice quite fittingly this cafe which specializes in you guessed it bubble tea [Music] what is it about bubble tea and bubble tea shops you know that keep us coming back for more now increasingly bubble tea operators are looking at expanding into cafe concepts for example in terms of the colors it is very bright it is very appealing it is intended to captivate for example teenagers so why don't we take a look around the shop okay yeah sure let me show you let's take a look at some of these colors so in terms of basic color psychology we can see that yellow is one of those colors that actually makes us feel very happy very cheerful we can also see pink which is a very optimistic in terms of look and feel as well we're just walking by and this actually captures our eye draw our attention actually encourages us to drop by here to take a look as well actually what about all this stuff here what about the merchandise they actually feature the very cute ones yeah so this actually encourages the target audience to actually want to take a piece of this brand home with them having seasonal offerings offered by the brands encourages consumers to come by check out the brand on a frequent basis to see what are some of those latest offerings that they have so how do all of these things add up to draw me back into the shop so we can actually see that they have actually tacked on a multi-sensory appeal whether is it for consumers to actually taste the drink itself to have a look and feel around the shop to evoke positive moods we can also see that consumers are able to have a piece of this back home with them to trigger positive associations and all these serves to remind consumers about the brand values encourages them to keep coming back for more [Music] marketing plays a big part in our bubble tea obsession and it's not surprising why bubble tea brands are willing to pour money into winning more fans it's a lucrative market expected to grow exponentially raking in some 1.1 billion singapore dollars in the asia pacific last year and this figure is expected to rise annually by 10 over the next seven years and on social media there's no escaping it on instagram alone there are 2.1 million posts under the hashtag bubblet to put it in context that's almost 20 times more social media posts compared to singapore sling many of these are organic content from bubble tea fans marketeers who work with social media influencers like daniel ang of daniel's food diary they want to win over more consumers to bubble tea i had noticed many of the people i spoke with at the bubble tea stores were youth so i wanted to find out if bubble tea brands are focusing more of their attention on a younger demographic so i understand you work with bubble tea brands and you help them with their marketing what exactly do you do for them so i'm a i'm a food broker so most people think that uh food blogging is just being an influencer we do more than that we do write up photos editing video editing it's a whole 360 way of helping a brand to promote or to rush about peace so when it comes to the influence of marketing how do they market something like bubble tea bubble tea is a little bit different because it's not just a drink it's not a lifestyle it's a drink that gives you confidence it's a dream that makes you feel hip [Music] you know the young people they like they use the word yolo if you don't have it you have no never tried it you're not part of the group i think there's this part of peer pressure as well there's that formal feeling the fear of missing out now so you can approach in a different way a colorful creative way to appeal to audiences who could be as young as 15 16. so you will see a bubble tea brand cross collab with a ice cream brand a fashion brand a graphics card brand and when they come together they form something that is very fashionable to teams out there [Music] i now know how much marketing goes behind bubble tea and why it appeals to a younger demographic but i can't help but wonder how it might be affecting our younger consumers like my kids and i'm about to discover there is definitely more to this drink than just the high sugar content that will have caused others effect like hypertension headache dehydration and sometimes you will have elevated heart beatings i'm completing the second week of my bubble tea challenge and now look to my bubble tea fix as a quick pick-me-up a little bit like warm blue and coal on top and chewy with things in it [Music] oh but sugar high always hits me in the first sip i wonder if that's the sugar perking me up or something else [Music] earlier i sent some bubble tea samples to wing wine he's a food scientist which means that he analyzes the composition of food products to determine their chemical properties and to make sure they're safe this time i'm asking him to dissect our favorite bubble tea so what is in our bubble tea that makes us crave it so much basically all of us we know that inside we have a sugars definitely so the more you drink the more you will crave for the sugar however most of us don't really didn't realize it contains caffeine as well caffeine like how much caffeine i mean is it the same as these other drinks like coffee and energy drinks as you can see here a cup of bubble tea contains about 100 to 160 milligrams at a serving size of 400 ml which is a cup of bubble teas it is quite the same with your coffee for a single servings of 250 mls you have about 30 to 160 milligrams whereas for energy drinks it's about 40 to 250 milligrams and you will see carbonated drinks or caffeinated drinks we have a range for 35 to 70 milligrams in terms of caffeine do we sort of get hooked on it you know that we keep wanting more of it so basically when we feel tired why because there is a signal in your brain that's sent to your neuro to tell you that it's time for you to go to rest so caffeines will block that signals okay so however when the caffeine effects wear off so you'll feel tired and they will start to have what crave for more caffeine so that you stay alert in this case so that's why people will start to develop dependency on caffeine so that's how it works that's how it keeps pulling you back in yes but is it bad to have too much caffeine of course definitely because if you have too much then that will have caused others fact like hypertension headache dehydration and sometimes you will have elevated heart beats as well as your hybrid pressure but these effects is very individuals those that are more sensitive will be like pregnant women and elderly children and those that has a history of heart attack what i'm surprised about is the fact that usually we don't want our kids to start drinking coffee until i don't know they're 15 or at least 18 years old right but yet we're okay with them drinking bubble tea it finally begins to make sense to me why i have been feeling the way i have the past two weeks feeling overstimulated then crashing and feeling more tired than usual all right i think i'm just wrapping up my third cup of bubble tea for the week and you know what it's been a bit of a struggle the last half of this drink has just been painful i'm feeling just a little bit more i guess lethargic on a day-to-day basis i'm not sure if it's a tea or if it's just me so apparently it isn't just the sugar that we now need to be worried about and if youth are being targeted by bubble tea companies i wonder what all that caffeine in the drink is doing to our kids i decide to check in with a pediatrician dr lim young-chen is a father of three young children and he doesn't recommend caffeinated beverages for kids under the age of 12. many of us will not think to give our kids a cup of coffee but when it comes to bubble tea actually quite a few parents are quite okay with that what is your response to that children children are already very active energetic they really don't need any more stimulation beyond that caffeine also has a lot of problems with it with young children if they have it too late if they excrete it a bit more slowly you may cause them to be anxious they may have issues with sleeping you get insomnia and all the attendant problems with insomnia daytime surnames for example for the kids so would you say there's an age where it's okay or not okay to have bubble tea i'd say generally primary school age probably is still something i would avoid bubble tea for for most kids the reason because they're still growing the toxic dose of caffeine is actually about 20 milligrams per kilogram for the average 25 kilo kid in the lower primary for example that would be equivalent just five cups of bubble tea and that that is quite easily achievable if no one's really watching it we know quite a few kids also students would want drink bubble tea when they're studying for the exams so if they need that little bit of that buzz knowing what you're drinking is very important i say once you're at the 12 year old old age group like a mini adult sort of level then maybe it's no harm per se but be very aware that you shouldn't be taking it beyond certain hours so i'd say probably 3 4 p.m onwards you shouldn't be drinking too much caffeine because it might affect your sleep and if you're not sleeping well how you preparing yourself for the exam so it becomes like a vicious cycle [Music] i've learned that our love or our addiction to bubble tea boils down to not just clever marketing but also the stuff that's inside the drink i'm not just talking about the sugar but also the caffeine levels which can be as much as your regular cup of coffee and even more than a can of soft drink wow that's definitely something to think about especially if you have kids who love bubble tea [Music] if one can't stop drinking bubble tea is there at least a healthier version out there i go in search of the elusive healthy bubble tea ever thought of going without the pearls we're trying to convince people to go on a healthy version of bubble tea and i finally find out what drinking bubble tea three times a week for a month has done to my health all right basically a couple of changes three major things i'm giving you all the bad news first ,False,True,False,False

166,FVpaCyO8f5o,VICE News,Crime and COVID in London’s Little India,2021-04-29T16:00:14Z,"Crime and COVID are on the rise in the suburb of Southall in London that’s home to the largest Punjabi community outside of India. 

At various times during the pandemic, it has recorded some of the highest COVID rates in the United Kingdom. VICE World News reveals how deep-rooted cultural beliefs and government distrust are fueling crime and vaccine hesitancy.

#VICENews #News",[Music] in london's little india there's cultural issues there's religious issues there's international politics and it's poor this west london suburb is home to one of the largest punjabi communities outside of india there's a mistrust perhaps of authority and the state police the chakra immigration at various points during the pandemic southall had some of the highest covered rates in the uk and government distrust is making it worse the rumors are that if you take the vaccine what's going to end up happening is this is a big government conspiracy to get rid of all the illegal immigrants someone they did some black magic power also some negative power inside your body i try my best to avoiding and depending on any perspective treatment as london battles to contain the coronavirus authorities are at a loss at how best to protect this immigrant community that's incubating the virus and evading detection in so kobe specifically areas like southall a lot of people are very much on the bread line you've got multiple families living within very small dwellings just because that's all they can afford a lot of rental accommodation that maybe isn't up to the standard that it should be a lot of people that have that have come here you don't speak english very well so they need to be around the community that they can communicate with typically these guys are on zero hour contracts maybe working in construction there's no furlough scheme that applies to them so a lot of people are here illegally and they're still humans and they still need food and shelter and because they're not legal residents in this country they're definitely falling within the cracks so i think there's a really distinct correlation between skepticism of any message that the government puts out especially kind of the the coveted side of things and vaccines especially there's definitely skepticism from people just because they fear what the government's agenda may be government distrust is deep rooted here punjabis began arriving to work in southall's factories in the 1950s in response to britain's post-war recruitment drive in this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man but as the immigrant population grew so did racist attacks and discriminatory policies which provoked riots in the streets of southall in the 70s and 80s [Music] now falls got some of the lowest job prices in the united kingdom primarily because we're so close to heathrow don't even know what to sell it here you come so police were called to an address last night by a member of the public and as a result of that officers have found a cannabis grow house and this is the crop from that as you can smell it's really strong cannabis grow houses continue that hasn't changed as a result of the pandemic so when the pandemic first hit we were catching more of our drug dealers with drugs on them we're not necessarily just cannabis but also class a so they were coming out with a house loaded with more product to sell more quickly south at one point for about a week had some of the highest covered infection rates in the country so locally we had to do something where we knew this was a massive driver for that there is a rough sleeping problem on this estate all right let's go and have a look hello you're all right all right just keep your hands away from there he's got a crack pipe down there you are going to research under the misuse of drugs you want to stand up for me brown rizzler the white rizzler white or brown white crack cocaine brown herring these glass pipes metal foil off the brillo pad put in the end put your class out on that smoke it you buy those glass pipes for a pound or 50p in the industrial estate we've just driven through that's somebody who's using class a drugs so just from an officer safety point of view i don't want to get stabbed just with the screw like that because that's still going to hurt and it's still going to cause a puncture into you though we asked him if he had any shots on him he said no but that's in his bedding if that was drawn across your face or shoved into your eye that is going to cause a police officer a real serious injury isn't it so all the cigarette lighters i don't smoke i know some people who do they only normally carry one lighter he's got lots of lighters because smoking drugs uses a lot of gas and they get really hot and they burn and they break because of the pandemic he shouldn't be here anyway but we the police have got no powers to pick him up and put him into accommodation that is not our job so he hasn't got class a drugs on him the outcome is he's going to stay where he is he's not under arrest i've worked here for 10 years just in southpaw it's very deprived there's cultural issues there's religious issues there's international politics there's language issues and there's a big migrant community it's well documented unfortunately with sheds in beds so that's immigrants being exploited by let's call them rogue landlords that is a massive problem still in southpaw since 2013 healing council has investigated over 2000 illegal dwellings which they estimate to have at least doubled the area's population as comprised banana illegal immigrants have overcome harrowing journeys to reach the uk but when they arrive the reality is very different to what they expected i have encountered a lot of vaccine hesitancy in my patients and it actually worries me because the patients who i am most concerned about that will do badly with kovid are the same group who just don't want to engage in conversations about the vaccine you know hospitals were always full of people dying but it wasn't like this before it wasn't young people who were fit and well who we didn't have anything to offer there's a mistrust perhaps of authority and and the state there is a feeling that people are trying to get your details and you might they'll say it's medical help but then suddenly everyone in your family will receive a knock on the door i think there's a fear that the health care service is in cahoots with the immigration services it's a population that's not got great health literacy and has missed out on certain public health messages there's a kind of gossipy village sometimes like a casualness about it you could call it magic you can call it faith i do see people who just trust in something else that isn't this model of healthcare that we're kind of purveying in a hospital when residents of southall feel distrustful of western medicine they turn to community faith healers who are only too willing to offer their services [Music] anybody coming police and in concert will ask you my appointment yeah appointment here hello hi hey what i've been having a lot of anxiety and things and i was thinking could i get a reading or something to help me with my problems are you doing reading yes i will tell you everything sometimes you'll get bad but uh i mean feeling negative feeling when you're sleeping you can't sleep very happily yeah someone they did some black magic power also some negative power inside your body okay someone they did some negative prayers they are not good people who they did their jealousy their enemy they have to remove this how do you remember we have to do some bad removal prayers whatever i need your photo if it is a fireplace i'll send it inside your body some positive energy whatever you feel inside your body is alpha negative i'll remove outside out all the remote okay what's the cost 500 pounds oh so what is the 500 pound cover i will buy that thing you're gonna buy things what things are you buying i'll buy 201 lemons okay 201 lemon flour yeah something black magic to be more thing when pressed on covered and the vaccinations they had this to say but you take the action if you want to take vaccinations not now one i'll clear this all i'll tell you the time the time we'll take that food for you okay you can tell him when to take the vaccine after you clear him i'm telling to you it is very dangerous you think about it outside and take five minutes and let me know okay okay thank you thank you don't get me wrong there are some people within the hindu religion that some pundits that do do good stuff but there's more bad than there are good and they just want the money and they will tell you what you want to hear and boom if i ever saw them they'd be sorry i promise you um you know a lot of these they happen behind closed doors there's a lot of undercover ones that are going on my name is jasper sandu street name injection i am a ex-criminal ex-gangster rehabilitated i was involved in every single thing that you could possibly think of i'm talking murders drugs kidnappings blackmail firearms money laundering you name it i've spent a good 20 years of my life kidnapping people and hurting people torturing people you know i mean you know like cutting fingers off and cutting people's ears off and and like you've got to make enemies across across the way you're not going to have people that are going to be saying oh he's really nice guy you know he cut my ear off last time you know during the pandemic injection has seen crime patterns changing radically to adapt to a new normal a lot of these drug addicts how they used to make their money is they used to walk in and out of these shops that were open on the broadway there's still something and then they will sell it literally the next shop down what's happened is everything's closed there's nothing for them to steal so now we've all started breaking into houses so they will sneak into your house while you're in bed sleeping 70 80 houses that have been broken into while they're sleeping they've woken up in the morning and everything's lying all over the place the other thing is catholic converters you could go park your car up you could go in the shop before you've picked your item up and paid for it and come out your category is gone injection knows from first-hand experience that during desperate times people will do desperate things there's so many theories out there that one person will send it and it will spread like wildfire they said i think it was malaria tablets if you took these tablets your corona is gone so every single sharpie that was sharing malaria tablets was out i remember coming to this chemist here and i queued up here for about an hour and a half i had to force the guy i had to stick it on him i said listen i said i want boxes now i want three boxes i said listen i'm gonna come over that counter i said i'm gonna beat you yeah i said i want three boxes i was just worried about my parents you understand but this is what i mean and it's just like i didn't know how much of it was true i'm getting messages from family members um my mom and dad are telling me get this malaria tablet because it gets rid of chronovirus one of europe's largest sikh communities is working to feed local homeless and unemployed people in a massive food drive which started at the beginning of the pandemic so now we have entered the longer hall where you can see it's very quiet due to lockdown these are all the langur so the rating that are cooked and we pack two in a row so two per bag and this will now go out to the back where there's takeaways for the takeaway longer for the community selfless service is food for the soul you feed your appetites every day so how about feeding your souls by helping others and caring for others i feel i've been blessed with this gift where i'm able to connect spiritually to my guru and to hear and listen to what guru tells us he says everyone is equal everybody treated the same despite who you are where you come from and this is the beauty of sikh values equality we are all one the pandemic along with cultural factors and poverty has created a mental health crisis in an at-risk population causing drug addiction to skyrocket [Music] foreign no money no clothes no food no shoes no sleeping like sometimes no sleep three three weeks and i'm walking [Music] [Laughter] [Music] is these conflicting viewpoints have created a perfect maelstrom leading to a disproportionate amount of deaths in this community despite these challenges everyday people remain resilient and still hold hope for a brighter future this pandemic was the first time i saw that the values of sikhism give strength to people who had every reason to be really scared and that really moved me i've transformed i've brought in religion i've brought in spirituality into the work that i do i still do the crazy stuff but i try and do it in a good way i try and help people sorry every single person's drugs [Music]

#Vaccine #BloodClots #SideEffects",[Music] vaccines are turning the tide but they're not without risks especially for women they've been rare cases of blood clotting even fatal ones leading some governments to slow down vaccinations we have now today chosen to continue our vaccine rollout without estracinica but each delay puts more lives at risk as the coronavirus spreads it's a balancing act between speed and caution in the fight against covert 19. the risk of dying from covert is much higher than getting a blood clot from a vaccine but even more concerning is a new report from oxford university that shows catching the coronavirus puts you at even more risk of a deadly blood clot in a moment we'll talk to a vaccine scientist at johns hopkins university first this report astrazeneca's covid19 vector vaccine has hardly been out of the headline since last december until now it's been instrumental in the success of the uk's vaccination program but from now on its use there will be restricted to those over 30 years of age there have been worries in the european union about its effectiveness and potential side effects germany initially restricted its use to under 65s now berlin is recommending it purely for over 60s those worries were compounded by several cases of a rare thrombosis type following astrazeneca vaccinations some of them fatal the european medicines agency in amsterdam felt it was time to take a stance on the jab it's director stressing that the benefits of the anti-viral agent far outweigh any risks this vaccine has proven to be highly effective it prevents severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against covet 19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects scientists have been investigating the reports and circumstances of the thrombosis britain's medicines and health care regulator agency says 20 million doses of the astrazeneca vaccine had been administered by the end of march with 79 cases of thrombosis later reported 19 of which were fatal the cause is thought to be a rare immune reaction most of them presented some two weeks after inoculation there are no apparent risk groups such as age or sex several countries like germany france and canada have tightened restrictions on the use of astrazeneca's covid19 vaccine others have suspended it totally waiting for the ema's verdict it has now recommended the continued unrestricted use of the astrazeneca jab regardless of any rare cases of thrombosis so mixed messages there about vaccine safety to unpack this let's bring in corso talacci's a vaccine scientist and infectious disease physician at johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland so let's start with astrazeneca as as we heard that's been given to more than half the adults in britain and is credited with saving tens of thousands of lives i'd gladly take it but authorities here in germany and other countries are blocking its use and offering no timely alternative isn't that in itself putting people's lives in danger so when you have a pandemic that's out of control like we have with the kovic 19 pandemic then any facts then you have to weigh the risks and benefits of any available preventive such as a vaccine or treatment and for the astrazeneca vaccine it has been shown to have saved millions of lives already and so the the potential benefits might outweigh any risks now there are some very serious risks associated with it in very very rare circumstances and i think i think each country but also each individual needs to be able to weigh that risk benefit equation for themselves to decide whether or not they're willing to take that risk for the potential for the protection against the virus when you have a vaccine that's available and that's not being used people can die and that's something that each each government and each person needs to weigh and this isn't only a problem with astrazeneca we've now got johnson johnson six million immunized in the united states and yet it's on hold because six people may have had side effects isn't one in a million an acceptable risk level during times like these so i think that the equation in the united states is a little bit different because we've vaccinated so many of our high-risk individuals already and we have two other approved vaccines that are that are more available than the johnson johnson vaccine even is um and i and i think whereas europe has been gathering information about the astrazeneca vaccine for several weeks we are just starting to learn about the any potential risk associated with the johnson and johnson vaccine and so i think the pause is to gather that information to truly understand what that risk is is it one in a million or is there something higher is it even um associ is the the clots that we saw with with in those unfortunate women associated with it and so i think the um the the pause is appropriate while we gather that information and make a decision about the risk benefits but i think in places where there's the virus is increasing in terms of the transmission and there is no alternative vaccine that it should be seriously considered to use this vaccine while that data is being gathered in the u.s the calculus is a little bit different because we do have two alternative vaccines that don't seem to have that same risk the strange thing though is that and this is what will get many people especially women worried about this is that those people affected by clotting were women in a certain age group and it's been a similar profile for astrazeneca as well so why is it being blocked for everyone or everyone under 60 or so i am that is probably uh due to logistics and programmatic issues but also because while we're gathering that information we need to understand better what that risk is and who truly is at risk while the majority people who have been affected so far seem to be women there were men in europe who have had this unusual rare blood clot happen um there was one man in the trial in the united states who had this unusual blood clot occur and so we need to gather that information and understand the process better and who truly is at risk to be able to maybe target the vaccines at people who are at lower risk but you know it's interesting that you say that because there's a lot of adverse events from vaccines that seem to particularly affect women and especially women in their reproductive years um and that's probably because our hormones are different than in the pre and post-reproductive period and also from men um and that may put us at um that may give us an advantage or a benefit but they may also put us at um some increased risk from the adverse events if you look at the anaphylaxis cases that are happening after the mrna vaccines in the united states the vast majority of them are happening in women as well so there's just there's a difference in the biology between men and women that we're just starting to understand can we go as far as saying that vector vaccines could be the problem in terms of the the clotting that's been seen exactly yeah in terms of adverse events in terms of clotting and or adverse events so each vaccine is going to have its different adverse events each vaccine platform has different kinds of adverse events that happen um and so for the vectored vaccines um especially for astrazeneca potentially for for johnson and johnson as well it looks like clotting may be an increased risk factor um that we didn't see with the mrna vaccines and in the united states over 100 million people have now been vaccinated with one of the two mrna vaccines without the same sort of signal that we've seen with the um with the with the with the antivirus vaccines but this hasn't necessarily been seen with other adenovirus vaccines in the past so we need to better understand what is happening and i think that this pause allows scientists and researchers to really dig deep into each of these cases to better understand what's happening and also to understand the mechanisms a little bit better and it's been fantastic having you on the show explaining to us what all this means kosovo talat of johns hopkins university thank you very much for being on the show today thank you very much take care whatever the risks vaccines are here to stay for now more on that from derek williams will we only have to be vaccinated once or will we need regular booster shots once again the straightforward answer is we don't know yet but a lot of experts do think it's very likely that even fully vaccinated people will need booster shots in the future there are a couple of different reasons why that might become necessary the first involves the fact that the vaccines we're using now have been approved for emergency use because they were safe in the vast majority of people who've gotten them and also extremely effective at least in the short term but we still don't know how long that effectiveness on average will last don't forget it's been under a year since the very first subjects and trials received their first shots but based on what we know about naturally acquired immunity to the disease and what we know about other coronaviruses the general expectation among immunologists appears to be that most vaccinated people will remain largely immune to covet 19 for at least six months and likely retain at least some immunity for a year or two assuming the virus doesn't mutate faster than we think however nearly all the experts i've read now also think that down the line variants of sars cov2 will change enough that we'll have to modify current vaccines at some point so the companies that make them are already in trials looking at possible ways to prolong vaccine-induced immunity and a lot of those trials will involve giving test subjects booster shots of tweaked vaccines you heard it from derrick williams i'm ben fosulin thanks for watching stay safe and see you again soon [Music] you ,True,False,False,False

#ABCNews #ABCNewsAustralia",taylor so let's talk about the sydney lockdown lots of speculation about whether it will be extended or not on friday what will be the case numbers that will drive that decision in your view i don't think it's so much the case numbers as the numbers of people who've been circulating before they were diagnosed as positive and so therefore that you've got more and more exposure sites and that's what seems to be emerging and it's emerging in the southwestern suburbs the uh sort of inner southwest going to south west and you know what they're worried about i assume i've got no inside knowledge particularly is that you've got a situation evolving such as you had in melbourne in the northwestern suburbs where you've got people who are often disadvantaged english is not their first language um and um you know and are pressed to work and have to get out and there's a lot of pain in those in those suburbs um so it's going to be are people in isolation already when they get infected uh have they got have they pinned down all the contacts and that was hopeful on sunday but yesterday it got a you know there were significant numbers with significant numbers circulating in the community so it's got to probably get down some people you know some analysts are saying down to single digits but it's more that you know where they all are you know where they've been when they've been in fact where they've been tested positive yeah on that note i've been looking at what's been going on in singapore which keeps getting talked about as a possible travel bubble buddy with us we're not there yet but they're now allowing small case numbers to bubble along aren't they they in the last week sing i did this for 7 30 last night and singapore in the last week has changed its policy and it's changed its policy it has to be said on the basis of about 60 of singaporeans being have had one dose and about uh i can try to remember now maybe 39 have had two doses and they had an outbreak a few weeks ago which really put them not quite into lockdown but really into serious restrictions a bit like sydney sydney's not really in full lockdown and uh cases are coming on control but they've got about 20-yard clusters and they're lifting restrictions and what they found is that people who are vaccinated no hospitalizations um at all people who are partially vaccinated some hospitalizations one or two in icu um but the deaths have been in unvaccinated people and so they feel that now they're moving towards a position where even if it broke out in small numbers they would be under control but they're not doing what britain is doing mass squaring is still compulsory they still have restrictions on social distancing and they have contact tracing so they're not giving up the ghosts by any means whatsoever and just on face masks i noticed in that report your report last night uh clearly outdoor mask wearing is compulsory do you reckon even if we are successful in killing the outbreaks in ramping up our vaccination that face masks will be with us for some time to come yes because the variant delta variant is showing up as a you get there are significant infections israel some israeli researchers are reckoning that the effectiveness in preventing infection is down at 64 for pfizer so you're going to get a lot of infections and we are going to get surges and if you don't wear face masks it will get out of control and unvaccinated people will be very vulnerable even if they're young to hospitalization and serious illness hey norman can i ask you another question how on earth in the last 18 months did you get time to write a book and not just any old book but the ultimate health guide i mean well how did you do it um by getting up at five in the morning of uh you know well i must say i do get out of five in the morning anyway no i just disciplined and to tell you what it was actually it's not flying um you you'd be flying to do some interviews you'd spend you'd come down to melbourne for an hour or two go back whole day's gone and not flying even though you're incredibly busy it opened up sometime during the day but mostly that time was five in the morning which is usually the time you're driving to the airport uh it's uh it's a great book as you say tackles some of the myths uh surrounding health i love it there's a section on coffee and coffee is as you write pretty good for us which is great news for us here on early morning tv that's right there's been you know ample number of papers now to show that uh your caffeine addiction is fine for you unless you can't sleep at night like me but um it hasn't got me over my caffeine addiction okay i do the other sorry norman i mean the other the other the the other thing i mean it's slightly indulged in the book it's a bit of a memoir as well so i tell personal and it does it comes from actually talking to a lot of millennials about their health and so i kind of know what their issues were and then i realized their issues are everybody's issues but it meant that i did have to put sex drugs in rock and roll so while i've put personal memoirs in almost every section there's none in the sex section yes well part six is called the sex thing perhaps we'll leave that to late night live maybe not breakfast tv don't talk about it hey if there's any doubt that you are a doctor uh lots of people left on this so thank you as well for the fantastic dedication uh to both of us uh in uh in in the books and uh here we are it's the typical doctor's scroll i had to go to the pharmacist to get them to uh translate mine thanks norman yeah just do a secret writing i take a needle for you thank you thank you you ,True,True,False,False

In a confession he wrote for Wendy he singled out the high-stakes, high-frequency fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) found in bookmakers across the UK. These machines offer gamblers a choice of games, and combine potentially high stakes with the chance of a win every 20 seconds.

How Covid Derailed The Cheesecake Factory's Success","Americans love The
Cheesecake Factory. The eatery known for its massive 21
page menu, dozens of dessert options, and ancient Egypt-inspired decor was ranked
as one of the top casual dining restaurants in the U.S. in 2019. ""We're the doggy
bag kings of the industry. No one goes home without a doggy
bag or a second and third. We have no early birds in Florida,
because everybody gets the value, and they have two or three
more meals at home. And that's really worked for us."" But the eatery popular with everyone
from NBA stars to cheesecake aficionados has fallen on hard times
as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on
the restaurant industry. As of December 2020, about 17%
of restaurants in the U.S. have shut down permanently due to
Covid-19, according to the National Restaurant Association. The casual dining sector has
been particularly hard hit. So after 40 years in business, will
the Cheesecake Factory be able to regain its momentum? And will the chain's takeout and delivery
service be enough to offset the decline of the
dine-in restaurant experience? The Cheesecake Factory roots
reach back to 1949. For more than two decades in the
basement of a small duplex in Detroit, Michigan, Evelyn Overton baked her
signature New York-style cheesecakes. She had help from her husband, who
handled sales and children who folded pink cardboard boxes. By 1971, the couple had outgrown
their underground kitchen and relocated to North Hollywood, California, to
open a small bakery. Evelyn's son and future CEO, David Overton,
ran with the concept, and in 1978 opened the first Cheesecake
Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. The menu quickly expanded in
the 1980s to include everything from chicken tacos, meatloaf, pizza, baby
back pork ribs and, of course, cheesecake. In the 1990s, the company
grew, too, adding restaurants and debuting on the Nasdaq at two dollars
and 63 cents a share on September 18th, 1992. In May 1999, the company launched the
Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. ""Well, we like to think of Grand
Lux as a kicked-up Cheesecake Factory, one or two notches higher just with the
products we use and the fanciness. It's really like a
grand European café."" By 2005, The Cheesecake Factory had
91 restaurants, 2 bakeries, and a billion dollars in sales. The company's stock price hit an all-time
high closing price of $67 on May 3rd, 2017, 32% higher than a year
earlier. But the company was facing major headwinds: an oversupply of
restaurants in the industry, a reluctance among consumers to spend,
and increased competition from fast casual restaurants weighed on the
brand, according to analysts. ""As people move from casual dining
down, they also move from white tablecloth down to casual. And I believe, you
know, it's entertainment. It's a meal. It's easy. We think we're doing fine. That's why we have not stopped
or slowed down our growth plan."" ""The industry has largely, at least on
the full service side, been in secular decline for the last
10 or 15 years. So, really struggled with traffic. You know, traffic has usually been
down pretty consistently in the space. A lot of share within the restaurant
industry has gone to limited service, which is more fast
food or fast casual."" In 2018, the company also faced
higher labor costs and legal fees. But the company doubled down on
the full service restaurant business, buying eatery North Italia and Fox
Restaurant Concepts in October of 2019. As of January 2021, The Cheesecake Factory
had a market cap of $1.7 billion dollars. It owned and operated
294 restaurants in North America and had 27 franchises abroad. Since its start, consumers have flocked
to The Cheesecake Factory for its massive menu, featuring more than
200 items, including pizza, seafood, steaks, chicken, burgers, pastas, salads,
omelettes and, of course, cheesecake. ""Cheesecake Factory has over 200
items on their menu, which is far and above what anyone else has
in the industry in terms of freshly made food. And one of the reasons they're able to
do that is because they have a high percentage of cheesecakes, which are a
high margin, a high percentage. And it's a secret sauce that really
no one else in this space has."" They also show up for the price. The average check per guest, including
beverages and desserts, was $23.50 cents in 2019, 38% more than 2005. As Americans shift to healthier diets
and rivals trim their offerings to cut costs, could the Cheesecake Factory's
menu weigh on the brand? Each year, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, a nonprofit group that advocates for healthier foods, announces
the winners in its Xtreme Eating Awards. Most health groups say
that the average person needs only about 2,000 calories a day or less. In 2017, the Cheesecake Factory received
two Xxtreme Eating Awards for a 2,300-calorie bowl of pasta that
includes sausage, pepperoni, meatballs and bacon, and an alcoholic milkshake
with nearly a thousand calories. And in July 2019, the
restaurant's 2000-calorie-packed Cinnamon Roll Pancakes won the Xxtreme
Eating Awards, too. It was the 21st award the
company had received since 2007. The advocacy group said the dishes help explain
why 2 out of 3 adults and 1 out of 3 children
and teens in the U.S. are overweight or obese. And while the company is renowned
for some of its more overindulgent offerings, it has a
lower calorie option, too. In 2011, The Cheesecake Factory
debuted its new Skinnylicious menu, featuring dishes with 590
calories or less. The restaurant also updates its menu twice
a year, but shows no sign of paring back on the number of
its offerings, according to one analyst. ""You know, a lot of restaurants
did simplify during the pandemic. Cheesecake did not. I think if you are going to
look at one differentiator for cheesecake, what their competitive holy grail, their
big differentiator, it is that menu. I mean, there, I don't think
anyone else can execute the breadth of menu that they have. And I think they've been loathe
to give away that secret sauce. And it kind of dumbed down their menu
because it might end up doing more harm than good."" The casual
dining business in the U.S. is a competitive one and
includes restaurants like Olive Garden, Applebee's, Chili's, Outback Steakhouse, and
of course The Cheesecake Factory. ""We're one of the few that are
really in what we call upscale, casual dining. And that is the area that's
above all the casual dining and right below dinner houses. And it's
a very special niche. I think we really
understand it very well."" Prior to Covid-19, full service restaurants
have been an onslaught of competition from quick service restaurants
like Chipotle and Shake Shack. ""So if you think back maybe 20
years ago, there was a big difference between an Applebee's, for
example, and a McDonald's. And, you know, in the last 20 years,
there have been a number of different concepts that have come to play, whether
it's a Shake Shack or Chipotle or you know, McDonald's has definitely
elevated their offering as well. So you've seen less of a
gap in terms of trade down. And so from a consumer standpoint, the
food can often be similar, sometimes even better, and it's
faster and limited service."" Covid-19 has only added
to those problems. With new dining restrictions in place
and business travel canceled, during the quarter ending November 29th, 2020,
the Olive Garden's parent company Darden Restaurants said net
sales fell by 19%. Same-store sales at the company plunged
20% during the same period. It's a similar story for
Chili's parent company, Brinker International. In the first quarter of 2021, sales
fell 6% from the prior year, and same-store sales, system-wide,
were down 11%. ""But I think those companies that
focused really on experience, whether it be entertainment or even fine dining,
I think those are the categories where you know, again,
it's focused on experience. They don't have many to-go,
delivery or takeout options. Those are the ones that are going
to really struggle in this environment. And a lot of them are going to
have to focus on reinventing themselves or the experience. For them, making sure
that safety, consumer safety, is front and center is going to be a
challenge in a lot of cases, because it's going to deviate from how
they've operated in the past."" To combat the drop in customers,
full service restaurants like Brinker have been beefing up their
delivery ground game. In June 2020, the company launched
its first virtual restaurant, It's Just Wings through a
partnership with DoorDash. Brinker International expects the business to
gross more than $150 million in sales its first year. ""None of these restaurants were really
built to be fast food restaurants, to focus on takeout or
to focus on delivery, right? And so, I think that's been the challenge
for a lot of these guys is they just need to figure out
how to do it."" Bloomin' Brands, the parent company
of Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill, have been
making investments, too. The company said in May 2020,
its takeout and delivery business tripled. That digital growth has helped. For the quarter ended October 23rd,
2020, Bloomin' Brands saw third quarter sales decrease by 20% from
the prior year, and U.S. same-store sales fall by 13%. And it might have been The Cheesecake
Factory that has taken the hardest hit from Covid-19. At the end of March 2020,
The Cheesecake Factory furloughed 41,000 workers and said it would not be
paying its April 2020 rent. In the quarter that ended September
19, 2020, the restaurants saw sales plummet by 12%. During the same period, same-store
sales fell by 23%. And in December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said
it fined the Cheesecake Factory $125,000 for misleading investors about the
impact Covid-19 had on its business. But it wasn't all bad news. In April 2020, private equity firm
Roark Capital invested $200 million in the company, and according to analysts,
like its rivals, the restaurant's push into delivery and takeout
has started to pay off. In 2018, the Cheesecake Factory signed
a delivery agreement with DoorDash. By 2019, takeout and delivery at the
Cheesecake Factory made up 16% of sales, 78% more than 2015. And in October 2020, The Cheesecake Factory
said from the beginning of the fourth quarter 2020 through October
27, restaurants with reopened indoor dining rooms captured on average 90%
of the prior year sales levels supported by 40% of
off-premise sales mix. CNBC reached out to The Cheesecake
Factory, but they declined our request for an interview. In July 2020,
California Pizza Kitchen filed for bankruptcy. And in October 2020, Ruby
Tuesday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a bid to cut
debt and reorganize following a loss of customers due to Covid-19. ""Now, there's no question, though, that with
dine-in, in a lot of parts of the country gone until the end of
the year, you know, casual dining is going to have a rough winter, and it's
going to emerge in 2021 a much smaller and leaner part of the
restaurant and food service business for sure."" With consumers shifting to take
out and ordering online, The Cheesecake Factory, along with the casual
dining sector, has faced serious obstacles due to the pandemic. And according to some analysts, an even
bigger issue for the brand could be its locations. Around 80% of
Cheesecake Factory restaurants are located at or near the mall. And according to Coresight Research, about
25% of America's roughly 1,000 malls will shut down in the
next three to five years. But not everyone agrees. ""I would note that this dynamic
between mall traffic and Cheesecake Factory sales has not been as linear as
many investors believe it to be. And I think the most salient evidence
of that is that the malls were closed in California throughout much
of the state until recently. And within that time frame, while
Cheesecake Factory was only limited to outdoor seating, there were often
waits for their patio seating. So I think that theory among
investors is probably the most persistent knock on the company. But yet it hasn't really manifested itself
in a direct correlation to the performance and the PNL."" Despite these issues, with about 100,000
restaurants and bars in the U.S. closing permanently, the coronavirus
pandemic, an unlikely accomplice, might just be the solution
to the company's problems. ""Clearly, this is an environment where
the big are getting bigger, and we've already heard there are about
a 100,000 restaurants that have closed during the pandemic. It's largely
been independents; it's largely been full service. And these larger chains
like Cheesecake Factory can really capture share in an environment
like we're in today."" ",True,False,False,False

room has turned to porn at some point in time. Stupidest shit a man can do,
here's why I say its stupid. We don't give people that do porn enough credit and enough respect. Those people are professional
actors and actresses. That's what they do for a
living, you can't just watch that shit and go home and try
it. It don't work like that. That's like watching a
karate movie, going outside getting in a fight, telling
everybody to back up so you can roundhouse kick
this nigga in the head; you don't know how to do that kick. Its the same thing with porn. I'm not speaking to you
from a hypothetical place I've been there. I've
done it. I've tried it. I've watched porn with my wife. Tried to the shit that I saw I was nervous about it. So I was having a
conversation with myself. Should I do it , should I fucking do it. Should I try it. I had good Kevin on this side, Bad Kevin was on this side. Good Kevin popped up.
Good Kevin had on a pair of khakis and V neck sweater. He said absolutely not, don't do it. That's a good woman,
you talk to her first. Bad Kevin popped up. Bad Kevin had on a pair of leather pants and a fishnet tank top and he was doing this. Bad Kevin, Bad Kevin said you gone listen
to the man with khakis on? No, Nooo. He said do it then, Do It. Out of no where I spit on my wife. [Pfft] Quick. Right in the fucking forehead. [Puht] A loogie right
in her goddamn forehead. It was an awkward beat of
silence nobody said nothing. It was quiet. Out of nowhere she was like, YOU JUST FUCKING SPIT ON ME! The complete opposite of the reaction from the lady in the porn. The lady in the porn went
crazy when it happened she was like auuuuhhhhh auuuhhhh This spit is making me so hot auuhhh This spit goin make me cum. In my mind, I was like
that's how you make em cum. You gotta spit on they fucking heads I've been doing it wrong all this time. I even told my wife you not doing it right you gotta rub it in,
that's how you fucking cum. I had to go downstairs to get a baby wipe. Clean her head off, that was embarrassing. I go to get back in the bed,
she wanna talk about it. What did I tell you guys, I don't like to talk, let it float in the air and disappear. I don't wanna talk about it. As soon as I get in the bed, she was like did you
really just spit on me? I almost lied. I almost lied. Even though I know that she
know I know that I did it, I almost fucking lied. The reason why was because
bad Kevin pooped back up. Bad Kevin was like say it was a leak in the
ceiling. I sad no, get... the hell out of here Bad Kevin. Yes, Yes! I spit on you. Why? I don't know. I was watching porn and I
saw some shit, I tried it. She said, Kevin, let
me tell you something. I don't care if you watch porn. Don't be stupid enough to
bring the shit that you saw in our house. She said, I watch porn all the time. I don't try to do the
shit that I saw to you. I said, uhhh... Back the fuck up. When did this become a whore house? The hell you mean you watching porn? What the hell are you watching? She was like, mmm, everything. AHHHHHHHHH Instantly, it got hurt. The reason why it hurt me is because I fucking couldn't separate my pride from reality. This is the problem that all men have. See reality is if she wanna watch porn, she can watch porn. If I wanna
watch porn, I can watch porn. That's how it should be, but my pride, my pride wouldn't let it be that way. My pride wanted to know what she was watching, I wanted to see it. Let me see it with my
eyes, I wanna see it. She said you wanna see it? Let me see it She got a laptop, opened it up. She said my porn search is in my cookies. All you gotta do is search my cookies. I said, well you better
get me a glass of milk cause I'm bout to eat all
these goddamn cookies. The shit that I saw hurt my heart. It hurt me. The reason why is because her porn search was the complete opposite of who I am. Everything I saw was big. Everything was big. Big balls to the walls,
big backs on big blacks Big cocks and socks. What
the fuck is going on? One of the sites wasn't even porn, one of the sites was a bunch
of tall men being active. They were changing light
bulbs, putting shit on shelves, hanging paintings.What

changing how we live and interact it is every individual Australians responsibility to practice good social distancing No Mas handshaking no more hugging emptying our streets locking down our borders stranding thousands of Australians overseas there's little doubt now that there will be a serious cost to lives and jobs the great paradox is that to tackle this invisible enemy together we have to live apart no wonder we're all feeling anxious I feel like screaming wake up wake up everyone this is truly a terrifying situation we're currently two or three months in to something we haven't seen before various countries are at different stages of their their own outbreak but but this is the beginning which countries are you most concerned about at this early stage I'm concerned about every country you know everybody is vulnerable basically few have a handle on this crisis quite like Professor Dale Fisher this native Australian is the Singapore based chairman of the World Health Organisation's outbreak alert and response network he's the man at the forefront of the strategy to fight this pandemic for non-medical people in it it's both confusing and extraordinary if a medical person such as yourself who's seen some of these epidemics before not maybe not a pandemic is it are you still incredulous as you wake up every morning and have to deal with this I'm tired and there's little light at the end of the tunnel really we're in a holding pattern until we can get a vaccine or a treatment every country really just has to has to minimize the effect you know contain the spread and and try and keep the curve underneath the capacity of the health system so at least you can manage the patients as they get sick if if you do it well the the mortality is going to be around 1% or less if you get overwhelmed then you're up at 6 or 7 percent like like Italy making dreadful decisions about about who can have the scarce resources if you don't mind me saying so you're painting a very very bleak picture there's no melodrama in this though is there I'm just I'm trying to counter the forces that accuse people of talking this up or beating it up I mean you're the health professional you're saying we're still on a cusp of something very very bad this hasn't started Liam I don't want to be alarmist because this is something we can control but the world needs to wake up if governments have been asleep behind the wheel the awful reality of covert 19 is rapidly sinking in millions have been ordered into lockdown in the United States across the globe social distancing and self isolation have become the norm now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel [Music] but it's not all doom and gloom China has recorded its first day with no local infections since the outbreak began other countries have had some success at slowing the viral spread but only through tough social rules and public discipline professor Fisher sees Singapore as a model of how we should be dealing with this crisis professor Singapore has very strict measures for infected people we don't is that a problem for us it's the old saying why do you rob banks well that's where the money is you know why do you isolate people because that's where the virus is and and we don't take risks with that so in Singapore we don't quarantine positive cases we isolate them so once we identify a case they're admitted to hospital they're kept in hospital this can take typically 10 or 12 days until they're there their swabs are clear and then we'll allow them out and back home but professor we don't do the same thing in Australia as you know we're relying on self isolation we're relying on people to do the right thing themselves do you think that's a smart move well all I can say is it's it's not what's done in Singapore or China Hong Kong Taiwan Korea intensive care specialist Greg Kelly is one of thousands of Australian doctors who have written to our leaders urging them to do even more to prepare our health systems for what could be an onslaught of patients while hoping that it never comes prevention is always better than cure and this is a situation where we're desperately trying to prevent a big problem before it happens are you saying the graph is running to form it could go exponential the behavior of the virus around the world has been that it has increased or doubled every three to five days in most countries before strict social distancing measures have been put in place the data is there to show that that's what it's doing in Australia where we are true to form at the moment we are true to form in the moment [Music] those growth rates see us hitting 12,000 caissons in the next two weeks numbers that would overwhelm our own advanced medical system from an emergency health perspective have we got enough ventilators in Australia yeah we have enough ventilators in Australia for our normal needs we have a around two thousand or two and a half thousand intensive care beds and ventilators in Australia the problem is that the surge of critically or over nineteen patients would overwhelm even the best health system so you're saying if numbers go seriously awry here in Australia there's no amount of preparation that can get us to that point where we're comfortable that's right [Music] for many of us it feels a bit like a bad dream and families right across Australia are understandably nervous well I keep waking up sort of having panic attacks at 4:00 a.m. I've been watching too many videos and reading too many science journals and I think I know what's coming this is terrifying this week defying the government's advice Katie little and husband Tim took the step of pulling kids Tom Charlotte and Hunter out of school for the foreseeable future lessons for them will be at home my number-one job as a mum is to keep my children safe and to keep my family safe so for me it's just a it's a simple answer stay home if you can I realize there's people who cannot do that but then again the more people who do choose to stay home and keep their children at home keeps the rest of the population safer dad Tim is a landscape photographer who leads photographic trips around the world his main source of income now cut off for who knows how long but his biggest worry is what happens at home and to me that's where all the anxiety lies for me not about my work or my job or that sort of stuff it's about how do I protect my family and how do I keep my family going like all of us this family is hoping for the best and preparing for the worst stocking up on supplies soaking up every development it's not that's not going away anymore it just feels like to me that we're on an ocean and with countries who are all ships lined up and one after another I'm watching them getting getting taken out and there's a tsunami coming towards us and ever and saying oh it's just water what are you getting so worked up about do you think a lot of people are taking you too casually absolutely we only have one chance to act preemptively and that requires some tough decisions and the only thing we can do I think is just shut everything down and stay home - so it stopped spreading Katty little has another big worry to her mum Jeannie someone we know well Jeannie little was the bubbly Doyen of Australian daytime television struck down 10 years ago by alzheimers disease now aged 81 she's being looked after in a home not far from where daughter Katie lives this is the home where your mum has been for how many years 10 nearly 10 years how many elderly in here with your mom oh my the answer to that easily a couple of hundred it's a two-story building like us all Katie is making tough decisions for the well-being of her family this is as close as she dares get to seeing her mum you think it's what just simply too dangerous to go and visit your mum absolutely they're the people who are most at risk the elderly and not just mum you know by me going to to go visit mum I feel like I'm putting everybody who's in that home at risk as well I mean I can't even believe I'm talking about it because it's the most surreal situation every day I wake up and I think I'm living in a parallel universe or something it's just mind-blowing in a sense it's a blessing that she has dementia isn't it absolutely the time when you when you could say say something good about dementia this is Italy she has no idea of the craziness that's going on out here [Music] if there is a glimmer of hope right now it's here at the University of Queensland's center for clinical research I think we have to do this rigorously and then we can set the world standard well it will be a world changer what a a true game changer that that's what our hope is is there anything in this virus that you've seen that surprised you every day there's something new the center's director professor David Patterson leads a team that is working on a cure for covert 19 the key is an existing HIV medication that has shown great promise in the lab so this drug has killed covert 19 in the test unit that's right [Music] there are also good results from the anti-malarial drug chloroquine professor Patterson wants to test each drug both on their own and in combination in 50 hospitals around Australia the sooner those clinical tests begin the better what we're doing is we're going to look at 2,400 Australians and rigorously study these drugs and see what happens but you suspect it's the magic of the combination do you that's what we suspect how confident are you that these drugs will work you know my guess is that this is probably going to be about 80% there 80% chance of success around the world other teams are racing to develop a vaccine in the United States the first human trial has already begun whatever its success an effective drug that can be mass-produced is probably 18 months away the cure being developed in Australia could come much sooner if all goes well the hope is that GPS could be writing prescriptions this winter you know we know for example that close to 15 percent of people over 80 are going to die when they get this infection you know if we could ramp that down to say 5% there's an awful lot of 80 plus year olds around the world who are in Great Neck who would love to their lives so they can play with their grandchildren I've come as any surprise to you that the entire country is barking for you well you know normally I'm out there on the weekend yelling at football players and it's it's quite a good feeling that this time doctors and scientists the crowds even though the crowds aren't there the crowds are yelling for us marina we're ready to get going more of our special coverage [Music] it doesn't matter which forecast you listen to Australia is staring down the barrel of economic chaos and small business owners like Nathan Gorman are right in the firing line he runs a busy inner Sydney hair salon but right now is fighting to keep his 17 staff in a job how bad do you think it'll get I think it'll get quite bleak I wrote out the financial crisis because people will tend to do things that feel good during a time of crisis a little luxury a little luxury but the ironic thing about this time of crisis is there's a whole lot of stuff there's a whole lot of complications around us touching them so unique sort of problem yeah yeah the salon is following all the government advice and implementing strict hygiene protocols but complying with social distancing rules is simply impossible my quest is to batten down the hatches and keep everyone employed in this time that's a fantastic gesture but yes financially how long can you keep that going well before I have to put my hand in my own pocket a shutdown of a month would really start looking quite grim how will you go if you do have to put people off I would like to say I won't it's not a question I've really entertained how would I go if I had to put people off well you don't want to think about it yeah I don't feed into that anxiety I put a smile on my face and I'm optimistic and my whole team does don't you have a lot of anxiety absolutely but the minute I stand on the floor of my cell on I'm not thinking about myself [Music] it's the same tough reality for so many others airline and travel staff hospitality casual workers and those in the gig economy but right now not everyone is feeling the plane it's obviously hurting retail no no no he told you that Jerry Harvey isn't known for his medical expertise but when it comes to selling he's a master we've got enough salespeople enough customers and we're doing really good business can you see they're changing no no this is a nice big shop we don't have to get really close to each other we don't have to touch you can come into the shop you're a hundred percent okay the billionaire retailer reckons we should all lighten up and not let coronavirus dictate our lives it's not the Spanish flu that killed 15 million people just after the first world war you know why are we so scared about getting this virus is pretty much nothing to get scared of well try telling that to a thousands of Italian families and Chinese families but that's there we're here I'm 80 I should be really scared guess what I'm not really scared well you're in the worst category you know I'm a I'm a sitting duck if you give I never see you again it's been nice knowing you I admire your optimism but it's not it's really not funny to me I've got to be positive I've got to 80 years of age I've had a wonderful life and I think there my self I'm just going to keep going as if nothing's happened [Music] for a section of the population she'll be right is the default position maybe optimism is what we all need a dose of right now the question is whether that puts ourselves and others at greater risk you know sometimes the country's greatest strength can at times be its weakness but from what I've seen in Australia sitting in Singapore I think the message is getting out there but you know Australia's been been it's the lucky country right it's it's been protected from a lot of these types of things it's it's not seen SARS or MERS or Ebola so I can understand the the public having some problems grasping it but but I think they're getting there for Gerry hobby the surge in panic buying also has some upsides now sales are up in Harvey Norman in Australia by 9% on last year our sales in freezers are up 300% and what about air purifiers up a hundred percent in this dark cloud Gerry Harvey refuses to see anything but a silver lining he won't have it any other way I've got to be optimistic what am I going to get out of bed every day for I'm worried about what's going to happen the world's changed there's a new challenge out there you know this is a an opportunity you know you look at me as if this poor bastard doesn't know what he's talking about you know but it could be possible [Music] however we want to look at it the medical experts tell us there's only one certainty in the months that lie ahead things will get worse before they get better all we can do is hold on and give it our very best you know we need to be in this for the long haul this is going to be going on until there's there's a vaccine or door treatment which could be a year or more so this is what I think success looks like success doesn't look like shut down everything and stay in your homes success looks like adaptation of normal life [Music] do you think the general public really getting it getting the message that look it's not necessarily about what I get yeah it's about what I pass on and you're exactly right it's not so much about an individual's risk as the number of people in the community that are going to get it and that if that exceeds our very limited intensive care bed capacity then we're going to be dealing with a lot of unnecessary deaths what would you say to them directly doctor to convince them to socially distance - you know self isolate if there's an issue yeah what can you say to them directly with you what I would say to them is we need to act like this is a crisis before it feels like a crisis and that this is one of the opportunities where you really can save someone else's life
