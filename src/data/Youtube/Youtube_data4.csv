counting down to today's definitely sporting let the kids have a normal life but instead of the dreams that the family was hoping for things turn ugly really fast for Shafie and Ida our new neighbor came in about three months ago from death on my life and my family life actually is in such a tremendous state of any anxiety trauma [Music] shafy and Ida claimed the neighbor pounds violently on the walls at night waking the family this family isn't the only one in 2017 the Housing and Development Board said they received about 3,500 complaints about bad neighbors and social media is filled with videos like these with close to 10 disputes lodged every single day I'm on a mission to find out what is causing these disputes and what we can do when we're caught in the middle of one [Music] neighbor disputes typically only make the news after they have been broiling on for many years or at least when one party takes a dramatic action Ida's family has been embroiled in a dispute with a neighbor to three months they are desperate for help this is the wall that he likes to bang unexpectedly during the day during the night and how many times the night this this banging happened it could be five it could be more than that by unexpected times he will use an object you'll bang door I can't have a good night's sleep in this room anymore I keep hearing the bang unexpectedly and do you still sleep here anymore no at night we pull out to be go out at the living room so all of us will sleep outside the alleged constant banging also scares their children aged seven three and one is already rich roman by going through all the things he he has to go see a psychologist help and yet inside [Music] there's no way around this situation I approach the age to be about the family's case the board said together with other agencies they're working with the parties involved to try and reach an amicable solution but it added it would take time before the resolution is reached the Housing and Development Board is one of the first places residents turn to to voice their grievances about neighbor issues but the HDB is primarily a property developer so some residents turn to the town council instead which is the estate manager but the Town Council only imposes rules for common spaces like corridors and void decks not what happens inside the flat in July this year Shafi and Ida made a police report but even that didn't really help because there are no legal decibel limits when it comes to sounds from residential homes in order for any action to be taken I don't Shafi need to prove that their neighbor's noise is a nuisance in court and that is going to take time and it's going to cost money according to the community mediation center the most common types of neighbor disputes are harassment followed by abusive words and unacceptable conduct coming in at the top noise Mykleby is a noise control expert he has spent the past 30 years working on noise monitoring I'm meeting him to find out why noisy neighbors get on our nerves we and sometimes not conscious about how much noise we actually generate children playing can be a very wide range of noise some things a board game it can be quite quiet maybe 65 70 decibels or you can be playing a chasing game when you're running around jumping around screaming when you so that can be going up to about 85 to 90 decibels so it's actually really quite noisy our everyday activities but what's more important is the perception of that noise let me show you an example okay so this is a device that is generating a calibrated sounds sound level so I want you to stand over here and listen to the sound that's being generated okay so this is how white noise this sounds like the ocean to me compared to this this is a speech intelligibility test voice so now if I'm trying to speak to you how do you feel when I'm trying to say something to you and you I'm not actually listening to you anymore although both these noises are actually generating if you measure them they are the same at 62 decibels seriously Jesse but this is a speech intelligibility task voice however one affects you more than the other yes because one of them is actually exciting frequencies that are close to the human speech frequencies and that's what you're most sensitive to because we communicate using those frequencies right so I'm in direct competition to it so it turns out the noises made by our neighbors tend to irritate us not necessarily because they are loud but because they impair our communication with others so let me show you another source of noise this is called the tonal noise this is the same sound pressure as the other two I feel almost like vertigo like I wanna yes faint that's right so it's only exciting a specific frequency and that frequency irritates us so we have that sometimes in some mechanical equipment like an aircon compressor as you my neighbors the other day complain because our air condition units so old the whole night just goes ah at this one frequency that's right and it caused us issues yes one more thing I'd like to show you is how ambient or background noise affect how we perceive sound all this time that we are doing a recording we have been actually putting some pressure into this place to actually artificially increase the sound pressure really so right now we're gonna turn it off okay and you you're gonna realize that it's a much quieter environment yes now when I subject you to this you will notice that this is even louder than it was before although it is actually the same song sauce [Laughter] oh stop it's more cutting yes everything is more cutting that's why there's a difference at night is right because at at night there's less noise pollution that's right but during the day there are all these others so noises don't even have to be loud but by agitating certain frequencies different kinds of noises can evoke strong reactions in certain people I want to experience for myself what Shafi and Ida are going through so I've asked to stay the night at their place I've discovered that one of the main culprits of disputes between neighbors is noise something which Iron Chef II have been dealing with over the past three months I want to know how bad it can get especially in the dead of the night so I've asked for a sleepover this is my kitchen so this is the toilet all right okay this is the bedroom okay thank you thank you before turning in I set up cameras and noise monitoring devices around the room [Music] [Music] so the families just got to sleep and they're sleeping in the living room and in the master bedroom let's see how tonight goes gonna get to my pajamas and get into bed [Music] [Applause] I'm slowly easing myself to sleep but soon I hear someone knocking against the bedroom wall and close to midnight I hear this so I just had to really love prominent bangs that definitely came from this way and made me feel really uncomfortable it felt like it was meant to provoke me and it I feel very vulnerable a good night seat I keep getting woken up but these two bangs definitely put me out of my comfort zone I'm not feeling comfortable today I can understand now the strain on Shafi and his family I want to help Shafi and Ida find a solution to their ordeal the community mediation center under the Ministry of law was set up in 1998 to handle disputes between neighbors in an amicable manner Krishna V is an expert mediator who has been helping resolve neighbor disputes for the past 21 years mr. Krishna why should the affected parties seek the help of a mediator in the presence of a mediator helps them because he guides them allowing the parties whom to speak go to answer sometimes they may come to a deadlock then it is used sometimes the mediator will have a private session with them and may help them with some suggestion look what about looking at this issue in this way sometime in the during the mediation there comes some very good ideas among themselves which you can't think of what is the percentage of cases that go through mediation that eventually find a resolution what's that % o story it's about 70 percent we've been successful rates which in my opinion I think is quite high so how about 30 percent then you can result called the proceedings so I'm learning that mediation can be a powerful tool to resolving disputes especially between neighbors I'm wondering if Ida and her family would be open to having a session of mediation with their neighbor to hopefully resolve their dispute I'm giving Shafi a call hi well I just spoke with the community mediation center and they suggested that you and your neighbor go for mediation what do you think okay wait hold on why do you think mediation won't work I mean as much as I really want to make it I think [Music] for mediation to work both parties must believe that they can reach an amicable solution which isn't always the case as I've just heard from Shafi yet with every passing day living with a bad neighbor can be torture the residents from this block in another part of the island have been terrorized by one particular household for close to a decade until that said household finally moved out is that what it takes for resolution to be reached [Music] hi hi I want to ask you some questions about a neighbor that lived on this floor that caused some trouble before what sir I will be lenient on Ida T to alumni tablet up eating it who like to see Ottawa attendant howdy thousand Utah once a new Tao what and then government poor sweet home from the total while away coli her woman turned Andal home Belen was a book what was it like for you to experience something like that contained a little excusing tell Donna how long did it last but Elena did ago bacteria will attend undo but is the problem always with the neighbor or could it be the way our plants are built I think earlier I spoke to Madame la she lived next to a neighbor who slashed liquids at her front door for close to 10 years 10 10 the little is using to tell that one option is to move out but is that easier said than done I'm meeting housing agents Janet out I know she's been trying to sell a flat at this estate in the western part of Singapore for a number of years so this is the unit that dog owners tried to sell in fact that by is it legal in a step by a bit open stop at the common area okay he's put all of his items outside on the corridors yes he's kind of claimed it as his own space so how did the problems caused by this labor affect the sales of this flat basically there aren't any takers you see the pka's Mumbai account to see a property to buy they don't just look at the interior they also survey the surroundings that how neighbors gonna live in because this is like an everyday affair right from then on and they are faced with a neighbor situation like this it were actually raised concern about the potential buyers about whether is going to be a livable environment for them in future let me show you something you can see from the past transact that prices that's been recorded before the owner started selling the market value is around 420 to about 450 range so unless I'm able to ask at such a price and here to ask at about 3 to be about 360 range in order to you know attract buyers wow that's a real significant drop yes it is how long has this owner been trying to sell the flat spot two years two years yeah you still haven't been able to sell it yes Wow I was starting to think that if you had a problematic neighbor then you just move out and it's easy but I'm really starting to realize it's not that easy to just move out and sell the flat correct because he can't get it so he's unable to move to another replacement home right so therefore he stopped so moving out is not always an option and even less so when you have a family of five like Shafi and Ida I've been trying to have a word with sharpies neighbor [Music] he went out okay I finally managed to get him on the phone he declined an on-camera interview but agreed to let me share his views so I've just gone off the phone with sharpies neighbor and he apologizes if he had made a noise saying that it was unintentional and just a result of his lifestyle but more importantly he's decided to move out and sell his flat upon HDB's pending approval and hopefully this brings some closure to shelf unites case [Music] but does the problem always lie with the neighbor has Lina Hamza moved into this flat in Pongal four years ago soul infants living here what are the noise issues you've experienced in this flat no kidding dragging the cupboard and they were top Kim is brilliant through I mean like throwing things can heal the dawn the Muslims life is really reaching Moses but the doors know when you're never on top or no but below right when you closing the door they impact the pressure you can get no no no as a poem and you know they're doing something sorry so why do you think you can hear these noises loudly here I think is the wall the wall yes it my husband drill don't do all this is not like last time the house in flat it's really like food so my husband said like the world is like empty easy to go to hear the song oh no you have to carry yeah yeah I understand how follow this yeah is literally nothing in this wall this this is only this area right but that's a few hip has Lina believes the sounds are amplified in newer HDB flats because the walls are thinner so I'm putting this theory to the test I'm pitting has Lina's for upon go flat against my friends thirty-five-year-old flattened to Appa yo I'm getting help from acoustic consultants they'll measure how much noise can pass through the walls and ceilings from one unit into another in both flats we will know in a few days if there's any difference between the two [Music] three days later the moment of reckoning so Bruno what did the tests tell us so we did two types of tests yeah one is called an STC test in which we measure the noise traveling from one room to the other to a wall and then the other test is III sita's which actually measure the sound traveling through this lab and then to the room downstairs the reservation system in between the old HDD image to be okay so they're almost the same thing yes they match quite well mmm this confuses me a little bit why is it some people say that living in the new flat is actually noisier than living in the old flat so one of the factors behind that is because some of the newer developments the units are smaller and the development itself is more than sleep packed as opposed to the order of elements or the units are bigger and not nonsense so what happens is now don't live in close quarters you're going to be able to listen to another situation that may aggravate the issue is because sometimes in your developments the surrounding area is not totally developed yet so especially during night time any sound on your neighbor makes its gonna pick up your attention even though the actual noise is not high so walls amplifying sounds not really turns out we could be just lured densely packed these days so how do I deal with the neighbor from hell well I could try and find an amicable solution through various third party agencies but when the dispute is about noise that's going to be difficult because you can easily find out the permissible noise levels for factories and construction work in your residential area but when it comes to your neighbors it's often discretionary perhaps it would be better for everyone if there were clear noise limits that would help us and agencies take quick action before things get out of hand [Music]

 #WSJ #Vaccine","- Hey, guys, so we're in line for our COVID-19 vaccines. - Vaccination 2021. - Shot number one. - [Narrator] More and
more people are lining up to get their COVID-19 vaccines. Half of all US adults have received at least one shot. - Hey, guys, we're on the way to get. - [Both] The second vaccine. - Pfizer, so we'll keep you
posted on our side effects. - How we're feeling after. - [Narrator] As they do, many are now also sharing
their side effects and some. - I had a tiny headache
and a tiny little red spot on my arm. - [Narrator] Are more common than others. - I don't know if you guys can see it, there's a little bump right
above my left clavicle. - [Narrator] So what side
effects should people expect after getting their shots? And when is it important
to seek medical attention? - I can't really lift my
arm like past my shoulder but that's it. - [Narrator] Side effects like this, pain and redness in the arm where a person received their shot are the most common. Dr. Krutika Kuppalli says
they can even be a good sign. - So the reason for the symptoms is really because your immune system is revving up to develop
those good antibodies that you need to help
fight off the coronavirus if you were to come into contact with it. - So basically, it's like a training for your immune system. - Yeah, that's a really
good way to think about it. - [Narrator] Headaches,
chills, fever, nausea, body aches and in some cases,
even vomiting or diarrhea are normal, if a bit unpleasant. - I have been running to the bathroom. I feel like my body's shutting down. - [Narrator] People getting
the two-dose vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna may also feel different
from one dose to the next. Many report feeling worse
after the second shot. - Second COVID vaccine, the Pfizer shot, has me in the bed. - The second time you get the vaccine, your body's already
experienced developing some of the antibodies, so your antibody response is gonna be much higher and so that's why those
symptoms you develop are gonna be a bit stronger. - [Narrator] But again,
this isn't everyone. Doctors still don't have enough data to say one dose carries
more severe side effects than the other. And whether the experience is different for people who've had COVID. - I was getting a little bit concerned but I figured this was just
an enlarged lymph node. - So some of the less common side effects that we've seen of the vaccine have been what we call lymphadenopathy or enlarged lymph nodes. - [Narrator] Though rare,
this swelling tends to happen on the same side of the
body as the injection. - It's a sign that your
immune system is working and you might notice when you get a cough or a cold, you get enlarged
lymph nodes in your neck. - [Narrator] Also rare are cases where patients have reported heart issues, temporary paralysis to
one side of the face or serious allergic reactions, resulting in rashes and
difficulty breathing. - This is one of the
reasons we have people wait after they get their vaccine. - [Nurse] Keep an eye on
you for 15 minutes, okay? - [Woman] Okay. - [Nurse] Between now and then, if you feel anything outside ordinary, please honk your horn. I'll come over, take a look and make sure you guys are okay. - [Narrator] What's not normal is having a runny nose,
cough or sore throat after getting the vaccine. - If you had those symptoms, I would be worried that you had some sort of upper respiratory infection or possibly even COVID. So I would recommend getting tested. - [Narrator] Typically,
any side effect starts to get better within a day or two of getting vaccinated. After that, Dr. Kuppalli recommends people seek medical attention. - Also if they have things
like difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, things that would be
considered emergencies. - One of the more worrisome
adverse events reported recently is a very rare type of blood
clot several women experienced after getting the Johnson
& Johnson vaccine. More than seven million people in the US have gotten this vaccine. - It really is one in a million people that have had this event. - For now, US regulators have paused distribution of J&J's vaccine, though Dr. Anthony Fauci
said he expects the vaccine to return to use by the end of the week, perhaps with additional
restrictions or warnings, as was done in Europe. What are some of the things
that people should do in order to dampen their side effects? - I would try to schedule time to just kind of have a mellow day, right? So you don't know how the
vaccine's gonna affect you. - [Narrator] But Dr.
Kuppalli says don't worry if you feel fine. The vaccine is still working. People over 55 typically
experience fewer side effects, possibly because their immune
system gets weaker with age. - I don't want people to think oh, if I don't have a side
effect, that's a bad thing. People's bodies are different as well. - Don't be afraid to get the vaccine. Everyone reacts differently. Me and my sister did
not have any symptoms. It doesn't mean you won't but in the end, it's better than COVID. ",True,False,False,False

For business enquiries: limkopi@ourgrandfatherstory.com our grandfather story","It's enjoyable but it's not easy. As a Home Personal Care Supervisor I usually go into the clients' (seniors') homes to assess their care needs especially if they have no family, or they are isolated they don't go out, they don't have any friends you will be the first one that they call (for help). This care is very personal, right? A lot of times they are also quite emotional or maybe they are quite depressed so managing their behaviour is also tough. People have the image that we don't do anything we are sitting down and shaking our legs but that's far from the truth. We provide individualised care  so part of my job scope is to try to build rapport with the residents and to make their stay in the nursing home as homely as possible. Small things which I think will be uncomfortable for myself I will make sure that it wouldn't be for the residents. So certain things like the head positions or how their hands are or whether they are lying too low – I'm (very particular) when it comes to such stuff, yeah. Not that easy because we are handling the elderly. I assist the therapists, physiotherapists and also the occupational therapists to do exercises with the clients (seniors) for their treatment when they come to the centre.  We really have to sayang sayang (coax) them. There's this one grandmother, she's very cute. ""I don't want to do this exercise this week I will do it next week."" She told me. Then I said, ""Last week you promised me that you will do this exercise. This week you make another promise that you will do it the week after. No, no, no, you have to do it this week."" I said ""No, you cannot."" So our job is like, at least to encourage them and that is the difficult part. Elderly can be quite demanding sometimes. They want this, they want that. You need to have the patience to understand that they are not like this. It's not that they want to scold you but it's because of their condition. Normally, we don't take it to heart because in this industry we need to learn to love them and assist them as much as possible, yeah. So, there was this auntie where – she has major depressive disorder. She will just keep scolding me. She will say, like – and she will not be open to answer my questions. Yeah, but there was this one day where  she was the same (as usual), sitting on the floor and everything so I just sat with her on the floor also and then I asked her something. And then, she scolded me but suddenly she said, like [in Mandarin] ""Why is it that, although I keep scolding you you keep coming back?"" [in English] I told her that  [in Mandarin] ""I come because I care for you."" [in English] I think she got a bit teary. I felt like that was a breakthrough moment because she knew then that I cared. And actually, she knew that she was scolding me. So, after that, like our relationship got a lot better and she was receptive to the help that she needed, yeah. It's not pity, I empathise with their condition. At their age going through a medical condition and (having) no family support you know, living alone at home I kind of empathise with their condition. I wouldn't say I pity them because I don't think that is what they want. If they know that someone is pitying them they will just feel lousy about themselves ""Oh, I'm that lousy that you need to pity me."" you know, that kind of stuff. There was one particular resident that I was taking care of. He is 60 plus year old, male and he used to be very aggressive to all of us. He would throw – splatter milo, splatter food at us and all. I mean, the first reaction that anyone will feel is ""Oh no, I'm trying to help you, why are you doing this to me?"" It's some sort of anger. So, I started looking at his social worker report and his social background. So, I understood that he was a firefighter. He used to be a strong male. Because for myself, I'm a pretty independent person so one day if I were to lose my independence that is something that I will feel as well. Of course you will feel frustrated that you can't do anything yourself. So, if you think of it from this kind of perspective you will start understanding ""Oh, maybe that's why he is upset that's why he's so irritable."" If you don't have good support, right it can be quite depressing. Yeah, but actually I feel that they are very resilient. So, for a lot of them, having lost some functional abilities (they) have found new ways to cope and adapt. I have one client (senior) who is visually handicapped so she is blind and she was staying alone. Yeah, so we came in to assist her with things that she really couldn't do like housekeeping. But she could still do very amazing things that – actually I don't know how she does it like cooking. Yeah, and she cooks the best chicken soup. Sometimes she will call us and be like [in Mandarin] ""I'm cooking chicken soup today do you want to come over?"" [in English] Yeah and she also makes very beautiful, like, beaded baskets that she makes as gifts for people. Yeah, and there are actually a lot of strengths to them. I think if I have to choose one, definitely there's one senior who I think – she's 98 years old. She has dementia but she's still very she's very jovial, she's very – [in Mandarin] she's like an old naughty child. [in English] She will be, you know, like kids they will sit on the floor (and say) [in Mandarin] ""I want to go home! I want to go home!"" [in English] So, it's a... it's quite an interesting sight. So, during the circuit breaker period unfortunately, she passed away in her sleep. So I think when she stopped coming (to the centre) and sometimes the centre doesn't have her noise so sometimes the staff will say, ""Aiya [in Mandarin] why is this grandmother not here anymore?"" [in English] We miss her loveliness in the centre. One of the clients (seniors) is in the centre right now even though it isn't the time for him to come for his exercise, he will come to me (and ask) ""When can I exercise?"" You know, his expression is like so – like, you cannot resist, you know. At least, I feel that my service is needed. There's this particular senior she's still in the nursing home currently. the kind of care I get from her is different from the rest because she talks to me really politely and she's really understanding to most of the nurses. She would say stuff like, ""Oh, it's okay, take your time. I understand."" You know, this kind of stuff. So, the fact that she's putting in the effort to make her life the best she can despite her situation, that's something that I can learn from her. I try to think of it this way, like to be as optimistic as I can because that's the only way you get to push yourself forward, you know. Whether it comes to taking care of the residents or my personal life, it's the same kind of concept. Yes! Yes, very important because if not for our job, a lot of elderly are not able to age in the community. They will have to be cared for in a nursing home. And actually a lot of times elderly want to be in a familiar environment in the community that they have lived so many years in, you know and our home care actually enables that. My job is important because you know that you are being there for people's loved ones and taking care of them most of the time till their last breath. Without my job, I think there will be a lot of elderly who will be without maybe, companionship? They wouldn't have anyone to talk to. Looking at my age now I'm also, like, about there. So I kind of – I hope that the community services is able to have those services for me also. I won't say that I'm a hero. It's just that I'm able to help other families to take care of the elders because we know that the family and caregivers also have their own stress. So, being able to have that short time frame of helping to take care of the elders helps to relieve this caregiver stress from the family members. Producer: Were you always working in such a sector or did you switch sectors? No, previously I was working in the cyber security area so I was given the opportunity to travel and stuff but I felt that there wasn't (any) self-satisfaction so I wanted to do something more meaningful. So, I guess it's more – I feel happier and (fulfilled) in this community care sector. My family and my extended family were not very supportive (of my work). [in Mandarin] ""Aiya, just take up a banking job you have a business degree. Why did you take up such a job?"" [in English] It did affect me back then but somehow thankfully also, I'm stubborn enough to continue (this career). It's not every day you get to do something as a job, as a profession that you love to do. Since we're going to spend so much of our waking hours, like, working, right why not do something meaningful for the larger community? So, I'm currently in the progress of getting my diploma to be a staff nurse so that was when I had to leave and on my last day of shift, I had conversations with the elderly, the residents, in my nursing home. ""Where are you going?"" They were shocked. ""What do you mean you're leaving?"" So, it was emotional but it had to be done for my career progression but hopefully, when I'm back those residents are still there and I can still care for them. I wouldn't trade (this job for) any other jobs, yeah. It doesn't matter if you have no knowledge about being a community care staff. Along the way you can build up the experience and also the skills. The most important thing that matters is that you have the heart. When we get engaged with them we see the joy in the elders and it kind of reflects to us that when the elders are happy, we are also happy. When the elders say [in Mandarin] ""See you tomorrow!"" I think we've made someone's day and this is the best satisfaction we can get from this job. Growing old is inevitable but with the help of community care staff we can all live well and age gracefully.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] a virus about 300 times smaller than the diameter of a strand of hair has thrown the whole world off course data collected of its dimensions helps us choose masks with a weave fine enough to protect us statistics tell us that about 97 of those infected develop symptoms within 11 to 12 days and about 99 will fall ill within 14 days which explains why it's a 14-day quarantine to keep the community safe and how do we decide that seniors should be among the first to be vaccinated well that's because we have data showing that it's 10 000 times more deadly for a 90 year old than a 9 year old [Music] so it was numbers like these that helped us form our first line of defense against an unknown enemy but apart from that data can also be revealing [Music] it can tell us how much life has changed during these unprecedented times and we can also draw from them lessons on how to survive and thrive in this post-pandemic world [Music] it's been over a year since the pandemic began and covet 19 has changed the way we live our lives door handles elevator buttons and even hands have all become covet coated booby traps [Music] and for most of us the long commute to the office has now become a few steps to our desk instead of long days stuck in meeting rooms we're now caught up in endless video calls and who knew the latest fashion accessory would be this a mask [Music] i can't remember the last time i shook someone's hand or performed in front of a live audience all these small changes hide a treasure trove of data revealing major social shifts normally i wouldn't get up close and personal with so many people but this time we're doing it for market research for science with safe distancing so if we're now a mask-wearing nation have our eyes truly become the windows to our soul and a pain to our wallets [Music] you see scientists have actually noticed that the pandemic has changed our relationship with our own faces but to what extent i'm going to study that starting with makeup hi excuse me so i did this review um you're looking for makeup today uh yeah let's see for eye makeup can we prepare for like our eyes [Music] because with the pandemic like we're wearing a mask the lipstick you can't really see it your eyes the only one you can see we have actually seen a drop versus a year ago for makeup however we are actually seeing like one-on-one increase in eye makeup so nowadays we are always meeting on zoom is there any particular color or type of makeup that has seen a pickup in sales in the past people actually are more into buying single color as well as dual color applicator for eye shadow now uh they have actually shifted more to the color palette where there are multiple colors when we weren't looking sales of eye makeup were reported to have skyrocketed all over the world and one of the world's biggest e-commerce companies alibaba even reported eye cosmetics going up 150 so for many the pandemic has changed long-held beauty routines and with masks becoming so ubiquitous the emphasis appears to have shifted to our eyes but are our masks hiding some serious upgrades underneath [Music] so we're trying first okay [Music] is it clear aligners are transparent forms of plastic braces uniquely tailored to fit each individual the shape of your teeth is captured using a scan [Music] and from this a set of aligners is 3d printed and over the course of between 12 and 18 months the plastic molds slowly move your teeth into the ideal position [Music] less painful and less awkward than metal braces this quest for perfect pearly whites doesn't come cheap the treatment can set you back anything from 1 500 to 7 000 us dollars open much more expensive than metal braces so at a time when some people are tightening their belts sales of clear aligners are taking off right around the back here there's a bit of misalignment at least two brands are reporting exponential growth i don't get it in this new era of masks and work from home why are people paying eye watering sums to sort out their smiles hey investment banking analyst tony is one of those people who paid more than four thousand dollars to get his perfect set of pearly whites what made you decide to begin the treatment why now why this year of all the years when the coffee heads everybody works from home every time i look in the zoo so that's when i started to really really seriously thinking about doing something on my teeth to make myself look confident and look better tony isn't alone four in ten singaporeans are now more conscious of their smiles with the surge and use of video calls [Music] it's not just orthodontists who are smiling all the way to the bank aesthetic doctors too are seeing an uptick in business so i'm heading from the dentist chair to the examining table scientists from the massachusetts hospital sent a survey to more than 100 dermatologists across the nation the results suggest a 56 increase in people seeking cosmetic procedures it's not just the united states cosmetic doctors and plastic surgeons around the world the uk australia japan south korea have all reported surges in bookings it's being called the zoom in singapore aesthetic clinics are also seeing a rise in enquiries and actual cosmetic enhancements done from eyelid surgery to face lifts to lip filler injections singaporeans are using this opportunity to get nipped and tucked dr adrian wee a plastic surgeon who's been in practice for more than 14 years fills me in on how this zoom boom has been keeping him busy what is it about zoom you know that has this big impact on how we view ourselves teleconferencing with programs such as zoom have led to people being more aware of the way they look because they're literally looking at themselves all day on the screen since everyone's worked from home might as well just get it done are you seeing more men coming in interestingly yes the past i think men would make up about maybe 10 of my aesthetic practice but now i would say it's about 20 even 30 percent this covet period has really been the catalyst i think for a lot of them to do stuff like droopy eyelids to correct the droopy eyelids or even get their eye backs done all right so doctor so with my face right how can you make it more zoomable for you you've got quite obvious eye bags so i'm just going to do a bit of marking minimally invasive techniques would be to mask those lines through the use of fillers if only this was like a magic pen and wherever you drew it the corrections just oh man then i'll be out of business place the pillar product right at the line there i think you look great wow okay i've just finished the procedure and it feels numb i can definitely see some improvement especially for my left eye the whole process took what 10 minutes maybe at most that's as far as i go there are clearly others who go even further dr we recently saw an uptick of 50 new patients in his clinic jamie is one of them so what procedure are you thinking i'm getting now it's a surgical procedure yeah it's called the scarless eye back you know can you see the second layer yeah just a bit yeah it's it's noticeable after you mention it but it's more noticeable on zoom call because for photos you can edit but on video is very hard the proliferation of meeting apps has created new phrases in our lexicon zoom boom zoom face zoom fatigue and well the latest i heard zoom body dysmorphia it means finding your own image in a group video call so unappealing that you can't focus on anything else but how often does that happen and why do we suffer from body zoom dysmorphia dr adrian wang reveals that he too has found himself becoming more anxious during the pandemic in fact it spurred him on to delve deeper into the psychology behind zoom meetings having to stare at your own face over a screen for hours on end seems to magnify that problem so people again start to obsess and dwell over what they perceive as imperfections and this can worsen their anxiety and their mental health is this issue just simply us finding ourselves more unattractive or is there something deeper in general i would say that no it's not a standalone problem by itself but it's an important component of many of the things that that stress people out because of of the pandemic how many people do you think in singapore have this are affected by this body zoom dysmorphia i see about 15 to 20 patients a day and most of them have work related stress from zoom and virtual meetings and you multiply that with with all the mental health professionals and counselors in singapore you come up with a pretty big number before the pandemic many people saw working from home as a luxury but when we were forced home or mass many found the office became a long forgotten dream destination [Music] in fact a survey conducted on more than 3 000 singaporeans in the middle of 2020 found that nearly two-thirds of those who worked from home reported feeling stressed in another survey around the same period 78 of those in the study said that they were anxious about economic issues while 37 said they feared contracting the coronavirus at malls or public places and this stress is manifesting itself in unexpected corners third straight day singapore has recorded more than a thousand new infections the region has seen more than three five million cases more than one million people have died in the coca-19 pandemic over the past year the world has been focused on the rising number of infections but it appears our single-minded focus on those numbers may have blinded us to other health issues i've never liked visiting the dentist but luckily this time i'm not getting my teeth checked or so i think i'm here because the national dental center singapore saw a spike in the number of people seeking endodontic treatment in 2020 endodontics a specialist branch in dental treatment that deals with problems such as complex root issues teeth replacements cracked teeth basically barely damaged teeth and i'm on the dentist chair because the spike in cases of damaged teeth has been so dramatic during the pandemic that dr tra from the dental center insists that since i'm here for his interview that i should get my teeth checked oh boy right put it together any pain on your teeth on your function um no not not usually any pain in the jaw joints uh no joints no okay any headaches in the morning headaches uh no not really are you aware if you're clenching or grinding uh yes just once in a while in a day oh day time i can spot a crack lying on the canine okay thank you doctor i'm just like super surprised that i have cracked teeth um it's due to my clenching cracked it can happen if you buy very hard foods like eyes and bones but people do not bite very hard foods so the majority of the case that we see as a result of clenching and not grinding there are distinct differences so grinding is like you wear off the teeth but clenching is you just bite them bend the teeth and then bend the teeth and then they crack according to dr choi the root causes behind teeth clenching are largely psychological in the past we did some research on it 38 of the patients they were tend to be moderately depressed in the center here our percentage of females to males about 80 percent females to 20 males in this dynamic situation there are issues of the mind the challenging times so i would anticipate this to happen more cracks and teeth often come about because of excessive clenching and grinding of teeth at night our teeth enamel is actually harder than steel in the day the bite force on our teeth ranges from 1 to 10 kilograms at night this force can go up to an estimated 30 to 50 kilograms imagine that so some of us could be busy grinding at night i wonder if the panama's changed other things that happen when the lights go out something i rather enjoy something that most of us probably can't get enough of i'm talking about sleep in a global survey by an app measuring sleep quality with 70 000 participants 37 reported taking longer to fall asleep since the start of the pandemic i've been getting way less sleep than usual and what is needed but then again i've also got a newborn baby to take care of i wonder if singaporeans are also facing the same sleep problems and i know just the people to ask the people who work here have you ever wondered what it's like to be a sleep doctor must be a dream job take a seat thank you dr kenny pang pioneer of innovative surgical procedures in the sleep medicine industry that's why you tend to find that your sleep quality is even poorer right now is passionate about helping people to get some quality shut eye yes since the pandemic i've seen at least a two or three-fold increase in the number of patients that see me for sleeplessness why is this so it's multi-factorial stress in the economy stress in their jobs as well and now that they have to stay home there's always tend to be some form of friction going on at home most of my patients can range from about 20s to about 50s and men women women more they tend to be more anxious personalities and more perfectionists compared to men men tend to be more type b they're more relaxed i would have thought that because more people are working from home and staying home longer then it is we have more time to fall asleep they take for granted that they can wake up later in the morning so they tend to sleep later at night we shift our clock backwards we mess up our circadian rhythm and a lot of times this can lead to sleeplessness or even insomnia so then what do you recommend is the best way to sleep a lot of my patients are sleepless for a short period of time and i teach them sleep hygiene sleep regularly every night 11 00 p.m to 7 a.m in a quiet cool and dark area they should not use any blue light emitting devices two hours before sleep no exercise four hours before sleep and avoid stimulants there's a whole checklist oh yes but it helps if you didn't sleep well or you wake up tired you'll be moody irritable short-tempered your relationships are affected your work is affected your so-called productivity is affected so your stress never goes up so this affects your personal self-esteem and your confidence as well clearly stress sleep and mental health are intertwined [Music] triggered by the stress and strains of kobe 19 we reach for the junk food [Music] and with work from home leaving us more sedentary than ever before many of us have gone from fab to flab [Music] according to grab the start of the circuit breaker saw double the demand for desserts such as frozen yogurt fast food orders specifically burgers and fried chicken also rose by over 30 during this period well it's no wonder that experts have coined a new term to describe a rise in obesity caused by kovit 19. kobe bcd [Music] so in a global survey conducted in 2020 over one quarter of all respondents said they put on weight in singapore the proportion is even higher one in three people said they piled on the kilos during the pandemic and of those who gained weight thirty percent reported an average increase of around five kilograms a weight gain that's the result of moving less and eating more thanks to the pandemic a reminder that covet 19 can hit us even without an infection in any given period the national cancer center sees a steady stream of new cancer diagnoses referred to the specialist here [Music] but from february to july in 2020 it reported a nearly 26 drop in new referrals [Music] what's the reason for this fall i think partly because during that period there were real uh worries about people entering the healthcare facilities especially when during the height of covet there were a decrease in for example breast mammography done during the period of time there was a decrease in colonoscopy done during a period of time and i think those decrease in screening could have contributed in a slight decrease in incidence of cancer during the period there might also be a decrease in the willingness of patients to visit the doctors one of the repercussions of someone coming in to diagnose their cancer a bit later i think if if the delay is about a month or two it's very unlikely that it will significantly impact upon this diagnosis but of course if the delay go on for months or months then there will be a significant impact it's always better to treat the cancer as earlier stages than later stages a study in the uk estimates that across 20 cancer tumor types just a six month delay in cancer referrals will result in over 9 000 fatalities and over 170 000 life years lost fortunately for singapore it has not come to that so while singapore's medical system did not collapse under the pressure of the pandemic the virus has brought us down in other ways and is hitting us where it hurts through a mess of new data we've seen how covet 19 can impact us even without an infection this pandemic has triggered a mental health crisis more of us are stress grinding our teeth and emotional eating has left many of us overweight and unhealthy but covert 19 has hit us where it really hurts no not there i mean our wallets global economies are suffering the worst recessions since the second world war the world trade organization reported the steepest drop in global trade on record from march to june 2020 and as a global trade hub singapore has been hit hard the city saw its worst quarter in history over the same period which also coincided with the start of the circuit breaker and from the unemployment charts it is not hard to see who the hardest hit are this is the unemployment rate of those in their 30s it rose from 2.3 percent in september 2019 to 3.5 in september 2020. this means that there were about 19 000 people aged 30 to 39 who were unemployed now if we take a look at the same chart for the people aged 40 to 49 not only do we see an uptick in unemployment for this group of people but the rate was higher and the rate of increase steeper but amid the dark economic clouds there has been a secret revolution going on during the circuit breaker cash was no longer king and e-payments took center stage according to dbs singapore's largest bank digital banking transactions rose 40 in 2020 compared to the year before there was an unprecedented drop in cash usage of 28 and in 2020 460 000 of us paid online for the first time what's more amazing about a quarter of their number which means 120 000 are aged 50 and up as the cashless society we have been talking about for years finally arrived riding on the coattails of a pandemic i'm banking on e-payment enthusiast xi zi kuhn to give me the answers i need so when's the last time you actually use cash to pay for something well i honestly cannot remember it's been so long ago i i can't remember i i don't believe i i use cash anymore i was here four years ago interviewing about payla and cashless payments and i felt like it didn't seem to take up until the pandemic happened do you think that that was like a catalyst for everyone to go cashless i think last year was a was it was a year where it all came together the needs arising from the pandemic where i guess people might not want to touch cash that much we partnered with government agencies to roll out these capabilities to educate a lot of these merchants on digital payments it's safe it's convenient and so we start to see a lot of adoption points there are already about 180 000 points where you can actually use payla when it came to corporate pay now transactions that was actually a six-fold increase smes were traditionally paying through checks have adopted digital payments instead would you say like you know this is the beginning of the end of cash well i would say this is certainly the beginning of a huge transformation a digital revolution one day in the very near future cash could be obsolete but there's one enduring truth where the money flows crime always follows and this pandemic has shown that criminals are one of the most resilient and adaptable players of the economy in 2020 reported cases of traditional crime decreased by 15.3 that's a drop of 4 000 cases and yet overall crime climbed 6.5 in the whole year that's because scams saw a near 65.1 increase in 2020. specifically e-commerce scams increased by 19.1 percent in 2020 compared to the year before and the total amount cheated tripled from 2.3 million dollars to 6.9 million dollars carousel is one of singapore's favorite digital platforms for buying and selling items but in the first half of 2020 they took the top spot for the highest number of scams on digital platforms most of the scams involved deals that seemed too good to be true and in 2020 scams involving masks hand sanitizers and thermometers grew at a feverish pace i don't understand how and why people still fall for scams like these as an online shopper i can tell if it's a scam just by looking at a person's sales numbers and reviews or so i think i'm at carousel's office in singapore and they want to put me to the test so yeah this is the account what do you think um zero followers zero following just join today it might be a fake account what's the difference between a new account like a legit new user and a scammer even if you're new some people will try to make it an effort to feel like a real person you can put out a profile picture description let's take a look at the listings and you can tell me what do you think okay so this is a 500 brand new packaging apple watch series six shipping register meal um it looks this this listing looks legit to me new accounts um they won't straightaway like post a very high risk high value listing usually i would think that it's like a sign of suspicious activity solin is the woman in charge of trust and safety issues at carousel her team uses a mix of artificial intelligence and automated technology to help detect and shut down any signs of suspicious activity so in 2020 we've deactivated about 50 000 accounts um this is to prevent bad actors from indiscriminately creating disposable accounts where they scam and move on scam and move on how successful has have these measures been over the course of 2020 we saw 67 drop in uh our fraud incident rate i don't really expect another huge spike like what we saw before but i think you know it'll not go away um in the early months we saw scams were around mass and sanitizers right and then during circuit breaker in april it's all about nintendo switch scan and playstation scan so as long as the next big thing is happening that's where the scammers are going to go to yes yes so the criminals have followed us into cyberspace and if there's one more thing we can gather from these numbers it's that while we love going online we love the great outdoors more than ever in fact we might be embracing this healthier lifestyle a little bit too hard nothing has turned our lives upside down like this pandemic since it began the only globetrotting i've done is on google earth tilt earth down whoa the only parties i've attended are virtual hello happy birthday thank you and all my meetings have been online wait a minute you see my virtual background also doesn't work so where's the silver lining in a survey commissioned by cna we're driving less we've also been taking public transport less on the other hand we've been doing more walking and cycling and 40 of us claim to be more active than ever before in 2019 singapore organized 116 races when the virus made such mass events impossible the runs went virtual and that's when running fever really hit virtual organizer 42 race saw the number of races in 2020 double compared to the previous year but what's the appeal of racing on your own for the most part virtual runs require participants to complete a certain distance by a specified date progress is recorded via gps tracking apps and devices with screenshots uploaded to the organizers as proof i'm meeting april chong a virtual race enthusiast since march 2020 she has taken part in more than 200 virtual races now she's teaching me how to prepare for one virtual run offers flexibility that uh you can get to choose uh your own venue your own time and your own distance then why the need to join a virtual run engine every day just run you know it's very motivating because if you set a goal that you want to do a certain distance then after that you complete it within your own targeted number of days it it feels good it all started um when i did a 5.5 kilometer over 55 days last year as in every day five point five kilometers yes i have to clock so it's like you know i've cut 40 days no i i have to finish 55 days so and then after that it became a habit so it's like right now morning if i don't start running it's just something's wrong yeah yeah like like no coffee you know so it's different from mass runs this one you're running by yourself don't you miss the social aspect of being with people everyone running together along like benjamin shows bridge and that kind of thing okay that's a different joy all together so if for those people who still likes to compete there's this leadership board and you can all track the runners you know who is first then you will run faster so what are the other benefits of virtual running um it builds up seminar you can start very uh short distance and then over a period of time if you can meet that and you get more motivated or you're more confident that you can do longer distance and then in the longer run you will get to want to do more things so let's get me started okay let's do [Music] this feel the sweat pouring down your face adrenaline pumping all through your veins deep feel ready at the start of the race time for glory push through the pain [Music] our new enthusiasm for running is also triggering a gold rush on running shoes so even as the economy is doing badly shoemakers are breaking it in decathlon singapore recorded a 41 increase in their running shoes sales between february and july in 2020 but what's all that physical activity doing to us knee slightly bent dr mizan avid cyclist and orthopedic surgeon gives us the bare bones truth 12. okay dr mizan was there any particular type of injury that you saw an increase in during or after the circuit breaker a lot of it was overuse injuries mostly of the shoulder and knee two of the most common exercises now in singapore are running and cycling so for running people are running further distances more regularly where they used to run 5 km a week they may now run 20 or 30. wow that's a huge jump ring your body is just not used to that to be overwhelmed with so much physical demand but we do see things like stress fractures as well and lots of long distance runners like marathon runners they have a lot of pain in their shins in the middle of your of your tibia right here okay and the way we we diagnose it is again from the history we know that they've suddenly ramped up their physical activity in a short period of time so stress fractures are just like tiny cracks in the bone tiny cracks tiny tiny tiny cracks enough to cause pain you don't need surgery so is this pandemic caused spike and injuries going to last we see different kinds of injuries right now we're all stuck in singapore alright no one's going on a holiday people are doing a lot of group exercises not just for the exercise but the social aspect of it but not everyone has the same physical level of physical fitness or ability just take it at your own pace if you have to slow down to catch your breath or to stretch so be it it's not a competition be it walking or running or cycling the pandemic has allowed us to embrace singapore's great outdoors forget the hot trendy new bars or restaurants national parks are now the hottest tickets in town 2020 saw nearly 50 000 people visit pulau bin nearly double the year before bugatima nature reserve drew more than twice its usual visitors hitting 75 000. wetland reserve saw numbers swell three times over to 33 000 [Music] and people aren't just enjoying green singapore they're also trying to nurture some nature back home in june 2020 anne parks announced plans to give away 150 000 packets of homegrown fruit and vegetable seeds the response was overwhelming they ended up handing out four hundred thousand packets instead in 2020 local facebook group urban farmers singapore also saw their membership grow by a third adding ten thousand new members why would a pandemic make urbanites like us grow green fingers [Music] all right jack jack young helps run urban farmers and he's a man who knows his peonies from his pansies i've got microgreens going this is this is red radish this is this is wasabi mustard yeah pinch of a whole bunch of it yeah thanks oh wow there it is wasabi yeah yeah so if you have a whole bunch of it yeah the kick just goes like straight through whoa and this is what you call organic rice yeah yeah yeah no pesticides so why do you think more and more people were picking up urban farming during the panama i think they had more time there's also the this thing about food security i could just come out harvest whatever i need go in and prepare dinner over here this is um rosemary um a mediterranean herb not easy to grow but we like it because my wife um does roasts like roast potatoes so it's chicken sometimes it goes with a steak oh yes oh don't make me hungry jack it's also therapeutic to just check out your plants so that that probably led to the increase so i mean apart from your corridor there's some greenery on other corridors as well you know have your neighbors caught on oh yes i started sharing like micro greens and just to encourage them to try and then from then on they moved up you know to to leafy vegetables and stuff so you planted the seeds in your neighbors so to speak and now they're wearing fruit yeah yeah in a way yes so this is broccoli this is broccoli yeah broccoli so this is this is the micro greens version basically seedlings you know [Music] do you think the interest in urban farming is here to stay so interest may wane you know um but there are those people who have found it fulfilling and definitely they are going to pursue this you know in the long term what are the effects of urban farming on us in the long run well definitely you see that there's a slight shift in the mindset you can actually grow crops within your house with technological advances things like grow lights hydroponic systems the authorities have taken notice of the needs of the people they have opened up lots of land for small scale urban farming which is which is really great while working from home has spurred some to take up home gardening others have clearly turned to home baking in singapore searches for the word baking usually rise just a little every christmas [Music] but in 2020 the searches spiked in early april after the circuit breaker was announced [Music] i'm heading to abc baking studio time to dust off my apron suit up and see if i have what it takes to bake it help we have a lot of first timer coming for our classes and why do you think there was this increase in demand currently a lot of people are working from home so they actually have more free time to explore their hobbies so yeah they come for baking classes you know out of all the different hobbies that we could do at home why baking baking is a skills that probably could bring them some side incomes so after baking they can actually sell their products rachel lowe picked up baking almost a year ago her baked goods however are for personal consumption only have you always been someone who bakes at home or is this something new to you well before a skit breaker i never thought of baking during the two months we actually stay at home so i have more time to make baking for me is actually therapeutic i should enjoy every single step of it i signed up for the whole cake course so i actually have plans to actually learn more techniques okay let's try what we have baked today yeah come here to try my medallions [Music] [Music] while kobe 19 has given us the opportunity to take up hobbies we wouldn't have done so otherwise i think it's safe to say that most of us want the pandemic to end as soon as possible and trust me if i could beat it out of this door i would with the vaccine roll out underway it seems like all the ingredients needed to end the pandemic are there [Music] if strict control measures in singapore hold up against new contagious strains most of us are unlikely to catch covet 19. [Music] but we still need to keep our hygiene habits up our stress levels low oh yeah and our emotions in check [Music] because if there is one thing the numbers have taught us it's this even if the virus itself doesn't make you sick watch out for the fallout from the pandemic because if we're not careful it may well be the fallout that will hurt us and that's why it matters ,True,False,False,False

5,7AzDyax1TeM,STAT,"Covid-19 vaccine side effects, explained",2021-03-15T16:19:18Z,"Vaccinations for Covid-19 are now underway in the U.S. Two vaccines – one from Pfizer and BioNTech, one from Moderna — have received emergency use authorizations by the Food and Drug Administration. Both vaccines have been deemed safe, but they can cause some short-term side effects. Vaccines are designed to invoke an immune response that builds protection without causing a serious infection. Traditionally, vaccines are made with viral material which prompts the immune system to mount a defense. This process releases chemicals that cause physical symptoms — such as pyrogens, which are inflammatory chemicals that can cause fever.",[Music] less than a year after the coronavirus pandemic took off vaccines for covert 19 have begun in the u.s these vaccines have been deemed safe by the fda but you can expect some side effects when you receive the shot many people will experience unpleasant flu-like symptoms and muscle aches this is normal it means your immune system is working many existing vaccines such as the flu shot and the measles mumps and rubella vaccine also cause similar side effects vaccines work by injecting an antigen into the body before the covert vaccine most antigens used in vaccines were made with viral material the antigens prompt the immune system to create immune cells the immune cells then target the antigen it is this process that releases inflammatory chemicals that can cause fevers and other symptoms in some people the immune system then remembers how to fight the virus if it is encountered again the mrna vaccines for cova-19 work differently instead of using actual viral material they inject the genetic instructions called mrna that instruct human cells to make the antigen in the case of sars cov2 the viruses spike protein but once the antigen is present the immune system treats it in the same way it would a vaccine made from viral material any side effects would be caused by the inflammatory chemicals produced by the immune cells targeting the antigen ultimately vaccines are authorized because the benefits of being vaccinated far outweigh the short term side effects they may cause vaccines for coven 19 can finally help end the pandemic that has infected over 17 million people and killed over 300 000 in the us alone ,True,False,False,False

© 2020 TheRightDoctors Knowledge Network. All rights reserved.",insights from the world's best medical minds you are watching the right doctors calm hello everyone I'm dr. Rajesh Upadhyaya and senior director and head of Gastroenterology at max super speciality hospital Delhi and you are listening to me on the right doctors comm which is India's leading medical knowledge platform I'm going to talk about eco vid 19 and gastrointestinal and liver effects Hakuba 19 has struck the world involving more than two hundred and twelve countries with more than 80 million cases as a debt of about half a million or more people worldwide and that's a huge epidemic we are dealing with at the moment and therefore it is very important to these days about how to manage ourselves and how to manage our patients in these difficult times Oh although it is very well known that over 19 is predominantly a respiratory infection causing fever cough and dyspnea with other features but I must say that the gastrointestinal and the liver effects have not received its due importance which it should have and recently the Journal of the Indian Medical Association had a big article on kovat 19 it's very little on the gastrointestinal and never affects and I wrote to them and they have published it in the May issue about the GI and the liver effects of Ovid 19 so such a huge pandemic we are dealing with we need to know about the GI effects and it has been seen and reported from various parts of the world that almost 30 to 50 percent of the patients with mid-nineteen have gastrointestinal manifestations such as anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea etc and out of all these clearly nausea and vomiting is very common but almost one-third of the patients who present with gastrointestinal symptoms have diarrhea as the main feature so diarrhea is common and sometimes it has been seen that diarrhea is the only manifestation and the initial manifestation even in patients who do not have any respiratory symptoms or any fever and there was a big report from Weehoo Han which is the epicenter of this pandemic that they looked at retrospectively on a large number of hospitalized patients and found that about 20 to 23 percent of the patients had GI symptoms more than 50% had a respiratory symptoms and the rest had both a combination of respiratory as well as GI symptoms so if you have a patient with diarrhea and a history of contact with over 19 patients and I think we must have a lower threshold for suspicion of this infection and we should do appropriate testing in addition to this it has certain implications because question is is there a fecal oral transmission of this condition and there has been reports from various parts world that almost 50% of hospitalized patients have equal sharing of the virus who they tested the fecal RNA and that was found to be positive for the virus even in those patients who did not have the respiratory positivity for the rt-pcr there for fecal shedding is definitely there it is slightly controversial as to whether it is amounts to infection transmission or just a fecal shedding but I think we must accept that he is two inhibitors for which the virus has a great affinity has been seen to be expressed in the gastro intestinal epithelium in addition to hepatocytes and equal NGO sites so clearly you have a binding over there and they can produce symptoms and patients with GI symptoms may have more severe disease and they may have longer shedding of the virus and may therefore require longer period of isolation what is the practical implication we are all talking about putting on a mask having physical distancing and washing our hands which is maintaining a hand hygiene but in addition to that I would like to emphasize on a couple of things more and that is that we should always close the lid or the cover of our toilet before flushing flushing causes an aerosol effect and can lead to infection in addition to all the standard measures remember to sanitize your toilet taps your handles toilet buttons etc so that is a very important area which has probably not been emphasized enough in addition I would like to point out another important point is that there are a large number of patients worldwide who are taking acid reducing drugs such as proton pump inhibitors and it is the acid in the stomach which kills the viruses so if you take the acid reducing drug you are probably increasing the chances of viral infection particularly covert 19 in these terms therefore the use of acid reducing drugs should be minimized wherever it is absolutely necessary now in addition to producing the symptoms there are a variety of as to intestinal conditions where it may be a more severe disease or they may be more severe manifestations of kovat 19 and these are particularly patients who are immunosuppressed or those who are on steroids or immunomodulatory agents and we have very commonly in our speciality patients with inflammatory bowel disease who are taking steroids and immunomodulatory agents and sometimes the biologics the biosimilars and therefore that is an area or that is a group of patients we have to be careful about now it is very important that such patients remain in remission during this time so whatever they are taking we encourage them to continue with that so that remission is maintained because if they have an exacerbation they are likely to be admitted in hospital exposing them to further retraction and we may have to modify their drugs accordingly so if they are on immunomodulatory drugs and if they have contracted over time in infection we need to probably stop the modulatory agents and delay the start of the biologics such as the autonomy map which we commonly use therefore these are some of the guidelines which has come in in view of this infection now let me come to the liver problems associated with coded infection and it has been seen that more than 50% of the patients with kovat 19 infection have the elevation of SC ot and tested PT to a mild or moderate extent severe the rise which is very high levels of enzymes mainly not severe covered 19 infections and in the last couple of weeks have seen patients who have really consulted with me with very simple symptoms like dr i i have lost my appetite and not feeling too well and I said can liver function test and they had moderate rise in SE OTS GPT we got the ultrasound done we got the viral screen done which is the standard one for ABC and he and they were all negative and some of these patients I must say who did undergo covert nineteen testing were found to be positive so rise in s UTS CPT may also be considered to be a manifestation of code 19 infection and most of these patients may have mild disease and recovered by themselves and they may not have a lot of medications to be given however there has been reports of acute hepatitis and this has come from the USA a typical viral type of hepatitis occurring in akavit 19 infection patient and we have ourself seen and have actually sent for publication at the moment case of a middle-aged lady who presented only with nausea and vomiting and was found to have severely deranged liver function test and features of acute liver failure and she turned out to be a cute on a chronic liver failure with acute renal failure or a hepatorenal syndrome and she actually succumbed to the disease within two or three days of hospitalization suggesting that this was a minute infraction we have sent this particular report for publication and awaiting response at the moment so liver is certainly an organ which can be affected not only affected but can have severe manifestations and particularly there are a certain group of patients such as those with fatty liver and patients with fatty liver usually have not only the fatty liver but the associated features of metabolic syndrome such as obesity diabetes hypertension etc which are all comorbidities where Kovach infection has serious consequences and therefore there are patients who have a high risk and they must be managed properly during these times in addition patients with autoimmune disease there are also another group of patients because they are taking steroids and immunomodulatory agents and they have to be maintained very carefully during this time so that they do not have any exacerbation of disease now patients with liver cirrhosis have got altered immunity they are immune deficient and they are at a higher risk of contracting and we have seen a number of agents who came in with decompensation of their liver disease and when investigated were found to have covered that infection so I think patients who got cirrhosis become decompensated please consider cobra 19 infection as well especially during this time another point I would like to put forward is the fact that particularly patients who has parts the decompensation develop ascites and we do a diagnostic or therapeutic tapping of such societies that there is a very high viral load in patients with to whoever is doing especially our younger colleagues these junior doctors we must ensure that they are wearing the entire PPE kit before they are doing the procedure and they are taking all the precautions so that is something which we have found out only recently and we are taking all precautions in our practice currently another group of patients are those who have had a liver transplant or are awaiting liver transplant and as of now most of our patients who are awaiting liver transplant we are avoiding any transplant currently unless they have a very short life span and those are the patients who are subjected to transplant currently so avoid transplantation currently because post transplant they will be receiving steroids and immunosuppressants and they are clearly a high risk patients and if you are going for a transplant you clearly need to check the kovat 19 status in such patients but not only in the patients but also in the donor and then proceed ahead so these are some of the liver and the gastrointestinal effects have been talking about that has been a huge number of papers from all over the world especially China and America and we have our self written a review article which is awaiting publication currently now in view of all this what have we learned and I think it is very important to emphasize to everyone what we have really learned and the most important thing is that particularly for our liver cirrhosis patients we make sure that they do not come to the hospital we certainly encourage daily consultation for them advice whatever test is required which they can get done either as a home collection or from their nearest lab and we take care of them because sub take them to the hospital environment increases their risk of developing the infection so tele consultation is something which we have learnt and I think it is there to stay because we have got I think at least the next couple of months if not more to deal and live with this infection now what else have we learned well during the covert times we have limited our endoscopic procedures because for example endoscopy is a aerosol generating procedure and we are clearly exposed to quarantine infection in such patients and therefore we use the entire precautions with the PPE killed masks the face shield and everything are before we do the procedure and we also decide very carefully as to who really needs the procedure and we are doing the procedure currently on patients who have got emergencies such as upper GI or lower GI bleeding or those who have got complete dysphasia with a malignant obstruction or something and and questions with perforation etc so we we try and charge and limit our procedures and when we do the procedures we take all the precautions in order to protect ourselves use the minimal manpower because that is also important we have had a large number of healthcare workers within the hospital who are now affected with Kovac 19 infection and we have to make sure that the department keeps running and we have to make sure that we use the minimum manpower for any infection so limit the procedures to wherever it is necessary otherwise we can certainly postpone it for a later date now what else have we learned I think the three most common problems for which I am getting tele consultations these days are acid reflux which is heartburn and and you know the water brash etc patients who have developed constipation during this period and patients who've got bloating abdominal bloating which is very common and these three and all of them are all lifestyle problems related to the lockdown where people who are stuck to their homes the exercise came here became less and probably the food intake also was not appropriate so what do we do simple things for patients with ger D what we advise well simple diet avoid fried foods and fatty food and take food which is at least 25% less than your appetite take it frequently but not never fill your tummy up and don't lie down in bed for about two hours after having your food and in addition to that we may require acid suppression drugs which we give as and when required patients with constipation again a few lifestyle problems are very pertinent they have to have plenty of fluids particularly in summer three to five liters of fluid plenty of high fiber food and plenty of exercise and all these three go a long way in addition we require simple laxatives which you prescribe as per the individual requirements and lastly patients with bloating and particularly in North India these days people take a lot of what we call the high Ford map food and high-fat map is basically fermentable carbohydrates which produce a lot of gas in the tummy and therefore causes bloating so the first advice should be that you go in for a low fodmap diet probably avoid min because a large percentage of Indians are latias deficient and if you're taking too much of milk it can produce a lot of gas avoid foods like pulses and beans and peas and there are vegetables such as cabbage cauliflower and ladyfinger and all these radish and all they can produce a lot of gas so alteration of the diet itself can provide a lot of relief in addition we provide sometimes the prokinetic drugs simple medications which increase the gut movement and therefore help so all in all I would like to say that we must be aware that gastrointestinal and liver problems are both very common in Kobe 19 patients and we must have a low threshold for suspicion of this infection in in appropriate patients we have to live with it we have to deal with it and I think we are learning as we go on because what we used to do has changed what we will do probably we also undergo such ease what are we nearly waiting for well like everyone else in the world we are waiting for the appropriate vaccine which can certainly prevent the disease protect ourselves but till then I think the basic rule applies to everyone protect yourself with your masks when you go to public places with physical distancing and I don't call it social distancing because socially we are all connected we are connected with the telephone with whatsapp messages internet etc but physically we have to be separate even when we are getting together we have to keep the distance and most important I think particularly from gastroenterologist point of view is they had the hygiene and there are very clear methods of how to clean your hands and you require at least 20 to 30 seconds for that which has all be promoted and you know they it has been disseminated widely by the World Health Organization and whenever I have a webinar or whatever program giving I keep repeating that because people need to know about it thank you very much for your patient listening and I would like to thank everyone this Thanks insights from the world's best medical minds you are watching the right doctors calm you ,True,True,False,False

https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nmsc/vos-x-msc-navigating-the-pandemic-webinar-highlights/",[Music] good morning everyone thank you for the introduction and for the opportunity to be here today to talk to you about covet 19 and children i'm very excited to talk about this um because a lot of things have been happening in the last one year and especially the last one month i'm going to talk about the clinical impact of covet 19 on children the collateral damage that the pandemic has brought a little bit about the infodemic and then lastly covet 19 vaccine and just i would touch very lightly on variants as well because i know people are interested to hear about that so misc is something called the multi-inflammatory syndrome in children and in other countries it's called in europe it's called pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome and this is essentially a syndrome that's been reported in the u.s europe india various other countries not so much in southeast asia and this happens in previously healthy children slightly older around the 10 age short of a range and this happens about one month after they've recovered from covert 19 infections so when they have covered 19 infection about one month later all the way up to two three four five months later they can develop the syndrome where they come in very ill with fever very lethargic irritable and primarily tummy problems so they get diarrhea vomiting tummy pain not so much coughing or blocked nose and these children tend to be fairly sick which means that more than half of them end up in intensive care they get multi-organ failure primarily involving the heart and two percent of them will die from misc there was a small cohort at great ormond street hospital in london where they looked at the six months follow-up of these children and actually at six months many of these kids were still not fully recovered so many of them still had fatigue and muscle weakness and still needed ongoing physiotherapy and rehab so this is something that we have not seen in singapore and not in southeast asia but obviously singapore has a very international population and we are on the lookout for this for children who have had coveted infection the shadow pandemic right so the collateral damage that has happened um as a result of covet 19 and one of the large collateral damage areas is mental health i think first of all the diagnosis of having the infection in itself is extremely stressful children will feel shame they feel stigma there's bullying i had one teenager who had eggs thrown at her front door by her neighbors when they found out that she had covert 19 infection her friends in school stopped talking to her um she was bullied and you know people would cross the road when they saw her on one side of the road and these were effects that um happened very early on um in her infection when she was still in hospital she tried to stay off social media during her time in singapore because it's in hospital so that she wouldn't see all these comments that were going on from her friends and it can really affect um their self-esteem uh in their mood when children are diagnosed with covet-19 they are isolated for a long period of time at the beginning of the pandemic some children were isolated for four to six weeks now it's shorter it's probably more around three weeks but it is a very long stressful time for them during which time they have multiple swabs the people that they see are all dressed in full ppe and they don't really get to touch anyone there's very little direct contact and it's very stressful for them in singapore we saw the same thing so in singapore there was a reduction in all the vaccination rates during circuit breaker last year this was more obvious in the private clinics than the poly clinics and then hospital had a least disruption and this was most significant for mmr and mmr and chickenpox vaccines which kind of ranged from sort of 25 to 73 percent um in terms of the vaccine rates and these for unvaccinated children are obviously at risk of infection uh measles is likely to reappear when travel resumes and if these unvaccinated children don't have catch-up vaccines then the potential is that there may be a measles outbreak within singapore and why was vaccination disrupted um so they looked at the reasons uh and actually number one was people were afraid of getting infected so people didn't want to go to clinics they didn't want to go to hospitals they were also restricted because there were travel and movement restrictions they were not able to access healthcare because the hospitals and clinics said well come only if it's absolutely necessary and of course their priority changed right so the priority really was to stay away don't get covered um you know let's not worry about the routine vaccinations yet but to be honest within singapore routine childhood immunization has always been an essential health service even during circuit breaker so i think this is now the time to think of our children we have a lot of adult experience with vaccines from singapore other countries showing worldwide safety there's real world efficacy in israel and qatar for the uk and south african variants we do need more data on that but generally the vaccine for variants may be slightly less effective to prevent infection but will likely still prevent severe illness and death and really the fact that we see more variants just reflects the surge in our community cases and that's something that we would like to avoid all right so i think we're all really hoping that we can move at some point from phase three to phase four and that will require everyone's cooperation and help to comply with all the measures as well as vaccination so i would like to thank everybody for really being very good so far and very compliant in helping to get us there [Music] besides the covet 19 pandemic there is a pandemic of fear and as you heard from dr chan there is also um info pandemic or inferdemic so friend from the world health told me that if there are two pandemics running together the word is actually syndemic s-y-n-d-e-n-i-c a synthetic more than one pandemic and this pandemic of fear today is initially was a pandemic of the virus the fear of the virus but now there's fear as you read through the social media the fear of the vaccines the complications the side effects so all these memories are stored in the partner brain called the hypocampus it's a small part of the brain you put a finger just above your head and starting the top here you'll touch the part of the brain called the hypocampus that stores in all your memory and and this part of the brain is near to a part of the brain called the limbic system that modulates your mood so they feel very very happy the neuroscience of singing you see that uh singing calls a a elation of a mood but also this this kind of music uh a singing itself that stirred up to only memory improves concentration we'll talk about that in our research but there's a search of chemicals in our brain we call dopamine and oxytocin and these chemicals the cell lifts up our mood and gives us a sense of well-being you see in this this uh a brain scan called the pet scan the red area is area where there is increased glucose uptake that means the this part of the brain which is the back of the brain is working uh very hard now so even if you're watching this webinar and you're looking at your laptop your computer and if you do a brain scan now this part of the brain the back of your brain will be lighting up because in fact my image the image of this of the slide or image of the speakers is at the back of your brain and so this part of the brain works very very hard so this brain here is the brain of someone with early dementia so you see although it's dementia not all part of the brain has decayed or declined but certain parts are still functioning quite well so in music reminiscence we often like to stir up the part of the brain to increase the the glucose uptake and also increase the neuroplasticity that stirred up more brain cells around here so this is the the basis of some of the research we're doing there are a few other things that you must must remember i want to run through with you um the thing first thing is the new norm you have heard of from dr chan uh also about the new norm that he must acknowledge there is a there is a change in our lifestyle now and so he got to put on mass uh social distancing vaccination the second point which uh dr chan has emphasized on is the information and we have so much thing but inundated and she and i'm i'm glad it's the new word called info dammit now and there's so much things and sometimes there are wrong news or fake news someone asked me what do you which one do you look to i i still look to the ministry of hell website and that particular person's size and well there may be a few missteps in the ministry of health website but in general there are good people down there giving us information and also important to have exercise regular exercise so you see this group of people they belong to a numbers group they go kind of exercising they wear they put on masks and this this little this space here below here this beautiful uh picture uh someone asked me i gave a talk to some doctors and they asked me have you been to switzerland switzerland recently it's a beautiful picture i said no this is in the botanic gardens i took a picture of the botanic gardens this picture was taken 40 years ago when i first came to work in singapore in 1981 i went to botanic garden and i had a crack of dawn and it was a beautiful scene it's not far from the but from the uh the rainforest and fourthly you must think of your diet so if you have you have anxiety you cannot sleep don't go and drink alcohol and it makes it worse because it it affects your sleep architecture in fact it affects your sleep pattern and in fact last last uh last week i have some students who asked me can i have can i prescribe from sleeping pills for them because they cannot sleep then and ask them why is that how come you're not sleeping well that well we're having an exam and we're going to study and um i've been drinking about four or five cups of coffee at night obviously you cannot sleep so the diet is very very important and then some form of relaxation we call it mindfulness practice you're not too familiar with it you can check the the apps the app called mind5 mind five um it's free you can go into it uh this is the important study because many people told me that well why should i do all this kind of relaxation this mindfulness is what is about mindfulness what is evidence based now the good news is uh we often hear a lot of bad news the last last two years now the good news is the the mind science center has published the first study in the world in which we have brain scan of people doing uh mindfulness the seniors doing mindfulness practice and the person who introduced this is our our late friend mr we sinto now of course number six is recreational activities a singing is something you must do all the time uh gardening is a paper published uh by angela sia from end parts and also art also by professor mahindran from the national mine science center so all these things you you can do we have a friend in australia called mr um boon you uh is his maroon or trap in sydney and cannot come back and every morning you'll take the nice pictures of the sea the seashore the booming of the breakers in the in the city and send it to us so photography is also interesting and finally uh most important i think is the social capital you know social capital of people who can take care of you when you are in in a when you are very isolated so these are the group of the namaste people if they form a group they've been walking now they begin to care for one another in a pandemic some of the people this group are widows and widowers and others would ring them and say can we can we buy the the mask for you or can i take the medicine for you so there's a lot of the community uh social connectedness which i think is very very important for everyone i think so it builds up a sense of compassion and a care for all of you [Music] it's so wonderful to see everyone today and thank you so much for coming i'm very excited to be sharing a little bit about um singing today and you know we just heard wonderful things about uh from dr chan and professor khoa on the technical aspects of the situation right now in in the world and which is has been brought great light to and been so informative to us and so what i'd like to bring and share with you today is actually um the artistic aspect to singing and why singing is so relevant to us and what makes singing so special compared to any other art form so i i i will be doing some uh physical movements as well so just expect some to move a little bit today but we are not going to be i'm going to be um trying my best to finish my slides today okay so before we begin i i'd like to share with you the four things that we'll be talking about why singing what aspects of singing help the most so that you are aware of what to look up for when you are singing and what do i do with my voice if for those who are singing for the first time or who have no idea how to sing or how to start these are some pointers and also some future singing opportunities to explore so writing on uh what professor just said on the seven habits we'll we will also be giving you seven habits of effective singers and i'm going to be breezing through because i'm wary of time so you might want to snap pictures of the slides if you uh if you would like to remember some of the points more so in a nutshell about a bit about what i do for those who have not seen me before i'm a conductor and composer artistic director of voices of singapore and my biggest passion in my life lies in bringing communities together so a lot of the work that i do is centered around voices of singapore we have many many different groups and i do a lot of lecture work around the region as well at voices of singapore we have professional and amateur groups community audition and non-audition groups everyone just comes together to sing because they love it we also work with professor quiet he shared on the dementia prevention and these are some of our participants in red and we have a choir for children with special needs called the starlight music making program so with all these every year we actually have a voices of singapore festival that we bring together 10 000 people from all walks of life at chimes hall in three days and we just sing you know and it's just the most amazing experience when everyone comes together to sing with no agenda no competition and just having fun you might have seen some of our projects home virtual choir that we did last year during the circuit breaker and also our spaces at capital theater where we have most of our rehearsals so i'm going to go mo straight into the first topic or the first question why singing and i like to bring an artistic perspective to this with a quote that means everything to me singing can heal the wounds that medicine cannot touch and this means so much to me because we sing when we are at periods of heightened emotion we sing when we are at our lowest points we sing when we are together with friends we sing and we can feel this extra level of communication that transcends speech because songs are able to capture something that goes beyond what we would normally be able to articulate in our rational logical minds i would tell somebody to say hey don't fret there is hope or i would sing the person a song if i were to say uh sing a song to the lyrics of somewhere over the rainbow way up high there's a land that i heard of once in a lullaby it makes no sense at all without the music but with the sound of my voice i'm able to pull emotions out that naturally create uh physical release of emotion i'm gonna demonstrate to you with this text [Music] [Music] that release of text and emotions really help to bring an extra level of imagination hope and motivation to the listener and that is why singing really makes uh such a different uh messaging to the person who is listening to it and also to the person who is singing it now we go to the next topic which aspects of singing help us the most right which is it the mouth that knows or is it the way i am uh moving or what is like the actual aspect of singing that help us the most and i'm just going to pinpoint this to a very specific two aspects a key skill in singing is learning to focus on controlling your rate of breathing and this activates part of the brain that are linked to emotion so if everybody would join me to do this gesture we're just going to relax with by stretching outwards and then we are going to make a sigh with just this ah in a nice light sound okay so join me now and let's take a deep breath from your mouth and nose breathe in stretch upwards as much as you can inside [Music] very good let's do this one more time and breathe in and side now for those who are singing for the first time this sound that you make might might feel very strange it might feel like there is is nothing to do with your speaking voice but it actually releases a lot within you and you can already feel that emotional release just by making the sound and breathing deeply into your body so the sounds made by our voices actually allow freedom of emotions which words cannot express so i'd like to do another um another example for you where we were always looking to tomorrow for for um for a brighter day for uh to to look towards the period of postcovid so i would say tomorrow tomorrow i love you tomorrow you're only a day away right in the most dramatic sense but when i sing it suddenly something very special appears on my face that is much more accessible and natural and this is the song of the lyrics from the musical annie i'm going to sing that instead of say that to you and i want you to realize what happens on my face tomorrow tomorrow [Music] okay so naturally the expressions and facial emotions the body really feels a lot more connected to the sound and therefore emotions are being able to be released in a much more organic and natural sense which speech and sharing thoughts will never be able to match up to so when your mood is up naturally you strengthen your immune system and you respond to stress factors in a more positive way and you enhance sleep patterns life is a song so let's sing it together as a community from all of us at vos thank you so much for attending our webinar a huge thanks to professor kwa and also dr chan thank you everybody [Music] ,True,True,False,False

For more than 75 years, CBC News has been the source Canadians turn to, to keep them informed about their communities, their country and their world. Through regional and national programming on multiple platforms, including CBC Television, CBC News Network, CBC Radio, CBCNews.ca, mobile and on-demand, CBC News and its internationally recognized team of award-winning journalists deliver the breaking stories, the issues, the analyses and the personalities that matter to Canadians.",you're sending us a lot of questions about the vaccine and by far of all the viewer questions i'm getting the most common one is go something like i'm allergic to blank xyz can i get this vaccine well i can't answer that personally but we've brought in for you someone who can i'd like to introduce you to clinical immunologist and allergist dr zainab abdul rahman who is also an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at mcmaster university that's in hamilton she's in toronto for us this morning doctor welcome to our program thank you for having me are you getting anything in your practice similar to what we're getting here in our in our team all these questions about can i get this vaccine because of my allergies absolutely we're getting a lot of that i think every allergist across the country is getting that question right now well so you've been thinking about this and you're just the person to have on the program health canada on the weekend put out this new guidance saying that anyone who is allergic to any of the ingredients in this pfizer biontech vaccine should not get the shot so you are supposed to consult the component parts of the vaccine but even if you look at those that doesn't mean you necessarily as a layperson understands so help us understand this can we start with the medicinal ingredient first the mrna this new messenger rna what do we know about allergies there so typically you actually don't have allergies to mrna although it's new to have it in a vaccine form um we actually are exposed to mrna some of the viruses actually whenever they do infect you they actually have mrna that's produced and then that's how they produce their own proteins within your body so you're actually exposed to mrna from viruses um generally when you catch infections or other pathogens so that's not unusual for you to be exposed to it's just a different way of us delivering it in a vaccine so that's interesting because they haven't used it before in this way i wondered if we would even know that we were allergic to it in a vaccine form and people often wonder if the mrna can affect their dna so the way it works in terms of dna and rna is it's actually more of a one-way procedure so you have your dna and then you produce mrna from dna and then the mrna makes proteins so when it's in your body it's going to be used to make a protein and then your body is going to make antibodies to that protein it doesn't go backwards it doesn't incorporate into your dna and afterwards actually that mrna degrades because mrna is not very stable and that's actually why there's so many requirements about how we keep it in terms of the vaccine to keep it stable because it actually will degrade so it will not go back it will not get incorporated into your dna it's not going to change you forever okay that's a that's a good thing to know as well although not specifically allergy related so let's come back to so the only medicinal ingredient is that mrna but there are other non-medicinal ingredients that we're going to pull up and take a look if you could go through some of those because again a lc and all of those numbers i mean a lot of that i don't understand on this list what is the most important thing that you think we should focus on there so on this list um the only one uh ingredient on this list that has actually been associated with allergic reactions in the past is the polyethylene glycol and so you can see that in the middle of that alc0159 and that has actually been shown to be a very rare allergy but there are a small portion of patients who may be allergic to this this allergy is very rare but people who have it are very aware because it actually is something we're commonly exposed to so those patients with an allergy to this are well known typically to their allergists already so what would be well how would you be commonly exposed to in what where else would you find this so polyethylene glycol is actually found in a lot of medication formulations it's used to stabilize a lot of medications in addition it's the primary ingredient in many laxatives so if you've ever had um you know occasional constipation and used um something like peg 3350 or laxaday or if you have taken common medications such as tylenol so common formulations of tylenol including the liquid form and the adult tablet form both contain polyethylene glycol and i believe that's one of the most commonly used medications across the country okay so you will know if you are an allergic and that is one thing to watch for as we bring up that list again there are sodium salts i guess and sucrose and things that you say are not of particular concern but as we look at but people who have the questions that i'm getting who have food allergies doctor who have egg allergies who have environmental allergies is there anything on that list that that jumps out at you that could be worrisome no none of these ingredients are plant proteins or food proteins so as much as you see this list what i think is important for all the patients who have allergies out there is what is not on this list there's no common foods in this list okay there's no egg in here there's no milk we don't have any concerns because there's no food proteins in this formulation there's no grass or environmental allergens in here there's no instant insect stinging venoms in here so and there's no common medications in here so there's no penicillin there's no antibiotics and so that is actually more important is what's not on the list rather than the list because of the whole list the only thing that can that has been shown of concern is polyethylene glycol which is very rare for an allergy but the things that are not is what's important for the allergy sufferers so the common things that you're worried about in terms of your foods environmental allergens like pollens or dust mates venoms all of those and common medications are not on this list so that's good news uh indeed to find that now a reassuring too so let me just ask one other thing because in addition to the specific recommendations for people who are allergic to ingredients they should not take this vaccine for now there was also guidance saying that anyone who has experienced a severe allergic reaction to another vaccine drug or food to speak with their doctor before they go ahead so what constitutes a severe allergic reaction and what kind of a time frame do we have to consider here so typically severe allergic reactions are actually very quick they're mediated by an antibody that causes very quick reactions so typically when we're talking about it we're talking about having a reaction for 30 to 60 minutes that involves multiple aspects of your body so it could involve dropping blood pressure breathing problems swelling so it affects multiple parts of the body very quickly after exposure so that's a severe allergy and the reason is they just want you to have an open conversation to make sure that you are not one of the people who have that rare allergy and just to make sure that people have an opportunity to discuss this with a trusted healthcare provider okay but generally speaking for example i'm somebody who was very allergic i just used my own experience food allergies smallpox vaccine but when i was very very young i mean if if we're looking at adult population right now getting this vaccine is that do you have to think back to when you were a child in terms of whether you are a potential risk and should be discussing this with your doctor even now so the key is really um it's about current allergies so we know that you can actually outgrow allergy so there's many people who are previously allergic to some foods who are no longer or who reacted to another vaccine the components of this vaccine are actually unlike any of the other vaccines a lot of times these are kind of put out out of the abundance of caution but we know that the people who are at risk are really those who have an allergy or anaphylaxis to a prior dose of this vaccine or one of the issues with one of the ingredients listed here namely that polyethylene glycol okay so it's at the end of this conversation i'm feeling reassured is that the right impression we should be reassured about this you should be to be honest having allergies does not really put you at higher risk of concern with this vaccine people who were in the studies also had allergies the only people who were excluded were those who had anaphylaxis or allergy to one of the components in the past but otherwise people with regular allergies food medications etc were in the studies and we did not see an increased signal for reactions so you should feel very comforted in terms of getting this vaccine the only concerns are if you've had prior anaphylaxis to acquire dose as this is a two-dose vaccine or if you've had an allergy or anaphylaxis to one of the components for which the main one that has been associated with allergy is polyethylene glycol i'm going to keep this conversation on tape and replay it for all of our viewers who have questions about this thanks so much for all of the time and for helping us navigate what is asked about so frequently thank you thank you dr zainab abdulrahman who is in toronto for us this morning but associated with mack in hamilton ,True,False,False,False

CORONAVIRUS COVID 19 VACCINE:
The coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is safe and effective. It gives you the best protection against coronavirus.

The NHS is currently offering the COVID-19 vaccine to people most at risk from coronavirus. For the most up to date list please visit the NHS link above.

The NHS will let you know when it's your turn to have the vaccine. It's important not to contact the NHS for a vaccination before then.

CORONAVIRUS COVID 19 VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS:
Most side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are mild and should not last longer than a week, such as:
• A sore arm where the needle went in
• Feeling tired
• A headache
• Feeling achy
• Feeling or being sick

You can take painkillers, such as paracetamol, if you need to.

If you have a high temperature you may have coronavirus or another infection. Please remember you cannot get COVID 19 from the COVID 19 vaccine however you may have caught COVID 19 prior or after your vaccine date.

CORONAVIRUS COVID 19 SYMPTOMS:
If you have any of the main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), get a test as soon as possible. Stay at home until you get the result.

The main symptoms of coronavirus are:
• A high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
• A new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
• A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal

Most people with coronavirus have at least 1 of these symptoms. If your symptoms get worse or you are worried, call 111

ALLERGIC REACTIONS:
Tell healthcare staff before you are vaccinated if you've ever had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis - symptoms on video).

You should not have the vaccine if you've ever had a serious allergic reaction to:
• A previous vaccine
• An anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredients in the COVID 19 vaccine. Please find ingredients list: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca
• A previous dose of the same COVID-19 vaccine
• Some medicines, household products or cosmetics

the pfizer biontech covert 19 vaccine   this week's video as i promised we're going to be 
looking at the oxford astrazeneca COVID 19 vaccine   you guys have sent loads of requests to do a 
video on this topic from my previous post where   i was getting the vaccine and also my purse whilst 
i've been involved in the covered vaccine clinics   so in this week's video we're going to be looking 
at the evidence all about the covered vaccine   we're going to be talking about how it works 
we're going to be talking about side effects   we're going to be talking about who should get it 
who shouldn't get it and also everything we know   about the COVID 19 vaccine so far and having it 
during pregnancy and loads loads more now before   we begin i just want to make you all aware that 
this video was filmed on the 23rd of january 2021   therefore all the information in this video is 
up today on this day however this information   is most likely going to change in the future so 
the best way for you to stay up to date is to   always speak to your healthcare professional and 
also visit the nhs and who website all about the   COVID 19 vaccine i will leave links to it in the 
description below so just stay up to date with it   okay so let's begin with the first topic how does 
the oxford astrazeneca COVID 19 vaccine actually   work well to help us understand this we first need 
to understand how the actual COVID 19 virus works   and then we'll be able to understand it a lot 
better so i'm going to try and simplify it   to the best of my ability so to begin with we have 
the COVID 19 virus and it has on the outside what   we call spike proteins now these spike proteins 
help it connect or attach to your healthy cells   so once the spike proteins have stuck to your 
healthy cells the COVID 19 virus is able to pull   itself into those healthy cells and take over this 
is otherwise known as an infection now the problem   is the COVID 19 virus is very good at not getting 
caught it's very good at being able to hide inside   those cells which means it's difficult for your 
body to find it and kill it and get rid of it so   this means that the virus is able to use the tools 
within your healthy cell to multiply and replicate   and once it does this it's then able to go and 
infect more healthy cells now the problem is   it takes a bit of time for your immune 
system to notice this virus but once it does   it starts to build defence proteins which we 
call antibodies now these antibodies are then   able to stop these spike proteins that we just 
spoke about from sticking to more healthy cells   now on top of that your antibodies can also send 
signals to immune cells called t cells t cells are   able to then come along and gobble up the virus 
so it's no longer able to attack your healthy   cells that we just spoke about they can also 
send signals to other immune cells to come   over and help us to get rid of this virus okay 
so you now have a brief understanding of how the   covid 19 virus works which is great because it's 
going to be really easy for you to understand how   the oxford astrazenica covered 19 vaccine works 
so in short this vaccine contains a dead virus   shell think of it as an empty eggshell for example 
without the egg white or the egg yolk in it this   dead virus shell is called an adenovirus now there 
is decades of research on using adenoviruses to   help us with vaccines and to deliver whatever we 
want to put inside them within your healthy cells   now for the oxford astrazenica covid 19 vaccine 
what we put inside this adenovirus so inside that   empty eggshell that we just spoke about is a small 
bit of genetic code from the covid 19 virus that   genetic code is the part which teaches well which 
uses the healthy cells to make the spike proteins   that we just spoke about so them spike proteins 
that are needed to attach to your healthy cells   so your healthy cells are able to read the COVID 
19 genetic code that we've used in the vaccine   to produce those spike proteins that we spoke 
about earlier so your body is creating those   spike proteins it says here you go look at these 
proteins immune system and make me some antibodies   and make me some t cells which we just spoke 
about which means that we're not waiting for   that lag period we're not waiting for your 
body to learn how to fight against COVID 19.   we are creating the actual antibodies and the 
t cell so they're ready they are ready to fight   they're floating around in your bloodstream 
so then if you do get infected with COVID 19   hopefully your symptoms are going to be very minor 
and you're easily going to fight it off so i hope   that made sense but i know what you're thinking 
you're probably now thinking well what happens to   that dna and what happens to that adenovirus well 
the good news is it takes a couple of days and   your body breaks them both down and gets rid of it 
so don't be worried about it also the adenovirus   as you if you remember what i said about earlier 
is it's a dead virus shell so it can't replicate   it can't really do anything and it can't cause 
you any harm please remember as well the dna the   genetic code bit that we're actually using from 
the covid 19 virus is just the bit that we need   for the spike proteins so it's not the entire 
genetic code to infect you with covid 19 so you   cannot get covert 19 from the oxford astrazeneca 
COVID 19 vaccine okay so in this part of the video   i want to talk about the research and the clinical 
trials done on the oxford astrazeneca COVID   19 vaccine this is going to be really factual 
i'm going to keep it brief but please remember   this is real science in action so it's going to 
be some great stuff also if you are looking for   some specific information in this video i am 
aware this is going to be a really long video   i am going to chapter it in the description below 
so if you're looking for some specific information   feel free to click on that description and click 
on wherever you want to go now let's begin so the   initial trials involved 24 000 people of different 
age gender ethnicity and race these were done in   the uk brazil and south africa which is great 
to see because it's such a broad population   that you're using which is really important 
in clinical trials there are also still trials   happening within the united states japan kenya 
and india which is great to know that we're still   getting updated by scientists across the world 
on the oxford astrazeneca COVID 19 vaccine now   here's the fun bit to measure the effectiveness of 
the oxford astrazeneca COVID 19 vaccine scientists   measured how many antibodies were produced against 
the spike proteins that we spoke about earlier   now after the first dose of the COVID 19 
vaccine scientists found a high amount of   antibody production which is great news but here's 
the better bit so even up until the second dose   scientists found that their antibodies were still 
high which means that even after the second dose   you're going to have even more antibodies that you 
had in the first place now what does this mean a   high amount of antibody production well in theory 
if you have a high amount of antibody production   in theory it's going to mean longer protection 
against the COVID 19 virus however this is still   being researched so please watch this space 
and finally 11 000 people within the phase   three clinical trials of the oxford astrazeneca 
COVID 19 vaccine showed that this vaccine has a   70.4 percent efficacy against developing covid 19 
symptoms now it is important to note that we still   don't know whether the oxford astrazeneca COVID 19 
vaccine will protect everyone from getting ill or   everyone from getting serious illness from covid 
19 we also don't know how long the protection will   last so whether it's going to need a booster dose 
so you're going to need more doses in the future   and we also don't know whether the COVID 19 
virus will mutate or change with time and if   any updates need or any changes are needed which 
is why scientists are constantly monitoring this   and checking it to stay on top okay so now let's 
move on to how do you get the oxford astrazeneca   covered 19 vaccine how is it administered well 
it's an injection it's intramuscular and it's in   the deltoid right over here when you've had your 
first dose you don't need to wait 15 minutes to   check for allergies or anything like that this is 
different to the pfizer biontech COVID 19 vaccine   however if you are going to drive you should 
ideally wait 15 minutes before you drive if   you want to go home straight away it's preferable 
that you get someone else to pick you up to drop   you off and take you home basically the second 
dose of this vaccine is given at least 28 days   from the first dose it's a two dose vaccine 
similar to the fizer one as well which is a two   dose one so now let's talk about who can get the 
COVID 19 vaccine if you're based here in the uk   please remember the COVID 19 vaccine is free of 
charge on the nhs available to anyone who wants it   now obviously there is a rollout plan for it and 
a high priority groups will be going first this   is going to be changing often so the best thing 
i'd advise everyone to do is click on the nhs   link which i'm going to leave in the description 
below and stay up to date with it so the nhs is   currently offering the oxford astrazeneca COVID 19 
vaccine to those at most risk of COVID 19. so what   i'm going to do is i'm going to leave a little box 
here somewhere with that list of people who are   the first ones who are the most at risk who are 
able to get the vaccine now but please remember   this list will be growing it's going to get 
wider and wider with time the joint committee of   vaccination and immunization which is called jvci 
for sure these are the people who are really smart   and they advise us on who to do first who are the 
most at risk but they will constantly be changing   this please also remember that the nhs will let 
you know when it's your turn for your COVID 19   vaccine they will be in touch with you please 
don't bother contacting your gp surgeries who are   already super busy about the covered vaccine there 
is an order the jvci have determined that order   and your surgery will be in touch with you they 
have not forgotten about you they will be in touch   with you and on an even more serious note there 
have been quite a few scams happening recently   with regards to the COVID 19 vaccine people are 
being calls out of the blue from unknown numbers   pretending to be the nhs asking for money and 
personal details to get the COVID 19 vaccine   please do remember this is a scam the nhs will 
never charge for the COVID 19 vaccine this is   always going to be free please don't give out any 
of your personal detail and hang up the phone if   anyone calls you with this scam so next up we 
have who cannot get the oxford astrazeneca COVID   19 vaccine so currently if you have a severe 
allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to   any of the ingredients in this vaccine you should 
not be getting it now if you're wondering about   those ingredients i am going to leave a full list 
in the description below so please check it out   also if your first dose of the oxford astrazeneca 
COVID 19 vaccine has caused a severe anaphylactic   reaction or a severe allergic reaction of any sore 
your second dose should not be the same vaccine   and you will have to discuss this with your health 
care professional another set of people who should   avoid getting this COVID 19 vaccine currently 
include pregnant women and those who are 18   and under however this information may change 
with time and i'm going to talk about this in   more detail after the next point and please do 
remember if you currently have COVID 19 or if   you're recovering from COVID 19 please do not go 
and get your vaccine until you're fully recovered   if you're unsure about this at all please contact 
your health care professional and speak to them   but the last thing that we want you to do is 
to go to these vaccination centers these hubs   wherever you go and end up spreading COVID 
19 to other people so if you're unsure at all   please speak to your healthcare professional okay 
so now let's move on to pregnancy and let's talk   some science you're probably aware that a lot 
of vaccines can be given safely during pregnancy   so the question is why are you now being advised 
not to get the COVID 19 vaccine right now during   pregnancy well to be quite honest with you it's 
very simple the COVID 19 vaccine has not yet been   tested in pregnancy this means that until more 
information more research is available on this   those who are pregnant should not routinely get 
the COVID 19 vaccine now please remember though   the evidence from non-clinical studies of the 
oxford astrazenica covid19 vaccine have raised   no concerns about its safety in pregnancy so 
non-clinical evidence is required before any   clinical studies can be done during pregnancy 
to check its safety so this is usual protocol   that until you have that information to avoid 
the vaccine avoid COVID vaccine during pregnancy   until we have more information on them 
clinical studies are done so please   remember these facts and this is usual protocol 
it's nothing different to what we usually do   there's no evidence that the COVID 19 vaccine is 
unsafe during pregnancy but basically we just need   more information and we need more research on it 
until we can recommend it routinely for patients   unfortunately there's a lot of misinformation on 
this topic so i really hope this information helps   now in the uk the jvci currently recommend two 
situations where you may be able to get the COVID   19 vaccine during pregnancy the first one is if 
your occupation puts you at a higher risk of COVID   19 and the second one is if you have any health 
complications or conditions that could put you at   higher risk of having complications from getting 
COVID 19. now in terms of breastfeeding there's   currently no data on the safety of the COVID 19 
vaccine on breastfeeding or breastfed infants   despite this the covid 19 vaccine is not thought 
to be a risk to breastfed infants and the benefits   of breastfeeding is very well known now because of 
this the jvci has recommended that the vaccine can   be given to those who are breastfeeding this is 
in line with the information given in the usa and   by the who and once again please do remember that 
this video was filmed on the 23rd of the 1st 2021   all the information i'm giving you 
today is up today on this date however   this information can change with time as we get 
more research and we find out more information   so the best thing you should always do is speak 
to your healthcare professional and also visit   the nhs and who website the links i'm going to 
leave in the description below to stay up to date   okay so i hope you're still with me i hope 
you're still enjoying the content i find this   information helpful if you are make sure to watch 
that like button just to show that you're enjoying   the content and you're finding it helpful now 
let's talk about the side effects of the oxford   astrazeneca COVID 19 vaccine first of all the 
side effects are very similar to other vaccines   the main side effect is the sore arm i know 
i had a sore arm i had a sore on for about   three to four days afterwards same with my 
friends same with my colleagues and that   was probably the main side effect the other 
side effects to be aware of as well however   is that it can cause a temperature which can last 
for about 48 hours a bit of a fever this is normal   you can also have a bit of a headache you can feel 
a bit tired you might feel a bit nauseous you can   have a few aches and pains in in your joints and 
muscles these are all normal and they will go away   now so far people aged over 65 have reported 
the fewest side effects also it's important to   remember when you get your first dose there might 
be a bit of redness a bit of swelling for a couple   of days but this should go but please do let your 
healthcare professional know when you're going   for your second dose how it was if you experienced 
any side effects that's really useful for them to   know as well please remember as well when you get 
your second dose of the oxford astrazeneca COVID   19 vaccine you're less likely to have the side 
effects again now if you're struggling with any   of these minor side effects such as the fever 
or the aches and the pains then you can take   over-the-counter analgesia if it's required such 
as paracetamol or ibuprofen but always speak to   your healthcare professional first before you take 
any medication this is super important and always   read that information leaflet that comes with 
the medication these are both super important   just to make sure that you're safe and suitable 
to take the medication because your safety   is the most important thing now another thing i'd 
like to mention to you is something called the   yellow card reporting scheme this is something 
that we've been doing for many years in the uk   and we do it for all medicines new ones old ones 
whichever you can fill out a yellow card report   for them talking about any side effects 
or problems you had with that medication   so it's even more important for new medicines like 
the COVID 19 vaccine for example that we do these   yellow cards because we're going to gather more 
data more evidence and gather it all and collate   it all together which could be really helpful 
for scientists and healthcare professionals not   only here but all over the world so if you can you 
can do this online anyone can do it you don't have   to be a healthcare professional if you've had 
the vaccine and you've had any side effects or   problems with it at all please do fill a yellow 
card because it's going to be super helpful for   all the scientists around the world another point 
i'd like to mention is please remember that if you   develop a continuous cough if you lose your sense 
of taste or smell at all or a reduction in it   or if you have a constant fever a temperature over 
37.8 degrees celsius or 100.4 degrees fahrenheit   then these could be a sign of COVID 19 these 
classic symptoms that we're all probably aware   of you may have got it before the vaccine you may 
have right after the vaccine this is a possibility   so please remember these rules still apply to 
everyone so if you do get these symptoms please   self-isolate follow your government guidelines 
here in the uk please visit the nhs website and   please arrange yourself a COVID 19 test whilst 
you're self-isolating and now on to the final   burning question how long is this vaccine going to 
be effective for unfortunately we can't see into   the future so we're still not sure about this 
scientists are still researching into this it   may be a case that in the future we might need a 
booster so after your second vaccine jab you might   need a booster every six months or a year similar 
to how we do the flu jab for example but this   still has to be proven we're still researching 
into it and trying to find out more information   we also don't know yet if it stops to spread 
if it stops the transmission of the virus this   still hasn't been proven so the best information 
i can give for this is please just stay up to   date look the information i'm giving you today is 
up to date for today really okay so you need to   stay up to date with the who with the nhs with any 
organizations that that you follow in your country   where you're watching this video and i will leave 
links to these in the description below so for my   final thoughts i think that the oxford astrazeneca 
covid 19 vaccine has proven to be safe so far the   clinical trials that we spoke about earlier showed 
no safety concerns which is exactly what you want   to hear and the clinical trials were in a large 
number of people they're still being done as well   and also they're doing a diverse number of 
people different age different ethnicities which   is everything that you want to see in a clinical 
trial but despite all of this please do remember   that if you do get the COVID 19 vaccine we still 
need to maintain social distance we need to wash   our hands often we need to wear the face masks 
all of these things still need to remain in place   because we still don't know whether the vaccine 
stops transmission that hasn't been proven and   there still is a chance that you can catch COVID 
19 even after the vaccine so it's super important   that we still maintain the social distancing and 
all the things that we've been doing currently so   as i did mention earlier even if you've had the 
vaccine if you still get these kinds of symptoms   of COVID 19 such as the constant cough the loss of 
taste or smell that high fever any of these sort   of symptoms which we know of COVID 19 the rules 
still apply you need to self-isolate you need to   follow your government guidelines if you're here 
in the uk you need to self-isolate go on the nhs   website and get yourself a COVID 19 test as well 
i will leave links to it in the description below   and just to remind you one last time this 
video was filmed on the 23rd of january 2021   all the information i've given today is up to 
date today this information can change with   time so please stay up to date with information 
online from the who the nhs and also your local   government websites that you know and trust i will 
leave links to these in the description below if   you've made it this far in this video i want to

what she has to share with us today so please join me in welcoming dr christina essija good afternoon everybody um it's such a pleasure to be here um to talk with you all today i'd like to thank dr mark agars and the icdfr for inviting me to come to speak with you all on this topic i'm just going to be kind of uh going through a little bit about what some of the mental health impacts of coven 19 19r in terms of what we know to date and then i'll talk a little bit about some things to keep an eye out for uh and then we'll talk about specific you know coping strategies and things that you can do to effectively manage the stress that we're kind of all collectively uh facing right now so there has been a variety of impacts related to covid19 some of which i'm sure many of you are not strangers to um obviously chiefly illness so dealing with the impacts of covet 19 um as well as you know the impacts that the illness has had on individuals in our families because of the necessary requirements to engage in social distancing that has left a number of us some more profoundly impacted than others with uh having to deal with isolation um other impacts include changes in our daily lives so having to adapt to perhaps a virtual world having to um adapt to a loss of child care having to adapt to a loss of social activities or other recreational activities that um people you were familiar you know were familiar or um you were used to having the opportunity to engage in um of course there's more serious impacts that we have um seen like job loss and resulting financial hardships um of course the loss of life we just recently crossed the 500 000 um death toll mark um and just this ongoing sense of uncertainty you know um are things getting better are the cases going down are there the these new variants what does that mean how is this all how are we going to successfully get out of this situation and so i am you know i am somewhat um i think that you know at least in terms of where we're we're sitting and meeting today it does it does seem like there are better days on our horizon and um and i'm and i'm grateful and hopeful for that but this has been obviously we're we're getting to the point where we're almost at the one year mark here where we have been experiencing you know all of these impacts and having to adapt to them fairly quickly um which outness without necessarily the kinds of supports that we used to have readily available and you add that to the fact that you know this isn't completely unprecedented time in our lives you know everybody on this zoom today has not previously had to deal with a pandemic um or the implications of it so um it's definitely unchartered territory and i think we've all just been doing our best to kind of adapt you know on the fly so to speak um early kind of research has kind of shown that not surprisingly there are significant mental health impacts associated with covet 19 and the you know kind of resulting consequences that i mentioned earlier so research is still growing but early findings do show that specifically anxiety and depressive disorders substance use and increased suicidal ideation have been observed among adults what what we know so far is that people that experienced more directly economic effects so maybe going back to like job loss or financial hardship more effects on their daily life so thinking about having reduced access to social support increased demands related to work or or parenting you know coping with illness caring for family those sorts of impacts on a person's daily life as well as you know experiencing delays in um academic activities or other you know kinds of goals have been associated with greater anxiety as well having um relatives or acquaintances with copen19 can potentially increase a person's risk for these kinds of mental health issues and again that's not surprising we kind of know already that especially with respect to experiencing stress and trauma the more direct demands that are placed on the individual as well as the more directly they're impacted by the event the more likely you know you are to see you know a risk for you know mental health issues also which has been you know kind of observed in the clinical literature for quite some time in in the medical field as well um not surprisingly young adults ethnic minorities um essential workers um unpaid caregivers for adults and those with pre-existing mental health conditions appear to be disproportionately affected so there's specific populations that seem to be at greater risk most namely you know ethic minorities so i'm going to use a metaphor um kind of a little bit throughout this presentation i want you to think about you know us as humans as being a lot like cars right so vehicles um obviously uh we all rely on our cars to take us where we need to go and perform a number of essential activities whether it's that be for work for school for again recreation for facilitating um social relationships uh things of that sort um so if you think of us all as cars you know what does a car need to to effectively run well it needs it needs gas right so and maybe you've heard of this kind of metaphor before in terms of you know humans being like cars and and needing to have what we call a full gas tank um it's it's not surprising uh that what stress does especially prolonged stress over time uh it it eliminates our reservoir right it it it keeps us functioning basically you know without enough gas so to speak so what you have now is now that we're getting to the point of one year of being kind of under these you know somewhat unprecedented levels of stress you find that essentially many people might feel that they're kind of you know running on fumes so to speak and the the problem with that is although the the car can still you know take you where you need to go on empty is that eventually if you don't attend to that blinking light telling you that you need gas uh there is the opportunity for uh um you know really negative consequences you know uh much more much more negative when we're talking about people's mental health um so it can basically be a recipe for disaster so unlike cars we don't necessarily have a light that's going to blink and tell us whether or not there's something that needs to be checked right um so what we have to do is kind of check in with ourselves and be receptive to feedback from other people that know us that are in our support system in terms of being able to gauge like how we're doing so these what are listed on this slide here are kind of like those warning signs so so to speak they're also just direct consequences of everything that i mentioned on the previous slide so some of these signs include like experiencing depressed moods so noticing that you're feeling down or depressed more often than not feeling increased anxiety fear or worry so perhaps worrying that about your your financial security the safety of yourself or your family members um you know not being able you know experiencing intrusive thoughts of worry or fear throughout the day how am i going to get through this what if i what if i can't um follow through on that responsibility or that obligation how is this impacting my children um you know do i have covid did i get too close to that person um was i exposed how am i gonna get an appointment et cetera et cetera so uh increased fear anxiety or worry also restlessness and irritability so a lot of times when we think about somebody that might be in need of you know perhaps receiving some kind of mental health care we tend to often think about somebody that maybe is experiencing symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks or subjectively depressed mood like feeling down or depressed you know having difficulty getting out of bed but it's important for people to know that there's other signs that are important to pay attention to as well and those are signs of what we call like um you know irritability or restlessness so you know having difficulty being able to relax um being easily frustrated or short with others um getting into a lot of arguments you know with people you know in your in your home or at work those are signs that you know again that gas tank is is low and those are that's something that you want to pay attention to also increased isolation now i mentioned that isolation is a consequence of covid because of physical distancing measures but also it's important to pay attention to when you notice yourself um or a loved one you know isolating from your support groups um irrespective of covid so so maybe they stop answering the phone um maybe they you know you find yourself hiding out in your bedroom more often or not wanting to um you know spend time with your family downstairs or watching a movie or going outside for a hike you just see withdrawal social withdrawal basically so that's something that you want to pay attention to um another important warning sign is anhedonia and that basically just refers to having a kind of an inability to experience joy or pleasure so if all of a sudden you find that things you really used to enjoy um you know maybe maybe hobbies or activities or you know going on walks with your dog or you know uh painting or playing music or even spending time with family and friends isn't as enjoyable that's something that you want to you know take note of another common consequence of stress is impairments and concentration so having difficulty focusing um having trouble making decisions having trouble remembering things feeling confused um so that is something that you know again you want to take note of appetite changes so if you notice that you or somebody else um you know you notice a significant change in appetite which could be you know overeating or under eating um that's also a you know a sign that you know there could be something going on um worsening of chronic health issues so if you have a pre-existing health issue um oftentimes what stress does is it exacerbates that sometimes you can also see stress result in the development of new health issues or sometimes even um you know headaches uh stomach aches gastrointestinal issues so those are those are again you know um signs that you know you might need to you know either seek some type of outside help or you know engage in certain kinds of behaviors that can kind of uh fill your gas tank so to speak um increased substance use um i think this is something that uh i've at least seen you know reported in um the news that this is definitely a consequence and they've certainly seen increased rates of substance use following covid um but that's also a warning sign if you notice that you're using you know substances more than you used to that you're becoming more reliant on their use or that their use is creating problems in your lives uh that you'd want to pay attention to that as well as lastly you know suicidal ideation um having suicidal thoughts um you know is not uncommon when people experience um depression or anxiety or stress but uh you know so to a certain extent you know it is something that is uh i think ubiquitous during certain times but when it starts to occur um you know again that's a warning sign and certainly when you start to notice that you're having increasingly uh frequent you know and um you know intense suicidal thoughts um that's definitely a sign to you know seek out some kind of help um communicate you know to friends and family um you know what you're experiencing so now i'm gonna go through some kind of general strategies to kind of manic manage anxiety and stress um during covid the first one noted here on the slide seems to be you know somewhat uh intuitive um and it's kind of the more obvious one but interestingly i think it's one of the ones that most people play pay least amount of attention to especially when they're under a lot of stress um the most important thing that you can do is take care of your body and your just basic needs uh which are you know having proper nutrition um ensuring that you're getting adequate amounts of sleep so generally for adults that's about eight hours a night as well as engaging in regular exercise so the interesting thing is we usually think of these things as being important to our physical health but they're actually equally important to our mental health in fact sleep is a is a really important indicator of mental health and when you see individuals that are you know struggling with depression or anxiety often you know one of the um kind of more observable um you know symptoms of those disorders is impaired sleep so sleeping too much or sleeping too little or having distressing dreams or nightmares so taking care of your body and just ensuring that you're doing just at least these three basic things you know eating nutritious meals and snacks um you know sleeping eight hours as well as getting some kind of physical activity is really important and i think for some people who may have been physically active in the past it could be it certainly has become you know increasingly uh more difficult to utilize some forms of exercise that you may have relied on in the past if you for example you know um relied on you know gyms and being able to go to the gym a lot of gyms obviously have been closed um but trying to find as best of a way that you can engage in some kind of regular activity you know thankfully you know we're fairly safe uh when we're outside and we're not around other people so you know thinking about you know going for walks going for runs biking hiking you know getting outside is is really important and getting moving another really important um strategy um to manage right now and i think that this has proven to be quite challenging for many people given that everything giving everything that has been going on within the past year related to the pandemic um as well as social issues and politics is media distancing we are constantly bombarded by information from the media you know it comes to our phones it comes on social media uh many people are now spending more time on the computer right for for work or for their education so we're constantly you know being exposed um to information and of course again these are unprecedented times so you're going to want to turn to the media to get information on how the situation is evolving how it's being handled but it's really important that you don't over consume um the news basically you want to make sure that you know you're setting appropriate limits um so for example a good strategy might be to you know agree to um set a daily time limit for you to watch the news or you know decide maybe i'm gonna you know look through recent news articles or read the newspaper in the morning or i'm gonna you know you know check it once in the afternoon that sort of thing um because what that constant bombardment of information especially again given everything else that we have kind of seen in the news in the last year is it you know it can be very taxing and it can you know certainly serve to elevate you know feelings of anxiety stress hopelessness anger um uncertainty so you wanna you know um dose that and that's not usually they think something that we're used to like having to limit or that we think about having to limit but it's important to do that um also try to focus on goals and identify new sources of enjoyment and meeting meaning so it's really important basically to spend time on activities or sources of meaning that matter to you and that you enjoy um so you might already have some of these things like for example i was mentioning earlier hobbies like um playing an instrument um creating some kind of art you know exercising hiking spending time with family these are things you you certainly want to do and if and if you are particularly struggling or if you your ability to do some of these things has been compromised because of covid um you might want to find new things that you can do uh that can provide a sense of satisfaction um or enjoying it and it's really important to make time to do these things i think sometimes when we're stressed out we can have you know a lot of things on our plate a lot of things to do you know you're thinking about household responsibilities and finances and caring for your for for family members that it's really easy to forget that it's actually really important and it's one of the the best ways you can kind of fill that gas tank so to speak is to have some time where you're engaged in an activity that that you enjoy and makes you feel good so good things to do during covid might be like having a movie night um reading a new book um exploring a hobby outline online and even planning maybe how you're gonna do that or what you're gonna do you know when uh when the restrictions are lifted um but focus on identifying things that you enjoy that you know provide you with a sense of satisfaction another important strategy is try to maintain your normal routine um as best as possible so anytime we're under a lot of stress again it's really easy to um you know uh not eat not sleep um stop doing things that you do regularly like exercise you know spending time reaching out to friends and family you really want to do your best to maintain your normal routine as much as possible however there is a caveat to that you also want to provide a little bit of space because when you're under a lot of stress it might be difficult to fully accomplish everything that you would under normal circumstances so you want to have some kind of a regular routine but still allow some flexibility because these are unprecedented times right there is going to be a day where maybe a family member calls you and tells you that they're not feeling well or you find out you have to go get tested or there's something happening on the news that's stressful so you want to have some flexibility but generally you want to have a reliable wake-up time a regular time that you're going to bed a regular time that you're kind of eating your meals you know to the extent that you want to engage in certain activities regularly like household chores or exercises that all can be you know really helpful to kind of come up with a plan and try to to kind of stick with it um another important strategy is engaging in stress reduction activities and self-care so these are things like meditation mindfulness uh even stretching and deep breathing exercises these can be really important ways to kind of restore our bodies and help our bodies you know kind of reduce the amount of stress there's a lot of resources available obviously mindfulness has been really growing as well as meditation in the in the past decade or so there's a lot of great resources you can find online through a simple google search or if you have access to you know a cell phone there's a lot of great apps available that can help guide you um through this process um but even just simple stretching um and uh you know taking a moment to step outside and and kind of be mindful and attend to like what's around you and take a moment to to take in you know um the space and world around you can be a a nice way to to reset as well as you know kind of cope with stress another important strategy is you know uh challenging negative thoughts a really common um you know experience uh for people with anxiety and depression depressive issues is having negative thoughts you know thoughts um related to worry or fear uh you know i'm not going to get out of this you know my life is never going to be the same um i'm not going to get through this or thoughts like i i'm weak i should be able to handle this what's wrong with me everybody else seems to be doing fine our minds are constantly chattering so it's really important that you try to i think do one of two things or a combination you want to certainly challenge negative thoughts and challenging a negative thought isn't isn't uh so simple as just you know just you know you know when a family or friend tells you think optimistically it's not just thinking optimistically i like to think of it as thinking realistically as well as compassionately so a lot of times if you get stuck in that negative thinking style think about what you would tell a friend right um think about how you'd respond to a family member if they told you that uh oftentimes you know when when family or friend come to us with kind of extreme you know negative thoughts because we're outside of the situation we're able to provide you know a more accurate um representation of what's happening as well as a more compassionate response so try to challenge you know those negative thoughts like recognizing you know what this is a really hard time and i'm doing the best that i can or you know what everybody is going through this right now it's a hard time for everybody or i can get through this um or i need to take care of myself you know try to challenge those negative thoughts um the other strategy i mentioned might just be to to just ignore them um you know the these are just like i said our minds are constantly chattering and it's okay um to not buy into those thoughts right um view those thoughts as just a symptom of stress and you don't have to play into them and you don't have to accept them as being true uh just kind of continue on with you know um what you need to do what you want to do while trying to you know obviously engage in some of these other strategies i'm mentioning another important thing is setting up a virtual support group or identifying a bubble so to speak finding friends and family that you can you know reach out to rely on and have regular you know social interaction i think that you know the experience during covet has been you know obviously unique for each individual some people were used to seeing a lot of family and friends and getting their social needs met at work and now they find themselves at home and isolated some people might find uh that you know all of a sudden they're home or with their family or with kids all the time um and and that could be challenging as well but it's really important to have people that you can reach out to that you can have some kind of regular social interaction with and i want to qualify it by saying you specifically want to reach out to i think during stressful times with people that you know are going to be supportive um that are going to be able to understand you know kind of what you're dealing with and what your concerns are so it's important that i think have a healthy support group and and it's okay to not also spend times with people that that that aren't helpful um you know when you're you know dealing with you know a particularly stressful situation um the next point is you know exercising compassion to self and others so i kind of alluded to that earlier when i was using that example of like telling yourself what you would tell a friend but be patient with yourself these are again are unprecedented times you know everybody is is struggling and just because you're struggling it doesn't mean that you're weak and it doesn't mean that you know things are not necessarily going to get better so try to be patient with yourself as well as with other people um that you work with or in your family as well um next find ways to help others so be whether that be through volunteering or helping your neighbors or family members or elderly members of your community these can be really you know really helpful ways to again you know one obviously help those individuals but also you know ensure that your um gas tank is being filled so to speak it provides a sense of purpose uh and meaning i would just be cautious in terms of feeling like you need to help everybody and take on more than you feel comfortable with we talked a little bit we haven't really talked so much about like self-care but you hear that term a lot and a lot of people think about self-care as having to be specific to um doing something nice for yourself getting you know getting a massage taking a bubble bath you know eating a nice meal those are all important ways to fill our gas tank as well but there's also other you know really important pieces of self-care which is you know knowing when to say no uh to certain things that you're not comfortable with knowing how to set boundaries with people that you find unsupportive or perhaps toxic knowing even sometimes that it might be time to turn the netflix off at 11 38 because you need to get your rest those are also important things you know to be doing and the final strategy here is ask for support and help don't be afraid to reach out to other people sometimes even just having a very brief conversation with a friend or family member can can really help um kind of you know put things into perspective and provide you know some temporary or short-term you know relief so don't be afraid to ask for help and um kind of what i've got here on the last slide are some references so if you or somebody in your family or friend or workplace if you start to notice that you know they do seem to be struggling these are great resources um to provide um obviously you know some of you are from the larger san bernardino community so the san bernardino county behavioral health um they have a you know a number of great resources on their website as does the national alliance for mental illness so those are good resources as well if you're from the csusb campus if you're a student services are available through the counseling and psychological services or caps you pay for those with your student fees and the psychology department also has a community counseling center that is offering services uh via telehealth um and uh you know that's an option to you know students faculty staff alumni and members of the community so that's all i've got for now so i'll go ahead and open it up for questions christina that was terrific thank you so much for uh all that you shared i think you know one of the points you made early on just about how long this experience has gone on right that we've been going through covet now and the sort of effects of that isolation and life change and hardships etc but the length of time at which all this has gone on has has really created i think a lot of mental health challenges and and and for for many of us and so i really appreciate you taking the time to kind of share uh your perspective on that as well as you know some of the strategies uh that folks can use to sort of think about that and help themselves and the people that they love in their own lives so so thank you for that um i do have a number of questions that participants and audience members have brought up okay so uh christina the first one i wanted to uh pass you speaks to something sort of early on that you mentioned in your talk and you had a you had a section where you talked quite a bit about kind of different warning signs that we should be looking for um both in ourselves and sort of those around us but one of the one of the participants asked how do we kind of determine the difference between what is just maybe a typical change in one of those uh indicators that you mentioned versus whether it's you know kind of something more serious something more to be more concerned about yeah that's a great question um and also you know it's important to keep in mind that everybody is going to experience some fluctuations right so you might have a period of a day or two where you feel more down or you do feel more anxious or maybe there is something happening on the news or in your family environment that's stressful so there's going to be kind of you know obviously periods where you see you know kind of transitory increases in in distress and things like that i think where it really starts to become concerning is when you see it you know um happening for a prolonged period of time so you know when you start to notice that you are having difficulty sleeping and this is going on for you know one week two weeks even longer that that's that's a very telling sign that you know there there might be something going on that needs to be addressed as well as with respect to you know experiences of depression or sadness it's not uncommon to feel down or hopeless a day or two right but when you start to notice that a person is feeling down or depressed most of the day nearly every day for you know two weeks or so that's kind of the diagnostic definition that's a sign to to really pay attention to that as well again if you start to see suicidal thoughts coming up and again really significant feelings of you know profound feelings of hopelessness you know when you feel like you just you know when you can't shake it but i think that's a good way to think about it you know um when you start to see withdrawal when you start to see you know significant changes in appetite and sleep you know those are really important things to pay attention to for ourselves you know and our loved ones no that's great that's great thank you for that thank you for that a number of our participants asked questions about um school aged children and students and so i'm going to kind of combine a couple together but um you know the i guess the the the main point is that that folks kind of want to know how do we assist you know school age children or students who might be struggling with their mental health well i think um i think you know you're going to want to rely on a lot of the strategies you know um i mentioned and then just you know to a certain extent you want to adapt them for uh kids and school age children a little bit i think one one important thing is is that you know kids don't often always express their distress in the same ways that adults do so i think that's the biggest difference um you know if you're sad or anxious or depressed um you know it's very common that you know i mean of course there's individual differences and cultural differences but you know we can very clearly communicate i'm feeling sad you know i haven't been able to sleep you know you know kids don't necessarily do that and so it's really important you know to pay attention to these same things how they're eating how they're sleeping as well as specifically whether or not you seem to notice that they're having you know a lot of um somatic complaints a lot of headaches a lot of stomachaches but you'll see a lot of those same behaviors you know you know feeling withdrawn not really you know experiencing as much enjoyment also sometimes you might see um you know you know i talked about like restless and irritability in adults you see that and you can see manifestations of that in kids as well you know not just with irritability but perhaps maybe they might be um pushing boundaries more or you know maybe acting out in ways behaviorally or responding emotionally in a way that you know they typically wouldn't so those are things that you want to pay attention to um and and it's also just okay to you know to to talk to your child and check in and see how they're doing um sometimes you know kids only hear bits and pieces of what's going on and they might be privy to what's on the news or like adult conversations and again these are unprecedented times and there's been lots of things that have been you know really concerning and scary but it's going to be even more so i think you know to to a child it could potentially be more so um you know so it's really important to to talk to them what about what's going on in a way that's going to be supportive so not necessarily you don't necessarily have to lie about what's going on but you know talk to them in a way that can potentially correct any any extreme or exaggerated kind of misperceptions um about what they might have you know they might hear you talking about kovid and they might think like oh my gosh if we get coveted my parents are going to die and i'm going to be you know i mean and so that catastrophic thinking you know can can lead to you know obviously really really pronounced um uh effects so it's it's really important to talk to them i think you know factually you know i'm going to say at a developmentally appropriate level um but you know because if you sometimes if you don't talk about it with kids then you just leave them to their imagination and that in many cases even with adults too oftentimes that's far worse than you know the situation at hand so um you know you want to check in with them as well i'm not sure if that answered the the whole question no i think you did and and and but and i think you went beyond right in a really important way in talking about you know what some of the things we can do to prevent the sort of escalation of those concerns etc that that might emerge in children especially younger ones so so i really appreciate that we did have a speaker earlier in the year who yes i remember talking to your talking to children right about about covet and that was one of the things they talked about it's like if you're not sharing with them they're getting information from other sources whether they're overhearing your conversations or something popped up on tv or on on a screen that they had and and that could create much much more severe concerns or thoughts so yeah yeah i think it's a really important thing just to say one more thing because i think intuitively as like parents and caregivers sometimes you might feel the need to like protect your child from information so maybe you don't tell them what's going on but it's a delicate balance because oftentimes then that can lead to extra you know additional uncertainty and fear and anxiety so finding a way to keep them in the loop again in a developmentally appropriate way so you know they don't need to necessarily know that you know their grandparent might might die if they get covered right but letting them know that you know this is a serious this is a serious thing that's happening and you know a lot of people are being impacted but i'm doing what i can to keep you safe you know do you have any questions you know that that's helpful yeah yeah i know that's great that's great thank you we got a couple of questions that sort of related to folks who who might say have have uh pre-existing conditions entering kind of the covet situation so one person was asking about generalized anxiety disorder another one about um ptsd but but for folks who you know prior to covet were experiencing uh you know either ptsd or generalized anxiety disorder um do you have any um recommendations or thoughts about their experiences to the extent that they might be sort of accentuated or exacerbated in the context of covid yeah actually um i meant to mention that earlier on when i was going through kind of some of the impacts but what research has shown not surprisingly is that you know individuals that do have pre-existing mental health conditions have been more adversely impacted um because of covet and and and and again that's not surprising just general life stress can can be more problematic for people with you know existing mental health conditions and certainly an event of uh you know or experience on this scale and for this amount of time and then again thinking about you know some people's care has been interrupted some people's you know the things that they normally do to kind of keep themselves um you know taken care of you know like spending time with friends and family you know you know those things have been impacted so um certainly you know and and what the research has shown so far is that those individuals are disproportionately affected and so i think a good thing to do is if certainly if you have a pre-existing mental health condition you know it is it is a really great time to if you're not already to connect to some kind of mental health um support especially if you're noticing that your symptoms you know are worsening um you know i i think it's also a good idea to just kind of check in with yourself i don't think we're also used to necessarily doing that you know asking yourself how am i how am i doing and then following up with no really how am i doing um uh you know check in with yourself you know and also you know sometimes it's hard to hear feedback from like family and friends but they know you and they they sometimes can be in a better position to observe if something isn't right right um so you know check in with you know be open to i guess to that feedback um you know from from family and friends you know um because chances are you know when you when you're in that state you don't always necessarily have you know full awareness um of everything else i mean but but the the the consequences are pretty pronounced um you know for example there have been some studies that have looked at you know rates of anxiety um depression um compared to the year prior so of course you know it's not won't get into research methods but there's a lot of problems with just necessarily doing that comparison but i obvi it's you know my guess is is that there there is some you know accuracy in these data and what they're showing is that people with um the prevalence of anxiety disorders is three times higher wow the prevalence of depressive disorders is four times higher um about about a quarter of individuals are reporting traumatic stress types of symptoms there was another study from the cdc a survey study that showed and this was conducted in january that and it showed that about 40 of adults are reporting an anxiety or depressive disorder about 40 so think about it it's about half right so i mean that's that's that's really prevalent and you know again i think at some point we need to also work to you know reduce stigma about mental illness generally but that's a separate conversation but these are experiences that are pretty prevalent under normal circumstances so you can only imagine you know how high the prevalence might be right now one of the uh one of the questions that came up and and you spoke to some of this earlier but but um you know if you could maybe um expand on that a little bit you know it's one of the most fundamental things right a person asked and i could have asked the same question right how do we manage you know irritability and feelings of isolation that come up due to being at home that's the thing i mean it was a great question that someone asked that's a theme i've heard so many people share just you know in my own personal life right this idea that i'm just more irritable i'm just feeling isolated and um i don't i don't know i know you spoke to this a little bit but if there was anything other anything else that you could add to that yeah i mean i think you know irritability i mean they're a little bit i'm going to speak about them separately i guess but yeah you know your irritability i think is a really important sign to pay attention to that you are you know over taxed right uh when we're stressed out when we're running late when things aren't going right when we have deadlines when we're worried about friends and family um it's not uncommon to to be more irritable um you combine that with also not not eating well or not sleeping and so you know i think with respect to irritability you really want to take that as a sign that you need to that you need to try to to do something that's going to be restorative to you and that's going to be unique to each individual so these are all different strategies and what i would encourage you to do is you know to to try a variety of the things that i've mentioned today um not necessarily one coping mechanism is going to work for every person it's not a one-size-fits-all you know some people exercise they need that you know um you know for other people it's it's it's sleep or it's spending time with friends and family for some people meditation is really helpful some people they find it they get frustrated with it you know um so you have to find what's going to work best for you in that moment and and the best place to be in is where you have a variety of skills or strategies to choose from you don't want to be over reliant on just one coping skill right because uh one it you know if for some reason you're unable to do that right like maybe it was going to the gym and now you can't go to the gym then you're gonna not have anything else to draw um but also i think the efficacy of our coping skills you know um can sometimes be um i think more pronounced when you know we have a number of different things to to kind of to kind of choose from so i think with respect to irritability you know i would i would first again focus on sleep um as well as i think you know if it's maybe because you need some space for yourself maybe it's it's you know um finding some time to to take care of yourself or do something that's relaxing um or enjoyable it might also mean that you have to um we didn't talk about this too much but these are really stressful um times we keep saying i keep saying that but um when a person's under a lot of stress you want to try find ways to eliminate the stress so of course we have things that we have to do that are essential to you know our our personal situations our households our work our school whatever it is but now's not necessarily the time where you should feel like you need to take on things that are extra or if you have things that you were usually doing that were somewhat extra maybe you need to step back from those and that's not a sign of weakness or failure it's it's just the reality of the situation maybe now is not a good time to like coach your son's little league maybe now is not a good time you know to agree to you know coordinate some kind of you know work event or take on extra service at work or to commit to you know helping you know your son's school out right now or whatever it might be you know but it's also okay not just just to say no to things that we don't necessarily want to do or even if we want to do them we still have to sometimes have the awareness to be like i want to do that but i probably shouldn't do that right now um but also being okay to to let go of the things that we can um you know you can get back to that i mean hopefully hopefully i mean i'm feeling increasingly optimistic personally but you know um we're we are going to get through this at some point whether it whether it's by you know summer or fall like you know it does seem like there's a light at the end of the tunnel so so so you know um i guess you know try to focus on that and know that even if you you know you let go of some things right now like it doesn't mean that you can't get back into it but you know it's difficult too because sometimes people might stop doing things or let go of responsibilities because they're depressed so you kind of have to like you know pay attention it's really about paying attention to like what your body and your mind you know kind of need but yeah um the other thing was irritability what was the other sorry oh isolation isolation isolation yeah i think i think some people definitely need to be more um intentional than others about you know engaging regularly with people um i think that's important we're social beings it's it's it's it's you know it's how we refuel it's how we form connection um it's so essential to you know who we are as as humans and so you know um trying to you know reach out to family or friends um you know if you if you can't see people in person um you know setting up zoom activities are really helpful um and sometimes you know i i think you know you have to pay attention to i guess you know a good piece of advice to be like with socially because it might be like maybe you need to isolate maybe you don't need to isolate pay attention to how you feel after you spend time with people you know you know sometimes it might be like oh i don't really know if i want to like go on that zoom or i don't really want to go talk on my driveway with the person in my bubble right but notice how you feel afterwards when you do that and and use that as a guide because i think you know you you also and that's with any activity you know check in with yourself did that make me feel better did that make me feel worse you know um and and trust your trust your own intuition i think we got a couple questions um about motivation which i think is kind of interesting and and i don't know that you've directly spoken to this yet but certainly it's sort of implicated in some of the things that you that you have discussed but um i'll use one of the specific comments around motivation to kind of frame the question someone writes as a school counselor my biggest challenge are students who are completely unmotivated they're failing most or all of their classes they're unreachable unreachable right not checking emails or answering calls and do you have uh guidance for helping them and and i would say you know i know the question came framed from from a school counselor but i think parents have that same question right and so you know i wonder if you have some thoughts on that yeah i mean i think i think this is i mean been particularly hard i mean i mentioned earlier on young adults but kids as well yeah um because of the reduced uh access to socialization and activities and um of course you know having to adapt to virtual learning um so i i think it's um it's definitely good to you know pay attention to signs of that within your kids and um i think with respect to you know how to increase motivation i think you know i think to them one of the most helpful things might be you know maybe very simple but you know uh check in with the person in form try to form some kind of like appropriate obviously connection or relationship you know ask them how they're doing because there might be things that you can do to kind of you know what might be what might be causing i guess their reduction in motivation can be many things so you don't want to assume that you know you necessarily know why but if it's stemming from anxiety if it's stemming from hopelessness or it's just like i don't like this learning model then once you get the person talking about it or to verbalize some of that then you can try to introduce some kind of like problem solving sorts of um dialogue so figuring out how you can perhaps you know make the learning environment better so maybe it's about scheduling you know um more breaks or trying to see if they can get a peer or a small peer group together like a study group or or finding more ways to connect with with um you know other individuals in their class or with the material um but it's kind of hard to know i guess without knowing you know kind of what what might be um leading that i think sometimes also just low motivation you know just i think it comes from a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness or you know feeling like efforts are just kind of futile or i i can't learn this way and you know i can't do this i don't want to do this and so some of that could obviously be addressed through you know either formal mental health services or also you know just again talking to the person trying to provide reassurance and support i mean that can really go a long way um even among you know uh you know obviously my area is a traumatic stress and one of the most significant predictors of resilience is social support and i mean it's just so incredibly important that we have access uh to that and i i think that that can can go a long long way as well as you know trying to see if there is something you know specific in the learning environment that that they're struggling with and if there's opportunity to improve it um and hopefully also you know the the you know i think we're hearing more ram rumblings about schools reopening um and so i think that's something to be optimistic for but also something i think to potentially be prepared for because you know the learning environment is going to be different you know than what than what you know students were used to so i think it's good to prepare students for that or prepare your children for that so that they know what to expect many of us did that work back in the fall when we thought that we were going back but now that we're going back i mean i was just telling um my son the other day because he he i'm hearing he might be going back unofficially next month and um you know he's only seven so i think he was thinking it from you know his own prior experience of school and i kind of had to like you know remember what we talked about in fall how you're gonna go for half day and you know so you know you want to set up make sure that people have reasonable expectations for what that's going to look like and we might not know what that's going to look like we don't even know a date officially yet but for some of us but you know to the extent that you can just you know i think the best thing to do is to try to prepare a person as much as possible um you know and and then just you know try to do your best to listen and to troubleshoot and and to also you know just recognize too that you know it's it's okay if if they're struggling everybody's struggling you know yeah no i appreciate you speaking to that and recognizing that it's kind of it's a broader issue beyond just the student or the child themselves right i feel like you know so many of the parents i talk to who have school-aged children are are all reporting this sort of challenge to to like keep their kids engaged and motivated the people who i know who are educators at the k-12 level are talking about how difficult and frustrating it is to stay engaged with the folks so you know it's clearly it's it's been a pretty big challenge but i i really appreciate your point it's like you know there are things that we can do as educators there are things we can do as counselors there are things we can do as parents around that yeah okay we are getting close to to time but there was one last question i wanted to sneak in if you got a minute left christina okay wonderful because it's because it's a really i think it's a fitting question too for us to kind of finish up on which is um do you have any expectations or suggestions or you know about what's going to happen as we as we move out of covid right and once sort of you know i don't want to say return to normal because i don't think that's the right way to frame what we're what's going to happen but this idea of as we move out of this sort of you know more strict and coveted you know constricted world that we've been in um are there mental health concerns or or you know things that we should be thinking about i think that that's an excellent question and um i think we should be thinking about it and i've actually been thinking about it myself because um you know it's been almost a year and let's all give ourselves a pat on the back for for we've all been forced to adapt one way or another right so we have been adapting and in some ways some things may have become a little bit easier you know some things not so much but some things you may have been able to successfully adapt and adjust and i think you know we're so focused on obviously we all want to get quote unquote back to normal and you know i think in some ways it's a good thing that it's not going to happen overnight and this is partly related to your question because either way it's still going to be a really huge shift and i don't think people are going to be prepared for that part um even when you think about you know uh for people working at home right we haven't had to battle traffic uh some people haven't had to put on anything other than sweatpants um we haven't had to think about what we're gonna make for dinner you know uh you know or maybe you can step out for 30 minutes where you can't do that when you when you're when you're um working from afar um same thing even just lives fundamentally kind of came to a stop right so think about parents you know kids had sporting events and they had birthday parties and you had family parties and and obligations and you know your own recreational pursuits and and life was stressful before so as much as we so desperately want it back it was still stressful and i think i think adjusting back it's it's it's good that it's gradual and i hope that it is because i think that that's going to be a lot to adapt to as well because this has kind of become a new normal where we've been able to have a lot of a little more flexibility with respect to work or school or our relationships right you don't you don't have to feel bad i mean of course you might because of you know anyway you don't have to necessarily feel bad turning down a social invitation you have an out right so so things like that you know if you know i think um people can run the risk of maybe taking on you know too much or it might it might feel kind of shocking to all of a sudden be like wait i don't know how i used to like get everybody dressed get breakfast go to school go to work leave early go to soccer make dinner like you know i mean as stressful as life is right now that was my personal experience before um i don't have to do a lot of it doesn't feel as it's a very different experience i would say it's like it's definitely still stressful but it's a different kind of stress and i and i think that you know you want to be mindful of that adjusting back and recognize that that could be stressful too anytime there's this change a significant change you know whether it's a good change or a bad change you know um so you know there can be you know you need to allow time for your mind and your body to to kind of adapt so even when things open up you still want to kind of check in with yourself be gentle be compassionate etc yeah i was thinking too that right we've sort of spent the last year thinking you know being in groups of people being out but that's a dangerous thing and and you know as we go back to more of that and that becomes more of what's normal that that in and of itself could create some challenges for oh yes that too and i mean i think especially for people that had any kind of pre-existing anxiety disorder especially like obsessive-compulsive disorder you know for those individuals i think it's going to be really trying to going back to starting to feel safe in situations that you might have already thought were unsafe you know pre-covered so um i think that that's going to be a reality for some individuals as well and for everybody um you know we're gonna have to i mean you you hear people anecdotally make comments about how weird it is to watch tv and movie shows i mean tv shows and movies and see people in such such class close proximity to one another and i think everyone's going to have a little bit of discomfort with that i mean depending on to what extent you have been really preoccupied with germs or you know proper ventilation and covid and whatnot so you know i think it's also okay to recognize that you're going to feel anxious for a while in those situations because it because it's adaptive because you learned that that was something associated with really negative consequences so you had to adjust your brain and your mind and your behavior to adapt to those situations and now you kind of have to adapt back and it's not going to happen overnight you know you might find yourself in a really in a really you know crowded room and you might have an experience of anxiety you know um and and you know i i think rather than trying to you know uh make a judgment about yourself like what's wrong with me or why am i experiencing you know to just be patient and know that like a big change is happening you know when when we when we get to that point and that things that were previously associated with safety all of a sudden became associated with danger you know things we take for granted like hugging a grandparent you know what i mean um so you know we have to be patient in allowing our brains to to kind of uh readjust back i think no that's great thank you for that that really thoughtful answer uh and and really thank you for your entire uh uh presentation today i know we're a little bit long so my apologies both to you christina as well as to our audience we just had so many interesting things and for those who sent a question and we didn't get to it i i apologize we just didn't have the time for everything um but i hope still that everyone got a lot out of of today's uh today's talk so i would i would just like to say again my sincere thanks uh to our speaker dr christina hasidia uh for sharing her wisdom and her expertise today so much good stuff to take from this so with that again my thanks have a wonderful day and be well thank you for participating in this webinar hosted by the institute for child development and family relations at california state university san bernardino providing guidance for parents and families based on science and best practice since 2002 ,True,False,False,False

For business enquiries: limkopi@ourgrandfatherstory.com","What? Huh? [Inaudible] How do you begin [Laughs] answering this? Being completely honest at least 10 percent was that way like, most of the time. But the other 90 percent of it was just trying to fix myself. I think I'm trying to look decent. [Laughs] Not 'hot' per se, maybe just presentable. I was overweight (80kg) and I could only fit into guy's clothing at the time. I mean the girls in my class they were so much slimmer than I was they could fit into all these nice clothes and I couldn't. So I didn't think I looked presentable and I couldn't fit in with all of them just because I was too fat. No, not 'hot' but like I think just to look pretty on stage on film. I do have a lot of friends and classmates who do look good on stage so I felt like I wanted to match up to their standards. So I remember when I was 12 I went shopping with my mum. We were trying to find jeans or something but nothing fitted me. And the salesperson, she looked at me up and down and she said, ""I think she should just go somewhere else. Nothing is going to fit you here."" And I was like, ""Okay..."" And then it started. It just went downhill from there. That was the trigger point. When I was around 14 years old I went to a friend's birthday party and we were all wearing bikinis. And then we took a lot of photos Then we posted the photos on Facebook and then my friend told me that this guy saw my photos and then he said something about my body. I suddenly felt conscious ""Oh people actually care, people actually give a shit."" The main (trigger) I remember was this family friend. He asked, ""Have you eaten?"" And I said, ""Yes, I have."" and he said, ""Yes, it's pretty obvious you've eaten."" It was from then that something just clicked like ""Oh, people see me like this people see me as the 'fat kid'. So I have to do something about it."" It's all through people's comments like, ""Oh hey, why do you suddenly look a bit chubbier? Did you eat a lot? You look fatter."" That kind of thing from parents and relatives especially. I guess those words kind of took a toll it kind of affected me a little bit. Like, ""Shit, did I gain weight?"" and that's when I realised ""Hey, why don't I try purging?"" So, the first time I purged (out food) I used a toothbrush. Because I actually didn't know how to do it so I realised that if I just kept gagging, it would come out. Looking attractive was definitely part of the reason. But, after a while it transforms into something else it's way beyond the desire to look attractive. It is an obsession, an addiction. Like it is an obsession with (being in) control. Yes, definitely. I lost a significant amount of weight. Within a span of 2 months I lost close to 20 kilograms. So maybe in the morning, I would have a slice of bread (for breakfast) that was it. And then maybe for lunch I would have Milo and then for dinner I would have Milo again then that was it. [Laughs] Yes, I lived like that for, I think close to 3 years of my life. Looking back I really don't know how I did it but yes, I did. I actually lost about, 6 to 7 kilograms over 5 months. (My weight) was about 51-52 kilograms and that's really underweight for my height (171cm). But for me, I didn't care about (being) underweight. I just cared about the numbers on the weighing scale. If I didn't look a certain way that I wanted to look like I would take (my actions to) an even further extent to do so. Like, I would go to the gym to do excessive exercise, do really intense workouts and just not eat as much after that. So I would do anything just to reach that limit as fast as I could. I think I was about 60... 69, 68 (kilograms) for my height, I'm 175cm. I feel like I always have to explain myself. Like, ""Oh, I'm tall."" I hate that, but anyway. My lowest (weight) was 52 kilograms yeah, around 50 kilograms. This was when I was restricting my diet and I was running a lot. What did I do? I didn't eat. The less I ate in a day, the more shiok (satisfying) it felt. Go on Tumblr (for diet tips), it was so screwed up. (The Tumblr pages) would tell you ""Day 1: Eat how many calories Day 2: Eat how many calories."" I would just follow it. But it came to a point where I didn't even need to follow it. I just didn't eat. Don't eat, and then exercise. It was a very simple (way) to live. ""This is my goal, these are the steps to get there to my goal."" And it was working. It felt so good, even though the goal made no sense. From the period of 12 to 13 (years old) I lost (around) 10 to 15 kilograms and at that point I was quite small-sized already. Those feelings of, ""I still need to fix myself. Something is wrong."" It just didn't go away. That's when it transitioned into bulimia because I felt so (angry) and disgusted with myself. I knew for a fact that this level of self-disgust wasn't normal but I didn't know what to do about it so I started purging and throwing up (food). It was just a lot of self-hatred. If you had looked at me back then, you would've thought that ""She looks perfectly fine, perfectly normal-sized."" But I still didn't think I was (normal-sized). So I couldn't physically bring myself to the (clothing) store and try on clothes because I knew that if I tried on clothes and it wasn't an S (Small) or it wasn't an XS (Extra Small size) I wouldn't feel good about myself. So my mum would always tell me ""(You) look so good. (You're) beautiful."" I mean, I'm her daughter. I'll always be the most beautiful girl in her eyes. But, to me it's just empty words because at that point it wasn't even about how I looked anymore. It was about (having control over my life), it was like... finding an identity. [Laughs] I feel like that's a very dangerous question to answer. V: Yeah.
I feel like that's a very dangerous question to answer. But in a nutshell, yes, I was very proud that I was doing something to fix what was wrong with me. I don't know why I found pride in suffering. It's like, ""I'm purging, I'm not eating I'm hungry, I lost my period, my body is changing I'm growing random hair."" When you get very bad anorexia you start growing hair in random places because your body is trying to keep it warm V: Yeah, yeah.
or something like that. I was like, ""Yes. Like, look at me."" I was just so empowered that people were noticing that something was wrong with me. It was a silent victory you're just like, ""Yes, something is wrong with me."" I was very proud of myself for losing all the weight. I felt like it was an accomplishment. Everyone was complimenting me, asking me for tips on how to lose weight. Nobody thought it was a problem at the time. I didn't think it was a mental condition at that time. I thought I was picking up strategies from this disorder to make it work for me. When everything felt like it was in control, in my life then yes, I was proud of myself. But when everything went south when I became bulimic that was suffering to me because I was completely out of control. Like, it was so bad and I was not proud of myself, I was disgusted. I finally acknowledged ""Okay, this is a problem."" In the past, yes I knew ""This (orthorexia) is a problem but it's a problem that makes me feel good."" But this (bulimia) was actually a problem that was hindering my existence. I couldn't do anything but binge, and purge, and think about food. I had the mindset of not telling anybody at all. Thinking back about it, I just think to myself ""How?"" Like how did I reach that extent where even when I was out with my friends I could take the opportunity to go to the toilet and purge successfully without them completely realising about it? I just wanted to go through this by myself. Because I felt like, if I told them they would tell me the same thing ""You know, this is unhealthy for you. You should really stop."" Every time when my friends would talk about anorexia (or eating disorders) I would just say, ""Oh, why would people want to vomit their food out?"" ""Why do people have anorexia or eating disorders?"" In a way, it's for me to hide like, disguise myself so that people wouldn't suspect that I had it. It's very hard to make real long-lasting connections because there's this V: Yes I agree.
long-lasting connections because there's this big part of your life that you're just not telling anyone and when they ask, ""Oh, how are you feeling? How are you doing?"" And you're just like, ""I'm fine."" And like, by just lying like that you cut off 90 percent of potential friendships. For eating disorders, I feel like the reasons are always very shameful V: Yeah.
are always very shameful V: Yeah.
or like we feel very ashamed of it. It's like, ""One day when I get to the place where I feel comfortable in, then I will show the world who I am."" But it never got there. I don't think you will ever get there. Like, if the reasons are  not healthy, you're never going to get to a healthy space. What happened was I started passing out all over the place. Once, I passed out in church and then once, I think I passed out at the airport and then once, I passed out at the supermarket. So, at this point my parents had had enough with me. I think, my parents at the time they didn't really know how to handle the situation. And it's not because they didn't want to it was because it was very foreign to them the concept of an eating disorder. So to them it was just ""You eat. Eat and everything will be okay."" I got caught by my current boyfriend. He actually kind of, sort of realised it because every time I came out from the toilet I would have watery eyes. So I told him everything on the spot because I felt like there was no point hiding it anymore. Eventually I'm going to run out of excuses and can't be giving the same excuses every time. He was just there, comforting me and just trying to get through this with me together. I didn't really go through therapy or anything like that. But, I guess I got tired of purging. And tired of feeling pain and soreness in the throat. I was afraid that this would affect the relationship maybe we would fight more or something. I guess with him being more strict it's kind of a good thing for me so that I can get my mind straight. Like, ""This is serious and I have to do this."" What made me decide to seek help was that I knew I was going to shut down soon. I wasn't able to put up this facade for any longer. I wasn't able to go to school and do well anymore. I told my mum I told her like, ""I really, I think I cannot (handle it) anymore."" So she contacted a psychologist a psychiatrist, everything. So I went to see a psychiatrist. I'm so thankful because (my mum) is always there to make everything better. When I was 18 (years old) the insides of my throat and my oesophagus got burned so badly I went to the doctor and he said, ""You need to stop or else you'll need to go for surgery."" In my mind, I was thinking ""Okay, I need to stop purging because my parents will worry"", and I didn't want them to worry (about me), I didn't want to go for the (operation). And then it transitioned into a panic attack disorder so I was having panic attacks all the time. It was during the season when I was seeing the counsellor for my panic attacks and trying to not get back to bulimia. When it turned out I'm a... like, I'm a survivor of sexual abuse from when I was younger V: Mmm.
from when I was younger V: Mmm.
and I think, knowing and I think, knowing what I went through before explained a lot of things for me. It explained a lot of the self-disgust, the shame, and the image issues and the panic and the fear. The main reason why I try to fight my eating disorder or all my mental battles in my head is because I have a daughter now so, she's ten months (old) and I mean, I can't be the best mum to her, if I myself am struggling. So I try my best to stay physically and mentally healthy. I want to be a good example to her in the future. I want her to grow up happy, healthy and confident. I used to idolise supermodels and used to glorify eating disorders. It used to be my screensavers. Now, she's my main inspiration. I think recovery is never in a straight line there's no end point to it. You can't say that you have fully recovered because there will be days when you slip a bit you fall, and that's okay. It doesn't mean you've failed in your recovery. I try to avoid triggers by telling myself that no matter what other people say it's just their opinion just don't think about it. I haven't encountered that moment yet that I had to lose weight for an (acting) role. If I do encounter that I'm scared that I will go through this eating disorder again. I feel like I've come to a point where I can I'm learning how to love my body. Like if I have a double chin or my arms are flabby it's still me, I'll still love myself. After I dropped out of JC (Junior College) I went to a (polytechnic) I picked up a sport, touch rugby. So having a sport to work towards really pushed me in my recovery because it changed my mindset about beauty. Instead of working towards being smaller I work towards being stronger, being faster, being fitter. It was about shifting my goals into something that was healthy for me, for my body. I have a weighing scale, but I don't actively weigh myself because I don't want that to be a definition of what I am. Like now? A bit of fat here and there cellulite here and there it's not so bad. I think ultimately if you feel good inside and you like what you are doing with yourself then you are beautiful. This is going to sound so lame and cliched but like to me, if they are beautiful it's not about how they look. It's about how you feel when you are around them. It's the aura that they radiate the energy that they put out. They just start to look beautiful also. It's really internal, inside-out rather than outside-in. I feel like I see the beauty in a lot of different people in different ways. It's like, I will notice the small things about someone that they might not even like about themselves. So for example, some girls have very small eyes and I think that is very beautiful I like to make it a point to tell people that I like something about them. Whether it be their smile or like ""You have very cute ears."" Or something like that as long as it doesn't sound strange like, I will try to point it out tell them, like you know positivity (is important). V: ""You go girl!""
positivity (is important). V: ""You go girl!""
S: ""You go girl!"" S: ""You go girl!"" Wow okay. There was actually this one woman who DMed (Direct Messaged) me I think a few months ago and she was asking me for help like, how to (help her) get through her eating disorder. She's a mum of three or four kids and she said that it's making it very difficult for her to be a mum because she's so focused on her eating disorder that she cannot do anything else beyond that. And it makes me so sad because she was so ashamed to have an eating disorder at this age. She said, ""I feel like I'm too old for this. I should be smarter than this."" That's what a lot of people don't understand an eating disorder does not choose anyone of a certain gender, a certain age. It can happen to men, it can happen to women who are over 50 It's not about whether you're smart or stupid you're rich or you're poor, it's a mental health condition so it can literally affect anyone. If you are suffering (from) an eating disorder I would say, try to go to someone who you trust. Talk this out with them and if you need their help to control you from purging or constantly eating then let them help you and just keep reminding yourself that you can get through this and it will end someday. Don't know when, but you can get through this. Yeah. I think because we have been taught to downplay it V: Yeah.
""Oh it's just anorexia, just give her a burger. V: Yeah.
Eat a burger."" That's why a lot of people don't acknowledge it and that's why it's hard to treat. I feel like my eating disorder in the past perhaps was me trying to find a grounding in life trying to find an identity. Like, if I couldn't be anything else at least I could be a skinny person. So even though I am still figuring out who I am as a person I try to focus on what I am rather than what I'm not. And what I want to be what I don't want to be. Focus on the things that I can work on rather than the things that are completely out of my control. Yeah. Hey guys, hope you enjoyed this episode. Eating disorders aren't always associated  with anorexia. You don't have to be severely underweight to be diagnosed with one. The symptoms can be invisible too. Overcoming an eating disorder requires a lot of willpower and courage and if you are struggling with an eating disorder now we hope this episode can encourage you to seek help.

Gayle Kaplan professor of medicine at the University of Calgary he's an adult gastroenterologist and epidemiologist he is the chair of our scientific medical advisory council as well as a board of director with Crohn's and Colitis Canada and dr. Eric Benjamin he's an associate professor and gastroenterologist Department of Pediatrics and school of epidemiology and public health at the University of Ottawa division of Gastroenterology at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario he's also chair elect of our scientific medical advisory council thank you and enjoy the webinar Thank You Mina thanks Mina yes so today it's our ninth webinar started back on March 19th and what we thought we'd do is something a little bit different and first I just wanted to kind of share a little bit of the history of the Cova task force the webinar and where we are today just to kind of explain to you why we're doing something a little bit different today so back on March 11 the w-h-o proclaimed kovat as a global pandemic and that day will go down in history as such a monumental day and we all know what's happened since since then and as I think of you like the day after Eric and I with Mina as well as Kate Lee got together to organize a meeting of this scientific medical advisory council to try to understand what with this pandemic how would it impact patients with IBD and the IVD community and you have to remember we had this was a brand new virus we had no idea how this was going to impact anyone there was no data on it we were just based on kind of expert opinion and what was happening in previous with previous viruses that have affected humans that might be potentially related we realized that this smack needed to be broadened and so instead of just convening this Mac we've actually expanded out and created a national task force and included representation across the country adult and pediatric gastroenterologist nurses patients voices infectious disease specialists to be able to help us kind of figure things out and so we've came together we started making our first sets of recommendations and we asked the question well how do we communicate this because most people probably not going to just wander onto the CCC's website and that was where the idea of doing these webinars was was born and our first one happened on March 19th and we decided as to do it on a weekly series with a format where it was kind of start after the introductions where I would kind of give an update on where kovat was in the world in Canada and update any kind of the epidemiological data that's happening both from a copepod perspective but also from an inchoate and IBD perspective and I do like being an epidemiologist foundation of my research focusing on IBD in epidemiology and then Eric would then update the recommendations that were made by the taskforce on the Tuesday night preceding the webinar and then what we did was we asked you the community questions to ask us what are the key questions that you have and that's actually helped us in two critical ways the first way is that it's helped to find these webinars and the second way is it actually helped us figure out what to focus on on the task force because so many times you ask questions we do next have the answers for them and that's what then we met as a group and said you know our infusion center safe you know what should we be recommending in terms of medication things that guide the questions that you had were the key questions that we had and so the last part of the webinar series was to create kind of segments that were drawn from your questions and bringing in experts from four different expertise in different areas of practice to come on and answer those questions in segments and so that's what we've been doing throughout the course of the last eight weeks and what we decided to do tonight which was a little bit different was not actually invite any panelists Eric and I be moderating these sessions and it's actually a pretty easy job we just get to ask questions and put a little bit input here and there and today we decided to kind of challenge yourselves and actually answer your questions and part of it was we've had a list of questions and we haven't not necessarily answered all of them and also some of them have been asked and answered but there's such pressing questions that we just wanted to kind of go back and review them together so I'm going to give my short relatively short update here in a second answer a few of the questions as part of my presentation and then bring Eric and I back and then we'll just field other questions that you've posed already we've we have them prepared to answer or any questions that you the audience might have for us and and again just says Sarah I mentioned earlier we can't answer medical questions we can't answer personal medical questions but we can answer around those types of questions to me what I'll do is um give it to our weekly update and hopefully everyone can see this screen is always my very first screen and again I just want to start by thanking Joseph Windsor and Stephanie coward just to give you a sense every week we're presenting data from you know the Thursday so today is May 14th so my my team downloads this data from different sources they crunch numbers and then make these really amazing slides that I then get the opportunity to present and back on march 19th you can see here there was 230 thousand Canadians who are sorry 300 thousand people across the world who had tested positive for kovat this is data from John Hopkins University and you can see it on this map the number of people who have tested positive the people who have died those who have recovered a week later that numbers doubled to half a million people and then we've done so many that I don't have enough space to show every single week not to mention that at the time it would take but we at the last three weeks from April 30th three million people May seventh last week when we did our webinar 3.8 million people and today as of just before noon 4.4 million people across the world have been diagnosed with with Kovan and unfortunately now over 300,000 people have died from the disease reported in a hundred and eighty eight countries this is a map that I I started showing a few weeks ago because we got to the point where you could actually take John Hopkins global data and start to look at which of the countries that are the hardest hit and now there are 46 countries that have reported at least 10,000 cases in what you're going to see here are countries that are green have reported one to 50 cases per hundred thousand so this is standardized against the size of the country so a country like the u.s. of course is going to have more cases in Canada because it's a bigger country so standardized against the size of the country you can see that the yellow is 50 to 200 cases per hundred thousand and the hardest-hit countries are those who are reporting over 200 cases per hundred thousand and again even of these green ones these are countries now that are showing more cases you can see Russia's been in the news quite a bit and it's now jumped from gray to green and now as a yellow country Canada now at 194 cases per hundred thousand is creeping up to that 200 case but really the hardest hit countries are those in red you can see the top 11 that are over 200 cases per hundred thousand here on the side now what about Canada specifically this is data from ESRI Canada and you can see here that when we started on March 19th there were 782 cases and across the country and then on the time that we jumped a week later there was order over 3,000 and 400 cases again skipping a few webinars and Oh to April 30th three weeks ago 52,000 Canadians were diagnosed with kovat last week the number was almost 64,000 and now we're at seventy two thousand five 100 individuals who have tested positive for kovat and currently there are over 5,000 canadians who have passed away from from kovat so specifically if we look at the provinces these are cases per each province so you can look to see where you're living and you can see the number of cases of people who have tested positive for kovat and data downloaded from public health agency of Canada and you can see that Quebec and Ontario have the largest number of cases again these are also very large provinces so now if we standardize these numbers against the size of the population so we're looking at the number of cases per hundred thousand people living in the province we can see that Kobach continues to be the hardest-hit province in the country at 470 case hundred thousand and again if you remember this slide I showed you before about the world Quebec is you know as hard-hit as any of the top ten countries in the world Alberta where I lived was 144 cases permit thousand I was seeming to equal that of Ontario we continue to see Manitoba being steadily at 20 cases per 2000 although Saskatchewan has climbed up a little bit in the last few weeks BC is kind of maintained in that 40 to 50 range and in the Maritimes you can see Nova Scotia being the hardest-hit province so this is data from Statistics Canada and so Stephanie coward every Thursday downloads this data and what we're looking at here are the risk of bad things happening if you get diagnosed with kovat and you can see that from a Canadian perspective eighty percent of Canadians who have been diagnosed with Kovan have had mild symptoms and remember this the denominator here is people who were diagnosed with kovat the actual number of people who've been exposed to the virus and have not been sick enough to need to be tested is a large larger number so we expect that if we did a population to screen for example if we looked at antibodies across the population that this number actually would be higher but among those who are coded positive we can see 11% end up in hospital three percent in ICU and our fatality rate is 60% in climbing again the reason why this number is a little bit higher than this number is because there are people who pass away at long-term care facilities who don't unnecessarily end up in hospital or there individuals who are elderly the end up being hospitalized but that I don't accept you know ICU care and so on like that now if we stratify these outcomes by ages we continue to see that children and adolescents are always doing well and I realize this on a weekly basis and I think this was also emphasized last week when we had eminent pediatric gastroenterologist from across North America talked to us about children and adolescents with IBD as you can see here Canadians you know the vast majority of them who have been tested positive for kovat have done very very well similarly adults between the ages of 20 and 59 have actually done very well in the case fatality rate is less than 1% this is important because if you look at countries that are other countries in the Western world like the United States and this age group has done worse than Canadians higher rates of hospitalization higher case fatality rates as well but of course the most vulnerable population in our society as well as in every country across the world is our elderly population of which 20% end up in hospital 4% ICU and again the case fatality rate is quite high and again when we talk about kind of risk stratified guidelines it's this type of data that that is affecting the decisions that the Cova task board is taking all right so I want to pivot a little bit to answering a few questions and we this past week we accumulated a whole series of questions being asked for the past few weeks to look at the ones that haven't been answered adequately or the ones that were so common that we wanted to kind of reach I call them again and so this is a question that I don't think we really answer but I think is a fundamental question to think about as we think about some of the other questions that we're going to answer in the future which is how long is the pandemic home to last and to be frankly honest nobody knows all we can do is look at what we have seen in history and see if we can extrapolate that information to what we're dealing with today but it's still an important exercise to do because when we're thinking about recommendations or thinking about what we should be doing we have to think about in the context of not what's going to happen in one or two weeks or even one or two months maybe in the context of one or two years and so I want to show three different scenarios that are being proposed and this is data from the Center for infectious disease research and policy it's a group that's out of the University of Minnesota and includes experts from like Harvard School of Public Health these are infectious disease epidemiologist and and they've actually published a really good report that I think is a high value to read and the links right here for anyone who wants to kind of read through the whole report and what they've tried to do is say okay let's look back at previous pandemics and see what happened to them and and what would it look like in our case in 2020 and 2021 if you know we follow the same patterns and this is was the pattern of the 1918-1919 pandemic which was the last you know the most major pandemic in the last hundred years and what you could see here and so if you kind of this is projecting out for December 2019 out to April 2022 and we are right now in this part right here where we have this first peak in the spring of 2020 and similarly in 1918 there was a peak in the spring of 1918 now what happened in the 1918 pandemic is that they had a large second wave it really was the fall of 2019 18 that he saw the highest number of cases and that outcomes occur it then leveled off they had another kind of peak not as bad as the spring of 2009 teen 18 but then another one in the spring of 1919 and then it essentially petered out in the summer of 1919 and the whole idea of this concept of this large second peak is that you end up getting so many people infected that essentially you've developed that herd immunity on a relatively short period of time time that 18 months has kind of passed that the virus is kind of gotten less impactful in in society now this is any of these scenarios are possible but we feel that this is probably not a probable scenario because there's a lot of things that have happened in the last hundred years in medicine and in healthcare and in public health we're now in a position where we know so much more information all of the things that we're redoing in it from a public health perspective is all designed to try to mitigate these types of curves and so we don't think that this is we don't think we're going to necessarily follow the 1918-19 model another scenario might be this one what's called peaks and valleys and it's again essentially we have the where we are today in in the spring of 2020 and then in the summer we get a valley things level off and then in the fall we get another one and then it levels off and then there's another peak you can see this wave and and this one I think if anyone looks at it would be extremely frustrating because if you look at this year you'd start to think well maybe you know whatever is happening here to us right now over the last two months we get relaxed and then oh no all of a sudden we're going to have the exact same things happen to us here and then a few months later it's going to happen again and that's not necessarily the true reality of this type of scenario the biggest difference between this peak and this peak is the time between the two and the knowledge that's gained and the ability to prepare and the fact that society has become accustomed to it and so at you know a future Peaks we have better antiviral agents we have better mechanisms to control things a lot of the physical restrictions that we've been doing now have really just been there to buy time to get better tests to get better preparation to you know stock up on PPE things like that so we'll be at a better position to fight this virus at this point in time even if we end up seeing similar number of cases the scenario that we're hoping to see is going to be this slow burn scenario and that's really where the worst of it is behind us but what we realize is that even as we get past this first wave we haven't actually eradicated the virus the only way that we essentially kind of get rid of this virus is if we have a vaccine against it or enough people are infected that they start to protect other people and and we have less infections from person to person in this scenario though we constantly are seeing kovat cases month after month after month but never at a point where it overwhelms a healthcare system and again knowledge is advancing month after month and we were ready and we're prepared so the reason that I think this is important to show you these different scenarios and to recognize and to acknowledge that this is likely going to be a battle that we have over not months but probably years is that when we start to think about other questions and how we answer them and what recommendations we give you we have to realize that these are things that are going to happen over the course of months if not years and so we need to balance the recommendations we give to you in the context of the reality of where the world is is going and I'll come back to that when I answer some questions around physical distancing and and risks of kind of going out into into the community now here's two questions that have been asked very commonly it's what do we know from cases of people with IBD who have gotten the kovat virus and what are the risks of Kovan 19 for particular IBD medications and I'm going to answer both of these questions by talking about the secure database if all goes well technically you should everyone should be able to see this website and I will just ask my colleagues to text me if there's any issues of not being able to see the website but I'm going to presume everyone can see it now and Erica just type looks good okay good so this is the secure and just to preface kind of reviewing the data on this database we actually had on entire webinar dedicated to the secure IBD registry this is a registry of now over a thousand cases of individuals who have inflammatory bowel disease who have tested positive for Kovic and their physicians have reported it into this registry and you can see that they reported it from countries all over the world essentially you know in North America and South America Australia Europe Asia all of these countries are reporting cases this database I've been fortunate to actually be part of them we actually are just just got our first paper except for publication in a journal called gastroenterology on the weekend so we can start to share the data and people can actually scrutinize the data as well when they if they lead the study my one of the rules that my team has had was that we've actually developed this interactive web-based map that you can all go to at any point in time and you can actually see the data in real time we update this every week so this is updated for May 12th earlier this week a couple days ago and this this was all done by my byfox under word she is a geographer that works in my research lab and you can see here all the cases you can actually even click on countries and you can see that you know Canada with there's 20 cases reported in Canada of people by VD and one of those 20 cases have died the one thing you have to remember about about cases their death we suspect that this is going to have a selection bias of reporting towards more sick people and that's what we think that if you if you had a sick case of obedience and they passed away or something that happened to them that is going to be a much more memorable case and that physician to much more likely to report this and people who are have had mild disease similarly if you've had cases of IBD and you didn't get tested and but you had couvade you wouldn't make it into this registry so the first question is who's kind of at highest risk and what we see here is you can see the number of people being diagnosed stratified by age groups and you can see here that if you're under the age of 30 not a single child has died across the world from from kovat and the other outcomes that we look at here are hospitalizations and got getting into the ICU and again kids have done tremendously well and including young adults between the ages of 20 or 30 and really kind of these red bad outcomes are only happening as you get older but even between 30 and 60 and remember this is all over the world not just you know North America where outcomes are probably a bit better than in countries that are poor you can see that most adults have done well as well the group that is at highest risk is our elderly population and each decade that you're older the higher the risk is of dying or ending up in hospital or ended up in an ICU and that's why when we shifted our recommendations we've shifted them to being age specific recommendations so and Eric will talk a little bit later on about the website and how we've changed your recommendations to accommodate the fact that the younger you are the less likely you're going to be impacted the other question that was asked was all around treatments and so who are people that are risk relative to their drugs that they're on and again I can't go through every single drug but the key things I just want to acknowledge is that we even though a thousand cases a lot it's still not enough to really tease out a lot of good information you need hundreds and hundreds of people on a drug to really see if that drug has arrests so you can just turn around here jack and Hitler that's tofacitinib which is a very specialized drug for all sort of colitis we have very few cases so we're not really able to report on that one whereas over here you can see this is anti-tnf therapy and I apologize this is written kind of for an academic audience but auntie Tina therapy is Remicade Humera or the biosimilars of Remicade and without six MPAs of thiamine methotrexate means that you're just on Remicade Humira or one of the Remicade biosimilars on its own we can see that there's over 300 people who have been coded positive on the on a drug like like Remicade or Humira and very few have had any bad outcomes and we did analyses compared those who were on an anti-tnf agent against those who didn't have an ATF agent we saw no signals for increased risk and that's led us to say that from a recommendations perspective or actually feel that if you're on a drug like Remicade or Humera you're your risk is likely no different than if you're not on it and that's in part some of the reasons that we've kind of lessened a bit of the rules on the anti teen of therapies and recognizing that we still have limited data so we always want to be cautious in any of these recommendations but this is definitely reassuring and the biggest difference was when we started our task force nine ten weeks ago we had none of this data to guide us so this is now reassuring and this data climbs you can actually see the number of cases reported the first one was on March 13 so you can see how many Crohn's and all sort of colitis cases that we reported ever since and you can see that those numbers are going higher and higher so as you get more cases it'll get more data and we'll be able to update you as well the other thing I wanted to say was that the one thing that we did see in this database was that if you are on high doses of prednisone you had very active disease that put you at increased risk for bad outcomes and really that's consistent with all of our recommendations going back 10 weeks ago essentially if you're well in remission whatever is keeping you in that state you want to stay on that drug and not stop it because the highest risk scenario is if you were to flare any prednisone that's when things become more difficult so I'm just going to pivot back here and what level of physical distance should I practice and what are the recommendations for people with IBD as things begin to reopen and really what these questions come down to is the provinces are starting to let people come out of their homes and you know what to recommend for you to be home isolated when everyone goes on a lockdown was a very easy recommendation but we realize that we can't tell people necessarily that you know if you're 35 and your each work and you can't necessarily hold my sleigh for two years so we had to take that into consideration and really what I do and this is what I do with my patients and when I think about risks I really think about this as a risk matrix and our personal risk is something that has to be developed between you and your physician but we can give you a bit of guidance and so if you're young like remember they under the age of 20 we haven't seen that outcomes at all not no IBD population not in the general population similarly if you're young and you're immunosuppressed or you're on a drug Remicade or Humera you know your risk is likely higher than somebody who's not on those drugs but we still think that it's really low similarly if you're an adult your risk starts to go up of having a bad outcome with kovat and likely if your immunosuppressed your under drug like Remicade or your drug like Humera those risks are likely higher but as I showed you from the security database we're not seeing strong signals that that those risks are very very high the ones that we are seeing at the highest risk are people who are severely active and on prednisone but remember this is a reversible risk you could be sick today we could get you on treatment and then you could be well in a month from now or eight weeks from now and then all of a sudden your risk would then fall back to the yellow area of course the toughest group are the people who are older as I showed you the data and it doesn't matter if you have IBD if you don't you're an older individual and you get exposed to cold what your risk is going to be higher and this is the population that we need to protect and the older you are the higher the risk if you're in your 80s it's our it's a higher risk and if your your sixties and if you have other chronic core morbidities like heart disease and lung disease it's that risk becomes higher as well and then you've got to then balance it against personal hardship so if you're an older individual and you're retired and you don't you know financially said it's a lot easier for you to stay home then if you're in your 30s you're the single breadwinner for your family and if you don't work you're you end up you know losing your economic viability that hardship is much harder there and so I kind of think this is kind of an escalating hardship and this is relatively simplified for an example but you can see here if you are if you have somebody who is at higher risk but you have the capacity to either you know to work from home your job allows that well then that's easier hardship than somebody whose job they can't work from home with and then if you can't work from home with there's certain jobs where there's Lois exposure at your work so for example you might work in an office building where there's tremendous physical distancing people are wearing masks there the employment they take the work you do is in an office or a cubicle so you can kind of keep yourself away from people well that's different than if you're in a high exposure to risk such as being a frontline healthcare provider we're going an emergency department or if you're in you drive an uber and you don't know who's coming into the back of your car or if you work you know as a teller in this grocery supermarket so when you start thinking about this matrix you have to ask yourself where are you and again this part this personal risk is a little bit based on you and your doctor talking about it but if your personal risk is relatively low and you have flexibility in what you do then I just argue to take extra precautions you can if you have the option of working from home or working in an office and you have that flexibility even if your risk was low why don't you work from home because you're just taking that little extra precaution a bit more than than the average person who doesn't necessarily have my obedient eye on a drug like camara but you're just doing that little extra more if you're you're you have greater hardship you have to do things that are hard about your risk is low well then just follow what the public health is telling you to do and as the provinces open up things you can follow them just like the rest the society because your risk level is on the low side if your risk is on the high side of things and that's kind of if you're elderly or you're actively sick if it's feasible and easy then clearly home isolation is important and and again and this is can be called relative home isolation people can still you know walk outside things like that you just want to be careful of being exposed and contracting on the flip side of that is if you're at a higher risk and you're having a lot of hardship and what you do decisions well it becomes a personal decision of what you do whether you continue a certain job whether you continue to take certain risks to give you a personal example I have asthma also had lung collapses on both my lungs when I was younger and I even though I don't have my vdn I'm not immunocompromised I recognize that as a frontline healthcare provider somebody who is going to be working in in lick'em on call this weekend of the hospital that I'm putting myself at higher risk by doing that job but I'm making that personal decision around all of you know of Who I am what I'm doing and because of that you know I'm going for it and doing this this work so with that and I apologize that I didn't actually think I would be talking this long but I do want to bring in Eric and I just want as they're kind of comes in on board just kind of highlight the fact that you know there was a time before code that we were hanging out watching a baseball game the Blue Jays as a few years back and we are both looking forward to the world getting back to this point it may not happen in the next days weeks months it may be a bit longer for us but we are going to be here answering your questions until we get back to this point so I'm just going to stop sharing my screen here and so I will take some questions I don't want to show my screen quite yet why don't we start with some questions and then as we take some questions will will show the website and show you know where we can where you might be able to find some of the answers on the website so we'll start off with question 1 which I mean I can take or you can take ill I know we were actually talking just today about this question with dr. Shia by email because some new developments have come out so the question came from the audience is there any new evidence of kovat affecting pregnancy in people with Crohn's or the general population so when dr. Seau and dr. Pham who he presented on this topic on sort of maturing mothers and newborns with i BD & co vid and what was happening that was I think week 2 you know there really wasn't much evidence but there were some reports from China that Cova did not seem to affect pregnant women any more severely than other women of the same age and that it didn't seem to get transmitted through pregnancy certainly we knew that if a mother was actively infected and coughing and that could infect the baby but we didn't think it was being transmitted through pregnancy gilled you want to talk about some of the new studies that just came out yeah well so there's just been recent recent case reports where there has been evidence what we call vertical transmission so if you're pregnant and you have active kovat and you have pregnant about deliver a baby there's been case reports where the dick Ovid was actually discovered in in the newborn as well and again when we say case reports that means that in the world of experience all of the physicians around the world are trying to look for unique patterns and anytime something unique happens we we report that and and we start to learn from it but it means that there's only been a handful of cases out of the whole world which means there have been the vast majority of pregnancies have been in women who've not had kovat and we haven't seen any issues there have been women who have had kovat had pregnancy and if not had vertical transmission and now we're identifying that there is the potential that that can can happen and and what that means is i mean obviously we have less control in terms of timing of pregnancies deliveries and and in that but it means that the health care system has to be prepared for that knowledge and has to be set up in such a way to protect everyone in that pregnancy unit from the health care provider as a physician the nurse who's doing the delivery to the mother to the partner is beside the mother to the fetus is born in Eric maybe as a pediatrician I'm wondering if you can give a sense of what would happen in that kind of scenario if somebody again these are very rare scenarios but if somebody did have Kovan inch and the baby was born in that scenario what would happen from a healthcare perspective to in the neonatal you know yeah so I mean the first thing to just make note of is even in these cases of vertical transmission the babies did fine there was no you know birth defects and there's been no reports of any birth defects when mother gets it while she's pregnant and in these in the two cases that I'm aware of one from China and one from Toronto actually in both cases the baby was asymptomatic so the only reason they knew that the baby had Co vyd infected in the womb was because they did antibodies on the baby and those antibodies wouldn't show up until three to seven days after the baby was infected which is when the baby was still in the womb we know some of the problems with those antibody tests you probably heard on the news they're not perfect tests so we don't know for sure this is the case but the good news is that the babies were asymptomatic and did fine the Canadian pediatric ER Society is recommending that you know the baby continued to breastfeed and we just enact protective measures meeting masks gowns gloves the mother would be in an isolation room and you know so the baby would be protected from you know actively being coughed on but we would still continue to breastfeed and we would still continue to do as much as we could to you know have a normal newborn experience and and normal newborn growth and bonding with the mother so for right now anyway I don't think to too much has changed compared to when we talked about this at week two that you know we can still allow the baby to do all the normal baby things and just basically watch carefully I think is the bottom line so these two case reports really recommended that if the mother is infected with Cova Dean with the SARS co2 co2 virus that we just watched the baby we do special testing at birth of blood umbilical cord blood and placenta to see whether there was virus in those samples and then watch the baby carefully and so Eric the second question it says recommendations for protection against Co vid in a workplace where physical distance is not always possible should we wear protective gear avoid returning to work I mean I was covered those that topic you know broadly when I talked about the risk matrix and that personal risks like against the feasibility of your workplace I'm just curious to get your perspective on you know additional comments from from what I said earlier yeah no I mean I saw I think this is really covered in on the website quite a bit and it's it's the return to work in school guidelines so now I'll share my screen if I can let's see what I can do here so my screen and then we'll pull up the Crohn's and Colitis website so if you go to the Crohn's and Colitis CA website you'll see the the kovat 19 section and then go down to guidance and way at the bottom is reopening of schools and the economy and that's where you'll find information about back to school back to work and what sort of recommendations we've made and they are as Gil mentioned age based so if it's back to school back to work assuming there's no severe inflammation and not on steroids high dose steroids then back to school is a reasonable thing to do and if the child is actively inflamed or on steroids the parents that the family members anyway should do all of these things and this actually brings two point one of the other questions which was if I'm immunosuppressed taking multiple immunosuppressive agents and I live with multiple family members that are still working outside the home what should I do - what should they do to protect me and this is where the recommendations are they're here that if your household member good hand hygiene washing your hands for 20 to 30 seconds as soon as you walk through the door or even outside would be better with with hand sanitizer social distinct its physical distancing if possible of other family members who might be outside the home adhere to public health guidelines of saying trying to st. to metres apart avoiding in-person meetings and so on use services for vulnerable people and clean the residents as best as possible to avoid transmission and that's where the Centers for Disease Control guidelines come in which are shown here you can click the link to see about cleaning and disinfecting the house as often as you possibly can and then back to work here for adults really the guidance is the same so if you're not on high-dose steroids if you're not having severe inflammation or moderate to severe malnutrition we can talk about what that means in a second you're fairly safe to work outside the home personally I would recommend wearing a mask I think two things that the mask does is it may protect other people so protect you from coughing or sneezing or you know spreading saliva around to other people but also very importantly it protects you to a certain extent because it prevents you from touching your mouth and if you want to wear a visor on your eyes it also that will protect you from touching your eyes so I you know it prevents you from going constantly from touching your face and touching your mouth and things like that so a good idea to wear a mask if you're able to at work but essentially otherwise those instructions are all here and you can read about them the seniors is a little bit more difficult obviously because of the risk of serious kovat 19 and hospitalization and death in seniors and so I think again that's what Gil talked about in terms of assessing what your risk is and deciding what your risk tolerance is deciding what you're able to do and maybe what you can avoid doing and one of the questions in Eric you touched on it a little bit was this whole concept of how do we define malnourished how would I know that as a patient is it something I have to speak to doctor about and the short answer is that from a true kind of medical definition of malnourished man that is something that you would want to speak to your doctor about there's a few scenarios where malnourished mint happens I can speak with a narrow population so one scenario is there are some patients with Crohn's es for example I've had surgery's up there small bowel and you only have a finite amount of small bowel and if you lose too much of your small bowel you can get into a situation where you get what's called a short gut syndrome and it's literally as a shortcut like you have less about a surface area to absorb nutrients and then you can potentially be malnourished in that state some people in the extreme to that are actually have supplemental feeding through tubes or through an intravenous call that parental nutrition and in those scenarios being malnourished there's still a relative level nourishment if you're followed by an internal nutrition program clinic and they've got everything up to speed and you're feeling well you're you're not necessarily malnourished but you're at higher risk for malnourishment the other scenario are people who are very sick I mean most people on the webinar would know that you know when you've had a flare and you've lose your appetite and your caloric needs increase when you're super sick it's very easy to get malnourished in that state and that's again one of the reasons why we've identified people who are actively unwell with their disease they're flaring actively that they're at a higher risk not just because of drugs like prednisone but also because they're probably relatively mount malnourished again you know I'm sure has a dietician in his IBD clinic like we do we work really closely with our our patient populations with our local dietician to help make sure we can minimize malnourished met in all states erican from a kid perspective a pediatric perspective any differences that you would not really I mean you know I think it's exactly first it's I think it's important to note that we're talking about moderate to severe malnourished a little bit underweight is probably not going to impede your body's ability to fight infections and also being malnourished has been well described you know impeding your immune system for all sorts of different infections from bacteria to viruses to other things so it's not a good state to be in no matter what but I agree that I think it's important to speak to your doctor or your dietitian if you have one about this the dietitians have good ways of measuring whether or not you're malnourished whether it's how thick your ski is in a certain area of body or the circumference of your arms or other parts of your body to determine whether you're truly malnourished and can calculate what your energy expenditure is and other things to calculate what kind of calories you need to to take in so that's you know certainly one of the advantages of being in an IBD clinic where you've got multidisciplinary care and you've got nurses and dieticians and other other care providers who can do that for you I think for the most part you probably would have heard if your doctor was worried that you were malnourished I would suspect your doctor would have told you that so in general I mean I think a little bit underweight is not what we're talking about here and then question number five is when someone finishes tapering off prednisone would they still be in the high-risk category for certain period of time so just to give you a bit of context of where all of this prednisone came from so this actually predated any data that we had in the IBD community what happened was in China where the epicenters started what happens is there are people who most people get a fever in a cough and and they recover at home then a subset and the early numbers showed it was roughly around 20% end up being hospitalized and of those who end up in hospitalized they end up hospitalized because the infection goes into their lungs and causes difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels in the blood and a subset of them develop what's called an inflammatory response to lung so it's not so much even the virus attacking their lungs but it's very immune system overreacting and attacking the lungs and that leads to some people call this a cytokine cytokine storm which means that this huge inflammatory response there's a condition called a RDS which is where your lung fills with fluid because of this inflammatory response and that's what ends up people very difficult to be breathing and they need to be an intensive care unit on a ventilator to breathe and so a number of different different anti immune system therapies having tried to help that specific group the people who have gotten sick enough to end up needing to be in an ICU setting and so early on they tried prednisone because prednisone is an anti-inflammatory and it settles down inflammation anyone who's been on print because with flair recognized that's why we pretty prescribed it but in that population the people who were given prednisone did worse they did not necessarily have IBD they were actually given the print is going to treat their lung condition and things got worse so that gave us the first signal that this there could potentially be harm and because of that from a state of caution we right right back eight ten weeks ago said you know we should be avoiding minimizing the exposure to prednisone the data from the secure IBD registry which I showed you earlier also confirms that people who are on prednisone are more likely of that outcome than those who are not on it and similarly there's an analogous Rheumatology registry very similar to the IBD one that I showed you that looks at conditions like rheumatoid arthritis which also uses many of the same drugs that IBD patients have and in that registry they've also shown that prednisone is a risk for rheumatoid arthritis patients so I think there's a consistency in the data to suggest that prednisone is as a researcher now there isn't a specific dose effect to it and we think that says high-dose prednisone is the highest risk and the cutoff that we've identified is around 20 milligrams so above 20 milligrams what we're trying to do is to reduce that dose you know you can stop prednisone outright because your body's printers and essentially cortisol and if you were to stock that you become cortisol deficient and you can get really sick from that so what we're trying to do is taper down and in the inability to be able to get you down off of the prednisone that's where we like to use the world shielding what does shielding mean it means being home isolated and not only protective from the outside world but also shielding in your home and that would be the scenario where you would want to be very careful about your other members of your family but tend to be sick coming there so they want to be taking those precautions to minimize your risk if you're on prednisone because the truth is during this pandemic people are going to still need to be prescribed prednisone they're very sick if they are very sick with our IBD and so we have to balance these these risks that the IV D against the potential risk of colon so once you get down below 20 milligrams we do believe that those risks drop and it's a combination of getting lower and offer the prednisone and that you get better as well so the key is that we're using another therapy to reduce the dose of the prednisone and that other therapy whether it be Remicade humerus dallara xeljanz if you don't lose amount of material all the different drugs that are at our disposal we're using those to get you off of the steroids and those other drugs we are not seeing signals that they have the same harm that Prime Minister has hopefully that makes sense absolutely and I have to say we're almost at eight o'clock but I think we'll stay a little bit longer if people are interested and just finish that are out there yeah no it's not your fault we were all interested in what you have to say Gayle don't worry but there's some great questions and I'd hate to leave them unanswered so I'll ask you the next question Gil is there any new information about anti TNF medications having protective effects against contracting Cova 19 or the virus severity yeah it's an excellent question so it comes back to that whole concept of that cytokine storm that we talked about before so there are trials going on right now all across the world where people are using different types of anti inflammatory type medications many of them being monoclonal antibodies that block specific parts of the immune system just like the biologics that many of the people who are watching this are currently on and again it's they're not they're not using it for example to prevent you from getting cove aid or if you have mild disease it's really in this in the sickest population we don't yet have data from those trials to know that being on it on a drug works that that's information that we're waiting for but what we're trying to do from you know data like from the secure registry is to look to see once we have large enough numbers we might actually start to see signals when some of the specialized immune blocking medications we have if we started to see that there was a potential not only just a neutral effect but potentially a protective effect that wouldn't necessarily mean that that drug was protecting people but maybe we could give us a clue that we could design a randomized control study with that drug in that specific scenario so the truth is it still too soon to know but that data is emerging and I just go back to kind of the scenarios where I showed you all the different peaks that were happening I suspect in p2 or p3 you know months and months down the road the big difference is or we're going to have drugs like that at our disposal to use so that the risk of having a bad outcome six months from now I feel it's going to be much much less than it is today and then and then there's a question here about where would you fall if you're an adult but I'm going to say an out or a child immune suppress but also have under other underlying issues like we're sponsoring problems so for example Eric neo has changed a little bit for you if if there was a child who had type 1 diabetes and also inflammatory bowel disease and they were on a drug like a biologic what how does that change your risk paradigm well I mean I think with type 1 diabetes it might not be the best of examples because it depends on what their control of their diabetes is right just as with IBD if your diabetes is well controlled and your hemoglobin a1c is great I'm less worried than if your diabetes is out of control and you're at risk of get going into ketoacidosis or something but I think a an even better example might be as massive your asthma or other lung diseases like cystic fibrosis I'd be worried right and I think that as the pediatric gastroenterologist I would be working with the restaurantes Tour the endocrinologist or the other specialists that are involved in the care of this child to start to develop you know almost a custom personalized risk matrix to say you know how risky is it for your child to go to school at this point and I think the same goes for adults I mean you kind of implied this yourself Gil that although you're you're young and fairly healthy you have this risk of asthma and you have this history of lung problems and so while you've made a decision to go to work you know and it's perfectly acceptable that if somebody with a similar situation decides not to go to work and I'd say that those people who have these multiple risk factors might want to discuss it with their physicians and while you know if the IBD is under control and they're not on steroids and they're feeling well the your gastroenterologist may say well you better speak to your respirator gist and see what they say first so we should all be working together to figure out what's safe and what's not for the for you as a patient individual patient yeah and I think the answer that you gave was exactly the same that I would say for for adults whether it be diabetes it comes down to are you well controlled or you out of control similarly there are fixed conditions and there are variable conditions so asthma is a variable condition we can get that under control working as a team with your esperadas so that you could be well feeling well and being and you're risk being low if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD that's a fixed defect that's something that we can't get the lungs better and we know that if you were to expose to a virus whether it be influenza or kovat your risk as much is much much higher and and that's where that creating that personal risk with your physician helps you kind of navigate those decisions for you absolutely the next question Gil I think is a really interesting one it's a bit of a scary one I think for patients because they think they noticed on the secure IBD website and on your graphs that the 5a is a medic medicines masala mean or sulfasalazine or other medicines like that people on those medicines seem to have a higher risk of death and I know this is something that you addressed in the paper that you just had accepted can you talk a little bit about why that might be yeah no absolutely it's such a good question and I'm glad someone asked it so they have an opportunity to answer it so first of all we we have to think about the methodology of of these types of studies and not just the specific registry but a lot of type of work that both air can I do there are potential flaws and designs of studies that sometimes bring out associations or relationships that may or may not be true and you see a lot of this with the Cova literature you see on Twitter or even the news media something comes out with like for example there was a recent article that said if you smoke you were protected against getting bad outcomes of kovat that was was in the news and some very smart epidemiologists actually went through the paper that was unpublished and actually went and said you know what here here's some of these methodological flaws that actually would explain why they're seeing these findings and so every time that we see a relationship we always have to ask the question is it biologically plausible is it does this make sense and so Messala mean drugs like Fantasia asked to call massive ants alla fog that we use quite commonly to tree but too clearly else to typically it is less so crohn's disease but for the most RL syrup lettuce our topical immune suppressants meaning they suppress the immune response in the bowel but they don't suppress your immune systems systemically we've known that for a huge number of studies through there's actually no kind of biological reason to think that a drug like Fantasia would actually put you at a higher risk of developing that that outcome from Cobra so then the question is why would a study like this actually show something like that well the answer is and what we think the answer is is that this was a global study this was a study that was done all across the world so we have people who are from North America where they have access to some of the best care physicians the best drugs like Remicade and in tibia and Humera and still Lara and xeljanz and and it also comes from countries in much poorer countries where you still get inflammatory bowel disease but access to care access to drugs is a lot poorer and we know in those countries they use a lot more of the masala mean drugs or drugs like fantastic Altman's event just the access to those drugs are much cheaper they're easier to access we've seen in our database that a lot of the people who are on Crohn's disease we're getting these medications and in North America we actually use a lot less of this than in Crohn's disease and so what we're thinking is that in these countries where you don't have access to the best care and they don't have access to the best drugs you may also not have the best access to care for your kovat if you're if you get a if you get sick from it and we think that those things are correlated together and so we see that this has happens more commonly the strawberries which are more commonly in poorer countries and also we saw that it's prescribed more commonly in our older population where many physicians might be nervous to use a drug that suppresses your immune system and so they may actually be sub-optimally treating them with the drug like pant as aware really they should have been using the drug like active EO instead and so this is where this is what we explained in in in the paper having said that you know it's piqued our interest and we are doing a series of different studies trying to understand you know exactly is this truly a risk or not but right now based on our understanding of where this data comes from and just does it make sense kind of are we don't feel that a drug like Fantasma increases your risk of a bad outcome that's great and I always like to show this I'm hoping that people can see my screen right now this graph the classic graph right that an epidemiologist will show to the public to explain that correlation does not equal causation and this graph shows that there's high correlation between years that a Nicholas Cage film came out and the number of drownings in the United States clearly well you could argue maybe Nicolas Cage shouldn't be making any more movies and then we'd have fewer drowning but that's not the case there's other reasons maybe Nicolas Cage shouldn't be making any more movies but clearly this is a correlation but it's not cause of effect there's other things that could explain this association and so it's important that you know people understand that this may not be an issue of the the drug itself here it may be an indicator of some other health services affect your health system effect I just want to add that I think Nicolas Cage is being casted as the tiger King so we may see more drowning the US so I'm gonna I'm gonna ask this question to you it's actually a very good question it's very topical it I'm actually really you know it really this the questions that we get today and all along really reflects how educated and up-to-speed are the IBD community is and so the question here is there more information regarding the pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome the Kawasaki's and disease that is potentially associated with Cova 19 and children and it wonder if you wanted that's relatively new data as well if you could talk a little bit about that yeah absolutely so you know this is a scary thing for a pediatrician and for a parent hearing that you know up until now we really felt that kids did very well with kovat 19 and tended not to get sick almost never needed hospitalization and almost nobody died as a child because of kovat 19 and then this comes out so these were cases that initially I think New York City and area reported about a hundred cases and now we just had a published report in The Lancet yesterday from Italy which looked at something called Kawasaki disease and this was a kawasaki like illness Kawasaki disease is a very well known pediatric illness it's not common but it's an immune system disease that's usually triggered by an infection we think although we don't always know what that infection was and it results in an inflammatory State not unlike IBD it sort of triggered by something that sets off the immune system and the immune system produces inflammation and that causes damage to your body in this case the immune system is reacting and causing a vasculitis which means inflammation of the blood vessels and we're very good as pediatricians in treating identifying Kawasaki disease which there's no test for it it's really identifying the symptoms of it like having red eyes having peeling hands or feet having a rash and having a fever lasting longer than five days and we can treat it we use medicines we use immunoglobulins actually intravenous immunoglobulin to boost almost your immune system and it helps prevent the complications of Kawasaki disease which can include coronary artery aneurysm and inflammation of your coronary vessels your blood vessels of your heart so what they found with kovat 19 is there seems to be an increased risk of something that looks like Kawasaki disease so it's Kawasaki disease like illness it's a systemic inflammatory disease it has similar features like the coronary artery problems and the red eyes and the rash and the fever but it also results in almost a toxic shock where your body shuts down your blood pressure drops and you get very very sick and the child gets very very sick and can die from it and so this Italian study that came out yesterday found that the rate of what looked like Kawasaki disease jumped very very high during the time that kovat was very prevalent in northern Italy and much higher than it had been in the year prior implying that kovat may be related and and similarly we've seen that in Montreal and we've seen that in New York that there are case series of these kids who get very sick with this this vasculitis illness this this Kawasaki like illness it's still very rare it's still very very uncommon again you saw the the graph that Gil produced that most children 98% of them don't need to be hospitalized you know very few if any have died in Canada and so and and you know so it's not something to panic about but it's I think it's an indication that we know very little about this virus and the effects that this virus has on the body and we need to be really really cautious with treating it lightly I'm not saying that we shouldn't slowly reopen I think we all agree that you know the economy has to reopen this is going to be a long term thing but we can't say for sure that all children will be fine it's not the flu it's something else and we don't understand it yet we don't quite understand how to treat it we don't know how to prevent it and we have to be really careful so you know that all to say don't be too scared about it it's very rare make sure your kids wash their hands really well make sure if they're going to be back in school if you're in Quebec really if you're going to be back in school that they wear a mask if possible that they stay 6 feet or 2 meters away from their friends and that they come home and they wash their hands really well but beyond that we're still learning all about this and the only thing I would I would add is that you know this is a new disease and so we're going to learn new things week to week and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this webinar because on a weekly basis because we know that if we were to come back a month from now we would essentially leave the community in an abyss without that extra knowledge and so we're working on this but it's not just us alone there is a huge outpouring research from the entire world the Canadian government just announced over a billion dollars in funding related to to coca related research including there are Canadian suits of health research CHR is a big the number one national funding agency for health research and they just launched a CO vid specific grant competition that Eric and I put in a grant application to study Kove it in the IVD community to try to unanswered questions that you've been asking again we don't know if we're gonna get funded or not because there's 2,000 applications at all there but it just shows you you know if we didn't get funded it means that there is X number of studies being done by brilliant people across the country that have ideas even better than Eric and I and that just shows you there is a tremendous amount of effort going towards trying to answer the questions that you have absolutely there was a question here about ostomies ileostomy z' any increased risk in those patients yeah so if you have an ileostomy so that's essentially your small bowel coming out into your abdomen and then and then your contents going into a bag there is no increased risk of just having it has to be in terms of contract encoded or in terms of having that outcomes where the risk potentially happens if you have an ostomy is in relationship to disease activity so if you have active inflammation in your small bowel just like if you had out active information and you didn't have an ostomy your risk would be higher and people ostomy sometimes have a higher propensity to get dehydrated because they don't have their colon to kind of suck up the water and so they sometimes when they get a flare they can sometimes get dehydrated run into kidney problems sometimes need to be supported in in hospital so it's not so much that the virus itself would necessarily cause greater harm or also mean it's just that you have to have greater care for your health system and similarly when I was talking earlier about that short gut syndrome if you have an ostomy and you've had multiple surgeries and you've lost a lot of your ears fall out your susceptibility whether it's to a flare or if you have even just a gastrointestinal illness what ever cause of of an infection is going to be is going to be higher in those scenarios and then I think oh and then Eric theorist should I attend appointments with my health care professional and then secondarily are the infusion clinics there to keep us safe maybe maybe if you wanted to focus particularly on the healthcare professional question because you know we had the webinar around telehealth few weeks back yeah so I mean I'll deal with both questions I think they're both excellent questions so I mean I think most healthcare providers still to this day are really trying to do the visits virtually if they can so that could be by telephone or it could be by videoconference so certainly if your appointment is shift to shift it to a virtual means of seeing you then please take that appointment if you're worried that you're sick and your message is not getting across by telephone then make sure you say something to your doctor or to your nurse and they will see you for the most part they'll try to see you in clinic if they need to be aware that obviously seeing you virtually is not the same thing as feeling your belly and having a look at you and you know doing blood work and doing all those things but if you go back to one of the previous webinar from two weeks ago I think it was dr. Nguyen and dr. Wang really when it's a good depth about how we can see patients virtually and do a good job and still monitor for inflammation and things like that if your doctor is telling you to come into clinic maybe there's a reason you can ask why like why do I need to be there in person you know but you know I think it's you know we're doing our best to keep patients safe certainly there are fewer patients and there have ever been in the hospitals and the clinics and so I think as long as you're physically distanced from other people as long as you wash your hands really well wear a mask you'll be okay if you have to go in to see your doctor or need blood work or any tests or anything like that as far as the infusion clinics go I'm going to share my screen again I want to try to emphasize that a lot of this is on the website if you go here on the on the right hand side there's this this navigation bar and you can go to the FAQ the frequently asked questions and there is information there about what infusion clinics are doing to try to keep you safe when you go I'll have to try to find it here if I can but it's here somewhere essentially they are doing an excellent job at really trying to keep by this is the difference this is not the Copa 19 infusion FAQ so I apologize and it's here somewhere there we go get answers I think maybe Gil helped me out live demo never works properly there we go this is it so lots of frequently asked questions and here it is is it safe to visit my infusion clinic and there's information there but essentially the infusion clinics are doing a very good job at making sure that you're physically distancing making sure that the nurses are using protective equipment so that they're not infecting you and you're not infecting them and that does mean that they can probably see fewer patients frequency per hour but and so that means that your your appointment might be shifted at a time that might be not as convenient for you so please be patient with any appointment shifts but they're making those changes because they want to keep as few people as possible in the clinic and make sure everybody is six feet and six feet apart and so on so in general I think that yes it is safe to visit the infusion clinics it's safer to continue your biologic than to skip or miss doses so please do that you can speak to your doctor about doing a rapid infusion so in sort of just over an hour instead of just over two hours that will kind of get you out quicker and make you safer if you're getting the injectable form of a biologic and you're going to the infusion clinic to do that speak to your biologic patient services programs a lot of them are now offering training virtually by videoconference to show you how to inject yourself at home if you feel if you feel comfortable doing that I think that's worthwhile to keep you out of the andalusian clinic and keep you at home as much as possible and another thing I would add is that time addressing the infusion clinic was one of the first things that we did as the Cova task force in fact our second webinar on March 26 we invited the exec two heads of the four major infusion networks in the country NMR in Viva clover deo and bayshore to come in to talk to the IP community to express all the things that they were doing to make those in fusion centers safe for them and so that's actually that's conversations is on the website that Eric showed and just to give you a bit of the backstory to that you know at the time the infusion centers were not deemed an essential service and what that means them in in a lockdown scenario if you're not in a central service you have to shut down and in that setting you know nurses couldn't work in those clinics patients can go to there and so that was a huge crisis point that we identified in the task force and worked with CCC and that's what we brought in to ask these questions and we realized that many of the provinces that not even get the CCC that advocated with the different health authorities in each of the different problems is working with the infusion clinics and within a week every province have deemed the infusion clinics an essential service which meant that if a locked-down were to then come and remember this was before we had all the school closures and everything happening that those infusion centers would not close down and the nurses working at them would not be redeployed into hospitals and so on so that was a huge effort of the task force right at the beginning but then it didn't end there then the next question was if those who are getting infusions probably recognize that you know back in 2019 those chairs were not two metres apart and so then we have to figure out what are the ways to screen people to make sure that we're not allowing people who are potentially sick with Cobra to go into infusion centers we need to make sure that those chairs were spaced properly we need to make sure that the nurses who were caring for those patients have the proper PPE and they had enough supply and again this was right on the radar for each of the infusion networks the key was integrated work between the four of them you know supported by our task force to give kind of medical direction and we were able to address virtually every single issue that came up a relationship to the intriguing centers and I think that's actually one of our early wins from the task force absolutely all right so we have time for a few more I will try to go as quick as we can this isn't a quick one this is not an easy one actually Gail I'm going to throw this one to you of course are there ways to strengthen my immune system um so first of all we were just before this conversation Eric and I with Mina and Kate we will always talk about what are the future segments or webinars we're going to do and one of the ones that we discussed that we want to try to organize at some point in the next month is kind of debunking conspiracy theories that out there book Ovid not necessarily that Eric and I we actually want to try to identify one or two good panelists that come in and to talk to you about all the things that you're probably seeing in social media that are like wrong and some things that like present unless by five key antennas it's not caused by 5g we promise and so um but but that's a very valid question what are things you can give you so before there was a pandemic Eric and I actually did a lot of research in IBD on a number of different areas including environmental health so we're trying to study what are the environmental factors that made you at risk for developing IVD and if you had IBD major at risk for having worse outcomes surgery or being sick with your IBD and not just Eric and I but there's been research all over the world to look at what are the things that you can do to essentially minimize your risk of Crohn's disease and really what we're getting at is how do we strengthen the immune system to prevent that outcomes from the immune system and there's now clear evidence from a number of different studies that a healthy life is associated with alpha T commune system so the key things that you learned in elementary school good diet proper exercise low stress getting sleep keeping a good healthy weight these are all things that not only prevent heart disease cancers but also we've been able to show that also prevent the risk of development IBD and also you have any worse outcomes and those are the things that not only are they seen in in kind of epidemiological studies but there are a really good basic science studies to explore how these healthy life things affect your health and a lot of it has to do with your gut microbiome and all those trillions and organisms that your body's immune system is constantly processed you know if you have a bad healthy lifestyle that that might grow by Anja's and then predisposes you to an immune system that's not strengthened and just to give you one last example Eric and I collaborated with an Environmental Health Sciences from Health Canada who was work trying to study and Erica like you're the lead on this to look at what's called green space or parks and this is a study that's being presented and it's currently the papers being reviewed for publication but essentially what it showed was that kids that played in parks but were lived closer to parts closer to green space they actually had less likely develop Crohn's disease than those kids who were in very kind of dense environments and didn't have access to green space and so on like that and so the message there is that you know these are things that you can do to make yourself healthy not just you know pre-pandemic during the pandemic home isolation doesn't mean staying in your home in your basement you can go outside you can go for walks you can go hikes the Alberta's gonna open up the parks soon like we want you to be outside being exposed to the Sun being healthy these are things that you can do to strengthen your immune system absolutely and there's actually an interesting story out there now a study that looked at vitamin D and found that people who had who are deficient in vitamin D as about 60% of Canadians are tended to do worse if they got Co fit 19 now again this may be a story of you know correlation and not causation just like the Nicolas Cage story but we've seen that with IBD as well that people with lower vitamin D levels are more likely to be diagnosed and more likely to flare up and so you know getting out there not necessarily getting out there in the hot Summer Sun you know you still use your sunblock especially if you're on an immune suppressing medicine but making sure your vitamin D levels are adequate and you know we should all be on a thousand international units of vitamin D every single day just in case that makes your immune system slightly better at fighting this virus off and so in here there's another question here for you were pressed but I'll ask you if you're on a biologic so if your amino compromised and a vaccine becomes a fork over 19 will there be an issue with receiving the vaccine so there's a lot of questions there right so I'm actually helping to lead with dr. Jennifer Jones and the Canadian Association of gastroenterology vaccination guidelines for patients with IBD which hopefully should be published within the next few months and we've actually split those guidelines into two papers one about live vaccines and one about inactivated vaccines so live vaccines live attenuated vaccines are vaccines that contain very small amounts of live virus particles whereas the inactive vaccines do not contain any live virus particles and so you know the question will be when the Cova 19 virus vaccine is out will it be a live vaccine or will it be an inactive non-live vaccine you know I think that that we still don't know that yet right I mean there's both both types of vaccines are in trials now at various stage of trials we don't know what type is gonna work certainly the flu vaccine is not a live vaccine the the injected flu vaccine but the nasal spray flu vaccine is a live vaccine so there may be both types available and it may well be that if you're on one of the immune suppressing medicines they are gonna recommend against doing a live vaccine but if there's a not live vaccine an inactive vaccine then it should be safe we just don't know the next question will be you know they're not going to make vaccines ability it's not going to be available for the whole world all at once right they're gonna have to ramp out production so the question will be who gets the vaccine first and that's a discussion for health policy makers and politicians Public Health and bioethicists right it's an ethical issue you know how we're on the list will people with IBD be if they're immunosuppressed like on you sticking the map first Alera we don't know the answer to that question but the hope is that whatever vaccine that they come out with you can take because it won't be a live vaccine we just don't know that yet and the one thing I would add to you if you remember those graphs I showed you about this kind of for a few years that's in the context of waiting for either a vaccine would shorten that of course but if not then it's a matter what we're trying to do is obtain what's called herd immunity and you've probably heard that in the news quite often and essentially what it means is there's enough people who are exposed to the virus who mount an antibody and that antibody protects them from being reinfected so every one of those things we don't know yet with with this virus we're assuming that if you get if you get infected that you will mount antibodies and there's a lot of data now to show that people are mounting the next question that has to be answered is if you have those antibodies does it prevent you from being reinfected we think that's going to be the case and if those if those answers are yes then eventually what's going to happen is they're going to be people who are going to have natural immunity because they've had the disease and there are people who don't have immunity and they'll be susceptible getting infected and the whole idea of kind of diminishing this disease is that epidemiologically of sixty to seventy percent of the population has exposure has antibodies then they essentially create kind of a shield against the people who are susceptible it's much harder for somebody who gets infected to pass on that because they're they're coming in contact with people who are immune so they don't get them sick so they don't pass on that disease on and onwards and so this will be regardless of what happens with the vaccine even let's say there's a live vaccine and we turn around say you know what it's we shouldn't be using it in people who are highly immunocompromised or for whatever reasons the fact that we'll have a vaccine and we'll start to immunize segments of the population including that other segments will have already have been exposed and recovered means we'll get to a point where we'll start to immunize a vast loss of the population and they start to form a shield against more vulnerable people who may not melt an immune response if they get a vaccine or who are it's not safe to give them a vaccine for example if it's a live one thanks so I think we're running out of time I think we're going to start wrapping up I want to remind everybody that out of your the answers to your questions are on the website again I'll sort of share a little bit of my screen here oops there we go so please do check the frequently asked questions in the kovat 19 in IBD section there were some questions about back-to-school and kids going back to school and work and a reminder that that's under guidance right at the bottom they're reopening of schools in the economy and then finally if you do have questions about back to school back to work the opening up of the economy I want to do a plug for last week's webinar which I felt was fantastic might be a little bit biased because it was really a pediatric focused webinar but it was really an all-star webinar of you know the best pediatric gastroenterologist in the world as well as one of the best infectious disease specialists in the world and dr. Allen so if you see here the Cova 19 families and children with IBD it also really goes into detail about reopening of the economy and back to school back to work so I urge you to watch those as well I wanted to thank everybody for joining us we we got some really nice compliments and we are seeing them in the chat box they've been passed on thank you so much to all the kind words everybody's saying that these these webinars are really valuable to them and we're hoping that that you're both enjoying them that they're they're passing the time for you and there's somewhat entertaining but most importantly that they're informing you and that they're reassuring you that things are okay that we're doing all right we'll we'll survive this will get we'll do fine and we're providing you with the most up-to-date information that we can I wanted to remind you that we are trying to raise money for Crohn's and Colitis Canada as part of this so if you go to get got CCA I'm sorry gutsy walk CA is what I'm trying to there we go gutsy walk CA and you can donate there to any team really and again that this is really the the top way that research for Crohn's and Colitis is funded in Canada but if you scroll down a little bit you'll see the Gil and Gil and Eric's kovat IBD webinars team and we're doing really well where I think number three of the top teams now and we're hoping that if you find any value to these webinars if you're enjoying them please please donate whatever you can a dollar five dollars whatever you can $500 anything you want to show that your support for these webinars and to show your support for Crohn's and Colitis Canada who are obviously struggling with the inability to do face to face you know fundraising and the gutsy walk has become virtual instead of face to face so we really really appreciate if you would show your your appreciation by donating to Crohn's colitis Canada either directly on the Crohn's colitis CA website or through the gutsy walk page and with that I think we we need to send a special shout out to nurses this week right Gil it's it's National Nurses Week and I wanted to particularly shout out to the two nurses at the CHEO IBD Center Natalie Fournier and Chantelle sholde ice the nurse case managers without whom we could not run the IBD clinic at geo they really take care of everything they're the first point of contact for all our patients they bring any questions that patients have or any problems they're able to order some bloodwork they're able to you know do stool samples if they need to and they really do the majority of the work in the IBD Center I would say we're in the background looking on but they're supporting us so happy Nurses Week to Natalie and Chantelle and to all the nurses at geo that I work with please Danielle Louise Donna everybody there Shelly as well and Gil I'm sure you want to give some shoutouts to the people you work with absolutely and I mean I kiss you Saint she truly is a saint she's my nurse she's also a nurse for me my manager who I work with as well and she is being Foundation through this pandemic you cannot imagine how many telephone calls our clinics are getting all across that's one of the reasons why we wanted to do these webinars was because we're being inundated with questions and the same questions because what's on your mind is on everyone's mind and she has done a phenomenal job with the whole team at the University of Calgary Medical Center you see mcgi clinic that I practice in are IVD clinic I also want to make a special shout out to our nurse practitioners Joan Heatherton and Mary Louise Martin they both have done a phenomenal job including setting up a high-risk IBD clinic that has taken care of people who are being sick right now and particularly not just catering to our clinics which for the whole city and Joan in particular has done a tremendous amount of work advocating for the IBD community with working with Alberta Health to try to address many issues for Albertans with IBD so it is you know I'm obviously only touching the tip of the iceberg of the nurses that we need to thank for including the clinic nurses or endoscopy nurses that make caring for you possible and one more Lucia from McMaster University who serves on the IBD Cova 19 task force for Crohn's colitis Canada as well in the smack and who does tonnes for Crohn's and Gladys Canada thank you for all your support OSHA in representing the nursing perspective and representing the patients as well and one thing about OSHA is this past Tuesday's task force we decided in honor narsings week to set up a special webinar for next Thursday on Nursing in IBD and so she's actually going to help us organize that and she's going to be a panelist on the webinar and we're going to invite we're going to collaborate with Ken IBD which is the nursing Association that Crohn's colitis canvas supports and we're going to have a whole webinar where we're going to ask nurses across the country their experiences caring for IBD during this pandemic so I think it's gonna be a really special webinar agree and with that we're gonna say goodbye and we will see you next week please stay well please stay healthy and get out there hopefully and enjoy the Sun especially in Ontario where it's been way too cold over the past two weeks take care everybody thank you you

17,a4UcNgRV17o,David Chen,Getting Pfizer Vaccine Second Dose: Side Effects and Reactions - Vlog,2021-04-08T14:40:59Z,"David and his COVID bubble discuss what it's like to get dose 2 of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. What were the side effects (if any)?

Note: The point of making this was not to flex or brag but to help demystify the process for people. Going into dose 2, I'd heard so many different things about what the experience could be like. I hope this gives you some sense of what the results might be, and that it helps you to make your own plans around dose 2. We are not medical professionals. If you need medical advice, ask your doctor.

other we don't see anyone else we are going to get dose 2 of the pfizer vaccine uh which is very exciting we're going to travel by ferry to a walmart far far away to get those two and i've heard a lot of different things about those two i've heard that it can be really bad in terms of side effects it can make you feel pretty nasty and so we have planned to take a couple days off not doing anything just to recover from those two and i'm gonna document my experience of those two here in this video now a few things before we get started number one i am not a medical professional do not take this video as medical advice of any kind seek out an actual medical professional for that this is just me sharing my experience of what those two was like second thing i want to point out is everyone's experience of the vaccine is different some people get really bad symptoms other people get no symptoms at all so this is only my personal experience it may not be generalizable and finally i don't know if you're new to this channel but basically what i typically do is talk about movies and tv and pop culture and other fun stuff so if you are interested in any of that be sure to hit like or subscribe hit that bell icon to get notifications whenever i publish a new video let's get to the walmart let's get those two and i'll start sharing with you what symptoms i'm experiencing let's go all right so we're at the ferry and after we get on it's like a 40-minute ferry ride and then there's another 15 minutes to drive and then we're gonna be at our destination the walmart [Music] i think that way is a bad thing no because okay if we are using i want it that way in a sentence yeah in the context of the song it starts with am i your fire your one desire yeah keep into her because it's like i want it that way i i want you thinking about me that way yeah i want to be the one yeah yeah you want to be i'm vibing i'm picking up what you're putting down so but you make a good point that i never want to hear you say new sentence full stop separate thought i want it that way but that sentence doesn't make any sense i never want to hear you say that's not a sentence in english it rhymes all right it has been a very enjoyable ferry ride full of talk of backstreet boys and other things like that we're about to get off the ferry now heading to the walmart we're about 15 minutes away and then we'll see what is up all right we have arrived at the walmart and uh it's real is it is it not i feel like it's very weird to be back it's a very special place i love it here yes i look forward to spending the next one to six hours here we will be here for a long time so let's get in line and get ready to do this also i'm switching to my iphone to go inside all right we're in line for the shot almost there all right i'm about to get the injection and this lovely doctor who will remain off camera and nameless is about to give a spiel about what happens when i get it all so right this one most common side effect is going to be an injection site reaction so a sore arm where i told you um try and stay relaxed while i'm giving it a shot afterwards move your arm that helps move the injection remove the muscle if it gets red hot or anything like that ice packs work really well um you can take paddle if you need to or acetaminophen for pain but don't take any anti-inflammatories i just throw it in motion to leave approximately those um most common side effects after this is going to be flu-like symptoms so nausea vomiting diarrhea body aches low-grade fever but the biggest one that people complain about is um fatigue so needing to take a big long nap and if any of those things occur do not cancer totally normal typically they last for one day after the vaccine we have to hang out here for 20 minutes afterwards watch for anaphylaxis the swelling of your lips difficulty breathing any questions for me no all right here goes number two thank you that's it that's it you're done so quick so quick all right we are leaving the walmart everything really smoothly everyone was super professional uh they actually have worked out a lot of stuff since dose one they're a lot more smooth this time so now we're gonna head home and uh wait for the symptoms to hit hey folks back at home it is now three hours after i've gotten dose two of the pfizer vaccine so far the symptoms have been pretty mild uh i will say i feel a little bit tired um a little bit of soreness at the arm injection site other than that it feels great to be vaccinated and i'm really grateful for all the fine folks at walmart that took so much good care of us and hoping for a smooth next 24 to 48 hours okay so it's about four hours after my second dose and i'm really starting to feel it in the sense of uh just feeling very tired like i need to go to sleep so even though it's only 9 30 p.m i am going to go to sleep soon and hopefully when i wake up i'll feel okay but either way we'll check and i'll let you know good morning it's about 14 hours after dose two i woke up this morning and i walked around a little bit and i tried to feel like whether anything was wrong but i don't think there's anything wrong right now there's no aches pains no fever no chills um i do feel fatigued you know and that seems to be one of the most common symptoms is you'll feel tired you'll feel like you need to take a nap um i'm gonna try to take it easy today uh i don't think i'm gonna work out or do anything like that i'll try to just stay inside all day which is what i usually do 14 hours and so far and it seems to be smooth sailing and i don't think the worst is going to happen in terms of the symptoms but we'll see it's now about 24 hours after i've had this one and i am exhausted i need to go take a nap i i stayed up catching up with some people on the phone and watching a wework documentary on hulu but now i really need to rest i'm just so tired now so uh this is what it's like 24 hours in uh the other people in my bubble are experiencing slightly worse symptoms and i'll probably talk with them a little bit about it uh but for now uh i don't really have that much other than my arm is really sore and i'm really tired it's been about 27 hours since those two how are you feeling it's come in waves it started with like really bad headache i would say which i think water helps and also i was doing like an ice pack just like body aches um but mostly like the chills are like really awful because when you have chills i don't know if you experience this too but it's like it kind of like blends into the body aches right because it's like whenever you move your body and you want to be in bed and you have all these blankets on and then it's like you move your body a little bit and it's like it might not even be an ache but when you have chills it's like anything touching your skin you're kind of just like it hurts i will say i was like not feeling great this afternoon i tried taking a nap i couldn't take a nap and then i was downstairs had my kanji was icing my neck i was like feeling great and i was like i'm feeling much better i'm going to take a shower i'm going to get my body temp up you know like want to feel great um and now i'm feeling as worse if not like worse than before so it's not like it's been steadily improving it's like i just feel really um run down i don't have a brain fog like i was worried that i would i had that with shot one a little bit and i was worried i would have that really bad with shot too and it's really just been like a headache and then um chills i'm just like i'm so cold and like going up and down the stairs it's like all right it is now about 30 hours after i've had the second pfizer dose uh it's night two and i thought i'd just talk a little bit about what my day has been like uh it's been a pretty normal chill day spent most of the day on the couch uh just watching tv and movies but also uh tried to do a little bit of cooking and some cleaning uh did some stuff made some food for the other folks in my coved bubble just to make sure they were taken care of so i did do a little bit of that i felt like if i tried to work out or something more strenuous like that it probably would have gone badly because i did feel fatigued most of the day at around five or six pm i took like a one hour nap uh felt a little bit better after that uh but yeah now it's around eleven o'clock and i'm ready to go to sleep for the night overall day two again has gone real smooth and i am hoping for a good uh next day in the morning um i'm hoping whatever symptoms i have which are mostly just fatigue will be gone by then um so let's see if that happens anyway going to sleep now we'll check in again in the morning good morning i just woke up and i am feeling pretty much normal i i feel almost no effects of this thing i don't even really feel fatigued maybe a little tiny bit but uh yeah i'm still gonna try to take it easy today because uh i don't want to over tax myself but overall i think uh i'm on the way out of this thing hello it's now about 48 hours after i've gotten dose two and today was a pretty smooth day i had a little bit of fatigue but nothing really serious some soreness at the arm injection site and that's about it so for me i wouldn't say i had no symptoms but i would say my symptoms were very mild i was one of the lucky people who didn't really get too impacted by those two but why don't we talk to the other folks in the bubble and see what dose two is like for them and that'll give us a much better rounded picture of what it's actually like what the side effects are actually like for dose two of the fisa vaccine let's talk to them we're here today with joy of napping and also carter our bubble mate to talk about what symptoms were like in the 24 to 48 hours after pfizer vaccine dose 2. what was the nature of the symptoms you experienced um well they read you about a list of symptoms and i had them all so uh just like the first time i would say shot one was rougher for me than most people and this was pretty similar so i was actually thrilled that it wasn't three times as bad as shot one um and the nausea was less bad this time but the chills and the fatigue and the roving body aches like you know wherever i have a little meat on the bones like my glutes or whatever i would just get this like burning sensation um and that was great and it would be amplified like if i moved um so i would say the leading and most lasting symptom for me was the fatigue i would start to think uh i've beaten this thing finally and i'd get up in 10 minutes later i'd be like this is a grave mistake and i'm going back to bed so it kind of dragged on for a while for me but i would say i had it at the very high end you shouldn't expect to be out most people should not expect to be out the way that i was so basically i had like 36 hours of like the chill chill chill stuff where it was like i'd be lying down and think like oh i'm feeling better and then it's like you get up and it's like i didn't want to walk anywhere going up and down the stairs i just felt like really weak and um not good um but then i would say gosh we had sunday full day and then i took monday off and probably by like monday around noon i was feeling like myself like i wasn't at 100 but as of noon i was like okay i'm starting to feel fine so technically i would say i had about like a 36 to 48 hour 40 hour full bout and like 12 hours of like the real flu stuff but um the other thing that was very helpful um which i learned when we were at um the walmart and then i did it on day two was putting the ice pack on the back of my neck that was very helpful for me with a headache or for the i think with the headache and also with just like the bo with all of the symptoms that it just like um because like you said it's like running hot and like just having like weird like chills and then like night sweats like it was just like oh and then but so it helped with just it actually like sort of smooths your autonomic nervous system which is like freaking out a little bit um i will say the one other symptom we haven't talked about is that you and i both got injection site rash this time covet arm you got it the first time but like 10 or 12 days after getting a shot which is not atypical as it turns out um but this time i think you and i both got it within a day and i still have it a little bit um and it wasn't super painful it was a little itchy a little swollen and red um it was just annoying like it felt like i would accidentally like turn if i was sleeping and then have to be like aware of it so i tried to take an antihistamine for it i'm not really sure that that worked they say you can also take like a tylenol or an ibuprofen and yeah all in all i'm not saying if you don't have symptoms that it's not working but i know this thing's working in my body because i could feel i could feel all the defenses rearing you mean when your feelings industry like yeah i could i could see this being pretty bad i can see this being not something i want but but yes i think um the fact that it followed to my understanding like what people were saying to expect it's not like anything was out of left field which i take comfort in and um and we're both women and there's like a gender difference like women are more likely to have the symptoms and have them more acutely and then so younger people and younger people as well so you know well thank you very much for chatting with me today i appreciate it enjoy that it's very worth it very worth it and carter yeah would do again and might have to oh my god i don't want to get a booster shot or in another year i'm gonna love it it's gonna be great yeah every year yeah can't wait so what are some lessons to learn from this whole thing here are some thoughts i have if you are about to get those two of the fisa vaccine or any doses of any vaccine number one is be ready for anything and what i mean by that is be ready for any of a number of different responses you might have to this thing some people have no symptoms some people have really severe symptoms some people have everything in between and so my encouragement is just know that anything might happen obviously if something concerning happens tell your doctor but in general it's very normal to experience a lot of weird and intense stuff during the first one to two days that generally clears up after that time so be ready for any of any number of responses that your body might have and know that for the most part it's pretty normal and it will go away do not panic the second lesson is prepare your house for the dose and what i mean by that is make sure you have all the stuff that you need to feel better if you are not feeling well physically whether that be pedialyte tylenol warm blankets heating pad all that kind of stuff like just make sure you have it within reach and easy to access because once you are back home after having gotten the dose it's a lot harder to like acquire those things so prepare the house prepare your living space if you are able or if you have the option to try to take some time off of work so that you can recover from it uh but that is my second piece of advice is be ready in terms of preparing uh your physical environs for getting the dose so those are my pieces of advice and sort of lessons learned from getting dose to advisor vaccine i hope this video has helped i hope it helps to demystify this process for you and if

for sponsoring this event and thanks also to all of you for logging in and listening in for what will be an informative session i would now like to introduce our distinguished panel panelists for the session today dr robin chutkin is an integrative gastroenterologist and the best-selling author of gut bliss the microbiome solution and the bloat cure educated at yale and columbia she's been on the faculty at georgetown hospital since 1997 and is the founder of the digestive center for wellness her educational platform gutbliss.com provides evidence-based digestive wellness advice an avid squash player and yogi she is passionate about introducing more dirt sweat and vegetables into people's lives dr kate michelle is an assistant professor in the school of medicine at georgetown university and a kl2 scholar at the georgetown howard universities center for clinical and translational sciences her work focuses on the role of the vaginal microbiome in the context of hiv progression cervical cancer and reproductive health as well as projects on the impact a physician health care systems trust on antiretroviral use and the geospatial analysis of pre-term and low-term birth-weight births in washington d.c dr stoneau sutiven is a faculty member in the department of biochemistry at georgetown university medical center she directs the md ms dual dual degree program in systems medicine a freestanding and a freestanding master's program in systems medicine because the systems medicine program at georgetown is the first of its kind in the world she has played an important role internationally and domestically in establishing systems medicine as an important component of medical education her research interests include taking a systems medicine approach to the study of inflammatory bowel disease cancer and drug repurposing and with that we'll get started with our panel discussion first question goes to dr michelle could you describe what the microbiome is and the role of the microbiome in health and disease hi great yeah um so i think first i'll just go with a definition of microbe um it's a microscopic organism uh but it includes bacteria fungi protists viruses et cetera but we'll mostly focus on bacteria and i'd like to frame this kind of in in terms of some key introductory questions um that i kind of put together as part of the the course that sona started uh that kind of sprouted uh this collaboration uh the clinical applications of the microbiota um and first uh let's talk about how many cells are there in our microbiome um as a raw count there are more bacterial cells in your body than there are your own human cells um although by mass of course there are far fewer um and a 2010 study estimated that these bacteria may have about 150 times more genetic potential kind of within their pan genome than our own human pan genome or all the potential human genes that we have it's pretty interesting um and where are most of our microbes located in our bodies um now you'll you'll hear a lot about the gut microbiome and for good reason um the majority of all of our microbes are in the large and small intestines a decent fraction are in our stomachs however we also have a very high concentration in our mouths and on our skin but long story short there are very few places we don't have microbes and even places we previously thought of is completely sterile um like the uterus um or bladder uh now seem to have uh you know bacteria occurring uh what types of microbes do we have um well it's estimated that our gut microbiome is over 99 bacteria uh so this is why you see basically we focus on bacteria um and a lot more analyses using uh 16s rrna sequencing which is specific for bacteria however of course increasing research is focusing on the less within one percent that's not bacteria uh i think it's also interesting that there are many different types of bacteria across each body site um so each body niche has typically one to signal signature bacterial phylas that make up around 20 to 80 percent of the total habitat which is pretty interesting so for example in the nose you'll have more cinnabacteria are very more dominant and nearly absent from stool and vagina but the vaginal microbiota is almost you know completely firmicutes uh so kind of interesting that there's there's little micro biomes within our microbiome uh so what factors shape are microbiomes um and i think this is really exemplified by a 2018 study that found that diet drugs that we take and body measurements accounted for about 20 percent of the inner person variability in the gut microbiome and interestingly they also found that non-related people living in the same household were more similar in their gut microbiome than relatives who lived in different places um and interestingly outcomes like glucose levels or obesity were better predicted by gut microbiome composition than by genetics or environmental factors um so it's it's very interesting that the gut microbiome and this is kind of borne out in other studies as well as highly shaped by diet uh antibiotics or drugs we take um and the places that we live uh and finally why do we have microbiomes um and i think just in a sentence i think the thought is just it helps us break down food and get nutrients from our food vitamins uh uh you know uh breakdown products of fiber um and that's probably why the majority are in our dirt tract um but we'll discuss a lot more here some of the more wide ranging health effects um and we also know there's extensive crosstalk between our immune cells and microbiome uh and you'll notice that the main places our microbes are located that i mentioned is kind of in these external places so whether that's the skin or mucosal services like the gi tract um so these are places of defense um and that kind of makes sense so yeah a brief brief introduction thank you dr michelle that's what's up what do you think is the role of the microbiome in the era of systems medicine and big data um that's a great question doug and if i were in person i would be asking show of hands how many of you have actually heard of what systems medicine is um so i'm going to start off by defining what systems medicine is and what contributes to the era that we are in which is era of big data so systems medicine is a very novel approach um to medicine and is based on computer models uh that uses vast amount of clinical data and that is used for analyzing the health of individual patients it's a multidisciplinary field and it looks and treats individuals as a whole and uses ohmic technologies so data generated from all of these different dome technologies and i'm sure that you all have heard of so many of these omics uh like genomics proteomics transcendence metabolomics i can go on and on for an old hour about all the omics that's out there um so that all this data from all of these has actually put us in the air of big data and now and this um has also opened doors to the possibility of using these omics to personalize a medicine or treating patients precisely or the precision medicine of course the dimensionality and the scope of all of this is increased multi-fold with the sequencing of the human microbiome and so now in the last several years in the last decade in fact we have also started realizing the role and the importance of microbiome itself and the role it plays in health and diseases um just to bring this whole uh con the whole context uh and make it relevant to what we're all going through uh in the era of covet right now uh there's been a couple of papers where they're actually shown that there's a correlation between the changes in the lung microbiota and the outcomes of the covations um and they've also shown that bacteriotherapy has actually helped and this is a study from italy and i would um i'm going to reserve the actual uh description and the discussion of this to dr chuckin and so now i just want to conclude with one sentence by saying that uh the whole microbiome has actually opened up at the next generation of medicine um and added to the whole omics layers um and so microbiome is going to become very integral and important more than ever before thank you very much dr vasudevan dr chuckin how does genetics the environment and medications contribute to the composition of the microbiome and disease expression thanks for that question we had a little preview from dr vasiduvan's answer and basically epigenetic factors are factors that are not coded in the dna that can still affect the outcome in terms of disease expression so if we think of the microbiome the microbiome is a really key epigenetic factor along with other things like environmental exposure and the host immune system that can really decide whether something is expressed or not we know a lot about these epigenetic factors from twin studies so for example we look at identical twins with diseases like inflammatory bowel disease we know that there's not a hundred percent concordance because frequently both of the twins do not have inflammatory bowel disease so this is where other factors like the diet environmental exposures etc in fact an inflammatory bowel disease genetic factors meaning what's actually coded in the dna only explains a disease in about 20 to 25 percent and we know that in the rest one of the really significant factors is alterations to the microbiome in childhood there's a meta-analysis from mount sinai a few years ago that showed that early exposure to antibiotics in childhood is a major risk factor and can have an epigenetic effect in terms of determining whether that child develops inflammatory bowel disease or not so it's not just whether you have not the nod to gene on chromosome 16 or several other of the associated loci it's really what happens to you during that progression from birth to disease expression these different epigenetic factors our first link between epigenetics and a disease state came with cancer in the early 1980s linking colorectal cancer to loss of methylation in the tissue which is one of the ways in addition to affecting histones and rna silencing methylation is one of the ways that genes can be altered and that can lead to mutations and they found in that first patient that there was loss of methylation in the colon cancer tissue compared to other disease-free tissues in the same patient and that was affecting tumor expression so it's really important to think about these different factors and quite frankly it's really a message of optimism because it's not this idea that your genes are your destiny there are many other factors that can control and contribute to whether disease is expressed and the good news is that many of them like diet are within our control thank you very much dr chuckin dr michelle in addition to epigen epigenetic factors what other what other factors affect disease expression um so i think there's a lot of concepts to talk about uh in terms of covet disease expression um we have to i think consider who's gonna be most at risk of acquiring to the disease um and then factors that it can you know affect uh symptoms and as well as as well severity of symptoms and uh outcomes like like passive like death um in terms of who's at risk for acquiring uh covet 19 um we have some evidence just from epidemiological studies um but i you know i should say too that we're this is obviously a new disease we are learning more all the time um and you know so kind of that asterisk on everything um uh we do you know it does seem that older folks are at high risk um younger folks are generally low at risk um there's evidence that this might relate to ace two expression um ace ace2 is the receptor um which is essentially kind of like a marker on the outside of cells that's able to interact uh kind of with the environment and do some sensing um and uh you know the co stars kobe 2 binds to is to to allow the virus to get into our cells um a few studies have shown that h2 expression um in the nose and in the blood increases with age um so you might have more susceptibility with older age but older folks also have more health conditions and we know from epidemiological studies as well that conditions like diabetes or hypertension may play a role in kind of exacerbating disease expression and susceptibility um i think uh some epi studies have also sound some differences by sex um this may also relate to ace 2 expression however i think i'd have to defer to katherine sandberg at georgetown who knows a whole lot more about this area than i do [Music] but in terms of disease expression across the body as well i think ace2 can play a role there as well it's highly highly expressed in the lung um but it can be found uh sometimes in a lot of other body organs particularly uh heart liver kidney intestines um that might explain to some extent the wide range of organs and symptoms that can be found with covid19 um specifically um ace2 is highly expressed on um small intestine uh lower levels in the colon or large intestine um and it has its own function there acetoic acts as a co-receptor for for nutrient uptake and uh amino acid absorption from food um and there there might be some association with polymorphisms of ace ii as well um so i think there's still a lot a lot more to understand about this thank you doctor michelle let's watch everything what are the common routes of infection for covid um yeah so we all know uh that um kobit 19 is a respiratory illness and that can spread from person to person and transmission of this virus can occur through direct or close contact with the infected patient so the virus mainly spreads through respiratory respiratory droplets um and from the infected individuals that can reach and uh go through our mouth or nose or eyes these are the most dominant ways in which it gets through uh to the through the person uh and these two receptors are actually um expressed in these organs as well and of course airborne transmission is a big thing now um so um it is believed that uh these stay in the air for at least 20 to 30 minutes um and so so for example if a person is um infected and is walking without a mask and uh just crossed your uh street and you just take a stroll after 5-10 minutes there's a possibility that those are still going to be in the air so airborne transmission is a big thing and then formic transmission is from contaminated surfaces so it's believed that these can actually stay on surfaces for at least 24 to 48 hours and then feces and urine are also other modes of transmission of these and i'm sure dr chutkin is going to talk about that a little later um and um dr fauci actually um just couple of days ago um just said gave up a statistics that it's 45 to 50 percent is actually by asymptomatic transmission so that's something that there's no control over so people who um have the virus um can still spread it without even knowing that they actually carry the virus um and then there's also talk about transmission via sex but although there is have been absolutely no studies out there uh but they found um the virus in the semen as well um so there are lots of different ways that it can actually be transmitted and we are still trying to study how best to um take care of this of course my one only one thing that i think we all can agree on is um in the absence of a vaccine the best way to protect is a mask and that can actually protect more than 70 of the transmission rates so thank you thank you dr chuckin we are all familiar with common symptoms of covid such as fever and shortness of breath are there gastrointestinal symptoms of covet infection that we should be on the lookout for there absolutely are and again dr bassett even touched on some of those but soros kobe 2 has been isolated from the fecal stream and in fact if we look at the early data from wuhan china we see that 47 of patients had both respiratory and gi symptoms 41 had respiratory symptoms alone so it was actually more common from that early data for people to have a combination of gi and respiratory symptoms you might be wondering what sorts of gi symptoms diarrhea loss of appetite and nausea are the the most common those three but abdominal pain and vomiting have also been reported and in the u.s data it seems to be out about one-third of patients who report gi symptoms in association with respiratory symptoms gi symptoms alone without any respiratory symptoms are pretty unusual less than three percent in most of the studies but the combination of gi and respiratory symptoms is very common and it's important to note that sars kobe 2 may remain detectable in feces long after it's negative from a nasopharyngeal swab and that seems to be a marker also for people with more severe disease so people who present with gastrointestinal symptoms usually again in association with respiratory symptoms can clear the virus from their nasopharyngeal secretions but it can still be present in the fecal stream for weeks after and this leads to the big question about oral fecal transmission so far we haven't seen any documented cases and of course the things other than people who work in a laboratory with fecal samples the way that would happen would typically be poor sanitation or poor hygiene practices or contamination with food if you are a restaurant worker for example and you're not washing your hands carefully after you use a bathroom there was one report from china of an outbreak in an apartment complex where there was a leak in the sewage pipes and so some of the fecal effluent was erasablized if you will throughout the apartment complex and they were able to trace that back but here there's you know i know a lot of my patients have been concerned about public restrooms and so on and again as dr vasadevan said right now we know the most effective way to protect ourselves is wearing a mask and i would add to that hand washing particularly when using a public bathroom etc but we don't think the so-called fecal plume which is the fact that virus may be released after flushing we we have not found that that as of date as of today that that seems to be a significant contribution to how the virus is transmitted but again it is important to keep uh keep these gi symptoms top of mind so that would again be diarrhea loss of appetite and nausea thank you dr michelle are people with autoimmune disorders or immune deficiencies at higher risk of covid and what does this tell us about the immune system um so again i want to say too at the beginning this is a evolving situation we don't have a full picture of you know conditions but um i believe cdc has released guidance um that those living with particularly immunodeficiency from organ transplants um or those living with obesity or type 2 diabetes are particularly high risk for severe covid um i think the data is a little less clear although these folks are still at high risk people living with hiv those using corticosteroids um or those living with asthma hypertension etc um more of my research focuses on those living with hiv and it does seem with folks uh with a lower cd4 count um or those potentially those uh not on highly effective uh antiretroviral therapy or at higher risk of severe covid um but these are complicated studies to do because a lot of it's epidemiological right and um living with hiv can be associated with uh an increased risk for other comorbidities that might put you at additional risk um so it's complicated i think um but i think it is interesting that uh you know at different levels a compromised immunity whether it's through um immunodeficiency or chronic immune activation can be associated with coveted severity um and i think this basically just shows us how complex the immune response can be and how balanced it really needs to be when we're fighting off infection um i'm sure as many of you know uh severe covet disease can sometimes be associated with um what's called a cytokine storm essentially just have an overwhelming amount of uh particularly ill-6 um but some other chemokines and cytokines um particularly you know like in the lung and it can draw a lot of neutrophils into the tissue and cause a lot of destruction now these cytokines and chemokines are typically part of a healthy immune response nearly all of our body's cells have a way of sensing viral pathogens through different receptors and our cells essentially transfer this information to to key immune cells and then these immune cells start an immune response and this communication is done through cytokines and chemokines yeah and massive activation of immune cells um can also be an issue for an immune response particularly non-specifically um if you think about when you get a cut or a bud bite uh very quickly afterwards you know it'll get red and itchy and kind of inflamed and that's kind of that on non-specific response it's not responding directly to any particular pathogen that might be present but it's just kind of you know creating a lot of inflammation at the site um and our immune response really relies on bringing that back down to normal to bring this back to the gut a little bit um i mentioned these immune responses happening in the lung but it seems that they could be happening in the gut as well uh which makes sense uh since we have phase two receptors uh there as well there may be viral presence as we as we talked about um and stars could be two can can trigger inflammatory responses in the gut it seems like um particularly this influx of neutrophils um and yeah there's evidence um that sars kobe 2 can can avoid some of the early immune response and essentially kind of knock down some of our early response so yeah it's a complicated virus absolutely thank you dr michelle dr sutiven what are the cellular manifestations of covet infections specifically protein protein interactions which could affect the normal physiology of cell functions yes as um kate have just said it's it's actually a very complex virus um we are into it for almost eight months and the whole world is working on this and we are still trying to learn something new every single day uh but one thing we have learned in the last eight months is that it can pretty much affect all organs from head to toe opening uh doors to systems medicine approaches uh to understand this virus so covet 1988 in infects airway and elementary epithelial cells that express h2 and the local mucosal infection leads to the initial symptoms the symptoms that we see like fever shortness of breath and gastrointestinal distress and this is an analogous to the other viruses that we've seen in the past like source and mars but there's a very crucial difference between those and covid19 and in fact it almost seems like an unrecognized feature in the other coronaviruses that we've seen so far and the difference is i think that covet has a second phase so during the second phase of infection what it does is it crosses the epithelial basement membrane and spreads as a virenia and to infect systemic systemic endothelial cells that express h2 and core receptors that are present in the kidney lungs and peripheral vasculature and also we have seen from results of autopsies this is pretty much how they learned uh that looking at autopsies they found there was lots of thromboembolism that is almost it seems like a disease of the blood vessels um and so uh so it's a very complex thing and lots of different proteins and pathways are implicated in starting from the initial binding to ace2 leading to all the systemic infections and the um it becomes more complex in people with underlying conditions uh like kate explained and i've been explained earlier so it becomes a very complex disease and lots of different pathways are being implicated for example vitamin d vitamin b pathways are very crucial and this ties back to the microbiome because vitamin b is very important for the stability of the gut and also some of the nutrients that we get are actually produced by the bacteria in the gut and so when all of this is affected so again it brings back to the role of microbiome in this whole covalent infections so long story short i think there's a lot of different pathways lots of different proteins are implicated in uh the complexity and we have identified quite a few too but we're still far away from putting the whole thing to um and solving the piece of the puzzle of what causes what so again i would end with saying that it's very complex and we're still trying to identify things thank you dr chutkin are there medications that may place individuals at higher risk of contracting covet and is there any evidence of microbial changes in covet patients i'm going to start doug with the second part of that question first because it follows very well from what sono was saying when i read these reports of perfectly healthy people dropping dead uh from covid of course sometimes that is the case and everybody who dies from this virus is a tragedy for sure but i'm i'm often intrigued by some of the things that may not be as obvious so when we think about comorbidities we think about lung disease and heart disease obesity diabetes etc but a disordered microbiome what we consider dysbiosis is a very significant risk factor not just for autoimmune disease but for infection also and there are lots of factors as kate described in her introductory comments there are lots of factors that can affect that diet medications etc so here you start to see the interplay between diet and medications and the host immune system and a common example of that would be for example one of the medications that is a major risk factor which are steroids when people suppress the immune system with a steroid their risk of infection goes up and that can be bacterial viral and fungal infections for some of these immunosuppressive drugs so the two classes that come to mind are biologics and in my world of gastroenterology those are the anti-tnf drugs that we see advertised on television for a wider and wider range of use now from the first from two decades ago when they were really first introduced so they were typically reserved for sicker patients with autoimmune disease with diseases like crohn's and ulcerative colitis but now we see them being used more broadly for mild psoriasis asthma etc and so the problem is we have large groups of people who are on these drugs who under normal circumstances yes the drugs confer a risk and again that's an increased risk of infection and in some cases malignancy but the risk is really the risk is really significantly greater now and again in my world of inflammatory bowel disease there is a registry that's been started called ibd secure to report on patients with inflammatory bowel disease also on biologics how they've been doing with cova and i'm happy to say that i i do have some patients in my practice who have done very well some patients with crohn's and ulcerative colitis who've had the disease but i also just want to make the political statement that that registry is supported by all the pharmaceutical companies that make those drugs and so there's a huge question mark in my mind as to really the legitimacy of that information because if you look on the website for any biologic the first thing you see in bold letters is this drug does increase the risk of infection bacterial viral and fungal so again we are amassing data it's important to know what some of these large study results will show but for right now what i'd like to say people who are on steroids if you're on a high dose steroid which is greater than considered greater than 20 milligrams a day if you have prednisone if you have been on the steroid for more than three months that's considered high risk and so even if you can't completely get off the steroid if you can drop the dose down to under 20 milligrams or you can shorten the duration of the time that you're on the steroid that's very helpful in terms of mitigating your risk the third drug i'd like to mention are the acid blocking drugs proton pump inhibitors many of you might have seen that study published in july in the american journal of gastroenterology i think it made headlines in other medical journals such as the new york times but that study was a population-based online survey of about 55 000 people and they looked at the question whether there was an increased risk of contracting covet and people who are taking acid blocking drugs and again they found that people who are on these drugs long term meaning several months not just taking it for a week or two did indeed have a significantly increased risk somewhere between two and three times higher depending on how much you were taking than the general population which is really significant it makes perfect sense because we know that stomach acid is one of our main defenses against infection along with the skin and our mucous membranes and we've known for decades that these drugs increase the risk of other enteric infections like c different salmonella etc so it's not a surprise but again this is something that the average person out there can probably do with the help of their doctor if they're on a proton pump inhibitor is to think about getting off and seeing what other modalities might be effective in treating whatever the ppi was being used to treat thank you dr michelle that's what student talked to us about microbial populations that shift with covin how could shifts in gut microbial populations end up affecting covet acquisition or progression um yeah so it's it's pretty generally accepted that dysbiosis can be associated with uh say increased intestinal permeability permeability um endotoxin concentrations in blood um causing more uh dispersed inflammation in the body um there's some evidence that this occurs with uh stars cov2 uh with studies um that uh gi disorders and coded patients associated with worse outcomes that i think as robin mentioned um and this might contribute to the cytokine storm and general inflammation as we mentioned before um there's also a known relationship between uh gut microbes in the lungs called the gut lung axis you may have heard of the gut brain axis um there are many different axes but essentially alterations to the gut microbiome through drugs diet you know every disease as we've mentioned um is associated with altered immunity in the word lungs um for instance the gut microbiome uh associates with copd uh asthma um and it's thought that this relationship can occur occur in part through metabolic prototype products sorry of bacterial uh fermentation of fibers um and those are called uh short chain fatty acids um and just broadly um you know kind of there's a lot of crosstalk between the microbiome and uh immunity and regulation um and particularly bring it back to the gut for a second too um uh maintenance of homeostasis is really important there and induction of what are called t regulatory cells that kind of as it sounds play a role in uh regulation of immune response um so yeah that might be a potential uh direct and indirect mechanisms you dr michelle dr chuckin we've been hearing a lot of about people who recover from the acute illness who we hear a lot about people with covet who recover from the acute illness but are left with chronic lingering symptoms can you tell us more about that sure i think you're referring to what we've come to call long-haul or syndrome and people who are not recovering so if you contrast the flu for example doug at about two weeks out from contracting classic influenza 90 percent of people are typically recovered and back to baseline the number seems far lower for covid cdc data of about 270 patients showed that two weeks after hospitalization with coved the majority of them were still not at their baseline and i think it speaks to the systemic effects of this virus that kate and sona have alluded to and how much we still don't know but what we do know is that there is definitely a cohort of people who seem to continue to have symptoms not just weeks but even months after infection there are three main categories for this long hauler syndrome that seem to be identified one is dysautonomia and that is primarily going to affect things like blood pressure respiratory rate heart rate where people might for example get dizzy sitting up suddenly and have these significant alterations and perturbations in their blood pressure and heart rate another category is sort of post-exertional malaise where even mild exercise or mild exertion like going up a flight of stairs can trigger significant symptoms and then the third really falls into the category of a sort of chronic fatigue syndrome category now of course there are literally dozens of other symptoms from tremors and headaches to all kinds of things that people have described but these seem to be the three main ones the people who are affected seem to be primarily women with an average age of around 45 and i think there's a lot of debate right now i think many people suffering from long-hauler syndrome have felt like the medical community is gaslighting them not taking the symptoms seriously many of these symptoms are hard to sort of objectively identify and prove and um there's conflicting issues of people sometimes who may have other reasons to claim long-term disability from this so it's a really fraught area but i think we have very convincing evidence that long-hauler syndrome is real and it definitely needs to be explored and researched and in many ways doug it's not that dissimilar from things like post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome where we know that after an infectious episode be it viral bacterial or fungal many people go on to develop classic irritable bowel syndrome with gastrointestinal symptoms that last for years so i think there's a real corollary between something like post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and post covid long hauler syndrome and as we have a longer trajectory from time of infection to potential recovery i think we'll start to learn more about this thank you thanks for watching can you update us on the latest clinical trials and treatments for kovid yes um well it's a blessing that the whole world has actually been working on this for the last um non-stop for eight months uh as per clinical trials.gao there are about um 1800 uh trials and studies right now ongoing uh where they're actually recruiting uh patients right now and in addition to that there are another 850 trials that are not recruiting yet but will start um so now there are lots and lots of interesting data that's coming out and i'm very optimistic that we will get something uh and thanks to the whole methodology of drug repurposing um that's why we're able to very quickly uh come up with these drugs and put them in into the trials um so for those of you not familiar with drug repurposing it is just um using an fda approved drug that was approved for some other condition uh and that can be tried for covid for example hydroxylate coral queen which actually has made the headlines and it's still talked about a lot is one of those drugs uh but unfortunately it's not panned out rendezvous we is again one of those drugs that was actually approved for ebola um and that's being tried right now but in addition um i keep looking at this every single day to see whether something is coming going to come out or not so there are a couple of drugs that have come out recently or at least in their last uh stages um are these anti-inflammatory drugs that have been approved for crohn's disease rheumatoid arthritis um it's called epilo mode um it's one of those everyone is thinking that that will be very promising so there are quite a few of those uh that are almost in the last phases um and of course in addition to all of these there are lots of vaccine trials that everybody is seeing in the news hopefully something will pan out thank you now let's take questions from the audience dr pursuit event what is the difference between functional medicine and systemic medicine which you mentioned so system system maker systems medicine is pretty much looking at uh the person as a whole uh so for example if a person has type 2 diabetes it's not just giving the metformin and be done with it but then taking metformin is actually going to lead to lots of other side effects so pretty much looking at their other conditions looking at lots of other parameters and then looking them as a whole so the whole concept of cura personalis so looking at the person as a whole so functional medicine is more um biochemical and at the cellular level what is happening so we actually come up with the whole concept of systems medicine and personalized personalization of the treatment based on functional uh attributes that we are seeing and again i want to emphasize one size does not fit all so we have to um look at each person individually um and then um see what works best for them excellent thank you this is for for all the panelists can you share the best ways of practicing good microbiome health i'm happy to start with that one i like to sum it up in three simple words dirt sweat and vegetables but in all seriousness diet is probably the largest contributor in terms of controllable factors and what are the things that we need to eat for a healthy microbiome in digestible plant fiber poorly digestible plant fiber so that would be things like celery and onions garlic leeks all that stringy fiber what we call max microbiota accessible carbohydrates which would include oats and different kinds of beans are also really important when we look at communities around the world that have really healthy microbiomes those tend to be the foods that we see as well as limiting processed foods uh limiting refined sugar alcohol uh large amounts of animal protein and fat so really a primarily plant-based or plant-powered if you will diet that's high in unprocessed fiber seems to be very healthy exposure to nature is also important because we get most of our microbes at birth but we continue to acquire them from the soil so spending time in nature is important and also thinking about where the food you're eating came from was it grown in microbially rich soil or was it sort of assembled in a factory somewhere that's another important factor and then of course avoiding unnecessary medications that can be destructive to the microbiome with antibiotics being at the top of the list followed closely by some of the other drugs we talked about acid blocking drugs steroids etc so i like to think of it in terms of remove replace restore remove are there things in your medicine cabinet that are not serving you that are also not necessary that you can get rid of um restore is how can you sort of get out into nature and get closer to the soil and then replace is really the diet uh how can you increase the amount of indigestible plant fiber so that you can increase the healthy species for example bacteria like fecal bacteria and prosnici the most prevalent bacteria in vegans that we know is protective against cardiometabolic disease colon cancer etc thank you to all the panelists are there specific behaviors and precautions that lupus patients should do or take beyond the general ones already mentioned to protect themselves from covet 19. i think i'm a rheumatologist full disclosure i'm a gastroenterologist but as many of you know lupus does pose significant risks to the kidneys of kidney disease and kidney disease seems to be an important comorbidity for covet along with some of the other things we talked about like heart disease and lung disease so if you're a lupus patient who already has kidney disease and might even be on dialysis you really need to take extra precautions and you should talk to your nephrologist about what those might look like if you're a lupus patient who isn't aware of kidney disease that might be something just to check and make sure to have your kidney function checked and make sure that you do have kidney function that's within normal limits and if not to see if there are additional precautions which would have more to do with um harboring at home and things like that limiting interaction with large crowds and so on but just the additional precautions we use for people who are at increased risk and then of course i'd mentioned steroids trying to get down to a lower dose of steroids if you are on a drug like that those are all things that can be helpful thank you for dr michelle can you repeat what types of compromised immune illnesses which are more likely to be impacted by covet 19 uh sure so this is this comes from cdc guidance um and the i think folks all of the ones i mentioned are are folks who should really you know be taking a lot of precautions um wearing masks etc um the higher risk per cdc is for uh folks who uh are immunocompromised from solid organ transplants um and folks um uh living with cancer um living with type 2 diabetes obesity are at particularly high risk but you know of course folks with hypertension um other living with hiv um or or other um conditions should should you know i you know there are definitely still at risk um and uh maybe not at highest risk but still at risk um and again i am not an md so i don't want to do anything prescriptive um but you know and we should all be taking um as many precautions as we can minimizing uh uh transmission and uh preserving our health so thank you dr michelle dr masturban can somebody who has recovered from kovid and presumably has antibodies still be a vector of transmission in other words if they are exposed to covet again and their antibodies are effectively fighting it can they transmit covet to others during this process uh yeah so there is data that very little data that is coming out and it's actually this confusing data that is coming out so there are different uh categories of this so there are people who have been infected say about six months ago um and they don't have antibodies anymore and they didn't even know that they actually had um you know they had antibodies or not that is that's again a very confusing thing so say that a person who's had povet and tested positive for um covered antibodies and they come down with uh covet again and so um they definitely can transmit that but then it's a contradicting antibodies are supposed to protect you from the infection again but now we are learning that these antibodies actually are not that protective for everyone so there are cases where they do have and they've been infected the second time and in fact i know leave a couple of cases uh there's not much of literature on it where it's actually been fatal the second time um so i'm just going to see if um dr chukkin as a physician has anything more to add more to um to this i think you're exactly right with your comments so now we we really don't know and uh we have as you said seen cases where antibodies are not protective against transmitting the question of reinfection is also something that there's a lot of interest in and to also sort of add to the confusion it depends on what sort of you know who is doing the antibody testing etc there are various levels of accuracy um if we look at something like convalescent plasma we thought that that was going to be much more helpful than it was in terms of you know using these antibodies to create immunity in in unexposed and uninfected people and that has not seemed to be the case so i think there's still a lot of work to be done and i know that some of the immunologists are hard at work on this and we should have some more answers soon thank you i just want to add uh one more point to um uh robbins uh that it all depends on the viral load um so a lot of people who we are talking about being asymptomatic actually carry the virus but they are not getting uh the symptoms they're not coming down with the symptoms because they're the load of the virus is actually low enough that they're not able to see any symptoms but they still can infect other people and so it all boils down to the virus load uh how much viruses that they're carrying but they definitely can infect other people thank you dr chuckin how does food security impact minority communities and gut health and what are two things we can do to strengthen outcomes that's such a great question and particularly now that we're dealing with a double whammy of dealing with covet and really recognizing all the racial and social injustice in our country because we know that there is a direct link between many of these conditions that we've talked about that are deadly on their own and combined with a pandemic are really just devastatingly deadly we know that there's an increased prevalence of diseases like hypertension diabetes and obesity in our minority populations and we also know as whoever's asking this very good question pointed out that food insecurity is a major issue in these populations i think we really have to look at uh make prevention a really important aspect of our public health measures not just looking at yes it's important to make sure that more minorities are included in the vaccine trials but it's also really important to make sure that the basic work for our minority populations are done which is access to not just decent healthcare but access to really healthy food access to microbiome enhancing foods and so you really can't separate this issue of minorities living in food deserts and not having access to proper nutrition to then developing diseases to then being at increased risk for coving it's all related and then when you add into that makes the facts that the fact that a disproportionate number of minorities in this country are essential workers it's not surprising that minorities are dying in record numbers and in really disproportionate numbers and so again i think this has to be a really combined tactic of not just how can we get things like vaccines and medications but how can we improve general nutrition in these populations there's some really terrific people working in this area of food and security both in dc and nationally and i hope they'll really be able to make that connection between covet and really make it a priority for our public health system thank you dr chuck we are almost the time we have one more question this is to all the panelists can the panelists share their thoughts on daily vitamins or supplements as a way to build immunity um specifically looking at probiotics in the diet as well as kombucha dr michelle would you like to start off answering that question uh i will have to say again i am not an md uh i don't want to potentially wade into anything that's uh prescriptive and um you know i think we also have to deal with you know i've seen studies that that supplements uh over the counter are not always you know what what we think they are uh within them so uh i i think um i think as robin's pointed out and and i don't want to put words around but i think a diet a healthy diet uh exercise getting good sleep you know reducing your stress these things are part of your your whole being and your health as a whole um we're increasingly learning how how stress can really affect your body and health um and i think um thinking about it a little more holistically um can you know kind of work at uh improving your health so that's what i'll say and i'll defer to uh robin for any more specifics that he's more knowledgeable about there's there's been thank you for that kate there's been a lot of interest in vitamin d and there have been some studies from singapore and other countries suggesting that people with low vitamin d levels have a worse outcome for coving and while that is the case there is an association a couple things some of those studies didn't take into account all the other comorbidities that could have affected that so people with lower vitamin d levels are also more likely to have some of these other diseases that the studies didn't necessarily account for but the bigger issue is that even though there is a correlation between and when i say low vitamin d levels i don't mean low normal i mean below normal so we're talking up below typically 32 or in some studies 25 micrograms so levels for example in the teens or low 20s might be correlated but there is also no evidence that taking vitamin d particularly if you have a normal vitamin d level will do anything other than potentially create vitamin d toxicity which is a real problem so there is zero scientific recommendation to take a vitamin d supplement unless you are deficient if you are truly deficient there is evidence that repleting having a vitamin d level is healthy for good health in general we have not shown that repleting vitamin d if you're deficient decreases your risk for covid but it's a good idea but again i'll repeat no evidence that if you have a normal level even if that's low normal that you should take vitamin d other things that have been talked about including vitamin c and zinc again no evidence that they're helpful for covid so my biggest piece of advice really is some of the basic things which is diet stress sleep exercise those will take you a long way and as kate said often when you're taking a supplement this is an unregulated market you have no idea what's actually in it you could be taking something that could be affecting your liver or kidneys these are some of the main organs of detoxification and putting unnecessary stress on your body so really don't recommend taking something that you've you know seen advertised on the internet etc in the absence of good scientific guidelines so if something's working we should be hearing from the cdc dr student do you have any uh quick comments on that that question before we wrap up yes am i i agree with kate and robin so i think it's better to supplement yourself with food and you know any foods that are rich in vitamins to go not the natural way than actually taking something from the over the counter especially vitamin d as dr chutkin actually said that it's actually very tricky because vitamin d although it's called a vitamin is actually not a vitamin it's a hormone and so it regulates lots of different things and so before you start putting yourself on vitamin d i think you should talk to your physician and test the levels that you have and if it's normal there's nothing it's going to do by taking more vitamin d except it might harm you um just that's what the studies have shown so going natural is the best way take a lot of turmeric that is what that works and kombucha anybody have comments on kombucha kombucha is healthier than soda that's um what i will say but kombucha has no health benefits when it comes to has no demonstrated scientific benefits when it comes to covid or specifically for improving the microbiome it's a healthy alternative to soda and i don't think it's harmful but the idea that drinking kombucha can boost your immune system is an unproven claim thank you and with that we are at time um i would like to thank our panelists for wonderful engaging and informative session thank you all so much and with that we'll turn it back over to kelly for a few last closing words thanks again thank you doug thank you again douglas robin kate and sona for taking the time to have this discussion with our community thank you all for joining us today and taking part in the conversation please look out for our follow-up email which will

19,Bl3gMV4K960,IMHsingapore,Mental Health Training for Frontline Workers - An Introduction,2020-07-22T05:48:14Z,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people around the world. Apart from the clinical syndrome associated with the infection, it has disrupted the lives of many. In Singapore, the outbreak amongst our migrant workers (MW) has impacted on their work and lives in significant ways. The psychological impact has been extremely varied, ranging from physical symptoms like pain, poor appetite, and insomnia, to emotional difficulties such as anxiety and depressed mood. Some can also present with symptoms suggestive of more serious mental illnesses such as psychosis. For many, the symptoms are mild and transitory, but a minority may develop severe mental health concerns such as suicidality and aggression that require additional support. 

This webinar aims to provide an overview of the mental health issues faced by MWs, and introduces the audience to “Psychological First Aid”, a simple tool that can provide frontline workers with basic knowledge and skills to help MWs affected by the crises in their lives. We will also introduce the audience to the workflow for management of MWs with mental health distress.",,True,True,True,True

[Music] logic brain is telling me this will end soon you'll get out of this it's just a cycle and then the emotional side of my brain is like nothing's ever gonna be okay again you're gonna be stuck like this forever this is the rest of your life having bipolar is like white-knuckling every day of your existence the highs can be really great and the lows are always very terrifying during a manic episode the longest time I've gone without sleep was either seven or eight days a lot of fast talking and grandiose feelings like you're a superhero when I was in a very deep depressive state I would just spend a lot of time in bed not feeling like myself it is something that is just so oppressive that you literally can do nothing to shake it I feel bad there's nothing I could do helpless as a parent when I was first diagnosed I wanted to do it without medication it turns out it's very very difficult this is a mood stabilizer antipsychotic and an antidepressant that perfect cocktail of medications that helped keep me stable [Music] my name is Andrea and I live with bipolar type 1 my name is Alistair and I live with bipolar type potato usually I'll roll over when the first alarm goes off take the pills roll back over and go back to sleep run away I try to take them at the same time every day even if I miss like one dose I start getting this is effexor that's the only bipolar medication I take during the day except for anxiety medication the first mood that I take at night is as I approach to an anti-psychotic and mood stabilizer and then this is a just a vitamin D because I'm super vitamin D deficient bipolar is a mental illness and it's characterized by mood swings that can last anywhere from a week to a couple of months if you're bipolar type one you have a lot more highs and mania than you do lows and depression and if you're bipolar type two you generally have more depression than mania personally I have a rapid cycle so I can go from one to the next really quickly it can range from having all the energy in the world to the next day feeling like you can't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom I don't want to be bothered I don't want to hang out with anybody it feels like everything's closing in around you and it's impossible to break out of it I'd say the most frustrating part for me about having bipolar because it is different for everybody has been the medication dance it took years of trial and error to get to a point where I was even somewhat stable you're trying all these different meds and you really have to trust your psychiatrist and you really have to trust in the process you know halfway through it it's very hard to do that because you're not feeling better but you're taking all these pills and you're paying all these co-pays and it feels like it's never gonna end as somebody that's stable like I know that at any time one of these meds could stop working and I'm gonna have to go through all that all over again [Music] this is my planner from 2019 you can see what I was handling at the time I was taking maybe six different classes in addition to being over RC student athlete I was also involved with our campus newspaper and working for a sports team on top of clubs so you can see I was handling a lot one joke I have my friends that there's type-a and then there's type andrea planners for me help keep me stable say if I'm a little more manic it gets all of my racing thoughts out so just that way I can start my workday with a very clear mindset bipolar one is when a person is most likely to have a more manic episode manic episodes manifest differently for different kinds of people for me they tend to have a lot more energy I tend to be more irritable and I would go maybe up to a week without sleeping I tend to feel like I'm still on top of the world but also I was gambling I was over drinking I was spending money that I didn't have left and right that's kind of the dangerous thing about mania is that you're engaging in really dangerous behaviors but you don't recognize them as being dangerous when it comes to balancing the mania and the depression there is definitely this overarching theme of what comes up must come down often it can rather be more of a crash than a smooth fall sophomore year college and my spring semester I hit a major depressive episode I was on our school's rowing team and one february winter practice we were out on the water and came across a dead body that one occurrence triggered a series of panic attacks during workouts and practices that eventually led into a very deep depressive state and a lot of suicidal thoughts that eventually landed me in the psychiatric hospital it was quite honestly very scary they had taken all of my belongings including things that I could have used to hurt myself the doctor prescribed me of antidepressant that is obviously meant to cure depression but in cases of bipolar it actually raises the manic symptoms it's actually a very common thing to have a misdiagnosis before getting diagnosed with bipolar disorder my mood went from zero to like 1,000 and without proper medications I was spiraling out of control [Music] so I think communication is one of the most important parts of recovery Jian is one of the closest people I have in my life and he is the owner of Jackson's automotive he's known that I've been bipolar pretty much since the jump I'm very open about it I don't really hide it from anybody and he was just like okay cool so that's just something that you deal with I get excited to come up here because being around somebody that I know well you know gets it and that doesn't judge me and I count myself very lucky not a lot of people have that kind of outlet I'm gonna bang really loud is that a problem over time I learned how to help him in different ways by just being there and being a good friend and asking what the right thing to do is in the right situations even when he says sometimes like no I'm okay like a couple hours later it's worth checking in again and being like alright you still feeling that like are we still good and then if it seems like it's like tilting in one way you know we got to do something about it or hang out or do something I've dealt with my own anxiety and depression in my lifetime which is nowhere near the level or magnification of what he deals with but it definitely makes me a lot softer to it it's helpful to help other people you know it you feel better at the end of it so as much as I feel like crap if I can help him and then I see he feels better I'm like alright cool and vice versa I feel the same way when we're both having a really tough time we tend to break stuff whether it be breaking hockey pucks against the the wall out there we've flipped trucks we've cut trucks up we've parked trucks on top of cars parked trucks on top of cars that was a fun one it always ends in us being like hey man I'm not feeling great today let's talk about it so it is constructive as much as it is destructive see some of my manic episodes are great cuz I'll buy hockey tickets and then he's just like oh cool [Laughter] I loved her run running has been this huge release for whenever I'm depressive or manic so when I'm depressed I can feel those endorphins immediately improving my mood but when I manic it helps me release all this extra energy that I would otherwise just be sitting with running is just peaceful it's possibly the most peaceful part of my day currently I train with a Track Club based out of Brooklyn I've spent my entire life being an athlete of some sort so when I finished college I missed having that sense of community I love the way sports can bring people together my dad and I will talk a lot about baseball and basketball growing up he was always the one to bring me to different sporting events nothing feels better than when I can just sit back and watch a game and just relax [Music] well usually come here we cook dinner I like to cook together we do cook well watch the hockey games ever-present throughout my life he was a good kid good thing because then I wouldn't had any more if he wasn't but he spoiled me but he was a very good kid I had him when I was very young so it's always been me and him you know hit the first born I guess the first sign of really bad mental illness was when my father passed away it was very sudden there was a car accident it just happened when I was 13 and that's when I started to get like really depressed for the first time I think it was 16 I was having heart palpitations you need to take me to the hospital that might that was like the first time I ever had a panic attack I didn't know about like anxieties and the sonars like he had to tell me I didn't like see it especially growing up with parents that were born during like the Depression years it was shut up and get through it like grandma's shut up and they didn't talk about nothing no everything was new we just put on pull on your bootstraps and you go through it there's obvious signs of you know depression or anxiety throughout the family but nobody ever talked about it I'm the first person that's kind of stood up and said this is what's going on so as far as mental health stigmas go I think we're in a better place than we were a decade ago there's still a lot of room to grow in terms of how people see mental illness they might think of you know the crazy person locked up in an asylum but in reality it's a very real and very common experience if mental health was taken a little bit more seriously in this country or if we had maybe a medicare-for-all type deal it might be a lot easier for people to get help and then you wouldn't have so many people living on the streets because they can't afford their medication you know the worst case is they end up living with a mental illness and they don't have the money or the education or even the support system they need in their mental health journey would you choose to live without it that's a good question honestly I don't think I would change having bipolar disorder it's hard to say I would pick to live with an illness over not living with an illness but retrospectively it's part of what makes me me and it's something that I identify with now while it's terrifying to even think that tomorrow maybe my antipsychotic stops working and I need to go on another med merry-go-round at the same time I don't think I would give that up because it's an integral part of who I am and I don't think I would want to be anybody different at this point [Music] you ",False,False,True,False

The long-term mental health impact the coronavirus pandemic is going to leave on society.

Strict health measures put into place by countries to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus gave individuals little time to prepare for, or even process, all the consequences that this would lead to: job losses, economic collapse, and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships.

Emanuela Campanella dives into why we should be paying attention to mental health and the impact it may have long after the pandemic is over. 

If you or someone you know is in crisis and needs help, resources are available. In case of an emergency, please call 911 for immediate help.

The Straits Times, the English flagship daily of SPH, has been serving readers for more than a century. Launched on July 15, 1845, its comprehensive coverage of world news, East Asian news, Southeast Asian news, home news, sports news, financial news and lifestyle updates makes The Straits Times the most-read newspaper in Singapore.","249 you covet 19 cases were confirmed today taking Singapore's total to over 46,000 800 they include 16 community cases all of whom are what pass holders and 4 were close contacts of earlier cases and already in quarantine there was also five important cases reported today who had been placed on stay home notices upon arrival in Singapore now more details will be announced tonight another copy 19 developments Hong Kong has brought in tougher social distancing rules to fight a spike of new infections and a vaccine developed by US company Madonna is showing promising early results let's discuss all of this and more with Professor Kyoya King Dean of the soaring Hawk School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore welcome back professor Chiyo now infections in the foreign worker dormitories have been hovering between 100 and 200 new cases daily since the end of June but rose to the 300 recently so while the numbers in the dorms aren't as high as the peak in April they haven't fallen by as much as some including yourself had expected why is that though as much as I hope my previous prediction of three to four weeks in late May for the Dom situation to stabilize a lot more will come true I'm very sorry that it didn't happen and in fact it will take a while longer for the dama tree situation to fully clear and this is certainly something that many of us underestimated that as we learn more and more about how the corona virus is transmitted we start to realize the implication to high density settings such as the migrant worker dormitories two aspects I will talk about firstly the number of foreign workers living in a dama trees we know that is very high and it is clear now that there are hidden reservoirs or infections that can happen within the community as well as in the dama trees and especially when we know a symptom take infections can potentially happen while the majority of the dama trees had been isolated the spread can continue within the dama tree in their infected foreign workers who are asymptomatic or who are very Maori symptomatic the second reason is that it comes back to the definition of the households we know that the corona virus is highly transmissible within a household unit in the user households in the community we usually have between three to six members in each household and we know that if one member of the household is in fact that it is almost certain there will be other members in the same household that will be infected in the dama tree each room houses between 10 to 20 residents but because and initially we anticipate the spread will happen within the room to the residents within the same room but because there are shared facilities as well such as toilets showers what basic basins we know that such high touch points have been shown to contain potentially high viral load so the definition of the household in a dhama tree can now actually be an entire floor level which may have 10 or more rooms so couple with the very recent evidence that the virus could be airborne and now you imagine a household unit not with free to six members but potentially 100 to 200 members and this is really the reason why the spread in the dormitories is going to take a while longer to contain and clear given the new wave of cases in countries like Hong Kong and also even in Australia what lessons should Singapore draw from that I think let's firstly recap what is happening around the world that it's worrying we have Japan Tokyo now have reinstating its highest alert level reimposing quite a lot of this restriction particularly around clubs and workplaces Hong Kong similarly reimposing restrictions closing down hong kong disneyland gyms bars restaurants banging civil service people are reminded that if they can work from home please do so australia victorious eight undergoing a six weeks lockdown so I think this is exactly the situation that many countries in the world even those with very good public health measures and systems but yet we see that there will be this occasional recurrence of spread and that's where you could see there will be a repeater closures that will be necessary and this really reminds us that their rescue and outbreak up there and Singapore is still in the states of DOS con Orange it is still happening the spread is happening within Singapore so what is happening in Japan Hong Kong Australia South Korea can equally happen in Singapore and I think this is the mindset that all of us have to get used to we still need to stay cautious and we need to be conditioned that there may be some closures that may happen even in Singapore and preferably we hope that this will be sector base closures let's look outwards a little bit Singapore and Malaysia said to open a green lane for long term pass holders and essential travellers next month will this lead to more important cases and also a new wave of infections so I certainly hope that you will not because if we put in place the right measurements the safe precautionary measurements such as the ones that we currently have the China decribe with requiring free travel testing on arrival testing some degree of reporting and sticking to a specific itinerary requiring people who are coming into Singapore to download trace together or to have a trace together token I think this part important measures that will minimize as much as possible the risk of importations the race is certainly on to find a vaccine a US firm owner announced that it will soon begin the final stage of human trials how significant is this exactly and what does it mean for the waiting time for a Kobe 19 vaccine so Madonna announced that it's trial on 45 subjects successfully produced neutralizing antibodies on all 45 of them and the neutralizing antibodies are the crucial building blocks to protect one against being infected by the corona virus so that's a piece of very good news the second piece of good news is that we observe also this dose response relationship meaning people who receive a higher dose of the Vectra vaccine actually did produce a higher level of neutralizing antibodies so those are two pieces of good news and I can see from the stock markets that it was equally reflected with some very positive gains there so while there is some good news today that we should definitely cheer about realistically there are still many steps ahead before people like you and me can get hold of a safe effective vaccines that allow us to return to live before qubit 19 and definitely to the holidays that we are looking forward to oh thanks for the time is always proved to you that was Professor Julia King who is the dean at the sorcery Hawk School of

Because we handle and attend to a lot of guests from all around the world so you never know where they come from. I'm afraid that I might get infected even by the slightest cough or sneeze from them. My initial response was ""Okay, you know what? This is just something that's happening in the other part of the earth we don't have to be so concerned about it."" The third week into the year when we started having cases I got a little bit kiasi (scared) and yeah, you get a little bit scared of it. We did brief our room attendants to pay extra attention to guests who have some (COVID-19) symptoms. ""Fearful"" is not the word. It's more of being more observant about them. When this whole (COVID-19) virus thing came about we were more observant of our guests and we started to really take notice of each and every guests' well-being. My team members are really worried but of course I have to convince them and as a leader I have to show them that ""Hey, it's okay. You just follow the guidelines from the MOH (Ministry of Health) from the government and from there you know, you'll be safe."" So when the first (COVID-19) case happened in my hotel I had to break the news to my team. They were all thinking ""Is it one of the rooms I've cleaned?"" A lot of them were looking at me very fearfully, and saying [In Mandarin] ""Boss, can I go on leave? I suddenly feel unwell. I suddenly have a sore throat. My nose keeps running."" So I just told them, ""You are scaring yourself. How long have you had this sore throat for?"" [In English] Yeah so you just need to talk some sense into them talk logic to them and that's when you calm them down. Guests were fearful of us. This was during the onset of the coronavirus when Singapore was number two (in the COVID-19 case rankings). It's to the extent that when we cleared our throats, right everyone would just stare at us like, ""What are you doing?"" Half of my team members are actually from PRC (People's Republic of China). So when they went into the rooms and wanted to clean the guests would just say ""Eh Mummy, let's get out of the room quickly. This person (is from) China."" Yeah, so of course that really hurt them big time I had one of them come down crying to me and I had to spend a long time to really just tell them ""Eh, look. People just say things without thinking it through. Okay, don't take it to heart."" There was one guest who he didn't really want to talk to any one of us in fact. But he's our regular. So I decided to approach him and ask him ""Is there anything wrong with us?"" because he usually likes how we attend to him. So then he decided to open up and he said he was actually quite scared because of (the situation that was happening) and he was distancing himself from every single one of us. So I educated him and said that ""Not to worry we've been trained we sanitise and we clean."" He wasn't really that convinced but he said, ""I will only talk to you."" But as time went by he saw that my other teammates  were approaching guests at a certain distance. So he felt safe after that and he decided to open up his presence to the rest of my team members. Sometime in December last year we were all looking forward to 2020. 2020 is a year where you have a lot of key events So we were really excited and we were actually filling up our numbers, so I told myself, ""Wow. 2020 is really going to be a great year I'm just looking forward to it."" One week before Chinese New Year we started receiving calls from our clients saying ""Hey, you know there's this outbreak of (the COVID-19 virus)."" I read emails about cancellations and then event organisers were writing to me and one said ""The event is not going to happen this year. It's going to be pushed (back) to next year."" I've only been in this hospitality industry for about seven years. To be very honest, this is my first crisis. So it's the first time where my clients are rejecting me not wanting to see me. and they said, ""Prem, you know what? Let's see each other after this whole (COVID-19) virus thing ends."" No such thing as (being) free. We still have to continue (to maintain) our hygiene, cleaning  taking care of the places (in the hotel). Previously we did (cleaning) at guest lifts like those high touch, high traffic areas every two hours and now we have increased the frequency to every half an hour for all the lift buttons. I will do random checks as well I'll go to our Fire Command Centre to see through the CCTVs (Closed Circuit Televisions) to make sure that the staff really go to every single area and follow the timings and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). [In Mandarin] It's not that we have nothing to do. [In English] It's far from that actually because we understand the importance of increasing the frequency to do this in order to get the public's confidence (in us). For me, as someone who has come through and experienced swine flu myself I understand how painful it is to go through and experience (being infected) so I don't want any of my team members I don't want any of their family members or any of the general public to experience this. So I am doing my part to ensure that we eliminate or minimise this as much as we can. I must say I'm very fortunate. I'm pretty grateful for how we took things very positively. We have been cross-training. I learnt how to actually clean the rooms personally and maintain their cleanliness. The mattress is actually quite heavy, you know. [laughs] I'm surprised by how all of our room attendants and housekeepers the ladies (especially), manage to actually lift it up and then fold (the sheets) tightly underneath the beds. I never thought that the job was so hard because I cleaned up and when I stripped the second bed I was already sweating and I was exhausted. So what I learnt out of this thing is when you're at work you always think that your problem is the biggest problem and you don't look at how much your colleague is actually going through. Yeah so now when I see a housekeeper I'm like, ""Hey. You're the man, man."" Did my family and friends stay away from me? No, they didn't stay away from me I stayed away from them. I was actually involved with the disinfecting of the confirmed (COVID-19) case rooms so I didn't want to bring the virus back to my family and my friends. So during this period of time after I did the disinfecting I stayed in the hotel for one week. During this one week I stayed predominantly in my office and in the guest room, that was it. I didn't go anywhere else. My mother works she used to work in the frontline as well customer service so she understands that I communicate with lots of people. She is worried but she doesn't show it at all. I had a birthday party that I was supposed to attend yesterday and this was planned two weeks ago. And my friends they are aware of my exposure in the hotel. They told me that it's best that I skip this this birthday party. I do feel really sad but then again at the end of the day I think it's for the better, for everyone's (good). Actually to be honest, we (as people) in the cleaning industry, right we are actually cleaner than a lot of other people. Yeah because we know how to do everything already we know that we need to wash our hands frequently we use the sanitiser on us all the time. Like, I taught my son because he sprayed the sanitiser all over (the surface). I said, ""No, no, no, you must spray it on the cloth instead of spraying it on the surface."" So these are some things that sometimes people do incorrectly. I even taught my wife how to sanitise her handbags. [laughs] Sometimes she puts it on the table she will put it everywhere so she will put it at home you know, then my kids will touch it. So I think for personal belongings it's important to sanitise like handbags, handphones and shoes as well. I think it's great that everyone is more kiasi (scared) now. I think the reason why we are managing it better is because of how kiasi (scared) we were at the very initial stage. My colleagues my friends the people at work Yeah, that keeps me going because the bond is there. In fact, it grew stronger because everyone is taking care of each other like if one finds out that they're sick (others) are willing to sacrifice (their time to help them) as well. What keeps me going these days is I realise that there's so many people so many of my colleagues who are actually out there helping me. For example, business is really slow now and I've got my colleagues from Marketing I've got my colleagues from HR (Human Resources) I even have my GM's (General Manager) secretary coming to me and telling me ""Prem, do you want to try calling my friend from this company? He may have some business for you."" What used to be a very selfish view that I saw of us just managing our own things, our own departments has turned around over this period. Everyone is helping each other. When I finish cleaning or disinfecting the confirmed (COVID-19 case) room, right I have people coming up to me, thanking me and saying, ""Thank you for doing this for the hotel."" Yeah it's these kind of things where people actually make effort to show their gratitude that I believe is worth doing for. During the Malaysian border ban when we came to work the next morning we realised that we were picking up a lot of reservations that were coming in mainly to accommodate the Malaysian workers who were staying in Singapore. That day was really a nightmare because suddenly, we had a lot of pickups. So we needed to set up all the rooms within a few hours. All of the departments' colleagues from our executive office to our hotel managers everybody from the executive office came to the hotel site looking for me asking, ""Jack, what should we do (to help)?"" We were all very excited. We went through five weeks of very low occupancy and then we realised ""Eh, today we're going to fill up majority of our occupancy."" No one complained and we're just very excited to welcome (guests) and to have the situation get back to normal. It's like, ""Eh, let's go and help each other even if we have to break a sweat we're going to do this together."" Be positive take care of yourself. Put social responsibilities in place. Don't panic. Calm down. Take this as the best opportunity to have some cross-training to upgrade your skills. The positive thing that this brings us is that it will bond us together. We will build a stronger base together. Someday this virus is going to be behind you and this crisis is going to be beneath you and you're just going to be stronger than what you were before the virus began. You got this, man. In light of the global COVID-19 situation we take a closer look at those affected in Singapore specifically those in hotels reliant on tourism. Thank you Wati, George, Jack and Prem for sharing their experiences. Let's stay positive and weather this storm together. ",True,False,False,False

Myocarditis is heart inflammation, but to be more specific, it’s inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (outer lining of the heart). Myocarditis and pericarditis often occur together, hence the term myopericarditis. 
How often is it caused by COVID? 
How often is it caused by the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna? 
What are the symptoms of heart inflammation? 
How is it diagnosed? 
I’m going to unpack all of it in this video.

Myocarditis is an interesting diagnosis because it can present in a variety of ways. Not just in terms of various signs and symptoms, but a variety of non-specific labs in the bloodwork. Non-specific EKG findings. Non-specific echocardiogram findings, meaning ultrasound of the heart. Also, most people with this diagnosis have zero or mild symptoms. On the flip side, it can RARELY present with sudden cardiac arrest. And even if you can make the diagnosis, it’s usually even TRICKIER to determine the cause. 

Disease severity can range from unnoticeable to mild symptoms, severe illness requiring the ICU to death. More often than not, it’s a mild, temporary issue. In more serious cases, when there is more heart inflammation, the heart has a harder time pumping blood, leading to heart failure.

What are the Symptoms? 
The highest risk population for myocarditis is from puberty to the early 30s. It affects males more often than females. 
There are no specific symptoms associated with myocarditis, but common symptoms include: 
• Chest pain or pressure
• Shortness of breath
• Fatigue
• Swelling in the hands and feet
• Heart palpitations  
• Lightheadedness
• A sudden loss of consciousness 

How does COVID affect the heart?
Even though COVID is a respiratory virus, it can affect the heart in several ways. First, when COVID causes pneumonia, it can damage the lungs, decreasing the amount of oxygen that gets to the heart and making it harder for it to pump blood to the body. This is known as demand ischemia. 

Second, the inflammatory response from the immune system to fight the virus is sometimes excessive. The cytokine storm that you hear about, it’s a cascade of cytokines and chemokines of the immune system that can ultimately damage organs in the body. Basically, it's collateral damage. The damage from this inflammatory response is known to especially affect the kidneys, brain, and heart. And that’s when you have myocarditis.

What is the risk of COVID in Children?
As of June 10th,  4,008,572 children have contracted COVID. This number represents 14% of all cases and is about 5,300 cases per 100,000 children. About 17,000 children have been hospitalized, and 330 have died. COVID has been in the top 10 causes of pediatric death since the pandemic began. As a comparison, 188 children died of influenza in the 2019-2020 season. The CDC reported that as of June 9th, 2,637 people under age 30 have died of COVID. 

What is the risk of myocarditis from the COVID vaccine? 
The COVID vaccines that are mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) have caused some cases of myocarditis (heart inflammation). There have been cases and minimal studies looking at patients who developed myocarditis after getting the covid vaccine. The CDC has received 1,226 preliminary reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 300 million total doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. These preliminary reports came through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System maintained by the CDC and the FDA. Among people 12 and older, there were 267 reports of heart inflammation after one dose of vaccine, 827 after the second dose, and 132 after an unknown dose. The CDC continues to recommend COVID vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older. Why? For every million second-dose vaccinations with either Moderna or Pfizer, there may be tens of myocarditis cases, but thousands of Covid cases are prevented.

In males aged 12 to 17, it’s estimated that for every 1 million second-dose vaccinations, 5,700 Covid cases, 215 hospitalizations, 71 intensive care unit admissions, and two deaths would be prevented, with an estimated 56 to 69 myocarditis cases. For females aged 12 to 17, it's estimated that for every 1 million doses to complete a two-dose series of vaccines, 8,500 Covid cases, 183 hospitalizations, 38 intensive care unit admissions, and one death would be prevented estimated 8 to 10 cases of myocarditis. And In those aged 18 to 24 years, the numbers look even better. Since Wednesday, there’s been a joint statement from the leaders of more than a dozen health agencies and organizations -- including the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, and more – all saying that the Covid vaccines are safe and effective and that they ""strongly encourage"" everyone 12 and older to be vaccinated against Covid.

#covid #myocarditis #vaccine","myocarditis is heart inflammation or to be more 
specific it's inflammation of the heart muscle   pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium 
or the outer lining of the heart myocarditis and   pericarditis often occur together hence the term 
myopericarditis how often is it caused by covid   how often is it caused by the mrna vaccines 
pfizer and moderna and what are the symptoms   of heart inflammation how is it diagnosed i'm 
going to unpack all this in this video and if   you're new here i'm dr mike hansen welcome to my 
channel where i love to break down medical topics   and provide you with real medical explanations 
this is my dog legend he likes balls myocarditis is an interesting diagnosis 
because it can present in a variety of ways   not just in terms of various signs and 
symptoms but a variety of non-specific   labs in the blood work non-specific ekg findings 
non-specific echocardiogram findings meaning   ultrasound of the heart also most people with 
this diagnosis have zero or mild symptoms   now on the flip side it can rarely 
present with sudden cardiac arrest   and even if you are able to make the diagnosis 
it's usually even trickier to determine the cause there are lots of different things that can cause 
myocarditis heck even heavy metal can cause it you might also notice there that smallpox vaccine 
can cause it well i should say could cause it   because routine vaccination of the american public 
against smallpox stopped in 1972 after the disease   was eradicated but the most common cause of 
myocarditis is a result of the immune system   reacting to a viral infection common viral 
triggers include adenovirus coxsackievirus   influenza parbovirus b19 and herpes and of 
course you can add covid to that list as well as   the pfizer and moderna vaccines but before we 
get into the details of cases of myocarditis   after the vaccine let's get a baseline 
understanding of the seriousness of myocarditis disease severity can range from unnoticeable to 
mild symptoms to severe illness requiring icu to   death more often than not it's a mild temporary 
issue in more serious cases when there's more   heart inflammation the heart has a harder time 
pumping blood which can lead to heart failure   the highest risk population for myocarditis 
is from puberty to the age of the 30s   so it affects males more often than females there 
are no specific symptoms that are associated with   myocarditis but the common symptoms include chest 
pain or chest pressure shortness of breath fatigue   swelling in the hands and feet heart 
palpitations lightheadedness and a   sudden loss of consciousness in the early 
stages of viral myocarditis patients will   usually initially have fever in muscle aches 
now if there's pericarditis to go along with   that myocarditis the most common symptom is going 
to be chest pain and that's usually a sharp or   stabbing pain but some have a dull achy 
or pressure-like chest pain a diagnostic   clue with pericarditis is that the chest pain is 
worse when lying flat and better when sitting up making the diagnosis of myocarditis depends 
on signs and symptoms lab tests including   troponin levels and bnp certain ekg findings and 
echocardiogram findings usually a chest x-ray will   be normal but can sometimes show an enlarged heart 
coronary angiography meaning a heart cath or heart   catheterization is sometimes necessary to rule out 
coronary artery disease as a potential diagnosis   cardiac mri is indicated in patients with 
suspected myocarditis with elevated troponin   levels or if they have ventricular dysfunction 
especially if they don't have a clear cause such   as ischemic heart disease meaning coronary artery 
disease some might ultimately require a biopsy of   their heart called an endomyocardial biopsy but 
that's usually reserved for those who are very ill even though covid is a respiratory virus 
it can affect the heart in several ways   first when covid causes pneumonia it can 
damage the lungs decreasing the amount of   oxygen that gets to the heart and making 
it harder for it to pump blood to the body   this is known as demand ischemia second the 
inflammatory response from the immune system   to fight that virus is sometimes excessive the 
cytokine storm that you hear about it's a cascade   of cytokines and chemokines of the immune system 
and that can ultimately damage organs in the body   basically it's collateral damage so the 
damage from this inflammatory response   is known to especially affect the kidneys brain 
and the heart and that's when you have myocarditis   and as if that's not bad enough inflammation 
can cause small blood clots or micro thrombi   to form in different blood vessels throughout the 
body including in the capillaries of the heart   more than four thousand children have suffered 
from multi-system inflammatory syndrome in   children so mis-c which can cause inflammation of 
the heart the lungs the kidneys and the brain as   well as other organs finally sars cov2 can also 
infect the heart muscle cells themselves a study   from washington university school of medicine 
in st louis it showed that the sars cov2 virus   invades the heart muscle cells and interferes 
with contraction researchers there used stem   cells to model the contracting heart muscle tissue 
their research showed that the viral infection it   actually destroys the muscle cells and you're left 
with a heart that doesn't pump blood on a related   note when we talk about covid long haulers one 
of the common symptoms that i see from patients   in my pulmonary clinic is that they have this 
chronic central chest pain or chest pressure   especially when taking in a deep breath my 
suspicion is that there might be a small   degree of persistent myopericarditis going on 
there but that's hard to know one way or another as of june 10th about 4 million children have 
contracted covid this number represents 14 of   all cases and is about 5 300 cases per 100 000 
children about 17 000 children have   been hospitalized and 330 have died covid has 
been in the top 10 causes of pediatric death   since the pandemic began now as a comparison 188 
children died of influenza in the 2019-2020 season   the cdc has also reported that as of june 9 2600 
plus people under the age of 30 have died of covid  there have been cases in very small studies 
looking at patients who developed myocarditis   after getting the covid vaccine the cdc 
has received 1200 plus preliminary reports   of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 
300 million total doses of the pfizer and modern   vaccines these preliminary reports came through 
the vaccine adverse event reporting system that's   maintained by the cdc in the fda among people 
12 and older there were 267 reports of heart   inflammation after one dose of the vaccine 
827 after the second dose and then 132 after   an unknown dose the cdc continues to recommend 
covid 19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of   age and older why that's because for every million 
second dose vaccinations with either the moderna   or the pfizer there have been tens of myocarditis 
cases but thousands of covid 19 cases that are   prevented for males aged 12 to 17 it's estimated 
that for every 1 million second dose vaccinations   there are 5 700 covid cases 215 hospitalizations 
71 icu admissions and 2 deaths that are prevented   with an estimated 56 to 69 myocarditis cases 
for females in that same group age 12 to 17   it's estimated that for every 1 million doses 
to complete a two dose series of that vaccine   you get 8 500 covid cases 183 hospitalizations icu 
admissions and one death that would be prevented   compared to 8 to 10 cases of myocarditis and then 
when you look at the bracket of age 18 to 24 those   numbers look even better since wednesday there's 
been a joint statement from the leaders of more   than a dozen health agencies and organizations 
including the cdc the american academy of   pediatrics the american heart association and more 
and they're all saying that the covid vaccines   are safe ineffective and that they strongly 
encourage everyone 12 and older to be vaccinated   against covid 19 this is their conclusion quote 
the conclusion is that myocarditis is an extremely   rare side effect and only an exceedingly 
small number of people will experience it   after vaccination importantly for the young people 
who do most cases are mild and individuals recover   often on their own or with minimal treatment in 
addition we know that myocarditis and pericarditis   are much more common if you get covid 19 and 
the risks to the heart from covid 19 infection   can be more severe we recommend getting vaccinated 
right away if you haven't yet it's the best way to   protect yourself your loved ones your community 
and to return to a more normal lifestyle safely   and quickly that's all for this video thank you

thinkers in international affairs professor kishore mabubani really needs no introduction but let me share some highlights of his illustrious journey of indian origin he is a singaporean civil servant with two distinct careers as a diplomat he spent over 30 distinguished years at ministry of foreign affairs as an academic from 2004 he served as founding dean of the lee kuan yew school of public policy at the national university of singapore he's also a prolific writer who has spoken in many corners of the world his most recent book on the changing global order is titled has china one which was released in april this year it's a fascinating book which is tackled critical global issues head on and very candidly welcome professor mububani it's indeed a privilege and an honor to have you join vishwaran 2020. my pleasure thank you for inviting me thank you professor professor when you penned has china won the current pandemic was not even on the horizon subsequent events especially america's response to kovat 19 may have tilted the global balance even more in china's favor so my first question to you is would you have written the book any differently a year later ah that's a very good question uh well actually you know the pandemic could have completely destroyed my book for example if it showed that the united states was far more competent in its management of covet 19 and the chinese system which is in theory rigid dictatorial could have failed in response to covet 19. so then i guess people would have said ah this book is uh get thrown away but sadly uh covet 19 has actually confirmed many of the key points that i make in my book which is that the united states is making a huge strategic mistake in underestimating china and the capabilities that china has developed and you know warren buffett very famously said once it's only when the tide goes out that you discover who's naked that's right so i think the the kovite 19 basically is like that kind of a tight going out and it's actually shown how formidable the state capacities of the chinese government are and sadly it's also shown how incompetent the u.s governmental structures have become in response to uh kovite 1950s you know i explained in my book why why these has come about as i say this is a contest between a meritocracy in china and a plutocracy in in the united states and in many ways corvid 19 has actually confirmed the strengths of the chinese meritocratic system and actually unfortunately also confirmed the weaknesses of the american plutocratic system so much as i don't celebrate covet 19 uh kovind 19 has confirmed the main thesis of my book yeah true no that's true as i was reading it uh which was in april uh i was you know it kind of in the context of the unfolding pandemic and i was in the u.s at stanford university at that time i just found it almost like i said visionary in in the way it played out and unfortunate and and the bottom half of the american society and the world over of course but the american society especially has really suffered and that's the protopsy you mentioned that's very true professor you in the book you do talk about the choice uh various countries are making in this bipolar world given that vishwaran has a lot of going to have a lot of indian participants the audience would love to hear your perspective on the choice india may make in a world where china either wins or loses whose side should bharat be on america or china well i think the answer is very easy bharat should be in favor of only one country in the world which is india and in all countries uh should pursue their own national interests and india should not be serving the interests of either america or china india should put india's interests first and actually the u.s china geopolitical contest has created a magnificent geopolitical opportunity for india huge because you know the uh they're basically we're entering a world where there are three major powers i mean number one is clearly still united states number two is china and the third most important power in the world today without a doubt is india and so in you know when a joker contest begins like i i compared to a see-saw you know so if you have a see-saw with two elephants um china on one side and india and america on the other side the best position for india to take is to stand in the middle of the seesaw so wherever india puts his foot that's where the balance goes and and that's that's exactly the kind of uh geopolitical positioning uh that uh china did in the cold war you know in theory china initially was an ally of the soviet union but as you know he shifted away and also became friends with united states and therefore by having good links with uh united states and soviet union china could be the swing factor uh in the cold war and the americans cultivated china assiduously because they knew that china was a swing factor so in similar ways if india can be perceived as a swing factor then both america and china will then have to cultivate china cultivate india sorry very seriously so i would say that therefore there's a huge geopolitical opportunity for india but what india needs is great strategic thinkers like like a henry kissinger george cannon uh to advise it but of course you know strategic thinking has been very much part of uh indian strategic culture going back from coteria to the mahabharata there are all kinds of lessons you can learn you know from there so i think this this this i see this as a tremendous opportunity uh for india and in in your view or assessment is the political leadership the foreign minister who knows this area of course and and the prime minister uh our would would kind of be looking at it the way you are looking at it as well well i think i think both prime minister modi and foreign minister jashenka i think understand the geopolitical game very well and i would say prime minister modi demonstrated it by spending so much time in both in his meetings with president donald trump and with prime minister xi jinping so i think they you could see from the way modi prime minister modi behave he understood that he had to have good things with president donald trump and good luck to president xi jinping but as you know unfortunately we had the incident on june 15 2020 which was a sad incident and it shows you how history is often driven uh not just by people but by events and that event clearly changed the nature of the discourse in india right now i understand i haven't been to india recently but there's a huge wave of anti-china sentiment in india and so it ties the hands of prime minister modi ties the hands of foreign minister jashenka because then they have to be perceived to be standing up to china and so on and so forth but i hope that over time as tempest cool i think one of the key points i make is that i as you mentioned i spent 33 years in the singapore foreign service and practicing geopolitics and the biggest lesson in joke politics is that if you react emotionally you lost again completely you must be very cool calm and cunning in dealing with your politics and and that's why i hope that india will calm down and see not just the dangers from this uh china japanese contest but also see the opportunities and as you know if you read jay shankar's book he's come up with a new book the india way he says that if everyone sees that india is a member of the quad so it's a member of the quad with us japan australia and so therefore seem to be pro-american but then he adds in the book he said but india is also a member of the shanghai cooperation organization it has a trilateral discussion with china and russia so india is you know friendly with uh all parties and i think that's that's india's biggest strategic advantage is that nobody distrusts india everybody trusts india so that's a that's a wonderful advantage that india has and and that trust gives india a tremendous amount of opportunities indeed now that's that's very well put in and i think we all hope that uh as you said cooler minds prevail and and the pressures of democracy and politicking which also you discuss in the book you know are not overridden uh or over right there is short-term decision making the policy makers it's interesting you also talk on your book about the possible friendship or alliance between the usa and the ussr russia which is is very convincing and uh it's a great argument i mean i haven't seen that too often yeah oh yes i mean my book has got several surprising elements and you know frankly uh as you know gorbachev tried very hard uh he created this concept with a common house of europe you know and he said that russia should uh have a european destiny and doesn't mean that there's an age-old aspiration uh in russia you go back to tolstoy it's there you know uh but unfortunately as you know at the end of the cold war uh the biggest mistake the west made uh was to drown in hubris and arrogance and so as a result the hubris and arrogance instead of treating russia with magnanimity after winning the cold war they continued to humiliate russia after the end of the cold war and continued expanding nato bringing nato right to the doorstep of russia and i can understand why the russians would be very very uncomfortable and i think india also understands this because if you have a foreign powers uh supporting countries in the neighborhood you feel uncomfortable too so india can understand that so it's it's in many ways the west has been very unwise so which is why i suggest in my book that in the long run the biggest biggest challenge for russia is not united states america united states america is so far away the biggest challenge for russia is china because it shares a mile border with china so of course the russians have got to balance and so if the west was wiser in the way it handled uh russia then it would be much better off and if you look i know in my my in my book i say you know asean and vietnam were fighting each other ferociously and i was involved as ambassador the u.n fighting the vietnamese delegation over the vietnamese occupation of cambodia but when the cold war ended within five years vietnam had admitted asean admitted vietnam into asean and why didn't the european union do the same and see the europeans cannot even think of the idea that they can learn from asians lessons in geopolitics but i think we can teach the europeans a lesson or two moving on to something quite different you discuss the reserve status enjoyed by the us dollar and it being a potential a kylie's heel for america given the speed of technological innovation disruption that we're witnessing along with america's wide and growing deficits when do you see a potential change to this world order quite simply how and when can china topple the us dollar well i think the u.s dollar will remain the global reserve currency for a long time there is no immediate threat to it but when i say there's no immediate threat to it i do not say there is no threat to it and so what i point out in the book is that there might be a threat to it and you know the advantage of having the us dollar as the global reserve currency is that the united states is the only country that can live beyond its means you know the chinese people have to work very hard put together all the component parts and these phone arrives right in in the u.s and and all that the americans have to do is print a few dollars and they get the phones right it's a very good deal if you have the dollar as a global reserve currency but for it to survive as a global reserve currency it should not be used as a weapon by the united states to punish countries we should use the us dollars and as you know the united states has not just punished his enemies is punish his allies and bnp if i'm not mistaken please check this had to pay a fine of 9 billion dollars now any repeat that is billion not million nine billion dollars because bnp was using us dollars to trade with iran and and you bnp was not breaking any international law not breaking u.n sanctions or breaking american laws this is extra territorial application of american laws overseas and it's not wise i mean i say this all i say all these things i emphasize as a friend of the united states i'm not an enemy of the analysis i'm telling the united states it's in your interest to preserve the uh reserve status of the global of of the us dollar and the best way to preserve the reserve this is not to weaponize it and use it against your friends and adversaries and so in that sense i'm giving friendly advice because if if the world begins to turn against the u.s dollar increasingly they will find that they can find alternatives you know and and one example i gave in my book you know right now uh as you know argentina sends soya bean to china and china sends maybe close to argentina but the way they trade is they use u.s dollars right because it's the only global reserve currency all you need if you have very smart blockchain technology you can actually create a unit of value that replaces the us dollar and if countries begin to do that then the the the status of the global reserve currency is threatened and therefore it can become as you said in your question the achilles heel of the united states and so i'm actually trying to protect the achilles heel of the united states no it's a point very well made being a former banker myself the joke used to be that america funds its deficits by uh you know penalizing and finding the banks uh and as you said the the fines were in billions and were exactly on the issues that you that you mentioned i personally saw that as well and so on so well good point thank you just moving on to the other issue around china and that concerns many in the west and and here especially those in the younger generation which is that in the pursuit of economic greatness china seems to be moving uh further in a direction which is antithetical to what i termed as liberal democratic values of free speech human rights data privacy etc are you worried about that at all and how do we reconcile the achievements of china with the alleged human rights violations that they come in that they're they're you know supposed to be doing where is the line and if i could on a related uh just ask you the question about where do you see an end game for hong kong um but if i could must be the first bit first well i mean i'll answer the question in hong kong data but let me address the broad question of human rights you know i studied philosophy western philosophy and the even if you study american political philosophers uh and like the greatest recent american political philosopher is john ross and you know the traditional political philosophers you know they never just emphasize freedom is freedom and equality these were the two cardinal values and what's happened is that in the united states there has been a total imbalance because they've emphasized the freedom and forgotten the equality so as a result of that the united states is the only major developed country where the average income of the bottom 50 percent has gone down over the past 30 years as you know i document this in my book and provide the data so if and if you you know uh john rawls had a very interesting uh how do you say question to decide which society is most just he said if you were blind and you didn't know which society you're going to be born in and if you yeah but you might suddenly be born in the bottom 10 percent of united states or the bottom 10 percent of china which society would you choose now in theory you would choose america because it has all the political freedoms and opportunities but actually if you are born in the bottom 10 percent in america your chances of ending up in jail are the highest in the world because america has five percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the imprisonment and especially if you're born a poor american you will lead a very rough life your chances of dying in violence are very high so you actually you're being you're better off being born in the bottom 10 in china because the bottom 10 percent in china have now seen their greatest improvement in their lives over the past 40 years the greatest improvement in 40 years over 4 000 years of chinese history so this is this is the criteria you so what what happens in the discussions about human rights and freedom and everything is that you look at the top ten percent and of course the top ten percent in america actually the top one percent america are the best in the world no question whatsoever that's the american exceptionalism but if you look at the bottom 10 percent really you don't want to be born in the bottom 10 because in america life expectancy has gone down infant mortality has gone up and so life is terrible uh for the bottom uh 10 so that's why when you talk of human rights and if you talk to any of the political philosophers the great political philosophers what they would even adam smith uh even hume uh even locks they were all focused on social justice and and as you know i quote so many american writers uh who which have pointed out that as a result of this deteriorating condition to the bottom 50 percent there's a sea of despair among the white working classes in america so you ask yourself a simple question which society's happiest society is it american society or chinese society america a chinese society today is a much happier society than uh uh amer american society is so so this is what human rights at the end of the day and this is also what i quote in the book it's about improving human welfare and human well-being right there's no point having all the legal rights and your life gets worse and it's true in in china in china you don't have political freedoms of the kind that america has you know and certainly you go to jail if you criticize president xi jinping in america you don't go to jail if you criticize president donald trump but at the same time if you think in terms of personal freedoms and i remember when i first went to china in 1980 40 years ago you know that the chinese people couldn't choose you know where to live where to work uh what to study you know none of the what to wear they couldn't choose you know today you go to china the chinese people can choose what to wear where to live where to work what to study and guess what each year 130 million chinese leave china freely and 130 million chinese go back to china freely so they're enjoying your personal freedoms and not political freedoms and that's a choice that chinese people are making and i all i can say is if the chinese government is really ha dictatorial oppressive the chinese people will overthrow them this has been a 4 000 year rule in chinese history when the emperor is oppressive the people overthrow the emperor so this is the balance that each society has to maintain and i and i would say uh it's right for america to choose the system it has for america it's right for china to choose a system with us for china and why should we decide chinese people can decide what's good for them the american people decide what's good for them and we in singapore decide what's good for us and as you know for a long time the american media was so critical of singapore you know and and saying no we are an oppressive state and so on and so forth and ironically there are americans giving up their citizenship now to become singapore citizens this is amazing isn't it okay let me move on to our last question unfortunately we're running out of time professor you start the book with this fictional memo to zijing thing which is a fascinating memo could i ask you for for a similar memo and advice to the next u.s president uh and as we're recording this we don't know who that is going to be but i think by the time this interview goes out we may know who it is well uh if if the next president if president trump wins again he's not going to listen to any advice so there's no point giving advice to donald trump and if donald trump wins then he will create a lot of short-term pain for china but they'd be a long-term gain for china because one of the most senior influential western figures said to me in private said kishore if donald trump is re-elected the west just did you know so i mean he's clearly going to be a disaster but if joe biden's elected it provides a magnificent new opportunity for the united states of america and i'm hope therefore you can see i'm hoping that joe biden is elected because i want america to become strong again i don't want america to be weak i think a strong america is good for the world not a weak america and so but i would say that my first p my advice to him is to go back and study what the uh previous american strategic thinkers had given advice to america and the man who formulated america's strategy in the cold war uh was george cannon and he gave four pieces of advice and like those four pieces of advice are still valid today first piece of advice he says the outcome of the cold war the soviet union or the contest with china today will not be depend on the number of bullets and bombs you have it will depend on the spiritual vitality of our domestic society and right now as i document american society doesn't enjoy domestic vitality so why why is america spend 5.1 trillion dollars fighting unnecessary wars in the middle east when if you had taken the 5.1 trillion dollars and given it to the bottom 50 percent in america each citizen the bottom 50 will receive a check for 30 000 use the money to help your own people taking care of your people is more important than american primacy the second piece of advice he gave is that cultivate friends and allies so i would say don't do what trump did talk to your friends and listen to your friends because many of your friends are saying for now pause your job legal contest focus on finding kovit 19. the third piece of advice you gave is don't insult your adversary so don't insult soviet union don't insult china because you've got to work with them and the fourth piece of advice he gave he said be modest be like mahatma gandhi or rabindranath be modest so i think that's the advice i would give to the next president of the united states who when i hope you'll be joe biden thank you professor it's it's been a fascinating discussion we're coming to the end of our time and uh it's it's very apt that you end on guru dev's words with ravinatiko been mentioned uh it's it's been really uh very insightful very enriching for myself and for the audience i'm sure uh i would strongly recommend the book as a must read for all all those who want to give him china one china one yes and what the world has in store for us in the next few decades and maybe the century uh thank you so much for your time professor for participating festival namaskar thank you you ,False,True,False,False

after his talk I shall now hand over to dr. arm aigoo Stephen ladies and gentlemen welcome to this webinar the focus today will be on coping with stress in the current climate okay let me open the the slicer coping with stress in the current curve 819 Clement now let's begin with a concept of stress what is stress we we know stress is about tension tension emotional tension and stress can also produce physical issues as well so stress in fact it's a way it's a fact of life but don't make it known don't make it a way of life we are every day when we wake up when we go to work or when we go to school or when we work with when we are schooling we face tremendous pressure and stress so it's a fact of life in fact in this modern world with with modern technology we are always confronted with stressful situation whether you like it or not the Facebook social media YouTube even your whatsapp your email all constantly upon bothering you with messages and we have difficulty trying to cope with these various inputs into our mind so it is very hard to say forget about stress stress will never go away it's a pact of life but please don't make it a way of life the sooner we deal with stress the sooner we are able to cope the sooner we learn skills to handle stress the better we are so tonight I'm going to help you deal with stress using a method and that method our a review later so let's talk a bit about stresser there are four SS of stress the first is the stress sauce what is causing stress what is the event the issue or some time the person causing you stress and then the situation you are in at the moment we are in a covenant in solution the circuit breaker is definitely definitely a departure from the norm and and therefore is an unusual situation we are facing an unusual situation they're not used to the situation and we got to adjust adapt to the situation number three is support even though we are facing the stress off we have good support from family members from friends and producer religious from your temperature group or your mosque all these constitute support and finally the cell the cell is critical in handling stress the self what kind of a person are you your personality your approach your philosophy of life all these will determine whether you deal with the stressors well or not now let's dwell a bit on the self if you are a worrier if you are a perfectionist if you are afraid of failure you always want to do well and you always seek external validation you want people to praise you in well of you and you are afraid of making mistakes because you don't want make mistakes and be embarrassed by it and you are the type would don't learn well from mistakes if you are like there and you are a pessimist you are going to have problems facing the stress on the other hand if you are an optimist if you learn from your mistakes to pick things in your strife you will be able to handle stress very well so therefore this is and gentlemen when we talk about we are in a stressful situation before you conclude whether you can handle it or not please bring in the situation you are in talk about the support get your given or something lack of support and then you talk about yourself how are you dealing with the stress and that will give you a more comprehensive approach to stress instead of blaming stress over time some people are tough they handle stress very well some people are very resilient you cope with stress very well they don't succumbs to stress in Chinese we call them put our own before down they get up before down they get up in Japan there's a proverb you four or seven times but you get up eight times because in one of the four you have to try twice to get up so we need to build resilience we need to arm ourselves with good coping mechanisms and that would be the theme of today's talk unfortunately for those who cannot deal with stress he will have issues and what are the kind of issues you were head we can discuss you can ask me questions you can range from anxiety feeling panicky panic attacks it can be fear a lot of fear and phobia it can be you can be very you can become very obsessed obsessional disorder you can be depression you can have mood swings your mood is not stable and you can feel very insecure behave in a suspicious way suspicious about your surrounding suspicious about your friends and your colleagues and finally you can have what we call psychotic breakdown hear voices stop nonsense and really out of touch with reality there is the worst kind of response to stress which we try to avoid so we respond to stress in many ways the best way is to handle the stress we know the body-mind connection the body the body-mind connection we know the brain for example the brain we know the brain the brain is is physical we can see the brain right so the brain we know the mind is something extract the my is abstract so we know whatever happened to your brain or to your mind can affect your body it's like the body mind or body brain connection so the brain is actually the CEO of the whole body if you look after your brain well if you know how to handle your brain well that is to cope with stress well your body will not succumb you look at the diagram there the brain can affect the heart the brain can affect a thumb-up so in fact if you are anxious what happened is that gastric juice will be secreted in your stomach and you have abdominal distension your stomach can be distended so brain can affect a stammer and in brain if it's not well if you were under tremendous stress you can have stomach problem yeah you can have gastric reflux you can feel the warm eating no sure right if your stomach is under tremendous stress because you cannot handle the stress well sometimes people say the stomach is a second grain because our stomach health is so important and then the hot Hut is the sort of button right the brain also affect the heart if you're anxious your heart rate will go up right and then if you are in a panic state your hands will be trembling right and your likes to be shaking and you may have diarrhea you may have constipation likeness of chess difficulty breathing right butterflies in the tummy and and then what happened you feel dizzy you because of lack of blood flow to your brain to your brain you have dizzy spell giddiness even headache so the body is affected because the brain is under tremendous stress and this is the body-mind connection very important we talk a lot about mind-body connection when I talk about well-being when I talk about Hell I usually cover four areas and I use the four legs of the chair as an illustration as a metaphor first of all so sure the two front legs refer to social and physical social is how we interact with others how comfortable we are when we are when we are with other people so if you are not under stressed you are comfortable with yourself is very easy to socialize if you are at ease when you socialize you don't feel tense you don't feel tense and that is an illustration that you are helping wellness but there's only one aspect then there's physical wellness we talked about a brain mind connection physical wellness how fit you are how healthy you are and your overall appearance right there is physical health two people see a physical health your physique first that is they see how you interact with other people the thirdly is mental health emotional health and that is the concern of our about topic today concern this is what we will be discussing today mental health emotional well-being which is a third leg of of wellness and then lastly don't forget religious and spiritual health religious hell is self-explanatory how religious you are whether you are a Muslim a Hindu or a Christian and finally you have what we call spiritual health but those without a religion we talk about spiritual health and usually I would defy spiritual health is any thing where there is a hobby a philosophy or an approach to life that can live the spirit that s called spiritual health so if you have all four legs of a chair well develop you would have what we call wellness well-being you are healthy the World Health Organization defines health as not just the absence of physical symptoms device health as the ability to socialize physically fit emotionally sound and spiritually healthy so even the World Health Organization acknowledges hell is not just the absence of symptoms health is also about social mental spiritual as well as physical why do I emphasize on these four aspect because in Akko v19 situation if any of these four is a factor you cannot have wellness and it's important to identify which lick is affected and how you can go about restoring health now the covert lighting situation I reckon it to be like a loss I spoke about the over radio over PSB talk on Corbett 19 stress there is a kind of loss why why is it seen as loss because and no longer leaving a so-called normal life we are housed well housebound we are supposed to be at home because now he's lifted we're face going to face Stuart but earlier on for about two months movements were restricted we were unable to do a lot of things for those who are living in condo for example the gymnasium is closed the swimming pool is closed and you just couldn't swim or go to the gym and so there's some restriction of your usual exercise for example if you have been swimming regularly suddenly for two months just cannot swim and there's a kind of loss of one hobby loss of one activity and you cannot connect with friends because you're not a lot too so social activities can also be curtailed because you can talk to a friend virtually but it's a difference between seeing a friend in reality versus virtually so loss of freedom loss of social interaction loss of the usual activities you are doing you have been doing right so when when you face a loss situation you react to the loss so when you react to the loss you go through phases the first phase is what we call shock disbelief denying you how can this be I've never experienced this kind circuit-breaker lockdown situation home base learning oh so so so unlike going to school you you are learning from home using a computer so so shop disbelieve them I miss my friends I rather go to school and to study at home so can't believe that you can be staying at home and then phase two is your said you cannot do certain things you worry what's gonna happen is this going to go on forever or a few more months or what's going to happen to the school life work if you haven't been working for months you worrying whether you will be out of job when the circuit breaker is over so you worry and then disappointment with situations with policies disappointment why they didn't do this quick enough why did you didn't do that quick enough so you you get disappointment and then because of lockdown you are at home with fellow family members so for the first time a bit of uneasy feeling usually parents will be working leaving the children two or three children at home now five or six peopie at home so a bit of disappointment a bit of rough ages you're trying to adjust to one another gilt some element of view in reaction to the loss why didn't I why didn't I do enough for example especially if if you I have a friend who ended up with Kobe 19 positive had to be quarantine had to be admitted and and he was full of guilt he he he in the end he didn't know where he got it he narrowed down to two places and he was guilt ridden you know I shouldn't have gone to that place oh yeah I should have been more careful I should have worn a mask and not listen to authorities who say no need to wear a mask so this this kind of guilt and an anger as well anger why why why this can happen to me and actually he went through a rough patch his his illness was quite severe so there was a lot built-up anger in him love guilt and disappointment and then these are for people who are affected you remember only 20% considered serious requiring admission to hospital of the 25 with me many ICU care the majority 80% are MA and asymptomatic in some cases so my friend happened to be in that group which required hospitalization including going to ICU and including intubation and he was very very demoralized by the whole process so his reaction to loss would be greater than someone merely reacting to a mild illness like a mild infection for my friend his life was chaotic and messy and during stage three really got reorganizes this is a whole whole life when he was slowly recovering but during that period when he was in ICU it was chaotic and messy even for family members for his family members you just you just couldn't comprehend could understand by the trip to a supermarket and I ended up almost at the near-death experience finally for the rest of us were mala a symbol a cinematic and also be chaotic and Nessie does life in this kind of situation no longer routine or normal social distancing we have to observe you have to wear masks when we go out we wear masks when we go out we have to wear masks when we go out and then not more than five when we get the we go to restaurant not more than five a bit of getting used to not me there's not that kind of freedom anymore and finally Stage four when we come to terms Leslie accepting that this is going to be like that for a period of time before things go back to absolute normality so now is relative normality you can't be completely free but yet you're not completely at home you can still have some degree of freedom so we slowly will get used to it so to in some of this light it means is a reaction to loss we are reacting to loss okay now now I will share with you one technique of dealing with the Covenant in stressful situation and it's called mindfulness how to be mindful this is a situation we are in how do I create meaning out of this situation sometime they cost age five as creating meaning of this reaction to loss and slowly not only you succeed successfully overcome crisis you also add meaning to your life and help you to reflect and project forward so mindfulness is what I will be sharing now mindfulness is a real hot topic everybody is talking about it originally came from Buddhism Buddhism and now is a mainstream psychology basically is to use the mind mindfulness is about using the mind and my favorite guru in this field of mindfulness is John Kappa Z they I end on cotton sing John kabat-zinn has done a lot of work in this area for tea over years of work and his basic definition is mindfulness is about paying attention paying attention to what to the present moment here and now alright and so that you can be relaxed so that you can open your mind to new possibilities a new perspective without judgment without judgment and actually mindfulness is a way of freeing yourself that you pay attention to the present moment present moment and then you free your mind to think of possibilities is the thinking of the box so that in a non-judgmental way on judgmental way you enjoy the moment you learn from the moment and you free yourself from being trapped in the past or worry about the future that's the beauty of mindfulness because many a time when we are in a situation we think of the past and we worry about what would happen next and it prevents us from enjoying the moment I therefore define mindfulness as enjoying the present paying attention enjoying the present moment and opening up the mind the mind to mindfulness is opening up the mind to explore possibilities and new perspectives in order to free yourself so when you're open you're free when you close your tray so that's a beauty of mindfulness I have written a little booklet little booklet call do learn grow k do learn grow and is leaving mindfully Fivefinger mindfulness you've seen a Fivefinger with acronym FOC us focus if you want a soft copy of this book the email address is there on young one at gmail.com and I will send a copy to you okay so let me summarize the key points of five finger mindfulness for the remaining slides five finger mindfulness how you open up your five finger five finger mindfulness okay there you are danke boxing's definition paying attention to the prison non-judgmentally open new possibilities and free yourself that is the meaning of mindfulness and using this definition I felt it's very easy to remember yes by using the five fingers the five fingers step one in five finger mindfulness is coming now coming down right I told you right mindfulness the acronym is f OC us focus right focus f OC us so f OC us so C is here C stands for coming down by deep breathing okay if the longest finger and the most important step you come down by deep breathing in any stressful situation you are in remember to take a deep breath we all know but now we know the reason one you send oxygen to your book to your brain when you do deep breathing you're sending oxygen to your brain you do five times you are also buying time when you buy time you can reflect rather than react so allows you to reflect rather than react you do not act impulsively if you practice mindfulness so mindfulness begins with step one deep breathing and the step is you breathe in oxygen normal breathing is two second in my Funes breathing you add two more second you and you count three four let me illustrate three four so I'm breathing to toe for second then I push out my abdomen when I push out my abdomen and expanding middle abdomen for my lungs to expand downwards the lungs cannot expand forward because of the ribcage the lungs can only expand downwards right and he gives space for the downward expanding lungs I push my abdomen up I mean while I would do I breathe English I have to breathe out and when I breathe out at five six seven I mean let me illustrate that let me demonstrate when I bring in 3/4 I come silently 3/4 just to make sure I brief in deeper then when I breathe out I'm count 5 6 7 because I'm breathing out carbon dioxide and therefore I want to bring out more come on down excite like 8 1 loss again in his 3 form oh it's y67 in his 3 4 oh it's why 6 7 3 for by 6 7 3 for by 6 7 3 4 5 6 7 3 4 5 6 7 ladies and gentlemen all you have to do is breathe four or five times and what happened you would have five to thirty seconds of breath and that allows 30 second allow you to reflect rather than to react many a times we we act impulsively without reflection and will regret subsequently let's step one step two is open up your five finger open up your five finger open up a five finger and that's o F or C us all o is for opening up why open up my finger so that you have five ways of looking at the event five perspective if you think five is not enough another five not enough another five so in essence you have multiple fives multiple of fives to look at the problem to look at the situation but if your mind is not open it is closed either you have no idea what's happening or you have only one idea of what's happening but when you open your mind you have many ideas of what is happening therefore that is the concept of opening your mind and in I add it I would like to add a few more things when you open your mind when you open your five finger it also reminds you of the normal distribution curve this is called a normal distribution curve twenty percent a bright 50 percent are not so bright the middle 30 meters 60 percent are rich so this is the normal distribution curve and it makes us aware of individual differences some people are slow some people are too fast most of us are average some people eat a lot some people eat very little most of us eat appropriately so the Fivefinger is a very powerful concept to illustrate that we are all different point one point two it also illustrates we don't have to be perfect it is a symbol of imperfection law short fat in right evil creator wants us to have affection he would have given us five thumbs unfortunately he's not Fightin's a Fivefinger different thickness different shape right different lengths so that is the power of looking at a five finger it's about imperfection at the same time normal distribution curve so he gives us spective makes us see things in perspective that takes care of step two now step three step three is telling you don't just look at the negative don't just look at the negative many of my patients have anxiety disorders our warriors they worry a lot almost non-stop non-stop worrying in their very negative every time they see something inevitably king of the negative you know the clock is saying half empty or half full they will look at a half-empty instead of the glass being half full in mindfulness training don't ignore the positive so I used a little finger to represent negative I used none to represent positive so it's not just negative is positive and you cannot cut away the little finger right you see that okay I only want the positive we need to embrace yes negativity is part of positivity is within positivity from negativity I learned and I can be positive so we learn learn from our mistakes negative is as important as because it gives us he teaches us lessons so we don't just focus on it we also focus on positivity the positive to give it a balance and in step four of mindfulness back to the definition of Jon kabat-zinn we are urged to live in the present this middle finger represent present don't do just with the finger alone you must be balanced by the little finger and the thumb and it means what it means live in the prison here and now relax and joy the soy is called present a present is a gift I give you a birthday present birthday present so enjoy the present and yes we all have a past in my Funes training we talk about accepting the past be possible with no regrets when you cannot accept the past and when you have regrets it stay in your subconscious it stays in your memory stall and it will come and haunt you and we know and then especially when you see something that remind you of the past you hear something that remind you of the past then in mindfulness training enjoy the present come to terms of the past and we learn to plan for the future not worry about the future many people while here in the present the thing of the future and then when the thing of the future they start worrying so instead of it giving 100% to the prison they are trapped the energy goes to thinking about the past and part of the energy goes to worrying about the future so instead of leaving hundred percent in the present you're trapped in the past 10 20 % go to the past 10 20 % go to the future you can't enjoy the present the present is left with 60% 70% you can't wholeheartedly enjoy the present so in my Funes were saying enjoy the present yes we have past we contain it we come to terms with it yes we have future we plan for the future not worry about the future so these are live skills that we all talk about when we talk about mindfulness then this is a symbol for worrying goes on and on non no beginning nor end drains energy creates a lot of emotional tension as the emotional tension we have tension emotional tension so rumination is about excessive worrying and excessive worrying leads you nowhere in mindfulness training we talk about planning planning if this happened what will I do if that happened what will I do plan B Plan C plan D if plenty cannot work out and we talk about a concept called containing the problem if the problem cannot be solved immediately not all problem can be solved immediately all right we are fighting an election akavit 19 election there are a lot of issues to tread trash out we contain some of these issues we march on closure will be the night of 10 July when we know the results so between now and polling day we plan we do our best we contain we manage what we contain because we can't solve the problem now we only know on 10 of July but we can plan you can't contain plan options ABCD P and then we are ready when we plan carefully we will be caught off guard because we are planning properly and that applies to any event any event in your life put some thoughts to it work out the options work out the possible solutions possible plans containing either in the formula journal write it down or key into your handphone various option so in your mind you have various plans in your mind and when you have plans you don't worry you only worry when you don't have plans if you have good plans you live in the present happily you sleep happily cuz you're no worries all art runs form into planes all your worries are in the form of planning contained in ABCDE you can have all the way to Z 26 containers you're not worried but when you worry it goes on and on and on non-stop I famously call it E or E or E or non-stop you go find mommy you are non-stop and it will make you unable to sleep patients come to see me and said doctor unconsciously you talk to them for half an hour you realize they have been worrying about a lot of things there you are f OC u.s.a covered step 1 coming down see a cupboard step 2 open up your five finger a

ladies and gentlemen I have briefly talk a little about stress especially a reaction to loss cuvee 19 as a reaction to loss I have shared with you a Fivefinger mindfulness and I hope you have something home messages now I cast the mic over to Stephen Stephen over to you all right thank you Tom we receive many questions this evening some are similar and we rephrase them to accommodate as many as we can and some questions do not relate to this 15 topic and I'm really sorry that with the Skippy's questions and we have about 10 questions here so the first question is is our current public health care system equipped to help those who psychiatric health care needs I thought yes I think there is a structure in place they have counseling services for people who need counseling so that part I'm not too worried about you there's a hotline where you can call up and then the counselors who attend to your problems so that's not the issue accessibility I think should not be a problem it's just a phone call away and now with online video and zooming it is so possible to have counseling in a virtual way thank you next question Stephen okay what do you see the question is my mom is someone who is quite prone to anxiety I getting depressed how can the likelihood of getting depressed be reduce okay it's a very good question some people have a tendency to get anxious and depressed easily and one of the reason I alluded to in my slide presentation is that is the personality makeup people who tend to worry a lot people who are perfectionist people who cannot learn from mistakes and people who need a lot of encouragement validation from outside they tend to be prone to depression and anxiety so ask yourself is my mother what kind of person is my mother she an optimist is she a pessimist I see a warrior a warrior a warrior music can do with stress very well how resilient is my mother if you find it is personality issues then really sometimes it's very hard to help because they are prone to anxiety and depression so and personality is not easily changed after so many years of formation we are quite fixed in our manners and our behavior to change personality is not an easy thing but we can help her cope with the stress of living in a stressful Society we can help her we can encourage her help her perhaps have certain activities with her going out with her more often going for walks more often find out what she really likes if she likes to watch drama serial on television watch it with her so in a way keep her company make her realize that support is there remember s is support support from family members is there and then help her deal with a vulnerability a lot of people who are prone to anxiety and depression if you'll honorable so we really have to tell them don't worry I'm around don't worry things up things will be all right they need a lot of constant reassurance and it's partly because of their personality which is so difficult to change once you realize that you don't get upset you empathize with her you realize that you can't change your personality but you can make life tolerable for her thank you back to you Stephen all right we have a couple of questions more coming in and this question is correlated to the previous one now the question is on what's the difference between mindfulness forgetfulness and dementia very very powerful question first of all what's the difference between forgetfulness and dementia it's a method of de cría forgetfulness happens though all of us we become forgetful now and then especially when we are tired especially when we don't have enough sleep especially when we are preoccupied in our mind we tend to the moments of forgetfulness dementia is a different ballgame dementia is a clinical condition of inability to recall recent events and some of these inability to recall is an event can worsen and then you end up with dementia and this is a clinical condition so oh-h forgetfulness and OAH dementia are two different thing which forgetfulness can be considered normal OAH dementia is a clinical condition that needs treatment because the loss of memory sometimes can be irreversible so when we talk of dementia we talk about more moderate or severe dementia the severe one you have tremendous difficulty reversing the process but forgetfulness I'm not too worried now what about mindfulness mindfulness is actually helping to deal with forgetfulness helping to deal with dementia there's a recent article using mindfulness to prevent dementia from happening why because you're using the my all the time if you use the my over time you're actively engaging your mind if I actively engaging your mind you're less likely to get demented so my fullness is a way of preventing dementia if I may say so thank you I hope I can type answer the question Stephen back to you all right this question is is medication a good solution to cope with stress and how does one knows if one is medication and professional help again a very good question and I'd like to use the M in in chocolate I'm not advertising for M&A but M&M chocolate the first n is medication the second n is mindfulness and other methods therefore doesn't mean we have to take medicine in some more cases we do not need to take medicine you need to go to the second M which is mindfulness and other methods such as exercise hobbies social interaction religion or display a partner in helping you whether it's small or severe anxiety in severe cases you may need medication maybe for short period of time then when you are stabilized when you are stabilized then you can go on to talk about the second M other methods of dealing with your problems so it's an M & M approach plus M is medication second M is under methods which include counseling as well therefore don't rush to take medicine that's for sure assess the situation it is small can I use other methods to cope it is [Music] serious yes go and see a professional for help and then you assess you see whether your mom moderate or severe and we suggest medication for certain conditions which are not severe we don't need long-term medication you need long-term medication for conditions like schizophrenia it is a very serious mental disorder affecting the brain they have hallucination delusions and loss of touch with reality right yet give me requirements in your life sometimes bipolar disorder you may require medicine for life but form are inside people stress-related disorders medication may not be the first right this point should be other methods what do you Cybil alright mom Kovach 19 gives us a lot of stress especially financial stress CHT be in our state appreciate in value this at most rest to us and of course there's another advices what would you give to Singaporean for advice who fear the level comfort be disrupted if they before opposition and how to overcome this fear of unknown so that two parts one is financial stress there one is the stress of fear the unknown a financial stress well one of the issues we are talking about is retirement adequacy another issue we're talking about is in come get the income gap so we had us ourselves why is there a first the problem in the first place people are feeling the burden of living in Singapore is said to be the most expensive nation in the world in for a few consecutive years so why what is happening between wealth creation versus income distribution income creation and income distribution so the whole idea that you may be a wealthy nation but if that well is not properly distributed and equally distributed you still have a big chunk at the bottom who are not getting the benefits of economic growth so there's one whole topic which is not the topic I'm gonna go into today will cover why we work so hard we watch we watch so many hours yet we feel that retirement adequacy it is not there we feel that we don't seem to have enough OCBC did a survey before elect to the survey of a thousand Singaporean if alright but true to the idea saving can only last about six months so so it's a very worrisome topic and that means we go back to fundamentals of government governance fundamental of governance and then explore what was working in the past why is it not working now what went wrong with the system what can we do to correct the system my first impulse is the influx of foreign workers close to a million of them dampening income for Singaporeans because you heard video clip by Tommy : professor Tommy Co one MP told him one foreign worker was earning $800 a month because she was staying the hostel she could have fought to send her $800 back to his hometown but a Singaporean earning $800 for that method thousand plus northern she leaves in Singapore he's not living in a hostel and the cost of living for him is so high and definitely not enough so even even professor Tom Pico highlighted this problem because of the influx of foreign workers the whole atmosphere is dampening of wages at the bottom they're not forgetting the influx of foreign pm/et coming to Singapore to compete with our local p.m. ET and the net result is if employers can get a cheaper foreign pmdg why should he employ a local p.m. ET what do we get p.m. ET soir out of job he can sustain high cost of living and many end up in scrap drivers so that I'm just giving you the rough sketch of what what I feel at the problem we can go into detail but what is important is PSP has this policy paper PSP has this manifesto and we will address all these problems okay about income about employment about the influx of foreign workers and how is affecting our way of life away cost of living did exclaim the first five xscape of the first part the second part Stephen can you remind me of the second part second part would be power vice will give to Singaporeans who fear the level comfort be disrupted a table for opposition how to overcome this fear of unknown okay fear of the unknown for the PAP has been in power since 1959 61 years and there was a period from 68 to 80 100 percent of Parliament was occupied by the PAP hundred percent of for 13 years and when you have every member is a PAP member in Parliament can you imagine what would happen the consolidated power they would change laws to suit your needs even in the presence of workers parties 6 7 opposition MPs you they just bulldoze their way they changed the Lord it suddenly woke up and realized that we need a non Chinese president it just changed the law so 1461 years were so used to one-party system it's fine you know if they look after the people if they narrow the income gap if they don't pay themselves so much then fine singapore will continue to prosperous under the pap but not the last 10-15 years we can see the erosion of values you can see the erosion of trust you can see the erosion of brick suppose you can't run a country without values without principles without beliefs like PSP song says running Singapore is not running a company Singapore is more in a company we are nation of people nation of citizens we have feelings we want to identify with a nation we want to feel patriotic hey and patriotism is not just because you won't be a P in you a considered patriotic but autism is you love the nation you want to die for Singapore lets patriotism so we have been brainwashed indoctrinated that they had picked the best they are the best to govern Singapore and the net result is everybody Theory PAP is not empowered Singapore go down you know Singapore will not go down here we have the silver service we have the police we have the military who are independent neutral but because over the years the perception is that a line with a pap we are together with the PPO feel it so we are worried that you know if PP goes down this institution we also Fung will also fumble not even fumble they are very solid because institutions are very solid it will continue whoever takes over power so because we've been indoctrinated brainwashed obtain it without a pap we can't survive it's not true it's not true and because we because suddenly over power anyway right from 6-7 members hit 9 members all we are asking for is 1/3 1/3 of 93 seats give us 32 seats so that we can have a check and balance under PAP government right and then whenever they do things they would think twice they will reflect they will practice mindfulness little practice mindfulness mindful of their policies on Singaporeans so don't worry your you in fact if you have 1/3 walk from the alternative parties put a pee-pee on the toast Singapore will grow better greater and more dynamic Nations and it's not a one-size-fits-all every yes-men kind of mentality it is many people can contribute is diversity with unity now is only one when you one and there is PA B's boys so see when I hope I've answered the question yes definitely a lot of questions are pouring in and trying to consolidate them then this question is it can be difficult to get a job during kovat knotty situation how do we cope with and support a family we'll keep saying get a better job with higher pay people set high expectations how to adjust a sense of reality very very good question is about how we measure success we have been so used to measurement of success is what car you drive what jobs you hole where you stay what school you go to what feel are you in I think we have to move away from that model life is not about just economic success success can be defined in many many way music hot spots this if you are successful in this area you are also successful so when somebody say going look for a better job going look for a more a higher paying job the person the family member is using his or her gas stick on you assuming you're not interested in a high paying job because you don't like the job you prefer low paintings or buy up your you enjoy the kind of work then you are in a dilemma do I listen to my family members or do I just carry on earning not so much but in a passionate job I mean passionate about the job I mean so it's usually a cousin and to me it boils down to values how what kind of values we put on jobs values become very important so I I urge Singaporeans to have a wider definition of success success is not just about the job your whole income the money you make I think it's more than money okay in more than being an economic digit success is about happiness in your life doing things you want to do of course with sufficient income you just can't live without income right well I can empathize with this person family members pushing this person going get a better paying job going look for another job I think inevitably you feel the pressure and this is how people get stressed and some of these beyond your control is people putting pressure on you and if you can't change them you just have to change your reaction towards them tell yourself this is a group of Singaporeans who just measure success by the own narrow parochial way and so you don't measure that way you measure success in your own way yes I hope I have answered that question Stephen back to you very very good all right many people feel stress to find jobs as many pm/et jobs are taken away by the EP holders so how can we manage our stress that's why everybody say oh I don't get involved in politics politics doesn't affect me politics or politicians I think we have to get real politics affect us every area of our life this is a good question they are coming to rob my job I'm or this pm/et from oversea so it's real and you solve the problem is not piecemeal attempt to solve the problem you can solve problem by piecemeal it piecemeal is symptomatic treatment if I have coffee right you give me coffee mixture but my cough comes from pneumonia you don't take care my pneumoniae you don't give me antibiotic to hinder the infection giving me cough mixture my coffees temporarily suppressed but my pneumoniae is still there a pneumonia requires antibiotic certain issues in Singapore cannot be just a girl piecemeal because they look at it from a broader perspective and sometimes it requires fundamental change and the fundamental change come from being involved in the political process questioning them why are you in allowing so many foreign pm/et to come in what is the basis now what can we do about it what is a long-term plan five year ten year from now we are not just interested in long-term fire playing more buildings more infrastructure no it's not like that we also want to have long-term plan for our populations morale our people's esteem of people's trust and faith in the ruling party in the government night and he can only come about if you have a sizeable number of opposition members 32 of them putting pressure on them licking them whenever you want to make a policy to think twice I didn't he would say stop foreign pm/et let's do our own local pm/et let's build the entrepreneurial spirit and for perennial intrapreneur climate innovative cleaner let's have another steve job another bill gate in singapore not not just you know importing label from oversea hoping to grow an economy GDP at the expense of people's innovation people future people's esteem I think it's about time we pay attention to our people but just for the sake of the GDP cheap labor foreign labor it's about time to stop now having said that as I said we need a comprehensive approach to the topic not symptomatic treatment what do you Stephen all right thank you a lot of people are pretty confused know the difference between P men overseas P met EP holders and foreign workers we were past probably or what pass so that's a very interesting question here I surround for a sympathetic the works the beeper from overseas with the what pass will help us in our daily or fast things you don't you do the question is for foreign workers we've passed probably overpass how do we take care of that mental health in depth to agents what long hours do things that we locust want to do is staying crime conditions so how do we take care of that mental health Steven that's a very very important point difference between the Pass Holder many of them hit $900 a month and as you correctly say the older agents money this is and we had but closely cost a million of them and then you have the EP holders they're a different ballgame the EP holders are akin to our what we call our pm/et in fact if you go to the mo-om website they use income level if you earning more than three thousand nine a month 2008 or 2009 you are classified as under EP right any B's 2004 is another category named the top category of your WP yeah your work permit holder and they form the buck close to a million all right now they are mental health I think we all know the Kovac 19 it's a wake-up call picking up the authorities about the plight of these group of people everybody now no 13 to 15 to 20 back in one one room and dom me three boss is just interested in collecting rent buy a mini-mall silly is given there was supposed to be a Commissioner Optometry the former M om mr. manpower one gene I was actually he actually proposed a paper which was tabled in 201 five and there was supposed to be Commissioner Demetri his job is to look at all the content on the trees in Singapore I think I'm a cruise 240 of them 40 dominant tree and maintain standard and make sure that and he put hygiene adequate standards are maintained but apparently I I read that many of these dormant refill certain standards they were not well maintained and commit nineteen expose more such cases so I hope I hope is the wake-up call I hope they realized don't look down on them don't ignore them they are very important they help to build Singapore and it's not fair they are left alone to suffer so that that takes care of the physical part the physical health their physical hygiene yeah the place where they live in I think we need to pay attention and of course their mental health as well how do we do it we need to come up with a comprehensive plan how do her counselors who speak a language how to have counselors who go down to a particular area so their dormitory is near the area can come in sick sick help really this is an example of post Kovac 19 plane for a permit holders because the sticker total relook at them and at this juncture I would like to highlight patient 42 she's a permit holder from Bangladesh he went to Mustafa he had symptoms he went to polyclinic this Swatt from him she was allowed to go back to his dormitory he was finally admitted only around early February sixth of February so in the few days by going back to the dormitory he would have infected some of the his fellow workers and what mo ND was to clean up the place cleaning the tour cleaning would do them good a job unfortunately they didn't go far enough to test the people then Gordon of the group so for one man nothing was done whole man until early much then the authorities woke up to realize it this is a hot potato there was a period of few days when positive cases exceeded a thousand a day and lo and behold for a over thousand people per capita where the highest in the world of course we probably say is no mortality less than 30 dead it is but 25 26 days that's that's fine but the foreign Demitri issue is a real big headache right contrast this with patient 31 in South Korea from a church the moment she was identified the two hundred thousand church members were screen and were cordoned off as a potential cluster in the end my happen South Korea did very well Nadine have a national lock down maybe in certain cities but not a national law okay so what's my point my point is that Kovac 19 is really a wake up call that we really have to look up to the wp if we really want to get them in to work in Singapore right fundamentally we got to take a real look how do we enter these people we always say all Singaporean don't be construction workers Kapoor in the one to be proud one to be a con technician the one to do the job how do you expect Singaporean to work in those lines when you pay a foreign worker $800 $700 he can't so we couldn't really read look how do we really pay these low paying workers a living which sufficient for them to live healthy proper life and how do we make it in such a way that we attract people to join their ranks even I know in Australia in developed country a plumber earns quite a fair bit the electrician earns quite a fair bit in fact almost on car with a technician or even a professional so you because it's they're proud to be in that tree and pride we pride comes esteemed with a stink on mental health it is what is the direction that we must eat towards not just relying on foreign workers cheap foreign worker to build mega infrastructure to grow the GDP and expense of the happiness of the people in the cost of living of the people so what's my final point yes let's do something for the wp economic growth is important but we must look into the quality of life for Singaporeans let you use even very interesting Reef lies now we have some bit of difference the question from a student we have a very stressful education system with Kobe 19 the stress is even more what can be done to reduce the stress amount of students his ax is again it's again back to the question of definition of success how do we define success and if we define success in a very narrow way academic achievement equals success we are going to have stress every parent would say you better study hard you better go and do jobs from the mainstream doctors lawyers accountant respectable jobs that would be the pressure on you let's say you want to be a musician you want to be an artist you want to go you know play professional football your parents would discourage you they say no no no study first get a physics degree get a max degree first then you can be a musician and you can be a at least nothing wrong there but a lot of your passion will be driven out of you introduce academic subjects of course we are trying to make things better now streaming we know streaming was bad now they woke up they have subject based learning no subject based bending not subject based bending where you are you are your subject is classified G 1 G 2 G 3 if you are very clever you take mathematics at g3 level you're not so clever you think mathematic a g2 level even a week unless you take it a g1 level that's very good so they don't make you normal expressed normal the normal technical normal Academy no no more by the year 2000 there will be a national exam and it's going to be subject based bending which I welcome it I think it's very good but again so long we've been saying that streaming is good bad for mental health imagine at each of 12 when you go to check one at 13 you're tall you're good you're expressed you're no good you're normal which service a euphemism the normal is abnormal the Express is normal right and then what happened you are labeled you know I'm normal technical I'm normal Academy if your esteem if your if you are very sensitive person who worries a lot what people think of you you're going to end up with low esteem you can end up with a lot insecurities of course like I say about a Fivefinger there will be one group they don't care how you label them they will continue to prosper and flourish you'll be a group highly sensitive you label then it's normal Academy the whole life can be read and affected of course once in a while you say oh this person normal academy now he's a professor the other outliers once in a blue moon you have an outlier but you don't get our lies all the time right so I'm very glad streaming is a thing of the past although he has done so much he has done damage I would say how much he has done damage to many esteem many egos many emotional lives this is a thing of the past now now they are going to subject base bending which is very good so you can if you are good in nets then you take a tea tree you are going Chinese you take a g3 level that's very healthy click good good approach but because we are asking ourselves how are we grading our people and slotting them into categories many people say do away with premise six examination PSLE a 12 year exam is so important but now because of subject based bending maybe even though you don't do well for 26 you can still g1 inmates g2 in English g3 in literature another kind of approach rather than you say your normal your normal Academy or you are expressed we are labeling people too early too fast and that may be a source of stress right so first of all how we define success secondly how we label our pupils we're moving away from that no more band are no more streaming a lot to do it bending and please attention to those who are not academically inclined not everybody is academically inclined pay attention to them I am a firm believer that PSLE should not be just max English science and Chinese what what about those who are good in US sports music right you are an official in the PSLE syllabus your subjects are not there then your four student do face for subject because they argue one is those are PC you need to have basic fair enough but let's long ignore people who are not good in the academic area okay enough it's given back to you all right that's a question for people who are in distress and angry any useful methods to cook especially drink of it 19 situation so I think this one can be this recommended or do the fighting so again watch this video I don't wanna Facebook YouTube you can get it from ciabatta buda onion bang calm all right so you gain some in a very useful information from regarded a five fingers max wellness approach and the next question is i tend to forget things easily I'm in my 70s could this be dementia I thank you very much for the question earlier on I say forgetfulness is normal we all forget and I say when you are tired when you can't sleep well when you are ageing forgetfulness is the norm but he men she is a separate thing so very simple can you draw the face of a crop properly 12 6 3 9 and in 1 2 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 you can draw and space it up properly and you can remember what breakfast you took this morning you are not going to be demented you are unlikely to have dementia but you can't draw a crop properly you don't know where to put the sixth way to put an eye and where to put a tree then you have to see a doctor for professional help or you cannot remember the breakfast you took this morning because dementia is about memory loss of short-term memory right people what he meant that remember things that happened long time ago and yeah there are no problem with all memory they have problem with new member I always say how to tell whether a person has early moderate or severe dementia but early dementia when you show them the watch when you show them the watch you show them the watch they will be a bit slow but I tell you this is watch a few seconds for moderate dementia you show them the watch they look at it you can tell is a watch but you will see is for telling time time which is correct but they can name the item for the severely demented you show them a watch instead and they cannot tell you with this for telling time or where there is a wash so if you are 70 years old if you can name a watch quickly you are unlikely to be demented the same fall if somebody shows you a pen if somebody shows you a pen right if you have very very led measure your answer will not be prompt you would say after a while pain pain I think is a pain let's leave for normal people they will love it you why are you showing me such easy thing okay you show me such easy thing but but early dementia they would take a while before they named pain normal people who serve is a pain how are you show me such a simple thing for moderate dementia they will take a while it's more writing right you can't name it but I know it's for writing but severe dementia you show them they can name it and they don't know it's for writing so this is this is from years of clinical experience if I have to test somebody for dementia quickly I will use it it's some simple question I give them three items remember ball car and Men then five minutes later I asked him what good items I asked you to name they cannot they repeat after me boy calm men then five minutes later today go on item after a long war one night then correct and they can remember the kind of men their family members who come with them or more coming very fast because they are not demented they don't have problem so these are various way of telling this 70 year old questioner whether he's got dementia and hippies forgetfulness all of us forget from time to time back to you Steven oh it's very good dr. Ahn's repre fashion I'm sure benefit from this mental health is always thought the biggest problem alright now this question is caregiver caregiver stress is a real issue at present there's two funding or subsidy for counseling for caregivers from Bono what measures can be proposed for caregiver support as a subsidized service in Singapore so this one a question that I asked I impromptu tell viewers they there is caregivers alliance caregivers align they run courses for caregivers how to care for your demented patient demented relatives you're mentally ill relatives especially those with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder there are more chronic long-term conditions unlike the stress we talked about to be acute stress reaction is recoverable but various schizophrenia and bipolar they tend to be long term illnesses and a caregiver their caregiver stress and caregiver burnout today I got a patient who didn't see me for four years today appear in my clinic euphoric elated singing away you know singing away dancing and singing and claiming that he's got super power we can change the world he can cure kovat 19 he's going to found the VEX find a vaccine very soon discover the vaccine so he was very high elated this example of bipolar when well treated well control they have no problem they can function they can work but covet 19 can work can be in office precipitated a problem a debt one requires long-term care the caregiver in this case is the wife and you can see the white crying away helpless hopeless don't know what to do the Sun came along the Sun say what's wrong with my father he was never like that because the Sun was very young when the father was not well for four years the father was well no problem and no suffered a relapse so caregiver stress is very real if you look after somebody with dementia I guarantee you you would feel the stress because you're dealing with somebody who who doesn't know what is happening who doesn't reciprocate who doesn't listen to you who's not logical anymore and he's very frustrating it's a one-way direction you know you give and give and give and give but there's no no taking back and this is your mother your father you cannot you cannot say I don't know take care you've got values the value is filial piety parents they are my parents they look after me I got to look after them now but there's a limit this there's a limit so caregiver stress is very very rare therefore one day one retired doctor came to me and say doctor and the husband is also doctor very renowned doctor I say how is your husband my husband is in a nursing home suffering from dementia oh I say Wow happen and I don't see I see how often you see a husband maybe once a year I don't I don't want to go there every month I know he's in good hand the sink a few thousand dollar-a-month I can't bear to see him because every time I see him is like attending a funeral because she can't recognize me he doesn't know who I am and stop being food and see your loved one going down to you he can't even recognize you and what happened is that attending a funeral not see him regularly I see him once someone good I know and I'm not heartless dr. on I know she's in good hands he paints my heart Irie man I will remember this story for the rest of my life you don't see a loved one because it's like attending a funeral because he's demented he doesn't know you he doesn't know you come right and rather see him every month or seeing every week you see him once a year because you know he's under good care and its caregivers knowing that it's very stressful a painful goodbye avoidance by avoiding going to see the husband there's nothing wrong it's just her way of coping but many don't have the fortune of putting your loved one in a nursing home being a few thousand dollars for them to have good care put a patient there boot camp so you end up caring for the patient and it's very stressful but we rest assured there's dementia association there is a Singapore Association of mental health there's caregivers a lion I think enough people around who are willing to help question is who do you go to their website link up with someone they have causes we conduct courses for caregivers but now as well subsidy from the government for caregivers who attend courses I think we can think about it work on it and come up with a solution I hope I answer your question it's very difficult to be a caregiver but you're doing it our love our compassion okay and you'll be highly regarded by people who know you look after your loved ones well thank you Steven back to you previous question okay with our difference whether process having really measure or faking it asama seen as attention seekers is such a person suffering from personality disorders rather than dementia okay very good before I answer that question I wanna tell you the different between it's not seeking it's got pseudo dementia pseudo he mentions not faking dementia pseudo new measure is a depressed elderly depressed elderly who because of the depression cannot remember things forget food so when you treat the depression the dementia will go and discuss you know dementia if you understand this concept is a depression damning and demented so treat a depression the dementia will go away so disgusted or dementia unlike really mnsure where you really have a demented patient not depressed but clearly demented there's not no depression for you to trip it's just you have to treat a depression one 93 year old lady came with two daughters to see me a few weeks ago the first thing she did when she came to the clinic is he showing my ass her gay wash I it's okay worship just give me an injection and make me die I asked her to daughter's house of mother's memory oh very good very good memory so 93 doesn't mean you're demented 93 means no dementia but very depressed so depressed until she doesn't want to live she just want to die that's an example of sudo he mentioned you to depression or just depression and forgetfulness so you treat the depression the suicidal thoughtful go away so I gave her antidepressant she took for a few weeks and a few weeks later I say how how do you still want to die no no Priscilla what soon chun-tae awesome mom so that's when the depression is lifted don't ever think that a 93 year old lady cannot have depression don't ever think that because they live until 93 they are very wise wise / lady therefore no depression I think there's a Miss there is a wrong thinking this lady not demented in 93 and again another means just because they're 93 you must be demented no 93 doesn't mean you need to be demented recover after a costly antidepressant so there is sudo dementia of a depressed patient trigger depression pseudo dementia will go away now is faking dementia for attention-seeking that is a different ballgame and a questioner I suspect is a psychologist she already answered the question could it be personality problem of this person who fake dementia so it is her personality power attention seeking people were very dependent on others Pannonia eighty it can be independent some of the time but most of the time they want people to take care of them say nice things about them love them siam them so when attention is not given then you come up with problem i have pain here i I cannot eat well yeah I cannot sleep well yeah iiiii yeah so attention will be given the depth and some of the symptoms cannot be proven if I tell you I have Haiti you can't see my ad if I tell you I fever you can measure my temperature but you can hear mic off you can see my tremors but if I tell you I hate it you can see my hippie if I tell you a chest pain you can see my chest pain so these are example of attention-seeking behavior and fake memory problem I cannot remember this morning what do you eat no I cannot remember what did you eat last night I cannot remember because they want you to pay attention to them so how do we know we have to see a professional to make sure that we are not ignoring an underlying depression that caused the pseudo dementia we are not ignoring personality problem and thirdly make sure it is not a real dementia don't just blame the personality I think it's a personality I think it's the personality actually you are missing a dementia whatever it is the three history possibility must be ruled out by a professional I hope I've answered the question Stephen very good last two questions for the evening now they a lot of fake news during kovat 19 if you stress about this fake news so how do we fight stress due to all this or fake news that spreading around very good question the first thing I do for myself is if I can't hinder I don't see and I tell myself if I don't see do I lose anything if I don't lose anything so be it and it was important enough people will call me people who email me people who make attempts to reach out to me if you think this is affecting doctor unless like dr. unknown so you get real news from real friends if you cannot handle fake news you can avoid looking at it for one whole day you won't affect you but you if you can avoid you if you gotta type them nicely if it means they'll learn to contain contain them factor contain you need a container container contain fake news this is a virtual container I'm showing the physical one try to learn to contain fake news put it aside I told you in mindfulness training in order not to worry we have options where container contain the problem if you cannot prove the problem so sometimes when you read something you're not sure whether it is fake or not put in a container put it aside in a virtual mine virtual container in your mind then as things unfold you would then realize whether it's fake or not fake good when you first see you do not know you suspect is fake it could be real so you put in a container container fake news and it is proven that it's not faith and if it's proven it's fake you will affect you and make sure it close properly make sure you close the container properly right and put it aside put a container side okay today you go on with your life to handle other things in your life you cannot allow a fake news to dwell in your mind remember effect your present in mindfulness the present is very important you don't want to worry about if this news fake is this news not free then you're worrying about the future so contain fake news put it aside sometime you can write it down you suspect this is great news put it one side write it down then as things unfold whether you speak or not you won't know you can handle don't worry if it's important enough people will inform you keep you informed this is my approach to fake news because it's too much we have a simple brainer but we are bombarded all the time in my introduction I say we're all stress is a fact of life but don't make it a way of life I'm giving this webinar conducting is what me no no my email is coming in all your coming in but I have contained I put one side I give you a hundred percent attention because I want to make you learn from this by Bainer so I give you a hundred percent if I keep worrying about the email if I keep worrying about what it's gonna happen later okay by thinking about my dinner which I haven't taken there I won't give you 100 percent that's the meaning of mindfulness so fake news practice mindfulness continue if you can hinder thank you very much Stephen or back to you all right so now we have the last question for the evening which is interesting question now going phase two of the so-called circuit break that for circuit breaker and do you think the current voters who are sitting on the fence feel stressed to make a correct choice of candidate for any election during this curve 819 situation Wow interesting so the question is do people under stress vote opposition for the ruling party we will know on 10 July evening of 10 July we all know and we all that's why we are we are going all out our ground campaign our electronic campaign we're going all out we cannot assume that the traditional way of gaining votes would work it would be the door-to-door walkabout even your walkabout is Katella you have to wear masks you have to practice social distance and not more than five campaigners and at one stretch as I said we are all going in with our it one hand me higher back and it's not going to be easy but we must try for the sake of our children and grandchildren one dude in Parliament we have a lot of ideas we all know contribute when I mean each nation and inclusive nation not an exclusive one not den versus us is all of us together as part of a nation contributing ideas not them against us right or us against them so back to the question how do we persuade this middle ground people and the swing voters commit 19 would be a test Baylor a kind of experiment for sociologists and political scientists whether under stress how do people behave the traditional view is that they look for security under the incumbent it feels safe with the incumbent because the income got 61 years track record opposition no track record but we are not asking to govern the nation we are asking to have 32 seats 1/3 majority and truly if the fence sitters can think we are not forming the government give it to them maybe they have brighter idea in coping with the Kovach 19 crisis and maybe with 32 in Parliament the incumbent would be very careful when they imposed rulings or come up with laws or in her measure as many introduced measures he would think of the 32 in Parliament every time they make an announcement at Inga in Parliament they're gonna face 32 alternative parties and P who would question them put them on their toes in my press conference I say you look at New Zealand you look at Taiwan you look at South Korea you have very strong opposition so the ruling party got to think twice before they do anything they have to think of how to answer the alternative parties in Parliament PAP government is always very proud to say we are unique in doing things we are uniquely Singapore we have Co e where e RP with n c and p with an MP yuning a Singapore only Singapore has got GRC o so GRC every waste s MC in Singapore GRC at one stage was a mega GRC six-member GRC now they wake up and say what you need such a big GLC bringing minority into Parliament a three-member GRC you can bring one minority in so it's a lot of illogical logic or logical logical logical a logic or illogical logic we which is very frustrating in bed for mental health is very bad for mental heaven there is no clarity of values no clarity of values suddenly you wake up oh we need Indian we need a non Chinese Pacific at the same time we'd only earn on Chinese Prime Minister we're not ready for the non Chinese Prime Minister so people are very confused no clear values no clear principles so swing voters please wake up give us a chance to tell you that don't worry Singapore will always be dead the civil service will be dead police will be there the military will be there PAP has fewer seats that's all instead of 90 percent maybe now they have 66 percent of seats and it won't come burn maybe they work harder maybe next round they will shine even better so convene 19 make people compare the PAP government with other government and see how the performances are the government of course you cannot include always because the rest is a different ballgame but talking about a tion we compare a person deathless oranges and oranges even that none quite they hindered putting quite well a very simple example transparency is a value a transparency you tell us today we have 235 cases among de foreign workers but you never tell us how many you tested so the 238 could be out of 1000 tested it is a very high number but if it's out of 10,000 tested then is a very small number so it's not about absolutely no it is about percentage dr. Fawzi advising President Donald Trump said it very clear it's not an excellent figure we are looking for is the percentage that we are worried about how many you test and how many are found to be positive there is the percentage we are to be worried about not absolute absolute tells me nothing and today we had five community cases so it's not zero it's not zero so don't ever think that we're safe to have election know what to do you want to they are very in hurry to get a Mende in a hurry to get an indeed so the swing voters you ask yourself are they interested in your life or your health or their own fresh Mende he see when he back to you write the rest of this evening session ladies and gentlemen we have answered most of the relevant questions thanks everybody who contribute the very good questions and thanks to dr. armful give me such good answers we have a wonderful session this evening is recorded in life at Facebook the content isn't so interesting a book can be written for me actually I think considered writing a book subscribe to our social media platform true chapada good calm together leaders news from him let's look for to a great weekend ahead see you next time and Cheers ",True,True,False,False

The isolation necessary during the Coronavirus epidemic brings with it a baggage of anxiety and fear which amplifies the problems of those already dealing with this mental health issue - and all those food and workout videos online aren’t helping. We asked Nayanika Kapoor, a fashion stylist and an eating disorder survivor and Aliya Singh, a counselling psychologist about the steps those affected by eating disorders and their families can take to keep their mental health recovery on track.

#mindfulness #brahmcentre #singaporemindfulnessconference #globalpandemic #anxiety #mentalhealth #emotionalhealth #healthtalk #smc2020 #askadoctor #covid19 #depression #newnorm #virtualconference #freewebinar",thank you everyone for tuning in uh today on this sunday afternoon um allow me to share screen um so that i'm able to show you my slide okay so um i'll be taking you through um the body of work uh that has been done exploring uh the various themes of mental health in the era of covet 19 and i think as as angie has mentioned um kovitt 19 is really an unprecedented crisis a year ago even seven eight months ago we would never have foreseen ourselves in the situation in which we now are uh but well here we are we are now about seven months in and um humanity as a whole is facing many challenges uh and this is uh these challenges are not just confined to the virus itself but also the various ways in which the virus is changing our lives i mean the very fact that we're having this uh conversation over this platform i think uh says it all about how these how these viruses changed our lives um so the facets of today's talk are basically threefold first of all i'll be looking at the effect of illness contagion illness spread on the broader public's mental health so i've termed this the worried well number two the effect of quarantine on mental health and number three it would be the mental health in the post kobe 19 world um before i go on let me just qualify that a lot of the data i've brought together is global uh doesn't really specifically pertain to singapore i think so far in singapore we've done a very good job in terms of being able to control our community spread and with the various stimulus packages and so on they have been released somewhat being able to cushion the economic impact of the virus so far but we are highly plugged into the rest of the world and we see unchecked viral spread in so many countries you know in india brazil the us uh that it does make one wonder whether these issues might someday come to affect us a little bit more it's good to talk about it now hence the talk today so part one would be the effects of illness contagion and the public's mental health so i termed this the worried well people who do not yet have the virus but are naturally worried by what it means so this is from a paper that's published in the asian journal of psychiatry earlier this year it basically theorizes that for every single spike of cobit 19 cases and it's likely that we will have multiple spikes of covet 19 cases around the world uh that you have two uh peaks of mental health problems the first peak happens soon after the virus makes its presence felt and cases rise and so there's understandably a lot of fear a lot of anxiety people that will be struggling to adjust to the new normal we call this the adjustment disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders as well but then humanity where a resilient bunch and so eventually societal resilience will kick in and people will adjust to the new normal but then unfortunately we know that the virus does lead to a loss of life but not only that loss of jobs and various other things and so eventually over time people may then develop a second peak of mental health problems and this would be more related to loss and grief so it's nothing but grief post-traumatic stress disorder depression and suicide and i think one of the concerns that was articulated in this paper was that the number of cases of people who may suffer from mental health problems may be far in excess of the number of actual cobit 19 cases in a population and this may go beyond what a mental healthcare system is able to manage so covet 19 and distress so i think as we have mentioned it is an unexpected unprecedented unknown we still don't know all that much about the virus there is a lot of uncertainty still about the rate and mode of transmission and there's unparalleled spread no definitive treatment at this point and there is a greater psychological fear than during sars i mean a substantial available impact about more than half of respondents from a study in china actually reported moderate to severe psychological impact and the fear of phobic 19 increases levels of stress depression and anxiety and in turn reduces the level of life satisfaction so why might this be happening part of it of course is related to the virus and the nature of the virus and its spread but also the fact that today we live in a very polarized world if not singapore at least in the rest of the world you look at the u.s for example and so media coverage may actually amplify anxiety there may be a lot of distrust towards governments and healthcare authorities to control the spread i mean if you watch the u.s news you would see that this is very much in play uh there may be a lot of stigma and blame towards individuals who are deemed to be spreading the disease and also a concept which i shall go on to explain called the behavioral immune system which i'm going to talk about a little bit because i feel it explains a lot of things that we are seeing today so the behavioral immune system we know that we all have an immune system so this is what kind of kicks in if we get infected by any bug a body mouse and immune response but it isn't just the cells in our body that produce this response it's also something that's seen in our behavior and what this immune system is meant to do is it's meant to protect us against potentially getting infected and so to reduce the work that our uh body's immune system then has to do so and the degree to which we activate this immune system this behavioral immune system really depends on how vulnerable we feel to the disease um coming back to the to a point that we see across the world you might see a lot of young people congregating at bars and going to malls and queuing up at you know restaurants you don't necessarily see people who are more elderly doing that and that might be because the elderly might perceive themselves to be more vulnerable to the disease and they take steps to protect themselves far more than younger people who view themselves as being innately immune might you know might might adopt these steps so what are the benefits well first of all it creates vigilance of one's external environment and it creates it values conformity and obedience over eccentricity and rebellion so these days if let's say there is a lockdown or you know there are restrictions social distancing and so on we tend to follow because we are worried about the virus and sickness behavior in itself when someone is sick they don't go out as much generally they adopt social withdrawal and a loss of energy may actually help to limit the spread of the disease and that's a behavior in itself too and so and also distancing behaviors from those are potentially unwell may reduce the probability of catching the infection and this actually lessens the work that needs to be done by the cylinder immune system however uh there are a number of downsides so first of all of course is the fact that avoidant behaviors may actually come at the expense of interpersonal relationships and daily activities we might go out less when i talk to people less we might not meet our colleagues or our friends as much and we get more distant it is stressful so that taxes our metabolic system we're always in a state of stress uh and and chronic anxiety and stress can lead to problems we might stigmatize certain communities we know of reports for example in the uk of asians being attacked and um the greater disgust greater activation of aversive cognitions with the working memory and greater motivation for behavioral avoidance so basically we view the world then as a more threatening place we start to adopt behaviors to keep ourselves safe it might help to keep ourselves safe but it's not necessarily something that's good for the long term or in excess so what are the groups that report higher distress levels and this is from a collection of papers from around the world so uh female gender it's been shown in a number of papers to actually uh be a group that is associated with higher distress levels um respondents age 18 to 30 and above 60. so above 60 i think it's you know perhaps because they perceive themselves as being more vulnerable to their disease and for respondents age 18 to 30 remember these are young people their studies may have been disrupted entry into the workforce they have been disrupted they're just about earning their first paycheck they'll be struggling to support themselves so this is a very stressful time for them students and migrant workers not surprising that they would be under a fair bit of stress there is higher distress in places with inadequate public health resources and limited containment measures if the virus is spreading everywhere and there isn't a hospital that you can go to then you are going to be very distressed by the fact the virus is there those with poorer self-rated health status and with medical problems will have higher distress because they'll perceive themselves to be more vulnerable and having an acquaintance a family member who is infected especially a family members infected with kobit 19 can be stressful as well you might worry that you might catch the infection there's caregiving responsibilities that you one might have to take up and of course there's that worry what might happen to my family member so part two uh focuses on the effect of quarantine on mental health i'd first of all like to qualify that it's very hard to exactly differentiate which aspects of mental health distress are due to the virus and which aspects are due exactly to quarantine because the two are so closely interlinked but nonetheless i've tried to look through the data to to kind of provide an overview on it so the effect of quarantine so i mean it's needless to say i think we're all aware now that the distress from pandemics not only stems from the fear of the disease but also from the effects of quarantine quarantine measures may worsen anxiety it can cause boredom anger and loneliness we might feel cut off from our social contacts and this can be stressful when you're at home all day perhaps not able to further one studies or do the things that one might normally do it might affect your self-esteem boredom and stress might affect one's ability to exercise self-control uh it affects sleep quality if you're in the house all day and it increases the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder there was an article in the guardian newspaper in the uk that actually said that one-fifth of vulnerable adults in the uk actually considered self-harm during their coronavirus lockdown distress related to quarantine is associated with inadequate information inadequate supplies and a longer duration of quarantine i think during our circuit breaker period you may have heard of minister lawrence wong talking about why it was important to time the onset of the circuit breaker properly and not have it for too long because you're worried about population fatigue and that's a very real thing and the longer longer you keep a population locked down that can have a lot of problems in and of itself quarantine and national lockdowns actually have a profound economic impact as well and this may actually cause a rise in unemployment and financial stress which in turn may increase the risk of suicide so with that i've actually kind of collated the literature to talk about some of the pathways from quarantine to suicide now i must emphasize that not everyone who is quarantined uh is at risk of suicide and it certainly is not something that happens you know it's not an inevitable progression but it is a concern and i think we need to bear it in mind because it's best to prepare for a problem rather than react to it so um first of all it's important to remember that there are certain groups that are at higher risk of you know suicide mental health distress and suicide when under quality so they're basically people who endorse being lonely those are living alone those are single and certain behaviors that might increase one's distress so more time exposed to news and kobit 19. if one has fewer positive emotions you have less perceived self-efficacy so you don't feel you're capable of doing things and you feel almost you know vulnerable to this to the quarantine uh lower quality of sleep and negative self-perceptions upon aging so these are some of the risk factors and some of the pathways so basically quarantine is a very isolating experience and this can result in a sense of thwarted belongingness so this is from the interpersonal theory of suicide so the person may feel separated from the group to which they normally belong so for example if they feel they belong to a certain church congregation for example or a certain group of friends now they're not meeting them anymore so they lose this sense of belongingness there's also that loss of social interaction and with that there is a sense of diminished mental health well-being there's also the very real problem of poorer sleep abuse is a problem i think the world health organization issued a an advisory about the fact that global rates of domestic abuse were going up during the period of quarantine so this is a very real concern victims of abuse are likely to manifest diminished mental health well-being there also may be a feeling of being trapped and the economic consequences which will be stressful so all of these things together may potentially increase the risk of suicide and the reason i'm bringing this up is because proactive interventions are needed to assist those under quarantine so things to uh to counteract the effects of social isolation to shelter those who are at risk of abuse to um you know to basically reduce the economic consequences of quantities so these are things that need to be looked at so approach and therapy i think i'm just talking about this uh more because later on i'm going to talk about the importance of self therapy but these are some of the cognitive processes that i think we can have in mind uh in order to kind of buffer ourselves against the mental health impact of quarantine and of the virus so first of all it's important to realize that virtual modalities are more practical and present yes face to face would have been good you know it would have been nice to meet your friends would it be nice to meet your therapist but right now that may not be all that possible and not be the safest it's important to address the reality that we live in extraordinary time it's also important to reassure the patient in the event of a therapist so how one would a friend that there will always be the person will always be there regardless of the crisis it's important to maintain eye contact um and you know basically to suggest using virtual platforms uh like zoom or facetime to maintain contact with one social contact so have a zoom dinner for example uh it doesn't mean just because you cannot meet that social gatherings have to stop um and for those in therapy it's perhaps perhaps important to bear in mind now may not be the best time to terminate therapy it may be good to continue it at least till this crisis is a bit better and to reframe to look at the pandemic not as the end of one's old life and the you know kind of the end of everything but as a role transition a change in which the person yes mourns the loss of old roles but then you adaptively restructure activities and relationships in this new novel so use it as an opportunity to start a new and to to adjust and to adjust other interventions so i talked about digital technologies and how important they are places of congregation should actually replicate their activities via online platform so this is like places of worship gyms employers should actually create a buddy system and ensure a daily reach out to employees routine creation is essential especially for children not in school to kind of give them the rhythm and routine mechanisms for surveillance and decisive intervention in cases of abuse must be created basically so that the victims of abuse were now back in their homes often with you know their abuses partners must have places of help and shelter um and that really leads me to my next point these shelters in and of themselves must be safe must have social distancing so that this vulnerable group doesn't itself become infected mental health system actually needs to be bolstered in anticipation of a surge of cases which may happen and telehealth may need to be expanded and communities should be encouraged to create informal support networks amongst themselves to provide support to each other how to help to help us well basically i've talked about this because uh i think we all recognize that um you know i'm not sure i think many of many of us may be therapists we may be caregivers um and it's it's a stressful role at this time to care for others um so how does one help the helpers so you know basically it's important to have a proper diet regular exercise and sufficient sleep clear communication uh basically providing the psychological and financial support to those who are on caregiving roles uh and psychological first aid which is um the main reason why i'm actually talking about this so if you look at that that box to your right you'll see that these are the themes of psychological first aid it's something very simple and basically the main focus is to emphasize to the person to whom you're giving this first aid that number one um they're safe uh number two that they're not alone someone is there to link them up with supports so that there can be more support in the days to weeks moving forward and to provide them with information about how to cope and how to manage their distress it's useful because it's very applicable in this time and psychological first aid is certainly something that i think is a good tool for a lot of people to learn much as we learn uh medical first aid to deal with people you know who are going through a medical crisis psychological first stage should be something that should be taught to help people who are going through a psychological and since this is a mindfulness workshop i thought that include something about mindfulness as well and there are some studies that have talked about mindfulness in a pandemic so focused attention mindfulness based cognitive therapy and mindfulness based stress reduction have been shown to reduce anxiety depression post-traumatic stress disorder and the physiological markers of stress they basically offer a helpful way to cope with this constant change over pandemic rising cases lockdowns and so on daily mindfulness practice actually improved sleep duration and reduced anxiety amongst the population of quarantined individuals in gohan as compared to those who just had mind wandering so basically just kind of unfocused attention and rumination qualitative study of nurses in china actually showed that they endorsed mindfulness as a helpful way of reducing stress we know that nurses are under immense stress uh these days in a lot of countries where the cases are you know you know surging uh and meditation and mindfulness apps may actually be helpful uh to in order to deliver this this mindfulness to to the broader community um and mindfulness micro practices can be used to promote wellness and reduce burnout example whilst performing hand hygiene so now you may have heard a lot about washing your hands and uh and so on so whilst washing your hands how about practicing using that moment to focus on one's breath once uh center one's mind and body and visualize the kind of calmness and and presence that one would want to have at that moment in time so while cleaning your hands how about also kind of focusing on cleaning some of your thoughts and kind of promoting that wellness and peace i know it's abstract but it's perhaps something that can be um you know elaborated on further by you know other speakers or maybe even during a conference itself about how these micro moments can be used to promote wellness so part three is about mental health in the post-covet world and i think that that really is um a question that's foremost on many people's minds so we talked about the kovitz cycle um so covet cycle i think as we are all familiar you have a rise in case numbers there's a lockdown case numbers drop and then there is a gradual reopening of society but unfortunately then case numbers rise again and whilst not linked in the ebola crisis in west africa in liberia and sierra leone they actually talked about the presence of a fear apathy cycle so when ebola cases rise there's a lot of fear but then ebola becomes a new normal and then there's activity and then cases rise again and they talked about this in terms of how aid agencies may sometimes render support to uh or government they render support to people affected by the ebola virus there is somewhat a similar trend seen with kobit at least in quite a number of other countries overseas uh and this is from the economist that basically kind of sums up uh this whole covet cycle and how there is this pattern of re-engagement followed by a spike of cases and then unfortunately shut down again so what are the possible social economic scenarios that provide 19 might have so first of all of course borders may actually remain far more tightly controlled than before you may have countries that they have as an aspirational goal suppression a mere suppression of the virus so some level of spread but uh but fairly low versus countries that may say well we want to eliminate the virus so countries like new zealand or taiwan or south korea and is it likely that a country having taken all that effort to eliminate the virus may then open its borders readily to countries that merely state as a goal their desire to suppress so this is a question that that might be seen in the months to years ahead uh there's also a concern that you know jobs is short-term contracts they become more commonplace as employers are unable to plan for the long term and this might result in a transient workforce and governments may need to institute a series of stimulus packages to support the most needy uh but this may be associated with an increase in spending and so tax rates might go up uh and you will wonder future generations might actually have to put the bill of all the stimulus packages in the present day please and quite a number of other countries that don't really have the reserves in singapore do this is a particular concern uh there may also be sizable disruptions educational progress i think school closures and online learning is is important but can it really substitute actually going to school um financial strains actually force younger people to forego higher education in favor of earlier work communal activities and large scale social events may not occur as freely as before and unfortunately as we know is human nature certain entities mister feelings of ill will towards certain countries and communities and as we know if history is any guide the ensuing friction may lead to global conflict we hope it doesn't but if past pandemics and crises have shown us anything it's that for every good reaction that mankind seems to do there is also an unfortunately a negative reaction as well so what are the mental health consequences and i've divided this really looking at the spectrum across the lifespan so um i talked about the increase in domestic abuse so this is likely to affect the young and the elderly the most but there may be other issues as well in the young so i think uh uh prof daniel fung we're talking more about the mental health impacts of the young uh so i'll be brief here but basically there may be a rise in adolescent mood and anxiety disorders you know due to stall educational progress dim prospects unemployment and the lack of social interaction and that may result in an increase in adolescent suicide and an increase in delinquency in the elderly we know that many elder care centers have had shuts and so this is you know because you do need to keep the elderly safe from the virus but then that creates increased social isolation and many people the younger folks may be familiar with zoom and online platforms but our elderly may not be so familiar and so they might really really be cut off uh and it as was seen actually uh post-sas there was actually an increase in elderly suicide driven by disconnectedness and fear of contracting the illness and this was seen actually in hong kong post stars so this is something that we need to bear in mind across all ages we are still finding out more and more about the direct impact that the virus has on the brain uh we still don't know all that much but there is a concern that it may be causing some behavioral changes in and in people who are infected um there may be adjustment disorders depressive disorders grief um ocd and post-traumatic stress disorder may rise across the board and anxiety disorders may as well may become more common and as was seen in west africa after ebola there was actually an increase in the rates of addiction especially the alcohol so this is something that we also need to think about and plan for in the future and so for the mental health care system uh i suppose it's it's more it's important for us to look at um the groups yeah so i've divided it based on the various um groups at risk so for the worry well those who are worried about contracting the virus but do not yet have any mental health illness mental illnesses at this point uh you may want to talk about increasing the outreach or mental health apps familiarizing oneself with their youth so this would be self-help cognitive behavior therapy or mindfulness we want to integrate mental health advice into pre-existing social media networks so maybe remind us on facebook or instagram in order to kind of ensure that they're well or checking on their friends to make sure that they're well and also having support groups in the workplace as we've talked about before for those who have mental health illness symptoms or some stress but do not yet meet the threshold for an actual disorder or illness then they may help from counseling services and increase in the scope of telecounseling services that might be helpful for those who have mild to moderate mental illness then i suppose having easier access to psychiatric services or scoping out your tele psychiatry services may be helpful and for the very ill i suppose it's the one major thing we need to think about is how do we get back get them back on their feet uh as soon as possible after they've had a period of illness especially given the silent employment prospects that would would be there as a result of this virus so my reflection and this is my my last slide is you know much has been said about hand hygiene washing your hands wearing a mask to stem the spreader of the illness but what about psychological hygiene to stem this emotional contagion the spread of of stress and of distress mental health effects of covet 19 are likely to linger within society long after the virus is suppressed because the economic after effects will not just go away the day a vaccine is found it will be there and talking about the vaccine much as a vaccine will inoculate or protect people against the virus perhaps you also need to think about a vaccine for emotional wellness perhaps this will involve teaching people how to practice mindfulness or cognitive behavior therapy on their own to manage stress teaching them how to have proper sleep hygiene for example or how to talk about their feelings how to recognize mental illness that's important too and telemodalities will be important in this way so if that will allow people to reach out to each other and eventually once the whole of society is aware of what mental illness is is aware of how to help oneself and how to help those around us then perhaps we would have built up heard pandemic related stress and uh and that's perhaps something that we need to to um build ourselves towards uh also it's important to remember that societies do have a responsibility to act collaboratively and manage the spread of hate and division which may happen but we must actively work to prevent this from happening so with that that brings me to the end of my presentation thank you for listening you ,True,True,True,True

Speakers:
Dr. Bill Bahnfleth, Chair of the ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force and Former ASHRAE President
Luke Leung, Team Lead for Commercial/Retail on ASHRAE’s Epidemic Task Force
Chandra Sekhar, Team Member for Residential on ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force","hello everyone so welcome to this ASHRAE webinar so my name is Tata Samui I'm the moderator and also the representative of the government affairs committee of ASHRAE so our webinar will start very soon so on behalf of ASHRAE society we are grateful for a large number of attendees and also we have received last number of applicants for these weaponers therefore actually we have upgrade or just the platform for the opinion from webinar actually we are using our webcast platform to do that so that we can cater for more attendance so according to our station lease there are people coming from different countries around the world so that means they are also at different time zones and I also have read some comments from the applicants telling us that the time zone water timing is may not be very convenient for them for example people in Hawaii or the west coast of us or the west part of the South Americans they are livid early in the morning and we have to say apologies to them because we have to select a right timing for most of the participants but hopefully you want to enjoy this or if some people who are not able to attend because of the timing we have the video recording and they can also watch the video recording of the webinar at a later time so without further ado I would like to kick start the webinar right now so this webinar is droney hosted by the government affairs committee and the epidemic task force of Ashley and this is the information that you should note it because when you are connected to the webinar you will be automatically mute for the entire period of the webcasts just in case I don't know is me effect is because so if you would like to raise the question as a question please click on the icon on the right hand side of your screen and then you can type your question together with your email and name and in case you are not able to raise the question during at that time you can still contact us we have the email address of the epidemic task force please note that the if this event is being recorded and the video recording and efficient ation file will be made available 30 events okay this is the outline we are going to carry out in the next one and a half hour so we have three speakers so you can see that we have three specific topics to be delivered by a speaker and we will also put some rational answers time at the end of the webinar and in fact we have received by a number of questions from the registration form of the webinar and we have already select some questions that we believe will be very constructive and we will try to this highlight this at the end of this webinar but at the same time if you have the passion to be waste during the presentation please feel free to do that using the chat pod we have three distinguished speakers two in this weaponers and you can see that the professor william p bankrupt from the Penn State University's he actually is the chair of the ASHRAE of the deme task force and together with two colleagues who are also from the SV epidermic task force they will be talking about in different aspects including the commercial and residential building or in general eco 19 protection electricity systems and I am the moderator for this webinar and I'm the chair a member of the government Affairs committees and also a chair chairman of the one of the airport committee responsible for organizing this webinar and in fact I'm the original file share of region 13 which is in the Southeast Asia and I come from Hong Kong chapter so I believe that many of the attendants are s remember so you may still remember we start to celebrate the 125th anniversary of ASHRAE nasiha in 2019 and you can see this is a overview of our society which started in 1894 and for this coven 19th pandemic in particular you may notice that as we have Makris pawn in the past few months by setting up epidemic task force and this is the some of the area that this task force have been looking at and they have researchers and also petitioners in industry that try to gather new so technical resources and informations and you can find all the technical resource information from the task force and from our society on these wavelengths and some of you may also be interested in the upcoming events of our society and I have picked up a few of them which highlight here on the slides including the upcoming ASHRAE 2020 virtual conference this is the first time actually trying to help virtual conference because of this pandemic which we will start next week and among all the different technical sections a live session they are four in particular we need to copy 19 that some of you we like to register for the conference and attend or watch the video recording afterwards and at the same time there will be another training short course online on coven 18 and buildings in particular for reopening on the occupation of the lockdown which will be held on the 8th of July so please visit the website if you are interested to attend those activities so as in as the introduction I would also like to highlight or use an update later and you me aware that the cover 19 is now affecting every countries in the world and this is the dashboard or the map I will help organizations and you can see that amongst all these affected countries some of them will be called emerging economies which include some of the developing countries which are now facing but challenges in terms of the health prices they are facing the control of the transmission of virus in their society and also economic impact to their society in terms of the lockdowns and any kind of supply of food or medical equipment and so on these are creating much problems in some of these countries and we believe that building operation and maintenance and also the HVAC system is a critical part of everyday life so therefore we would like to provide in this manner and in also the upcoming activities more technical informations which could be adopted or referred to by people in the emerging economies or some other countries when they are considering the protection and how risk of the facilities so this is a Dilys of the free copy so at this point I would like to pass to our first speaker Professor William pampered or the presentations bill it thank you hopefully you can see my screen now it's a real pleasure to be here at this program honored to be invited and say good morning to everyone because it's just a few minutes after 8:00 a.m. where I am my function here on the program is to give an overview of some of the background material so that the presentations by the other speakers specific to emerging economies will have a foundation so my talk is about fundamentals of risk management for covered 19 will start with infectious disease transmission modes there are a number of different ways that an infectious disease can be transmitted through the air either by large droplets over a short range or by aerosols by smaller particles or droplets that can remain airborne for some period of time in some cases almost indefinitely by intermediate surface contact or Foe might transfer water and food physical contact and also by vectors such as mosquitoes we're talking here today mainly about airborne transmission in its various forms because that's what can be impacted by HVAC HVAC you can also to some extent impact film i transmission but for a cover 19 that's not thought to be one of the the main modes the risk management is something that everyone should be becoming familiar with there's a hierarchy of controls to mitigate those various infection modes elimination of sources is the most important one if we can do it that's hard to do with an infectious disease Engineering controls are considered to be the the next most effective approach if you can't eliminate the source you can deal with it with HVAC systems and other means that intervene to reduce exposure and then following that their administrative controls rules and regulations and personal protective equipment which to some extent are viewed as being less effective because they depend on people actually implementing them risk management for infection requires a team approach because there are so many different factors in a building and amongst building systems that contribute to it so where do infectious aerosols come from humans are the the main source of breathing talking singing coughing sneezing all of these activities can produce aerosols and in in greatly different concentrations or or amounts breathing is the least productive and activities like singing produced a very large amount of aerosol as you can see in the flow visualization of a cough there on the right hand side but we also have plumbing fixtures that can produce aerosols and you can see a visualization of a toilet also on the right and the additionally medical procedures in Dennis office and hospitals where intubation might be done can produce aerosol so there are lots of sources and those are what we're producing the contaminants in the air that we need to deal with the respiratory aerosols are initially droplets that contain water proteins and salts and they cover up a wide range of sizes as you can see on the figure on the right which is some some fairly old research but still widely cited by Doug within the US and the 1940s so these droplets dehydrate to smaller final sizes from their initial sizes which may be as large as a thousand microns and many of them can remain airborne for long periods of time there have been studies of influenza where the the viral load in aerosol has been sampled that have found that half of the viral load may be in particles smaller than five microns which are quite capable of staying airborne for a significant period of time so this issue of the size ranges of droplets has resulted in the division of airborne exposure into the close contact large droplet mode which is what's mainly talked about as the the primary motive affection for co19 at least by World Health Organization and other organizations those are droplets that are large enough that they will settle out because of their weight fairly quickly within this 1 to 2 meter radius that we have all heard about being the safe separation distance we did distancing but some of the large droplets can also travel a long distance if they're produced by a cough or a sneeze and they leave the mouth and nose at high velocities there's a lot of discussion about what is the the difference or the dividing line between large and small some say as large as 60 microns initial diameter at 10 microns final diameter whether a particle can be distributed a long distance to some extent also depends on local air flow conditions so it's it's a bit of a gray area but that's the distinction that we're making here between close contact and air assault so as far as Coby to the the virus that causes the the Koba 19 infection is very closely related to the the SARS one coronavirus that caused the the SARS epidemic some years ago it's an RNA virus that has a fatty or lipid envelope and though the size of the virus is about 120 nanometers or point 1 2 microns we often focus too much on that because given the way that viruses are shed in respiratory droplets what's really important is the spectrum of sizes of those droplets which are quite a bit larger there are a lot of things we don't know about the disease transmission that would be helpful to know the the shedding rate of a typical infected person and the infectious dose so not having that information means we're a little bit in the dark in terms of deciding exactly how much do we have to reduce airborne concentrations to control risks that's the other situation we're going to be in for some time we also know that in the air the virus can survive for hours and on surfaces for days according to some of the work that's been done so there is a big controversy over whether or not there is airborne Air Assault transmission the it's complicated by some disagreements about what those terms mean the the World Health Organization and CDC in the US and others are focused very heavily on close contact but they haven't entirely ruled out other modes as well a lot of the evidence comes from health care environments which may be well ventilated so there's some explanations for why we may not see a lot of aerosol or airborne transmission one could be the viruses are mostly in large droplets but that's not necessarily demonstrated by the evidence that's available another plausible one is the infectious dose is large and the third is that in a lot of environments the environmental factors reduce the the concentration but there are a number of unexplained community spread or super spreading events like this gadget valley choir rehearsal or the Guangzhou restaurant case that are really hard to explain by this large droplet transfer so that and the evidence from the SARS epidemic suggests that maybe we do have some obligate airborne transmission going under certain circumstances and there is a fairly large community of physicians engineers aerosol scientists epidemiologists who believe that's the case and you may have seen some of the other papers like the one shown in on the right-hand side of this slide so ASHRAE adopting what we might call the precautionary principle and other organizations as well Reva in Europe for example has taken the position that there is enough evidence of airborne or aerosol transmission that we should take measures to protect ourselves that have the effect of reducing airborne exposure you see on the right that figure that comes from an analysis of this restaurant case that's very famous where we had little ventilation and fan coil units circulating a lot of air in a part of the the restaurant that was near an infected individual and a number of people were infected at the three table shown there at the top this figure so that's where ashtrays guidance comes from so with that foundation let's discuss some of the engineering controls that are available and that are the tools that we have to try to mitigate exposure ventilation is one of them how much outdoor air do we provide for dilution of contaminants air distribution is another factor how do we move air in spaces are there better and worse ways to mix air supplied by our air conditioning systems with the air in the space that will reduce likelihood of exposure filtration which generally is taken to mean filtration of particles another important mechanism disinfection by various means UV is the one that ASHRAE most strongly endorses but there are others as well that you've heard of ionization and dry hydrogen peroxide and others that are being discussed as possibilities and then also temperature and humidity control which relates to our HVAC system operation as well those are the main things that we can do as those who are responsible for indoor environmental control so let's talk about each of these a little bit of ventilation dilutes contaminants and by doing so increases the exposure time that's required to acquire infectious deserve the dose becoming infected with a respiratory illness is somewhat like being exposed to a toxin there's a certain amount of infectious material that we have to inhale before we have a high probability of an infection incurring so if we lower the concentration and our breathing rate doesn't change it takes longer time and that's protective as a ventilation works quite effectively but it's energy intensive even if we have energy recovery we see the impact of ventilation in the figure from a study done in a university in China some years ago where they were looking at another coronavirus but the one that causes the common cold and you can see there a very clear relationship between the ventilation rate and these dormitories and the incidence of colds so we know that it's generally effective but it does have a negative to it in terms of energy and maybe even in terms of feasibility for some systems ventilation works in conjunction with exhaust with removing contaminated air locally and pressurization to have flow from clean to less clean spaces as a strategy for controlling risk air distribution can contribute if we have strong air currents that distribute larger droplets beyond the range that they would normally be a high risk factor so if we have for example pedestal fans or personal fans that are in the breathing zone or if we have a lot of unitary air conditioning equipment that produces high velocities that has the potential to distribute the larger size droplets and in the respiratory aerosol over a longer distance at lower velocity mixing may actually be preferable to this placement ventilation because displacement produces hot spots near infected individuals and I've seen some persuasive discussion amongst aerosol scientists that the mixing is actually useful in some cases personalized ventilation and exhaust can work if you can localize the sources or the individuals that you want to protect the filtration is capable of removing with some degree of efficiency any aerosol contaminant but not all of any size for indoor sources filtration is only effective if we have recirculation either within the space or within the system so if it's somewhat conflicts with guidance that you may have seen to eliminate recirculation in systems that were designed to recirculate it works well if the contaminants of concern are airborne they aren't always they may be surfaces and we suspended by disturbances and it also is effective if the clean air delivery rate the volume of filtered air that we're supplying is large enough to dilute the contaminant concentration in the space to a safe level we see a Merv filter curve example there on the right-hand side and this figure the the ASHRAE standard 52.2 system we are at very low filter efficiencies by minimum standards currently and one of the things that our guidance is to increase efficiency so here we see some data on respiratory aerosols over on the right-hand side some work done by Christopher Chou from Hong Kong and others that shows the distribution of the the droplets produced by speaking and coughing and you can see that those are in a size range that much what could remain airborne and could be filterable and at the lower right we see some data from the current epidemic that shows the presence of virus in droplets of small sizes you notice that the scale on these three figures only goes up to I think it's about five microns here so there's quite a bit of particulate matter containing viruses that are capable of staying airborne and of being filtered if we have filters of appropriate efficiency this figure comes from an interesting economic analysis by professor Brent Stevens from the US and it uses the wells Reilly model of infection what we see here is that the mean relative risk of infection on the the vertical axis can be affected by filtration the heavy black line or by ventilation and that as we go from lower filter efficiencies smaller Merv numbers to larger ones we get a significant reduction in infection risk with not much change in the annual cost this is dollars per year for a five thousand square foot or five hundred meter squared office building the colored curves show the cost of doing the same thing you ventilation and you can see that in every case to get to the same level that the murder filter achieves it takes a lot more cost to do it and that's going to be manly energy cost so not only the the operating cost but the energy use of the building is going to be going up another reason that increasing filter efficiency may be a good thing is shown here the effects of PM 2.5 on health in general exclusive of infectious diseases is well known World Health Organization has probably studies about that and we can see in the figure on the left here but if we go from a Merv six or eight filter where our ASHRAE standard 62 point one and sixty-two point two are currently two thirteen and fourteen which is the range it's being recommended for pandemic response we can get on average predicted hundreds of dollars per person per year increase in health benefits by reducing morbidity and mortality so that's a no regrets reason for increasing filter efficiency now let's talk about air disinfection and in the interest of time I'll focus on UV light germicidal light here ultraviolet light in the UVC band has been known for more than a hundred years to be at this infect --nt and we have a well developed and relatively inexpensive technology and mercury vapor lamps that produces two hundred fifty four nanometer Cultra violet which as you can see in the figure at the bottom right is close to the maximum germicidal effectiveness of UVC it's perhaps at ninety percent of the peak effectiveness at two hundred and sixty-five germicidal UV works by disrupting the bonds in DNA or RNA you can see a thymine dimer and the upper right figure formed by adenine thymine bonds being broken by photons of UV light another that does damage prevents viral or bacterial replication which is how it disinfects corona viruses actually have very good UV susceptibility so it's an excellent technology to apply as an adjunct to filtration and ventilation and it's been approved by the Centers for Disease control and prevention in the US as an adjunct for tuberculosis control so it's been well vetted by agencies of that sort there are some interesting emerging technologies like LEDs at different wavelengths and far ultraviolet from Krypton chlorine excimer lamps the benefit of some of these technologies that are being studied is that perhaps they are safe for human exposure to 54 nanometer UV light needs to be kept away from occupants of spaces this slide shows some typical applications we can do upper-air UV GI is shown on the top of the figure on the left we see some fixtures on the wall of a large open space break room or something of that sort and they're creating a disinfection zone is shown in the figure on the upper right where there is a significant UV fluence and air that moves into that zone by being carried for a thermal plumes or by the air distribution of an HVAC system can be disinfected and then reintroduced into the space with an effect that can be the equivalent of 10 20 30 year changes per hour depending on how effectively the system is designed another place to put UV is in air handling units and that you can do surface disinfection of cooling coils to improve their performance but also with sufficient intensity this can also do air disinfection another uses space disinfection with devices like the UV robots so-called on the lower right that can be wheeled into an unoccupied space and used to disinfect it between uses so there's some interesting trade-offs between ventilation filtration and air cleaning these can be described by the air cleaner effectiveness parameters shown on the the right in this slide it's essentially a measure that will tell us what is the incremental benefit from putting another control into a space and so we're going to a start we assume with some level of ventilation because it's required by code but then we'll have some filtration and we may add a an error disinfection device to that some of these things are synergistic there as if we had ventilation then put filtration in the space but if we have a ventilation that's increased by recirculation and that reduces the flow of restricted air through a filter there's actually a trade-off and so I did a little example just to illustrate this a very simple recirculating system with outside air and a filter and I looked at what happened if we kept the outside air constant and increase the filter efficiency and what happens if we keep the filter efficiency constant and increase the outside air and that's shown in these two figures so if we have a 20% outside air system and we have a filter efficiency that increases from zero to a hundred percent essentially from no filter to kappa level what we see is that the effectiveness of the filter goes from zero initially up to a hundred percent as we increase its performance and the normalized concentration and the ratio of the concentration and the space to what it was with no filter drops to twenty percent of what it was without the filter so there we have an additive effect for putting a better filter and on the other hand on the right hand side if we start with a 60% filter maybe in the in the murmur of 13 range on average and we increase the outside air what we see is that the concentration again drops to 20% as the outsider increases but the effectiveness the filter eventually goes to zero because when there's no recirculation through it it's not removing any contaminants from the space so we've increased the outside air here by a factor of five and we've only achieved the same reduction in concentration that we got by putting in a better filter with the same outside air that we had initially which to me somewhat throws a know recirculation recommendation for recirculating systems into a bit of doubts they need to be considered very carefully if you're thinking about doing that so those are our our interventions that relate to changing our normal air contaminant controls I'm sure that most have heard about the potential for temperature and humidity control to be effective in reducing risk the ASHRAE has actually had in its handbook in the humidifier section for many years the version of the figure shown on the right that suggests that perhaps forty to sixty percent relative humidity is the right range to be in to protect ourselves from a number of indoor air quality risks everything from infectious disease to chemical exposures governments have been some recent studies that have considered this issue and they have shown that specifically for viral infections this also seems to be a highly protective region that there are a number of factors that reduce risk that are shown at the bottom of the slide there the droplets evaporate more slowly and settle out faster when humidity is higher that our mucosa are less receptive to infection when the air is not too dry and that the viruses themselves may be less infective and survive less long when the humidity is not too low this is a pretty strong argument for at least setting some feasible floor on relative humidity they're good reasons not to exceed 60 that have to do with other factors so ASHRAE has not come out unequivocally in endorsing that recommendation because there are some concerns about it different pathogens respond differently there's the risk of moisture damage and mold growth if the humidity is high or even if it's low in some climates in cold climates even perhaps 30% relative humidity in an existing building would be difficult to attain without having problems with the envelope the effectiveness of UV GI is reduced somewhat but that's probably a secondary factor and of course there's potentially comfort issues as well so ASHRAE says look at this others like Reva have said we don't think you need to change any set points from what they already are so it's a bit of a contentious issue so those are things that we can do with our HVAC system but at the end here I want to loop back and and remind everyone that ASHRAE agrees with the the health authorities that say that close contact is clearly the the highest component of risk and that we need to do the things that we need to do to reduce that risk which includes masks masks can vary from n95 s that protect the wearer if they're fitted properly to cloth masks that mainly protect others so in one case PPE is a mask as PPE but in others it might be a source control or engineering control you can see the effect of a cloth mask and the figure on the right there that was produced by researcher at NIST that shows that it greatly reduces the extent of the the jet that's produced by a coughs oh it's a good thing for us to wear a masks and this figure from a recent paper that was published analyzing the effectiveness of masks shows that if even if we have just simple cloth masks that block particles being expelled by coughing and sneezing and other activities and if a lot of people do it with a moderate amount of adherence and moderate efficacy we can get the are not for kovat 19 to 1 which would be the tipping point for snot being the pandemic so that's a really important thing to keep in mind it's not all about personal behavior or all about HVAC we need to do all of these things to be safe so to summarize the HVAC system interventions we can do are mainly reducing this residual risk of aerosol and airborne transmission that may occur in some cases we've got a fairly small but very effective repertoire of controls we can apply we need to do that in a thoughtful way taking the consideration our climate and the systems we have and the other factors that may be in play and engineering controls again are just part of an overall risk management program so do the other things as well and with that I'll thank you for your attention they'll conclude Thanks you hello the next section this is Luke learn the next session will be commercial building so there will be free our elements we're going to talk about the environment the space and systems so environment so summers coming in a few days so it's a good time to go outdoor and the good news here is according to this paper majority of the cases that people trans got infected by the copa90 is actually indoor they did a study of over seven thousand three hundred cases and they find only two cases uh outdoor so one of the thing about commercial building maybe half the tenants to spend more time outdoors during lunch time maybe even have some meetings outdoor under sunshine in the summer is good this is a study done by us by Defense Department and what you'll find on the top here is ninety percent reduction from in the air from two hundred minutes to four point five minutes if the materials in the air and a bottom there what you see is on stainless steel and they find over sixty minutes there's no significant it's no significant decay if is is darkness but under sun strong sunlight 90% reduction in seven minutes so the total idea use having out having able to go outdoor with sunshine chance at sunshine is a good thing now but be out be aware of the PM 2.5 there's association of higher higher level PM 2.5 with that rate of kovat and this is maybe more important in some emerging country where the air quality has to be a little bit of a concern there we'll talk about the relative humidity of forty to sixty percent and we have to take care that it doesn't it doesn't condensate indoor especially in the winter time what do you think the bottom with additional information is actually provided by the power Defense Department of us we did a curve fitting of the data they provide providers and what you see is roughly about seventeen sixty percent or so this is specifics to Koby - it does looks like a react to the relative humidity and is bottoming bottom bun turning around that 60% area co environment is not it's not not as good for us because the virus tend to stay longer a state more stable in the co environment so in office environment what you want to think about is for example you have refrigerator or places that are colder and drier you may want to be more concerned about that this is a recent study indicating the importance of the floor which is not surprising this study is about patient roam and they find the most material on the floor thinking about this is a droplet transmitted disease primarily so it shouldn't be surprised at their elements on the floor so think about how we're gonna clean the floor and don't we suspend the elements as we know normal coppers tend to hold a lot more dusts and elements of different sizes so so far we roughly talked about the environment in terms of outdoor and indoor what are the elements that we want to think about the next section we touch on the spaces this is from CDC suggesting no matter in more space for AB you talked about the importance of having production devices CDC mentioned that all employees should wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in all areas of the business coming into the lobby this is actually our own office in Shanghai and it's not uncommon that you will see in some area of the world they have actually this infrared detection device to make sure your temperature is not high now you probably had a lot these people are a symptomatic so what's the point of having this device here usually don't a symptomatic people can carry the virus but the people who are symptomatic tend to be much stronger in in fact of the others so having a having an infrared device to identify the people data that have high temperature does you know identify those people that are you know already symptomatic and maybe more more dangerous compared to the asymptomatic people some even have device like this app you mentioned toilet in this case again is the patient room study they did find the elements in the toilet so we need to be a little bit careful about dealing with the toilet including the continuous exhaust of the toilet and also hold or open there are devices out there right now to tell you how to keep social distancing inside the toilet and make sure you know how many toilet how many people are inside the toilet before you enter but the good news may be a little bit of good news here is this case you might have seen in the past is the courier or a cosigner the good thing about it is there's a infection outbreak in the building but majority of the cases actually ninety four of them our of 97 are set in the same floor and they actually more concentrated in one area of the floor so obviously they share the toilet they share the elevator they share the amenities in the building but we didn't see the entire building getting infected in fact the cases a majority of the cases are concentrated in the corner that's us that suggests maybe droplet is actually a very important element in this transmission now if your building has atrium you gotta be a little bit more careful because the air tend to be shared so whatever measure you take at one floor it has to be somewhat consistent to the other floor to achieve a overall sort of measures in the building so we touch the spaces from the lobby to the toilet to the atrium some of the things you worry about now the final section here we will talk about the systems in the building if your building has natural ventilation it will be helpful what you can see in the screen here is the natural ventilation of a building and moving into the different system in the building if you have a radiant system that doesn't recirculate air just pump fresh air into the building that's obviously good and you can leave them continue to continue the run same as true beam so there's tools out there to model this system in this case we actually model a door system using the NIST later software so what you're seeing on the screen the blue is actually the occupancy every hour the person spent 10 minutes inside the room right so and the room has a commission in there so it's not constantly exposed to it so every 10 minutes on the hour and the Green Line is the X and the Green Line is actually the total exposure of the day and the blue line is the exposure concentration you can see Esther as today go go by the integrated exposure is higher and we'll come back to this chart later to compare the different system now there's another types of doors that recirculate air for example you have a doors with a fan coil unit or BRF in the space this type of door system we have to be a little bit careful humans in the restaurant in China in that case there's a person a one is infected but he's asymptomatic and then he actually spread the virus on to the other people inside a restaurant because the airflow and has the distance of the of the transfer so the point here is if you have a vrf system with no filtering no outside air and tend to recirculate air make sure you understand the air flow that it doesn't carry from one person to the other cons for prolonged period of time and then of course there are we AV system in the case of Vav system this is a Vav system with minimum alsa here and they tend to return air back to the unit now in this case if you have an enhanced fielder like mer 14 will help to minimize the amount material in the air we'll touch on this graph here so what you are seeing is merv 8 and the benefit of mer 14 using point 1 2 micrometer elements so in this chart here what you are seeing is we are comparing using the NIST program comparing Merv 8 tumor 14 so what you see is the integrated exposure is almost after a 24-hour stay is almost maybe slightly more a slightly more than half but it's a lot better using the Murphree team compared to merv 8 and the exposure concentration is also better have a Murph rate infielder compared to a Murph 8 theater so if your be AV system has 100% outside air what you can also do is shut off the return and provide 100% fresh air into the space now what you are seeing here is comparing Murphy to 100% outside air again you will see the integrated exposure and the exposure concentration is also also much better with the Vav with 100% outside air so how about we comparing all three Vav with Murph a compared to Vav with Murph routine compared to Vav with 100% outside air now we'll make the point earlier that we have to be a little bit careful and use 100% outside air you can see here why because the Vav with Murph routine the benefit is actually very close to the Vav with 100% outside air in this case the báb with 100% outside may be slightly better but not by a whole lot so they are very close to each other but Murph routine is doing much of the job already and they are both really with Murph routine or Vav with 100% outside air still significantly better than a Vav with Murph eight so that may be another discussion out there you here is how about doors compared to Vav system so this is the case of using doors compared to be AV system now in this case with the whole day's exposure the Vav with Murph 8 and me we have even if mer 14 actually is slightly better and the reason is because they continuously recirculate the air through a much higher grade theater now but this is only one case of course so we have to be a little bit careful but there are certainly cases that indicate the the Vav system can potentially be better because they are recirculating everything as especially in the lower case through a mere 14 fielder so but then you have to this is average in the room so we have to also think about what about close distances and all that information so when we look at this numbers here we have to be bear in mind this is copy average of the room not a specific location UVC light is important and we can and be went through that alone already that's something that we can use to enhance the room and they are also a bunch of the emergent emerging technology we can use in our buildings but this may need a little bit more science to completely understand what exactly can they do moving beyond the Cova 19 so there are actually other elements that can derail our health in the future pandemic is number three according to World Health Organization chronic diseases is number two and climate change is actually number one those are the top three elements that can derail our our future in terms of health but the good news there is maybe we can look for the highest common multiple for example the particulates in the air we if we have good filter we can we can help in pandemic we can help to improve the air quality to avoid the PM 2.5 for chronic diseases or avoid some of the fire and this particulates that come into our building so maybe one elements we can start think about is what are this highest common multiple that can do multiple things that can keep our buildings healthier in the future thank you you thank you I would again thank the organizers of this webinar to have invited me to speak about the residential buildings in this case we heard from Bill about the fundamentals of Cobie 19 and some of the basic understanding that we need to have were the virus and its transmission modes and Luke has taken us through all the issues and what we could do with commercial buildings and I would like to spend some time the rest of the time in this webinar on the residential buildings so I'm going to just start off with this slide that bill had showed right in this early part of the presentation if we look at the infection control hierarchy obviously right at the top if you can eliminate the pathogen that's ideal then we go down the line down the pyramid so to speak down to the personal protection equipment again the focus even in terms of the residential buildings would be on engineering controls so again the talk that I'm gonna have with you for the next few minutes will be on what sort of things do we know about existing residential building situation I'm going to sort of take you through with information that we currently know about the ventilation rates and what sort of exposure levels that are likely to occur not just in terms of the viral infectious aerosols but generally in terms of any contaminant inside we've seen this before in I believe it is Bill's slides and it was also reiterated when Luke was talking about we look at ventilation as being one of the primary means of achieving deletion of indoor contaminants of course there are other ways you remove those and that's even better but let's look at ventilation as the means of dilution of indoor contaminants three things come to mind and we need to bear in mind that is the quality of the outdoor air and and here we are talking about what sort of quality of the outdoor air that we can bring in depending on where you are this might be very different might change the quantity the liters per second or CFM per person that we need to provide as part of the amount of outdoor air that we need to bring into the building then we have one of the important consideration that's the room air distribution the ventilation effectiveness as the primary characteristic that drives this understanding of how the room air is distributed and if we are talking about outdoor air that comes in from the illusion of indoor contaminants how do we make use of what we understand and what we know about room air distribution to help achieve the better effectiveness at the breathing zone and thereby help in mitigating the exposure to contaminants of whatever nature they are I'm going to take you through as I said some data that we know from literature some studies that have been done and if we look at this particular case start off with a semi-detached house in the heating season and this is natural ventilation in a house that has triple vents on windows and also these are little openings that you can either open or keep closed on windows and doors that will allow depending on the wind direction outside air to come into the building so here is a very summarised slide that is part of a publication that is currently under review for a journal and what you are seeing here is carbon dioxide concentration measured in bedroom in this particular case in that in that house that I just showed you earlier over time you see a buildup of the contaminant the carbon dioxide in the bedroom and it goes from something like 2200 ppm to about almost 3,000 ppm overnight and it's just with one person sleeping in the in the bedroom and the bedroom door being closed and then the person leaves and this was an experiment that was conducted and you have a decay of the carbon Delta simply because you got outside air that comes in so the natural ventilation process and that's happening to the trigger lens in the bedroom windows and it was further augmented some time later by having the bedroom door fully open now look what's happening between C and E you have a tremendous difference in the air change rate that is obtained in the same bedroom keeping the door open is very good it helps to dilute the bedroom contaminants so even if you're talking about rooms within a house and the type of spaces that you'll be spending more time like in a bedroom in the night and that sort of space is keeping the door open your naturally ventilated building or a house appears to be much better than keeping the door closed and then if you can augment that further with exhaust ventilation so you got a bathroom exhaust that gets turned on or you have a kitchen hood that's also turned on at an appropriate time then you notice that the a change that improves even better so this is just to give you an idea that natural ventilation by itself will not be very effective unless we are able to direct that air into the house either by proper openings on different sites facades of the house or augmenting that with more assisted with better extraction through bathroom exhaust fans or kitchen who would extract I'm going to take you through another example this time in a tropical setting typical setting that a lot of us in Asia would be familiar with you got a an apartment high-rise apartment where you have a lot of multi split system fan coil units the split system units basically DX direct expansion driven and if you look at this particular slide this is a an apartment master bedroom where you have the opportunity to make use of an exhaust fan that is fitted in the bathroom window so this slide is something that I I like to discuss it's again part of something that we did but something years back and what you see here is the measured co2 level on the y axis and time on the x axis there are two parts to this experiment that you're seeing here the first part is about a very focused experiment where we had people occupying that bedroom just to provide carbon dioxide as a buildup of tracer gas if you like so they offered whatever co2 build-up could occur and then they left so the the for adults they left and as soon as they leave you notice that there there is a sort of a drop in the co2 DK and that's happening because we need two things we did one where there was no exhaust fan in operation and then another experiment with the exhaust fan in operation with the fan on you find the ACH the air change per hours but 1.96 almost to the other one is one-sixth it's about 0.32 so clearly having an extraction we know from first principles from our understanding it would help and here is the case where it was clearly proven now we take it further as an experiment into the night the entire night as experimental duration we notice here that remember it was occupied by two adults the child the build up about six to seven hours it features about 3,000 BPM and that is not unusual a lot of these buildings do have a fair amount of air tightness because buildings are being increasingly made airtight from energy conservation which is a good thing to have but it also leads to buildup of contaminants and in this case co2 as as an indicator that we are looking at and notice the game in the exhaust fan is switched on the decay occurs quite rapidly so the benefit of having an extraction provided in the bedroom or in the house itself like in the previous case that we saw in the heating season situation it helps so two examples one from heating season one from cooling season just to lay the background that we need to understand what's happening in naturally ventilated residential buildings and especially when we start to enclose them and start using other means of environmental control for thermal comfort a quick kind of brush overview of the standard standard sixty two point two most of you would be quite familiar with it depending on the floor area the dwelling floor area and the number of bedrooms our dwelling we have the ventilation rate in terms of videos per second on this slide and it is very clear in a for any given area well in floor area if you have more number of bedrooms you need to provide more ventilation that's understandable because when you have more bedrooms and you've got a sort of closed some of the dough's you want to be able to make sure that there's at least some ventilation that can reach different parts of the dwelling so this is just to give you an overview of how the ventilation rate is provided as a provision in the standard if we look at the european standard the sense standard sixteen seven nine eight 2019 version what you're seeing here is a design delta c or two that means the co2 level above the outdoors and if you take the outdoors has about 400 ppm so this is telling you how much more above that you can have in the house and the European standard has both the living rooms as well as the bedrooms and you notice here the bedroom requirement is a little bit more stringent in other words you need to actually have a better ventilation provision in the bedrooms in order to be able to keep those co2 levels lower since standard also has extraction air flow rates the sort of thing that we discussed earlier for exhaust ventilation and again you know this year depending on the number of rooms and whether you have a kitchen exhaust your bathroom exhaust other wet areas toilet there's one in dwelling or two or more in drilling you need to be providing a certain amount of extraction rate in meters per second and that's what this slide gives us an overview I'm going to run through the next few slides as a sort of broad literature review based overview of what is it that people have studied in the past in the last shall we say 15 20 years perhaps the x-axis here are different references different literature reports or journal publications let me be more clear on that and the x-axis or y-axis in this case of the co2 level so the idea that I want to portray here is what sort of co2 levels have been measured and reported in these studies and you have the triangles tell you the red one is the maximum and the green one is the minimum and the circle the blue circle tells you the maximum of mean and the one the one with the circle and the cross that's telling you the mean so you got the let's look at the mean values to see you can get some general idea of what's going on there are 780 and 1350 line that you see here this comes from the European Standard because the European standard does provide co2 sort of number that we can look at when it comes to residential buildings as I was showing you in an earlier slide so you got cooling season and heating season the left is cooling season the right of heating season and this is naturally ventilated buildings and there several studies reported and you is that the main co2 values are generally lower in the cooling season and also the heating season perhaps but then you naturally went 18 buildings you got more of them probably in in sort of levels that are below the 1350 ppm of course you do have some where it exceeds that no doubt about it this is the mechanically ventilated buildings it's also equally good because then you have mechanically ventilated buildings you would find that there's a clear provision mechanical provision of bringing the outdoor air into the rooms into the bedrooms we are specifically looking the bedrooms situation here that's what this all of you study was done about and again you notice here that the main values are much much lower than the earlier case with the naturally mentholated buildings so the env as we would expect with the mechanical ventilation makes things much better we now look at the air change rates now notice that the air change rates again as comparison points I've got the pink numbers 0.2 and 0.7 that's coming from some kind of estimate based on the ASHRAE provisions in terms of how much ventilation we need to provide so 0.2 is on the lower side and 0.7 is on the upper side that's kind of a range within which all those different dwelling areas the number of bedroom based when relation based comes to and the purple of blue lines blue number that you want to call the 0.4 there change per hour to 0.7 that comes from the european standard the same standard now you also see something above on this plot that's the orange numbers though two point nine two and the one point two this is for the bedrooms now the european standard the same same standard actually talks about air change provisions for bedrooms in addition to what they mentioned about the whole house so you notice here they're four bedrooms the requirement is much higher and that's simply because you want to be able to maintain a much lower co2 level in other words have a better winter provision in the bedrooms so the three numbers that you see for the Europeans the higher air change is for the category one building this is the the best class best-in-class building and then you had to at the one point two sort of thing that's gradually decreasing in terms of how you look at them as as kinds of buildings so if you look at the bedroom ventilation you you notice here in terms of a change per hour pretty much most of the studies reported don't get there and and they are quite low compared to what you would expect based on the European standard but then again if you start looking at what is generally seen for national event in your building something like 0.5 0.6 a change per hour in the heating season you notice that a lot of the means are about that number or slightly you know within that number so there's a lot more that one could expect to accomplish in naturally ventilated settings in heating season especially and also in cooling season if you look at it there's a lot of the means that occur in the line above the zero point seven even and that's that's probably because in the cooling season or in the in the tropical settings the more water settings you're probably gonna have more of your windows and doors open in the house you have your help to you aim to achieve a good cross ventilation through the different rooms and the house or in the apartment mechanically ventilated again you notice here that in the heating season a lot of them are much lower the means are lower and if you have the you know cooling season the mean that means seem to be slightly in fact most of the means are mean values in terms of AC are the air change rate are much better so comparing between the seasons one would it one would want to think that in the cooling season you probably got you're probably diluting or flushing your house more frequently more often in comparison to what might be happening in heating season situation I've got two more slides in this point of discussion which is a change rate in the whole dwelling we were looking at the bedrooms and now if you look at that dwelling the whole house as a whole and then here you find that comparing with similar lines the pink ones of ASHRAE 62 point to base numbers estimated change rate numbers and the purple ones now the European standard as I mentioned earlier again in the heating season you notice that not-not-not all the studies reported is the ours that were even hitting that sort of 0.5 sort of number that at least you won't expect to achieve and the cooling season it turns out to be somewhat better in fact considerably better in some of the studies reported and that's mechanically ventilated buildings again you'll find sort of means within about 0.4 0.5 the heating season and the cooling season obviously it's been better with with this sort of all of you based on the literature information about what we see in buildings and residential buildings in terms of the reported exchange rate and also the buildup of co2 which can be used as an indicator of how good a ventilation is we get an idea that in a lot of residential buildings unless we make a concerted effort in ensuring that we have ad to come into the building either through mechanical ventilation good amount of mechanical ventilation or if it's naturally when data's buildings add them enough open the windows enough or if we have other means to ensure that you have a good cross ventilation we may not actually be able to get ventilation as main means of achieving dilution so which is something that is important and we need to be mindful of so I'm gonna sort of go towards the end of what I am talking about I okay I wanted to go through the ASHRAE code 19 preparedness website just to give you a little bit of a flavor of what you can see there on the residential building site and here if you notice we have on the website on the Asha website you've got general guidance applicable to all homes and something that mentioned in different kind of aspects as we went through the presentation maintain normal thermal comfort conditions increase the ventilation rate and I think that's something that we should be hoping to achieve through some concerted effort operate the exhaust France and that was very clear and we saw the benefit in some of the case studies I reported I showed you earlier I probably didn't talk about specifically on the air cleaners part and that's something we can look at and we should be looking at if we don't have ventilation in the house or in the specific room we would have to look at our standalone air cleaners that can help to achieve and clean the air within that room so that if you have sort of recirculation happening within that room you you keep the air quality in some level of reasonable control increase room air motion this is something that we need to be mindful of and ensure that we have good circulation of air movement this also helps in achieving thermal comfort so something that we need to be bearing in mind there are additional guidance for homes with forced air systems we're talking about high efficiency filters was spoken about earlier but the bill and look as well operate system continuous me bill spoke about Yui GI radiation systems something that will help and that can be part of systems that that are used in buildings residential buildings as well multi-family homes specific recommendation or guidance water seal in plumbing systems in the bathrooms and toilets important consideration maintain pressurization again depending on how we want to maintain the pressurization you want to keep a building in pressurization or want to keep it in isolation depending on what the situation might be there are some clear direction and guidance provided and I would urge participants and urge those who are interested to also go and look at the ASHRAE residences FAQ questions we got 21 questions posted on this site as of now I am part of the residences residential team and this is something that we regularly meet and discuss and try to provide updated information about how one could handle in the present situation specific to the residential buildings so in conclusion let me just say a few remarks here I discussed with you the principle the regulation in terms of what happens in the heating season what happens in a cooling season and some of the measured data in terms of co2 and the exchange rate which gives us a good indication of the type of ventilation that we have in these type of buildings in these type of climates ventilation in residential buildings like a review of literature studies several studies that have been done and I've tried to pull them together and put them in the context of naturally ventilated and mechanically ventilated buildings and in different climates heating and cooling season to give us a sense and I think what emerge from there is in heating season the naturally ventilated buildings may not really reach up to the level of a change per hour that we might want to achieve at least in some cases it does but in some cases it probably doesn't and unless a concerted effort is done through some means of directed targeted ventilation air to come into the into the house or into the bedroom and so on in cooling season if we keep the windows and doors open in the house we are probably able to achieve better a change per hour as you saw in the review of the slide slides more of the cooling season studies the main values were generally better as compared to the heating season studies but if we close those when naturally ventilated environments in a cooling season in a tropical climate and we use air conditioning which just recirculate the air then we do have an issue where we need to be mindful of that and go toward some kind of regular Yanik airing and and flashing of indoor contaminants very briefly attributes with residential ihq guide on the Asha website and we would have you would you would find more information in terms of specific questions on the FAQ part on the residential side on the same website with that I will conclude my presentation and thank you for your attention okay thank you very much for the very good informations and now we have a finish for the free presentation and we are going to cut into the Q&A sections so I will also like to thanks all the free speakers for the excellent time control so that we have about ten minutes left for this Q&A so for the Q&A part what I would like to do is we will show our faces some speakers and I'm trying to show my face as well [Music] [Music] so in fact we have received some questions already from the registration forms and I have the advantage of a red food of the reservation form and find out that there are some really good questions that have been raised by the audience so I I would like to make use of those questions to answer the speaker's what response and these are the appreciate or question that we have selected but the first set is related to the use of UV light HEPA filters and ionization energy systems and there are three sub question naturally come from Peru which try to ask about the use of UVC spectrum in air conditioning systems and the second one is from India which are about HEPA filters in with how to remove corona virus and the last one on the set is from Spain in Europe whose answer for why Ashley is not so interested in ionization technology has compared with huge E is mentioned by appeal for this kind of the question we are asked people maybe you later and so these always fall into his comment yeah certainly I'd be happy to so the first question I'm assuming that what's being asked is about putting UB inside of an air handling unit which is one of the options and that can be quite effective for disinfecting air but the the limitation of it is that the amount of treated air that can be provided is limited to whatever air change rate the system can provide so if you have a Vav system maybe that's a six air changes per hour more or less less if you have a Vav system and the load is is turned down so it can be effective but we haven't seen a lot of transmission virus through air handling units and if you have a high efficiency filter there there may not be a lot coming through that filter on the other hand if you put up a room inside of a space that treats the contamination in the space more directly and I think that in the current situation is is more recommended the second question about will HEPA filters remove corona viruses yes HEPA filters have been tested on viruses and the size range of corona virus but back to the point that I made earlier that's really not the important dimension what we're really looking at is that the size distribution of droplet nuclei the residues that are formed from respiratory aerosols and filter efficiency is very good for those people tend to think that just because a HEPA filter is rated at 0.3 microns or by Ashley 52.2 we only rate down to point B microns that everything below that is not filtered and that's not true it just isn't tested in the rating and the diffusional collection efficiency should actually go up the third question why is Ashley uninterested in ionization technology and focuses mainly on a new BGI well let me just say that about 15 years ago the UV industry was sitting about where the ionization industry is and they we're telling me why doesn't a Shrey have much interest in in UV and the reason was that they were sitting on the outside of the x-ray instead of being on the inside and they said well instead of complaining why you guys form a TC and and really in a non-competitive free competitive objective way developed that technology within ASHRAE and they form TC 2.9 and now we have to hand book chapters and to standards and we have evidence assembled that gives ASHRAE confidence that technology works and I would invite people who are interested in these other electronic ear cleaning technologies to come in and work from the inside of ASHRAE and one more thing I'd say an answer to this is there's actually a rigorous literature review on electronic air cleaners in progress right now ASHRAE is extremely interested because of the level of interest in the public and when that's published I think we'll have a good explanation for why ASHRAE has the position that it has on the level of evidence currently thank you thank you I believe that the ionization technology we also need more technical discussions technical committee can be formed in nursery to look at how it could be applied in these sort of situations we can now refer to the second sets of fashion which is relate to general issue at is this some of this general issue is so happened that loot in your presentation you have mentioned about a new way of reaching offices and how to get people crowded places to be free from the harmless so there are some question raised people from Indonesia I think they are in a very critical situation at this moment so they are worried about actually system change in this era of endemic or how to repeal new normal for all the building operation to create healthy environment for everyone would you like to comment on this can hear you yep good we can't hear you you have to turn on the turn on the mic oh okay because okay mute myself now you can hear me so yeah you know no you know in the short term there's most of the buildings will be limited to what the building has then in the longer term maybe their changes they can make for example you in the short term let's say if you don't have enough static pressure from your fan to overcome a stronger few doors you may be limited to maybe increase outside air or other things in the longer term if you can adjust the fan and not a measure maybe you can put in a stronger future but then there's also a to longer term is look into the future forward looking into the future what are the elements could be coming and as we mentioned you know in the pub and you know in the initial just now maybe one of the things is focus on the particulates in the air that know not only just endemic but also fire but also other issues and think about you know maybe a mur 14 food is actually a good place to start and during this time of course if you want to change future the caution is maybe there are elements in there though like what you mentioned earlier chances are there's we do not know the entire truth yet the chances are the majority of the virus is in the droplets but nevertheless it's pouring cautionary to wear proper PPE Percy DC guideline to do some of this measure in the in the short run when we have to take care of the field of changing yeah thank you thank you lute for the comment I think not only HVAC systems and also architectural design and also many other building elements we are looking forward to a new normal to be set up future yes Burton yeah what I've been thinking we talk about is funny in a way because North America in your North American majority of the toilet doesn't has a leak but in Europe majority of the commercial toilet actually has a lead so we are talking about simple things right should we think about least in toilet you yes I agree okay we also have the first set of question related more scientifically to arrow so the deposition of arrow salon services no matter is inside lead or you know Henry OHS or in other building surfaces people are wearing about these are therefore they are looking for the most effective ways to minimize this Rousseau's contamination actually we have question from bazzill and one person from Singapore they were in the empty out the mast transceiver array system in Singapore and I believe that he's also some worried about his arrow so contamination may be a contra would you like to respond to this question from Singapore and Brazil well I think I think it goes back to the transmission modes that bill was talking about earlier he's very clear droplets the the larger sized droplets say you know the less than 100 microns 2200 microns you know they won't fall by gravity the larger the size the shorter is going to fall so within that 1 meter Vista that we're talking about a lot of the droplet might settle but then you have the smaller sized droplets 5 microns or smaller even much smaller than say the submicron particles like 0.1 and that sort of size less than what micron I mean so they could potentially be in the short range the 1 to 2 meter range but there could be airborne so I think we are still trying to understand what is happening even within the 1 to 2 meter distance in terms of the transmission board there is droplets there is airborne drought that's happening within that range and then the droplet settling on the surface the one that you just mentioned somebody touches in the for might transmission so all of these things are happening continuously in all kind of I suppose in closed environments so Luke your your slide was very nice a very first one to outdoors 7,000 something indoor so that that that tells it clearly so you have more chances of catching something from within an enclosed environment on all I personally believe a lot of us believe in all the woods and it's very hard to differentiate which one is contributing to the most transmission probably the droplets I wouldn't disagree with that thinking that in the short range between an infected person and you know a susceptible or a vulnerable person you could have more of most of the droplet and the contact motor transmission but think about even within the context of a room you have a room say about 8 meters 10 meters distance you could have short-range airborne transmission I mean we would probably call that more like medium range it's not something that's going through your ductwork and coming back into the space but within that space itself the eight meters 10 meters distance you could have airborne transmission happening and some of these droplets could actually go for it further than the 2 meter distance and settle on to other surfaces and you could have for mite and contact transmission so I think it's an interesting science it's an interesting field that we are all in and we're beginning to appreciate how important it is for for our human I suppose activities whatever we do and I think each of us as we take different I suppose go through our activate daily activities we exercise caution at the individual level we follow guidelines or guidance provider at the country level I mean if you're asked to stay home we just stay home and there's a good reason for that so you minimize all the chances of some of these primary modes of transmission kicking in and if I mean remember elimination or source I mean you don't even give a chance for the source to happen for transmission to the individual we can talk and discuss about this thing from a variety of perspectives but I think in this particular case that's a CoV to case the droplets has been probably you know responsible for a bulk of the transfer happening that we know of so far but I think this is reasonable I suppose thinking that we could have that there could be the other modes that we can't rule out at this point in time so we need to be mindful of how each of this or maybe collectively of all the different modes of transmission are happening together it's probably a kind of a long answer to a short question that you asked but I'm not sure what else we could do at this time then be aware and and be mindful of what what we can do on the individual labels wrong answer Chandra Frank thank you very much for your answer in fact in order to control the virus for example in some public transportation system for example in Hong Kong and I also saw in Singapore they are using some blue light on the rail of the escalators and also they use robots to run around the place in the shopping centers in order to clean up the place before people get into so we may need to take different types of measures I need to control these aerosols contaminations yeah I heard about that blue blocks the UV robots going down during unoccupied hours but yeah I've been staying home I haven't gone there and seen it myself the next next epidemic disease may have different characteristics and so these things that we're doing that cover all the possible transmission modes I think are leading us in the direction of where our standards may wind up in the future yeah I think I think one point I would like to add here Sam is I think all that we have learned so far and it's still continued to learn with this pandemic with this corona virus is also putting us - putting us in the context of how can we build the resilience of building and the systems in the future today is the corona virus maybe tomorrow we have had the issues of haze in the past in California you had the Morris virus and the outdoor pollution at times so they could be episodic driven events that may warrant us to go in a certain way and I think unless the system's the building systems has the inherent resilience to adapt itself we I don't think we are going to say that you design something and put it in place that's going to function the same way all the time right that that could be that could have energy implications so I think we are talking about really resilience and design resilience in buildings which is probably the way to go that's part of the new norm in my view point forward I think that it's it was strangely prescient Curly's coincidental that the two main technical areas emphasized in the new ASHRAE strategic plan which was written before the pandemic started were indoor environmental quality and resilience and and here we have both of those things coming together absolutely okay excuse me we are coming near the end of these repeaters and in fact we try to show our faces of the speakers and moderators at the end of the Q&A section make sure that we are not robot we are not artificial intelligence in conducting this happiness so I hope that there will be more discussions in different forms in the coming futures in x-ray or in some other societies so here I would like to thank all the speakers for your effort and time span and we have a very good discussions near the end but unfortunately we are not able to satisfy all the questions raised during this webinar but we will try to read it and respond or maybe put it in the FAQ on our SP websites they don't so that people can reveal other people refer to it so once again I would like to thank the speakers also the ASHRAE staff behind the screen which they're supporting us in this past few weeks in organizing developing these events and at the same time of course without the participants participation of the audience we have more than thousand audience attending and maybe a some other will be watching this video later on at home and I wish you good health and safe at home like what Changjo is doing in singapore and we look forward to more information provided for mastery thank you thank you thank you for thank you thank you Sam organizers you

31,lr6bsE-G978,CNA Insider,Living With Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) | Strangers In My Head | Mental Health,2021-01-08T12:00:30Z,"Youthful and outgoing, one can hardly tell that Le Yong battles with a mental health issue. Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is an under-diagnosed condition, characterised by obsessive and intrusive thoughts of perceived flaws in a person’s appearance. Unaware of this mental health disorder at an earlier age, Le Yong has had cosmetic surgeries to correct his perceived flaws. However, surgery has not fixed his body image issues. 

Every day, Le Yong needs to make an extra effort to manage the distorted image he sees of himself and the feelings of shame for having these obsessive and ‘vain’ thoughts. As he feels the pressure to measure up to society’s standards of what it means to be normal and the perceived expectations of what a man should achieve, Le Yong dreams of a simple life free from BDD.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",when i go to the mirror right i see a very broad and short face and it changes like i can see different faces sometimes and i'm very unsure of how i really look like i think about my face all the time like two thirds of the day will be based on my appearance i feel upset disappointed hopeless ugly woman like that i wanted to end my life because i think i'm too ugly for the world [Music] i'm being seven this year my name is laura young yeah i'm suffering from body dysmorphic disorder i think there's something wrong with my space abnormal i can check up like 50 times a day in the mirror not to soften anything but to confirm my flaws see sorry you know some people might feel their hands are dirty they wash their hands and afterwards they feel their hands just clean right i'm like washing my hand but it's like never clean i perceive myself as a mentally sick patient i perceive myself as somebody with loss i always talk to my mom yeah or ask her if my face isn't okay or not yeah because you know i i'm always seeing different faces right so i don't have a stable body mage so i'll check with her okay okay okay no no it's okay okay but honestly speaking right when people give me assurance it doesn't help i'm obsessed with what i see in the mirror so if i see that it's short it's broad it is what i would believe in people would think that this is vanity this is a childish way of thinking but it's so real to me [Music] i was desperately looking for help because i feel lost i feel really ugly hopeless depressed i'm not making much progression i'm really on so much medication so i found out the disorder caught body dysmorphic disorder from the internet and it describes me very well and how i feel is that at least i'm not alone it's not a mystery it's something treatable [Music] how has it been like um for the past few days since our last session the checking is low oh okay yeah oh 12 15 times and that's it okay 12 to 15 times in the last few days like just now i just went to the toilet i had a negative feedback from the mirror i saw a face that's very broad and short and it feel a bit uncomfortable about it yeah like disappointment was set the worries are so strong and um just so prominent in all aspects that it can really be quite debilitating for them and oftentimes like um what ends up happening negative feedback recently there's more positive feedback there is still negative feedback so i believe this is a number game the more i check the more higher chance that i will have for negative feedback and that's why ultimately we want to work towards reducing the mirror checking so there used to be a lot of mirror in my house so my parents they remove it you know there used to be a lot of mirrors in the living room in the toilet they remove it so i went out they tried to make me check lesser every single day almost every minute you're thinking about the passive flaw yeah and then it's always at the back of your mind no matter what you do only sometimes when you also might fall into something like doing what i like to do like cooking then i will stop thinking so i believe everybody have these sets of mental capacity to do everything in that daily life but i have to give up quite a big portion to to my symptoms the distress caused by the bdd is so intense that i cannot function properly this i work in dignity kitchen i'm working as a cook learning how to cook i used to work for work for them few years ago but i decided to try try out the society so i went out to work by myself and see how far i can go yeah and then i feel yeah and i feel very bad about it whatever he does you want it fast you want it perfect you know he has very high expectation of himself like even after work in the evening he will text me so hey can you be harder on me can you not give in to me because if you keep giving to giving to me right i may not be able to to to improve you know oh i want to get things done properly if i can't do it properly i feel like i'm lousy so like if i can't cut something in in a more uniform way manner then i'll feel bad why i can't do it okay if i'm not feeling okay i can take a break anytime i want to which if you go out and work you don't get that kind of treatment and especially in the workplace format right people just want you to get the job done they don't care how you feel or how sick you are so people like me i don't have a place in the society [Music] that very young age when i was like secondary school started it started with my nose every day i think about it everything the moment i wake up before i sleep everything i keep thinking that people are laughing at my flaws everywhere i go like every laughter every staring is on my floor so i actually had my nose done three times and after the third time i'm finally happy about it but then the bdd moves on to something else which is the shape of my face [Music] and you get sensations you get sensations over that perceived loss which is very disturbing as well i just you know suffered quietly i i don't know who to tell because i don't know what i'm suffering from i don't know what's going on and i'm embarrassed to tell yeah i hide it from my parents as well body dysmorphic disorder is often overlooked because firstly there is little awareness of it and on top of that there's just so much of worry that they will be misunderstood as being vain or narcissistic and this really prevents them from from coming forward to seek help remember last time i shared about um there's this image of ourselves that we have in our mind right do you recall that yeah yeah so um the image is is often something that um we kind of have even without looking in the mirror so it's let's say if you are sitting over here now um if you're not looking and we're not looking at your reflection there is still kind of an image of how um you think other people see you like right now it's very strong ah okay why why do you think like right now those cameras there's your eyes yeah the camera is watching one more eyes from you yeah yeah so it feels like there's a lot of people like looking judgments my head right now yeah yeah and and this is what you're thinking about i feel like running away actually because there's so much that that is going on right being part of this documentary i actually feel that i'm given the chance to create awareness about body dysmorphic disorder but i'm worried that what i see in the documentary i i don't like it maybe i'll see just my flaws yeah so it's a bit scary i want to go to the toilet yeah i'm going to go to thailand now okay all right okay do you think maybe i won't be cool no it's okay yeah i'm fine they're quite disturbing yeah yeah it's distracting to have the camera yeah the ugly image is very strong i went to the toilet i get a negative feedback um he's always been very afraid of seeing himself on film on on camera especially with that being taken by somebody else okay he has got little control over how the picture of video looks like the important thing to keep in mind is that that's not how you really look that's how you feel but is it helpful to focus on that image no not not helpful right yeah how is the filming process been difficult for you uh you know this anxiety of like oh i'm gonna be filmed how will i look in the film so maybe the day before i i get nervous i can't sleep [Music] i have physical cravings i have a dust for alcohol every day alcohol will make my bdd worse because my mood will be affected after i drink i want to cut down the amount of alcohol i'm thinking because it's taking control of me life for me right now is like a roller coaster a lot of up a lot of down sometimes i feel like i'm okay completely fine sometimes i feel like i'm in a trash because i'm not progressing i'm not doing things that i think that i need and i want to do [Music] so what's next what do you want to do now just get myself as skilled as much as possible learn what i can learn as much as possible you want to start a story if i can start also definitely i want to but right now i don't if i'm capable my dream is to sell laksa yeah and let everybody eat my laksa actually if you can get a good luck start i can actually help you to set it up for le young the sky is the limit why i say that he has a very good personality in terms of selling sales and everything second thing he's a perfectionist he like to do things right or don't do at all that is a very good personality third thing he's hard-working if it's not for bdd he actually will do very well right i'm gonna have it you follow exactly what i do it is the part where you do the chopping right so adaptive using the tip only when leon shared his dream about being a hawker i'm both happy and worried because being hockey is not easy an average hawker probably works like 10 to 12 hours and he might not be able to take the stress of long hours and if he's manning the stall himself right and the time where he need to cope right you need to walk away and that's the part that is worrying don't tear the skin yeah this is where it splits i'm trying my best to go to work every day trying to let not my mode affect what i'm doing so all these are small little practice that is going to help me in the future okay thank you all right but i don't think i'm doing that well at the moment because sometimes i skip work when i feel bad i avoid getting myself more frustrated or stressed because that will cause my symptoms to pick so sometimes i choose not to go to work i think i'm not that confident to start a hawker by myself at the moment because i'm still in the mess [Music] i'm jealous of people who are healthy and then they can mingle around and make as much friends as possible you know and be happy but i can't because i feel that i'm very ugly i think that when i talk to them right they will look at my flaws i cannot engage in a proper conversation in that manner so it's very upset thing for me when i know that i can't do it yeah and then i avoid it [Music] so basically i just go out by myself you know regardless of what i'm feeling or thinking when i'm getting a negative feedback from the mirror just be myself and do my things and then slowly you you again that confidence hey mother how are you huh since you have this kind of situation then you shouldn't be forcing yourself to work this is cinema like i feel like everybody can do it then i can i can't do it like all right it's okay take your time jackson is my best friend yeah he he saw my meltdown he know that i'm suffering from some mental conditions and i actually feel safe when i talk to him you know when i'm around him i feel safe as well if you remember that day right on birthday i don't even saw it actually i show one of the girl magic trick but i didn't manage to get her a contact you know also wasted she seems nice you know i think i know i think on instagram is it this one oh no yeah yeah i have relationships and it all failed that's why i'm not married i want a girlfriend by skip i think it's me i think the relationship feel because of me i i feel like i get very paranoid because i think that there's something wrong with me physically that's why this person don't like me or behave in a particular way i don't think of myself how really am i going to take care of other people you know how people can accept people like that they don't have a proper job i need a lot of acceptance and which people around my age it's really more than that right like you are doing so well they're always shocked i admire jackson because i think he's doing well in his career in his relationship he can manage his life he can drive a car so it's like the ideal person that i want to be like just socialize a bit more tomorrow we'll not have dinner drop by i'll let you know yeah let me know okay are you okay with that are you trying to get a good image uh should we turn it should we turn it off again it's better if you've done it i turn off okay okay this is better okay now we're smaller because there's uh so much uh you know hidden uh secret suffering out there that it's good to hear from someone like yourself a lot of people are afraid to seek help a lot of people have like a bad impression on mental health when you look at yourself in the mirror what do you actually see i think that will give us a better understanding of what your experience is like i'm very bothered by by the width the width of my face from this area to this area i will keep comparing with like celebrities or pictures that i see on people around me and when i do that i feel that my face is too wide and too short have the people around you like reassured you about the way you view yourself is not the way that other people view you okay i'll tell you who did i ask for assurance the most that's my mom i always answer is my face okay or not yeah and then she always tell me hey yeah okay does that help in any way i would say it helps but just for that short period of time when you ask your your mom for reassurance how do you feel afterwards sad i feel sad [Music] like why should i make my mom feel this way i made my mother cry for behaving in a particular way saying nasty things when i'm feeling down who wants to see that kid suffering do your family members are also preoccupied with some other things maybe not a body per sale could be uh maybe like washing hands actually i'm the only one i have a elder brother and a younger brother they they are normal but i'm the one that's sick yeah one thing i teach the students strong is that um we don't like to think so much in the categories of normal or not not normal so i i like to think that you're also normal but you have an experience that is very distressing okay i want to be as normal as i can so i try to be as normal as i can but i realize that i have a lot of limits like i cannot get frustrated once i get frustrated my symptoms will pink if i didn't sleep well my symptoms will pick if i drink too much the next day my symptoms will pick so there's a lot of difficulties to live like a normal person i think yeah and i've never experienced living as a normal person right can you crazy what you see there ugly huh ugly why my face so ugly my face was short so white you feel a bit depressed when i saw the clip of how i look it doesn't feel good i think it's ugly what it's done is done like we cannot reverse and i already decided to put this up then we're gonna put it up no matter how bad i think i look so do it just do it i'm cool okay yeah before the family i'm quite i doubt myself i can't do it a lot of anxiety going on off negative emotions but after i did it actually i think i feel quite good i want to create awareness for people yeah so it's something i want to do it's like a goal early little goal and i did it to me happiness is like having a healthy mind being able to experience things around you like a normal person you know when i cook i feel happy [Music] i dream of for life free from btv i'll be so carefree i'll be a lot more functional a lot happier i want to support my family i want to start a laksa store i want a simple happy life [Music] what's up [Music] ,False,False,False,False
32,AitOwSzDeV0,Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,[ATS] COVID-19: How will increased tension on US-China relations implicate the region?,2020-04-30T04:33:16Z,"US-China relations are at an inflection point amid the COVID-19 crisis. The crisis has exacerbated bilateral tensions associated with the trade war; mutual recriminations about the spread of the COVID-19 virus have made it hard for the two powers to cooperate in combating the global pandemic. How will this mixture of threats—stemming from the pandemic, as well as economic and geopolitical competition—impact on the security and prosperity of Asia and beyond? 

Join us for the second episode of our virtual panel of Asia Thinker Series (ATS) to learn more about these challenges and their implications for the region.

This ATS Special Edition Ep 2 event was live on Facebook on 28 April 2020, and is supported by the Singapore Global Network - connecting Singapore’s global network of family, friends and fans. Join us, as we grow our network. 

Interested to watch more such videos? The third episode of ATS Special Edition will be live on LKYSPP's Facebook Live on 6 May 2020.

LinkedIn University Page: https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=42060","[Music] good afternoon my name is Bert Hoffman I welcome you to this special Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Asia thinkers seminar I am the director of the East Asia Institute at NUS and also a professor of practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School and this great pleasure for me to chair today's discussion on the theme of kovat 19 how will increase tension in us-china relations affect the region and the world and I'd like to acknowledge support for this seminar from the Singapore global network which is a division of the economic development board we hope to have about 1,300 viewers online which is fantastic it's also a bit complex I can't reach out to you individually so if you like to ask questions please do so through the comment section on the Facebook page I'm sure people know what that means and if you can specify whom you'd like to address the question to on today seminar at The Cove in 1910 dynamic is first and foremost for human tragedy and we are more than three and a half months in there is three million people that have been known to have been affected by the disease and more than almost 200,000 people have died of the disease and I said we are we are not through it yet the measures needed to contain this pandemic have also affected the economy crazily and the IMF projections which came out two weeks ago projected this year will be the worst year on record since the second world war in the decline in economic activity as projected will be worse than the global financial crisis twelve years ago this would be a great time if super powers were to work together if China and the US were to work together and help the world solve this problem because it is a truly global problem unfortunately kovat 19 seems to be more of a catalyst to increase the tensions between China and the United States what that means for the world what it means for finding a solution for covert 19 but more broadly what it means in the longer term for the world economy and for global and regional cooperation we discussed the day to discuss these questions we got a fantastic panel and to start we have mister he doesn't want to be called professor anymore mr. Kishore Imam Rabbani distinguished fellow at the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore is the former founding dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former senior diplomats for Singapore we also have professor Kong eventful the vice dean of research of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the lee kai-shing professor in political science and last but not least we have professor Alicia Garcia had a role she is the chief economist of natixis investment bank but she is also an adjunct professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a senior fellow at Virgo Institute in Brussels Kishore you have just published a book with the provocative title the usual provocative title and I see a pop India has China won obviously you wrote this before the pandemic started but what is your take on how this pandemic will play out in this very big fight this competition between China and the United States over to you thank you thank you very much but and I want to say it's pleasure to get together with you my friends even for me and this year to have this discussion and I want to thank Dean dellacroix for once again inviting me back to the Lee Kuan Yew School the school that I'm very and I want to begin by saying that I would have been very happy if the United States and China had decided that since they both faced a common enemy called it 19 and since the enemy of your enemy is your friend I would have been very happy if the US and China said let's take a strategic pause let's focus on covert 19 and fight this together it would have been very good for the world would have been very bad for my book because they were shown there's no moral context sadly the opposite has happened and as a result what covet 19 is done is to X actually aggravate the us-china Joe political contests when it should have actually calmed it down and so it so in sadly has confirmed the fundamental thesis of my book that a major geopolitical conscience has broken out within us in China so what my book tries to do in India in some ways I'm trying to be helpful to the United States because I say in my book that the United States has made a fundamental strategic mistake in launching this major geopolitical contest against China without first working on a comprehensive long-term strategy and actually the man who gave me this insight was Henry Kissinger at a luncheon New Yorker I had within two years ago and I believe that it's in America's national interest to work on such a comprehensive strategy and to build on the advice that soon served very very wisely gave he said know thyself know thine enemy fight a thousand battles win a thousand battles and what my book shows number one is that the United States does not know itself now we all know about the great strengths that the United States has in fact I begin the book the fictional memo who Xi Jinping documenting all the strengths that America is but at the same time America has developed some structural problems as Danny quar is documented it's the only major developed society where the average income of the bottom final 50 percent has gone down over a 30-year period at the same time America has become a plutocracy as I demonstrate and America has become a society that is incapable of making u-turns and adjusting to new realities for example if they're serious about China being the number-one adversary what they should do is stop fighting in the Middle East but I can't stop so that's an example of the rigidities that America has accumulated and at the same time the second part of since the strategy is Nodine enemy and most Americans know very well all the structural weaknesses of China in China as you know like any other society has got many weaknesses many challenges and they're real and they have to deal with them but what most many Americans are not aware of are some of the fundamental structural strength that China has developed man one example I give is that the Chinese Communist Party and I know this is a very controversial thing to say has effectively become a meritocracy where the best and brightest China and I when I was in Columbia University two years ago my research assistant was a graduate student and she said when she graduated of high school she was so sad she was number two in the school because if she'd been number one she could have joined the Communist Party right so that's an indication are the best and brightest joining the Communist Party and at the same time the Americans must recognize that the return of China is the return of a strong civilization which was the number one economy in the world from the year 1 today to a year 1820 so the return of China is perfectly natural it cannot eat so at the end of the day my advice to go the United States and China is please think again it'd be better for both your people you cooperate especially now against Kotick 19 thank you thanks for sure and I'll come back to you just to ask you later on whether the strategic cause are still feasible what needs to happen to get there because I like the notion very much but let's first talk about the economy part of the fire so be sure I said well covet 19 has added fuel to the fire of the strategic competition part of that fire is the economy part of this fire was the the decoupling that some in the United States firstly of course law as a strategic future for China and the United States aneasha tell us what what does pro vat19 add to this equation well first of all if we had we would be sure that this is really just going to put more fire into the strategic competition between China and the US but it's also going to add more fire to that idea of the coupling and my impression is that it might come from both sides because it's going to become more and more obvious to China that the decoupling is unavoidable we may talk about interdependence so you know I would use the word decoupling more carefully in the sense that there's no such thing as full decoupling it just can't happen but we're going to see increasing difficulties in the way we run that interdependence and this is just part of that demonstration of of the strategic competition so we've moved from the very obvious trade war which was basically dealing with the surface meaning import tariffs to a more complex impact of that trade war and increasingly covet 19 on the value chain on the global value chain that's centricity that china has played for a long time in that global value chain being basically diminished not only by the US Japan is a very good example even the European Union simply because it's become crystal clear that the dependence on China centricity of the value chain can also bring some problems if push comes to self and this is of course medical devices another very very obvious cases such as the automobile supply chain for example at the at the peak of the who base part of the copied 19 outbreak so beyond global value chains this something that frankly speaking not even in my worst nightmares I could have imagined which is the deep globalization of people-to-people movement which were seeing in a way of course forced partially by copied 19 if we may want to put all of the blame on copy 19 but I think beyond copy 19 so we can think about the way students may be shifting from the US as where the way workers in Europe may be shifting this is beyond China so you know we're seeing some structural characteristics of people-to-people deep globalization that go beyond China but we certainly affect China in its talent pool in the way it we did you know it reacts or it relates to the US and and I would argue the West more generally and of course the the tech strategy competition we had been seen unit rate work is there to stay we just have very very obvious cases or continuous cases of this type of the globalization or let's call it to ecosystem that increasingly do not coexist but exist on their own and finally a very very tricky and very dangerous type of legal the globalization that we may be seen as a consequence or or I would say accelerated by a cop in nineteen although not started is financial this integration and in particular the decoupling of China's companies listed in the US let alone us investors tapping the Chinese market were started to see signs this might be increasingly dangers from both sides so as an in a nutshell from trade to global value chain from global value chain to people-to-people and tech in the midst of it plus potentially financial the globalization so yes I don't think Kobe 19 has brought lots of I would say unintended consequences or maybe intended that that's the whole point we don't really know whether this is just coincidentally an opportunity for the US and China to keep on pushing into that to those two ecosystems that they seem to be more comfortable with at a current juncture Thank You Alicia you informal as they say here in Singapore if two elephants are dancing the grass gets trampled but do you see an upside for the region do you see some of what would your view is to fall out of this big strategic competition what's the fallout of Kovach in this context but do you see an upside for the region as well thank you thank you very up side probably very tough let me just focus on the downside first there and I'd like to try to get to your question by making three points the first point is about the timing and the political strategic context of the kovat 19 crisis the timing of this pandemic sucks there is never a good time for any pandemic right especially one on the scale and with the mortality rate that we are seeing but being inflicted by it now it's like being by what I call the triple whammy from a geopolitical point of view the pandemic couldn't have come at the worst time for us China relations first whammy is the year-long trade war that has strained us-china relations and the pandemic as all of you say have made matters worse and that is one reason why US and China has found it so difficult to cooperate second the trix war itself was a symptom of a larger dynamic namely the shifting balance of power from the west to the east something that Kishore has done so much to document the u.s. reaction to this can be seen more starkly in the security strategy document of 201 7 and the defense strategy document of 201 II where the US has basically identified China as the strategic rival crucially for the US this is a rival that espouses values in the Michael to the core values of the US and for that reason it has to be confronted third remy is where six months away from a US presidential election and these three contextual factors lead me to my second point as the curve flattens people will ask what happened there will be enormous pressures in the US and perhaps Europe to assign blame and to seek accountability the blame game will pick on an extremely impassioned character because of the huge casualties and the economic level if we look at the u.s. over 20 million people have lost their jobs a million infected with 56,000 victims this is about the same number of Americans who were killed in the Vietnam War except that in the case of Vietnam it happened over 10 years whereas for kovat 19 this is occurring in the space of four months sir I expect a huge reservoir of accumulated anger in the months ahead that will be directed at the source of the pandemic a key weapon that the Republican Party in trauma do is to deflect blame focusing on allegations about China covering up the pandemic and not being transparent about the casualties expect this blame game to intensify as the US elections approach and even Joe Biden the current forerunner the Democratic Party nominee nominee I think was the trouble sidestepping this the main danger of the blame game however it's not that it will lead to direct u.s. military confrontation rather it will make relations so tense and Trust so low that it could spark larger conflict and that leads me to my final point the implications were Southeast Asia I think it leads to the unwelcome dilemma of being asked once again to choose between the US and China on the issue of whether to assign blame and if so who's today as many know in recent years most of the ASEAN countries have repeatedly said they do not want to put to be put in this position of having to choose between the US and China but that's the cases of the TPP the a IIb the Bri and Huawei 5g have indicated sitting on the fence has become increasingly difficult both the US and China will bring pressure to bear on Southeast Asia to sign with them in the blame game I believe the majority will not support a probe or investigation of the kind wanted by the US and his allies in in fact muslin ASEAN will give China the benefit of the doubt more importantly foremost in ASEAN and beyond the issue is not whether China Calla things up but once the pandemic dokgo which societies did best its containing the spread and in saving lives the other performance bands will be who will recover faster economically and while the jury is still out on this one I would not underestimate America's economic resilience and the technical and technological ingenuity but if China were to do better than the US on the economic front its narrative about being the wave of the future will follow unreceptive years in Southeast Asia I think I'll end there thank you thank you very much grateful okay I think we can debate this point on what Southeast Asians or what the world thinks about the role of China in containing the virus I mean some would actually put the blame on China for losing quite a bit of time at the beginning and making it a global a global issue but let's let's let's let's step back and see whether we can work on solutions and I I go back to key Shores notion the strategic pause can we have a strategic falls in this in this international in this competition the strategic competition between the US and China and what needs to happen to get there Kishore well I I must confess to you that you know since I spent I guess almost 50 years analyzing International Affairs I find the first rule to follow is to be as realistic as possible and I believe that the momentum that has developed especially in American body politic too was China and you know it is quite amazing that 9 in 10 Americans today see China as a strategic threat that's amazing statistic and if you did you visit the United States today is actually very difficult to get any kind of a balanced debate and so that the likelihood is especially in the presidential election year you already seen that both Trump and Biden are competing to see who's tougher on China that's very very clear so I think we will see a very bad 2020 the best we can hope for is that after the elections are over and let's say for example if Joe Biden wins I expect the temperature to go down a little bit the competition will remain but a Democratic administration especially if you have the previous officials we used to work with Bill Clinton with Barack Obama I they come back they know you have to maintain a balance between competition and cooperation with China if you want to deal with global warming you're going to deal with global financial crisis and so on and so forth so I my unfortunately I feel very sad making this prediction there will be no strategic pause in 2020 let's hope that there's some kind of strategic pause in 2281 human form you mentioned the US election do you agree that that would be an opportunity if there were to be a change in the guard and the you asked them over time at least buying by next year there could be a strategic cause or a different direction in this competition could be too late for covert 19 I would agree with Kishore part of the way that in the event of a change to a democratic administration and with the old hands people like Campbell coming back that will probably be a more moderate approach to China but I would also like to point out the situation of what I call there is a structural issue here and the structural issue is basically China is catching up very quickly with the US on the military economic technological and even cultural front and that has raised some very serious fears in the u.s. of the kind of Kishore just talked about and what that means is that the structure of the international system especially in Asia I see it as a written bipolar where you have to and the powers contending for on the leadership position and that is the thing that that that is the dynamic that seems to be driving the competition so this will be a long-term structural competition but in the end it doesn't matter who is office because there are certain things that the US and China can cooperate together but with this particular administration that seems a little bit more difficult okay well let's let's go to those in a moment in a moment on those areas where the US and China can call rate but also what role SAR can play in this region organism let's first go to Anisha because the corporation in a way aside from the to and fro on who caused what covet 19 the corporation on the economic side hasn't been the g20 and together two weeks after the w-h-o called for a global dynamic and then put together a package which was amazing my jury took six months it took six months in the global financial crisis before the g20 got together and went for coordinated approach how do you see that is on the economic side is there more cooperation possible then on the the geopolitical side the strategic side well first of all I would be I mean while agreeing that our bar is 2008 we're okay on global cooperation we have had quite a few conference unfortunately late has been cancelled so it doesn't really necessarily show that optimism but beyond that I think the measures I mean yes the five trillion it was just an ad thing basically national fiscal stimulus without by the way in number four China which we are all still waiting for so you know eat the Esper point to the fact that that the two major Germans aren't necessarily cooperating within that framework that would be it first of all my my take on the g20 and the very obvious case is it's a very needed recapitalization of the IMF which we rarely discussing and where I don't think we'll have you know much agreement as the US will probably be very reluctant to accept this anytime soon so on on global international corporation I would be more cautious but I would add to the complication that I think both agents are looking at how weak the other side is in the light of a structural deceleration which both are going through in different ways so how much that structural deceleration will be pushed further by copied 19 is the 1 million dollar question from both sides will China be weaker or will the u.s. be weak both will be weaker but how more how much more how much will occur will each side be for the other to take one step further that's where we are is literally game theory here so I think from the US side their call is that China's finances and I frankly quite agree with that the problem is I also agree with the fact that the u.s. is also put in a lot of you know issues on their on their debt given what you know the massive stimulus they're going through but from the US side I actually think that they see China's structure growth as much lower and as some you know because you've been working on this rightly so so they really wonder for how long do they need to put up with this for how long will China continue to be able to finance that in the innovation that is indeed catching up but it's basically very much that driven let's not forget this so for how much long will China be able to catch up without basically pushing growth so low that their disposable income which we already see in the day that will no longer grow and you know social issues will start up here in maybe not of the type of the West but surfing out with the support that the party may have today so I think that's the bet who's going to suffer the most and more quickly and and and that is indeed why in my opinion both sides are pushing both sides are pushing for the other to be weaker rather than cooperating for both to kind of save the boat if if I may say so yeah I agree with you that that both will come out weaker to some extent I do believe that if you want the u.s. optimism of how much weaker China will be is exaggerated and China has its dynamism and its ketchup potential that will be there irrespective of God but but you know you give them the g20 basically I don't know b-minus c-plus in terms of cooperation but more broadly the the covert 19 is now spilling over into international organisations and the cooperation of in those international organization most prominently of course wh oh and the US has threatened to withdraw funding Kishore whatwhat what is your view one is this is the international organizations the really are a product of the us-led International order is the UN shooting itself its own fault or are we expecting a change of mind down the road the international organizations still based yeah the mainstay for us power yeah well I very sad that the United States that decided to attack and detect out from the World Health Organization at a time and we are in the midst of a major global fight against Kovach 19 which is stressing all 7.5 billion people but at the same time if I had to give one small practical piece of advice to policymakers in Washington DC I think one practical question we should ask themselves is you know in the past whenever the United States took any initiative remember everybody would rush to support it you know with what Joseph Nye called soft power they were all Russia's about the United States but what's interesting is that this time around when the United States for example attacked the World Health Organization move on not one country and I think even the European allies of the United States were quite shocked they said hey what's going on here and even one of the most prominent American citizens the richest man in America Bill Gates said I'm going to keep on supporting the World Health Organization and I think therefore having launched this attack on World Health Organization the device for the analysis to strategic calculation of which countries are stepping up to support them and at the same time frankly I also hope that wiser people in Washington DC will point out that Kovac 19 is not going to be the last virus 30 more such viruses coming it's inevitable so what should we do over the long term is strengthening the World Health Organization it has I pointed out in my book the great convergence you know 1971 62% of the financing of the World Health Organization from compulsory mandatory contributions you can make long-term plans of the base 3 that's down to 18% and that's frankly a result of Western initiatives because the restore the funding back up to 63% and I think the United States tries to listen to the rest of the world they don't find the rest of the world actually wants to work with the United States to rebuild the 1945 boost base order which I'm not emphasized was a gift but west to the world it's not these are not Asian institutions he's how Western institutions and fortunately all the Asian countries want to support it yeah it isn't it quite okay I share your frustration I am still wondering what a distance by and large a Trump factor or whether this is is whether there would be a bilateral consensus in the United States I'm turning away from WH oh I doubt a second but but we can come back to that human form you said so there's lots of areas where is that can still work together as as superpowers but but here in the region ASEAN is the big is the big organization to work together how has he had been doing and income at 19 have been played a role and how do you see them working in the future in the context of this continued strategic competition between the US and China I think there was a reason ASEAN meeting in which there was some talk of cooperating on the kovat crisis but I think we'll have to wait to see what comes out of this this suggestions so and in terms of if you look at what the regional initiatives that ASEAN is involved in from the TPP to what we call the RCEP what is interesting about this economic initiatives is that the TPP excludes China and the u.s. is not in right and the our set will include China but not the US and RCEP some people say may actually come into fruition at the end of this year although Japan may be having second thoughts about it given the commitment crisis because there are other things to attend to so even on regional economic cooperation now it doesn't look all that promising and in terms of our audience role between the two superpowers in the first decade after the Cold War Austin was really in a good spot in playing the role of an honest broker by setting up institutions like the ASEAN Regional Forum and so on where they could bring the two big powers to the region and for them to a buck on the side if there are problems and issues and that really helped alleviate tensions when tensions are rose but my sense is that this this has become much more difficult for ASEAN to play that role of the honest broker or you know be in the driver's seat of something like the ASEAN Regional Forum because precisely because of the looming geopolitical rivalry between the US and China in the sense the US has found its built-in barrier and once that is you know in train I think it becomes very difficult for small to me the powers to play a mediator role between the two okay well should we get a few more minutes left for discussion among ourselves then we turn to the questions we got a lot of questions I won't be able to go through all of them but it's great to have to have them lined up Alicia I'm going to turn to you for the funding for the final preliminary and that is on the economy the question is are we there yet do we see light at the end of the tunnel is there a good pathway out of this this misery that second part is going to be terrible are we going to see how do you see that I couldn't well if we if we just use the IMF while you cannot make out me look like a wonderful v-shape and I will be out of you know out of this one by 2021 but I need to remind the audience of the assumptions behind certainly my assumption behind that we shape recovery which is that first the West gets out of this situation by this quarter so you know there's not much time left basically in two months we have to be out of any type of lockdown the second one is that there's no second wave the third a very very important one is that there is no such thing as financial crisis speed on the corporate space weed on the sovereigns face or perhaps why not a financial institution I think that the financial institutions probably are less at risk and they were in 2008 but corporates are because dollar debt the corporate world is very very high and and we all know that we're going through a global dollar shortage of some sort and on the sovereign side I go back to my point on the IMF and on the hundred countries that have already requested financial assistance for which they saw the 800 billion dollar at hand so you know all of these things have to happen which to me reduce the likelihood of a bishop recovery very very clearly and I would add that that's true not only in the West but that's true also in Asia and in China yeah the hundred countries asking for a system that's four times as much as during the global financial crisis just anyway that's right all right well we got the question and I some of them I just get her as one question but sometimes I can identify who asked the question and one is from Jeffery C and as how I should the UN it's really four Kishore how should the u.s. manage this situation in their interest so Kishore you have one minute with newly elected President Biden I'm not very hopeful for Trump but that one minute three like who is elected president by presently like man what are you gonna tell him how should the u.s. manage this in their own interest well I I would tell him that the United States should pass itself a very fundamental question why has the average income of the bottom 50 percent gone down over 30 appear why is there as to Princeton economist case and Deaton have documented a sea of despair among the white working classes so there's some fundamental social and economic problems within the United States within American society so the wisest thing that United States could do is instead of spending three trillion dollars on an Iraq war is going to complete waste why not take that money and bring that money home and use it to have the American people so it so the primary focus of the American government should not be to try and preserve American primacy because American Pie Mercy's making the American people pay a big price maybe temporarily even just focus on the American people improve their well-being improved their welfare and if he does it he won't be much is one of the greatest presidents ever in the history of America okay I I would I would take the same advice Michael one has a question and it really is one for you on phone once it does set on covert 19 will China be more respected or less respected in the region what is your take several sovereignty issues will be important in that ledger one of them would be the extent to which the international community sees China as not having been transparent and not having shared information early enough so depending on how that judgment you know our ghost it will affect on us Chinese standing so that's one factor that I think in general I think that's the sense that China could have been more forthcoming on you know and faster so but the other issues that will be important will be how the China doing containing the endemic all right so if it is you know if this judge China did a very good job that will say quite a bit about the performance of the Chinese government right and especially in contrast to others who may not has a perform as well in terms of a number of lives you know are saved so and then finally I think that also mean the issue of the recovery from the economic problems the IMF has predicted that China will probably have a growth of one percent this year whereas the US will have minus five point nine percent right now if the IMF is white then it would seem China would be on to a stronger recovery and I think a lot of trading partners East Asia would notice that because as the rest of Southeast Asia East Asia seek to recover they will have to think about who they'll be trade with so in that sense who recovers them who's more wrestling economically between the two superpowers now well play an important role in the future economic spending among the people who are looking to see who is going to give them their lunch in this Asia practical as always in that context of Asia one of the questions here on funking you is at the WTO clearly just before we saw the demise of the arbitrary arbitration panel or at least a pause in the arbitration another not enough arbiter is three to two to two mana panel and basically the video out of our function at the moment do you see them play a role if you look at if you look at the impact of kovat on world trade it's absolutely astonishingly bad it's minus 20 to minus 30% in in global trade can the WTO in this context be a catalyst for reviving trade and reviving cross well for me for a long time before copied 19 and the collapse in trade I've always thought the WTO was already history to be frank the Titanic I used to call it so imagine now I mean the U has tried to revive as you know the arbitration through its own mechanisms and invite other countries including China actually to participate but you know this very day it's very hard to arbitrate trade when trade is collapsing because it's just you know everybody on its own he's on her own so I I just don't think a any type of arbitration is just basically two people we had what we would need to to foster trade would be liberalisation and that's something that since no how we are waiting for so you know for since the Doha round so I don't think that's something you can do in such a difficult time and I'm sure we learn from Great Depression how hard it can be I just want if you allow me to add something to this idea of China as the third part of the equation how China's economy will do so that others prefer to jump on that owed yes growth wise obviously but of course they the base is different yeah I mean China was growing 6.1 percent last year so basically the reduction in growth although it's still bigger for the US I fully agree is still very very massive for China and in fact if we just focus on March data which is very very scary to be frank retail sales have collapsed in China - 16 percent real responsible income - 4 + so we just have to realize that China may grow but it might not grow for the rest of the world growing is not enough for the reservation China needs to import and the key question is will China import or will China keep whatever growth is left for its own for its own so so I fear that even the very difficult circumstances China is going through China will try very hard to keep that growth for itself keeping very little for Asia that doesn't mean that the US will do better but I'm just saying we may have to be realistic about how much China can actually offer to the rest of Asia at least in the short run 2020 2021 and very very clear also that China will not come up with this massive stimulus as we saw in 2008 in 2009 which frankly helped restore growth for the rest of the world not gonna happen there's too many domestic problems in China too many issues with the financial sector with corporate debt with household debt it's going to be much much more gradual on that though only on the longer term growth we have a question from from Ernesto Ernesto Brown Kishore you you seem quite optimistic about the long term for refrige for China now others would say look you know the the state let's centralized an industrial policy guided a model that China has children has doesn't have a proven history it has never worked for the long term growth versus a more liberal competitive market based system where should where does she run to miss um come from for the for China well that's a very good question but to my friend Ann esto I would say that that reflects the perspective of history that is based on what was the norm for for the past 200 years when the more open liberal societies in Europe and United States took off and succeeded but before that for 1800 years the two largest economies were always those of China and India and I will say that if China tried to come back on the basis of Western formulas on how to run China China could very well fail but if China decided to go back into its own history and ask itself when did China really do well and the answer is unambiguously clear that's only when the center is strong that the Chinese people benefit and when the center is weak the Western powers have disowned the 19th century came and trampled all over China so in the case of China having a strong central government is a necessary condition for their success but more importantly you also have a Chinese government that number one for the first time in 4,000 years he's utilizing the brains of 1.4 billion people for most of Chinese history a very thin silver sliver of minds were being used in Chinese history now there's one point for begin before and as they have also improved their livelihood so much that if you read my book I quote the Stanford psychologist which says that if you wanna pounce of a society if you want to feel pessimism go to the suburbs the inner cities of the United States if you want to feel the pulse of optimism you go to China so clearly China is doing things that are fundamentally right yes you can't feel but consider the possibility is it safer to underestimate China and then be completely shot when assembling more powerful China emergence or is it safer to overestimate China and if China succeeds and let me just make a very simple point if the average Chinese can be 50% as productive as the average American China's GNP your mathematics will be twice the size of the United States now I believe that the average Chinese can easily be 50% as productive as the average American maybe even 75% maybe 99% so what kind of economy are you gonna have so let's be yeah I'm gonna emphasize I'm making very realistic projections this is not wishful thinking this is on the basis of a deep understanding of the forces that are driving the revival of China this year you see you frowning would you agree with me Kishore just said I thought you wouldn't see me frown in that such a pity well I have to add something as an economist that you know first of all you're absolutely right labor productivity in channels been very high even for China's GDP per capita so so we are all aware of the in industrious nature of Chinese which is great but is more for for potential growth to continue because we have to remember we're talking about a very high base you know China's potential growth post let's say it's about five you need that productivity to show to increase every year and it not only labour is also capital and that's what I want to put you know most of most of the emphasis for that you need capital to be allocated properly and it's not really about having a central government and only which you can have with private ownership you can have you know let's say France has a very centralized government which doesn't mean that you need to go full fledge with state of ownership of every major center every major sector so I think they commit the key for China to keep that potential growth really is about increasing labour productivity which indeed it's happening although I have to say is coming down and maybe this is because it's increasingly difficult to do to do better which is what has happened to the West you know once you organize your population is not too difficult to be more productive once you are there how do you increase further but the most to me the most the key question mark is how you make your capital allocation more efficient how you make your investment more efficient for that road to remain as high as it has been so far and there I'm frankly very pessimistic on China's long-term growth rate not because and I'm not trying to say that's bad news this is what has happened to every country that has actually developed including south including Japan so it wouldn't be any failure what I'm trying to say is that we don't need to think of China's failure to imagine a China with a much lower potential growth it's just a natural process that's all okay there's a very famous article by Len printed and others who says good policies or good luck and you see the rich countries have had a lot of luck or which countries have it not a good policies well you need a combination of both China's there was a lot of a lot to grow needs to grow four or five times its current size too to match if you want to per capita income of the United States so they need a lot of good luck but they can also make a lot of policy mistakes along the way we're running out of time I have one very quick question for you and foo and that's building on the on their last question will the experience of kovat 19 and if you want how China's handled this will this be an advertisement for the China model will there be a backlash against democracies in Indonesian comes from cement at war you got one minute to answer but can you repeat the last part will we see the Democratic neck sliding in Southeast Asia as a result of the cope at nineteen crisis and the good the relatively good performance in managing the crisis by China it is a trade-off between performance and individual liberties now to the extent that there has been a lot of talk about the way that societies like China manage to contain the spread of the virus was to very invasive technologies right which allowed the government to track where people were going and so on it is an issue I think for democracy it's not just in Southeast Asia but also elsewhere but in the end however I think a lot of people in Asia will focus on what works if you can keep the casualties down I think they will appreciate that and apparently this is also happening in Europe although you hear voices you know stronger voices of protest in a way that you know you hear less of in Asia because of the focus under the community all right I think this is a question that will be debated for a very very long time we're out of time I have many more interesting questions left unfortunately I have to go to my speakers for the final remarks and let's start with Alicia well the ultimate outcome in terms of this strategic competition between China and us will not be resolved out of committee 19 this is just all the very important just one more drop in the ocean of a situation that basically is there is there for us to just is there to stay we just have to get used to this and I think ultimately there may be no winner I think frankly in my opinion this is going to to harm the - people are going to realize that they've put their own interests before the solution to a global problem which is a pandemic and therefore both are going to come out weaker out of this thank you very profound conclusion you had from your last words one I think there might be a way out of the geopolitical competition between the US and China and that's something that was implicit I think in waukesha say earlier and that is the extent to which the u.s. knee would be the predominant power in Asia right and analysts have raised the question whether the u.s. is willing to share power in Asia with the rising power namely China and I think that is something that the US has to work through because today if the u.s. is willing to pay less attention to the nature of the systems and treat nation states in terms you know of them as cognition squad nation states there might be you know a way to work out in terms of a sharing power and influence in the region and I thought in China I said in any hurry to displace the US as the reigning hegemon he sure in final word very quickly you know I began by talking about why I think it's important for the United States to do a kind of strategic reboot its long-term strategy we see China one one person that frankly Americans look at very carefully he's the man who formulated America strategy in the first quarter walls mean what George Kennan and let me just give you four examples of advice he gave in dealing with a much more hostile Soviet Union he said number one focus on our domestic spiritual vitality man at the end of the day is what's gonna win the battle gets over human number to cultivate friends and allies very important number T amazing me even be severe the Soviet Union and he said don't insult them because we still have to work with him don't insult them and number four the most important piece of advice and say be humble it is interesting in 1949 George Kennan said all of this I think what George Annan said in 1914 wine he stood Berry in 2020 so thank you I suggest we sent a very long telegram to both Beijing and Washington on that note I do there is did an opportunity to work together and if not undergo vat19 missed the trigger the largest economic crisis since World War two when would cooperation be possible I've had a great discussion thank you so much for for the participants Alicia a quiche or human foam thank you so much for the great questions that came from the audience and I do hope to follow up with some of you in person thanks to entre media for man this very sophisticated setup that I do not understand and thanks to the Singapore global network division under the EDB Singapore for supporting the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Asian thinker series good afternoon good night and thank

This virtual program, part of our 'Beyond COVID-19' series, was held by China Institute online on April 7, 2020. Learn more at: www.chinainstitute.org","hi everybody welcome to this webinar james heim oh it's the president of China Institute and it's a great honor to welcome all of you for those of you who know China Institute welcome back for those of you who are joining us China Institute has been around for 95 years founded in 1926 to help Americans better understand China through education our new culture through business and to current events like what's happening now we've been through all kinds of disruptions we've seen all kinds of Evil's but one thing China Institute does believe in is collaboration engagement that doesn't mean we have to agree with everything that goes on in Beijing or Washington but it does mean that we have to figure out ways to work together because we believe firmly that China and the United States are probably the two most important countries to occupy this planet for the next chunk of time and the things that China does and the things that the United States does have a tremendous impact not only on those two countries but on the whole world so we're delighted to welcome a perspective from Asia as well as a North American perspective I just want to put a little note in and say you know China Institute has been on site we've been on site in Washington Street now for nearly five years of beautiful new space and we are transitioning to the example of that from on-site to online so even though our physical premise is closed at the moment we are very much open we're very much here making sure that we are helping to Shepherd the dialogue and I just got news this morning our Center for Contemporary China which is going to be a beautiful space downstairs on the ground floor Construction will move ahead as soon as we get off this pause that's been imposed on us and everybody else in New York and in the country so that's some good news anyway you didn't come here to listen to me we all came for what's going to be a fascinating discussion today with Kishore mah Bhavani Allyson and I moderated by Rana Farrar so without further ado let me pass it over to our director of programs did Elliot who's helped put this whole thing together hi everybody I'm didn't Elliot director programs as Jay mentioned and we've launched a series of mini series of programs to look at the world during and after this crisis and today our first as you know will look at the rise of China and what it will mean for navigating new world order next week we're doing one with Chinese young Chinese restaurant tours and delivery service entrepreneurs who are trying to retool in an effort to survive the crisis and the week after that we've got Wang Yao who's the president of the Center for China and globalization talking with penny the president of once young USA about business tactics to survive the crisis and what the business landscape will look like us-china collaboration and what the business landscape will look like after the crisis so I really hope that you will tune in to all of these programs and much more to come um a little quick housekeeping note we will take questions at the end and what you do is at the bottom of your screen you will see an icon that says participants or attendees and if you click on that or I think you click on raise hand at the bottom and if you raise your hand at the end of the you know towards the end when we take questions from the from the audience you know we will call on your call your name and then you'll be able to ask your question in person I am delighted to report that we have more than a hundred I think 110 115 people on this call today which is very exciting and lots of thought leaders tuning in so thank you all so much for joining and it's now my great pleasure to kick off this series with two of the world's great public intellectuals Kishore Marvell Bonnie and Graham Allison moderated by one leading journalists of our day Rana through our key Schwartzman Singapore's top strategic thinker for decades he was a close advisor to Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and has served in many top government positions including ambassador to the United Nations he's written many books most mostly controversial and my dad and his latest has China one has just been published I want to give a very special shout out to Kishore for agreeing to do this event in the middle of the night in Singapore so thank you for that Kishore Graham Allison has taught government at Harvard for the last five decades he was the founding dean of Harvard's John John F Kennedy School of Government and was an assistant secretary of defense in the first Clinton administration Graham's latest book an international bestseller called destined for war sparked a seminal debate about whether the United States and China can avoid the soudanese trap in which the ancient Greek historian postulated that the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta made war inevitable Rana Faru Faru heart is global business columnist at the Financial Times and CNN's global economic analyst her book makers and takers the rise of Finance and the fall of American business explains why the capital markets no longer support business and her most recent book don't be evil how big tech betrayed its is is don't be evil how big tech betrayed its founding principles and all of us we are so thrilled to have these thought leaders take on some of the big questions of the day so Rana we will message you at around 140 when it might be time to take some questions from the audience and over to you Rana thank you so much great great thanks so much tinda thanks to Kishore and Graham and thanks to everyone who's joined in it's really an honor and a privilege to be able to moderate this conversation so it's been just said we're gonna speak for about thirty minutes or so we're gonna open up for questions probably have a vibrant conversation and let me just start really I mean it's hard to know where to start because there's so much right now but right into the crisis I mean even before Kovan 19 we had a situation between the US and China a shifting global order that was encompassing every possible kind of change geopolitical change change to the global economic system security now we're in the middle of a health crisis which is really shedding widen and perhaps speeding up some of the changes that we're already coming but I'm wondering if both of you can take a couple of minutes and just kind of sketch out your headline thoughts about what the virus is telling us about the place of both China and the u.s. in the world right now and the changing global order so t-shir why don't we start with you and then grandma come to you well I think the it's as you know to early to tell what would be the lasting effects of kovat 19 but one thing is definitely done is I think it has aggravated the us-china geopolitical contests which has already begun and in some ways what this this crisis in revealing the lack of trust between the two powers also indicates the problem that is coming our way and that's as you know is what my book as China one is about and I think one of the key points I make is that in some ways the United States has made a big strategic mistake in launching this geopolitical contest against China without first thinking through a comprehensive long-term strategy and how to do with this I say it's an inside given to me by Henry Kissinger it's an insight that comes from reading George Kennan and George Kennan for example pointed out when the Cold War started you know there's some things we must do you're gonna take on a big contest we must maintain spiritual vitality at home cultivate friends all over the world don't insult the Soviet Union and be humble and what's interesting is all these tenets of advice that George Kennan gales which in the NRA work for the United States and the Cold War are being completely ignored today and on top of that that is obviously a major misunderstanding between the US and China because for Americans this whole contest is black and white good and evil Communists and democracy but China's crying Griego today and this is the key point we want to you must try to understand is that China's goal is not to promote communism globally China frankly has no interest in which society becomes communist or non communism there's no interest in that what is our fundamental interest to them is that they want to overcome forever the century of humiliation that is sub when 400 years from the opium of 1842 to the establishment PRC in 1949 and that those wounds are still alive and well and I mentioned that because some of these wounds are opening in this Kobuk 19 outbreak and so for example as you know when the newspaper calls China does real sick man of Asia it just brought back horrifying memories of how China was trampled upon so when you have a crisis I covered 19 what he can do it I can either here and bringing people together oh you can bring out or reopen painful wounds again and that's what I feel of it 19 is doing to the world today and add to that and also if you have any kind of intelligence about whether there is communication at the moment where there's there's any kind of coordination between public health officials in the US and China any kind of discussion so thank you very much let me first say it's an honor to be here with you then the others at the National Institute and with Kishore whom I've known as a colleague for many years and they've learned a lot from and I like the idea of folks from Singapore or offering strategic insights I think he's following in the footsteps of one of the great strategic thinkers there our lifetime Lee Kuan Yew so that's just a start I think coronavirus is like a flash of lightning that illuminates landscape for a for a flash for a moment that allows us to see some of the contours that are normally obscured by by the dark and I think that in my understanding of the big picture here it's just what you're asking for that I'd make three points first coronavirus is an existential threat to the most vital interests of the USA which is the survival and well-being of Americans simultaneously it's an existential threat to the most vital interests of China which is the survival and well-being of its people and in this case it opposes a threat that neither state can defeat by itself so we discover in the reality of coronavirus that if China succeeds in stamping it out all together and it's rampant in the US for some time they'll be reentry so the second wave in the third wave so this is a place that emphasizes that there's a shared interest that we have to address for our selfish of selfish interests that's the first point secondly this is layered on top of structural realities that cannot be denied so the big picture that I try to develop in my destined for war book is to say look at the structural realities which actually happened to the seesaw of power in each dimension and there's no question that China is the meteoric rising power that has it rises it impacts positions and prerogatives Americans have become accustomed to at the top of every pecking order for a century in American century and that this is a classic lucidity and rivalry with all that entails and then there's a big tale to that but it certainly entails as you said it or is it as was said in the interim a substantially increase of increased risk of war real deadly bloody war maybe even catastrophic war so that's the that the second point and the third point is then if we imagine that you had rational adults running both the US and China I know that would be a bold bold assumption but if that were the case if either faces a existential threat it can't defeat by itself even if they're in a through Cydia live--ah bleep kid could they find their way to some version of partnership even a limited partnership or what I have written about as a quote rivalry partnership taking a page from ancient Chinese wisdom that end up in the treaty that the that the son developed with the liao in a thousand and five that only provided a century of peace so I think there's a three big ideas and I think how this settles will be unclear the hope that somehow this will lead us to set aside all our differences and get back to engagement and cooperation as usual is naive the photo the rivalry is baked in to the structure of the relationship on the other hand the notion that either party can deal with either coronavirus or with climate disruption or indeed with risks of nuclear weapon by itself is also naive so can we find our way I think it's possible that this could actually help motivate could be a learning moment for building what what a cheesy simply call for a new a new form of make power relations okay that's that's a great point and let me just say I'm gonna ask a few more questions but you all should feel free to jump in respond to one another redirect if you like let me ask one more question before we move on to kind of the bigger broader long-term structural shifts that are underway let me ask one more virus this is a big question and key sure I'll start with you the title of your book is how has China won and I'm curious in the context of the virus and the handling of the virus how do you see that I mean in some ways it is illuminated both the strengths and weaknesses of the systems in China and the US and China you know trying to come under fire for opacity in terms of communication at the beginning of handling the virus on the other hand they've been able to implement policies that have gotten it under control very quickly in ways that European countries and the US has struggled with these are the issues that we face in the liberal democracy so has China won in the context of the virus and then below blow that out you know beyond beyond that topic if you like and Gramm feel free to jump in well let me say that actually is for me it's an honor to be with Graham he's the Guru in the relationship is not a mission it was a pleasure to be you right now but I want to emphasize of course and by the way that we are really in the as I say in the thick of battle in the fog of war we have no idea how copied 19 is going to end right now I think anybody who thinks he knows what the ending is this is of the city building himself this this could either become much bigger or settle down or whatever it is you know but as of now if you take a snapshot of where we are I think kovat 19 has reinforced some perceptions that were sort of growing of China and of the United States and in the case of China and frankly the rest of the world was beginning to accept the reality that this was not going to be a sporadic communist party system that something very dynamic and very vibrant was happening to China and structurally if you look at China today it is is a very basic thing for one before thousands of years the Chinese never utilized the brains of eighty to ninety percent of their population it's only in the last 30 to 40 years but massive education access to health access to modern world now 1.4 billion people's brains are being tapped and the best are being funneled upwards to a very careful meritocratic system of selection so at the end of the day you get you get the quality of mind in the institutions which is absolutely remarkable and the professionals who deal with their Chinese counterparts amazed at how well inform and how clear they are into thinking about many of these issues so what's happening in the United States is that you have a very efficient meritocratic government and which is initiated which are right it's stumble in the first phase of dealing kovat 19 but once it picks itself up my god if you just took such dramatic action of closing down a province of 60 million people two days before Chinese New Year believe me that shocking hmm you know it's like closing up United States two days before Thanksgiving it doesn't happen yeah so that's the kind of dramatic action they take that's a meritocracy and in the case of the United States sadly Kovach 19 is then brought up the structural weaknesses that have developed in American society and the sort of d legitimization of public agencies the seraphic the scorn put on government and remember Ronald Reagan's famous statement government is not the solution government is the problem and so what has happened is that the United States has not been sucking talent into the government sector and so all the government agencies are struggling you all your talent is going to banking to finance and to consultancy and so on so forth which is wonderful if everything is going fine but the minute you have a crisis like this when you actually need better government agencies to deal with it then all the weaknesses are beginning to show so as of now you asked any reasonably well-informed person in Africa in Latin America and Asia I can tell you by doing my friends in Asia absolutely shocked at how unprepared and how in some ways how chaotic the response of the United States is being and if I can put one point very very delicately it's actually quite shocking that it was the West that exported modern science and technology to the world but there's far greater respect for science in China South Korea Taiwan Hong Kong Singapore then you see in the US administration they're a kind of remarkably ignorant statements are being made at the highest levels and even last question and they said how can how can that happen so clearly as of now I would say clearly this china standing in the world has gone up and the United States has gone down seven so I would say yes and no so I think it's complicating but there's no question if you took a snapshot today and did the balance sheet that in terms of numbers of new infections and numbers of deaths China has been more successful than the US and I think watching the US ones often dismayed at the incompetence or the floundering or the inability to come to grips with things so I agree with that secondly I agree with Kishore the most the most important truth about coronavirus are the uncertainties so we are in the fog of war today this is not over nobody knows how this ends and so the this is I compared it to if this were a war against coronavirus as President Trump is the clear we're in the first phase of a war so then third I believe your point is exactly right that this helps illuminate some of the systemic strengths and weaknesses of the two systems one a partisan autocracy and one a democracy a decentralized democracy but also in particular about these two governments and their capabilities and I think they're key shows proposition about the ways in which Americans have disinvested incompetence in government for the one hand as China as invested is evident for anybody who engages with Chinese officials and sees what their competence is what their capabilities I also agree with them that the ways of which China has harnessed its talent of for over these years after having so many years wasted it is quite remarkable when all that being said I subscribe to a proposition at the most the world's most successful investor Warren Buffett frequently repeats he says nobody ever made money in the long run selling the u.s. short let me say it again no one ever made money in the long run selling the US short so I think it remains uncertain what happens in the second inning the third inning in the fourth inning and I just remind you this from a historical perspective in general democracies do not do very well in the first innings and we rented the Revolutionary War in 1776 Britain wins if you attended world war 1 before the Americans got there the Germans will if human ended the the European war before the Americans arrived which you almost did Hitler would be you would be speaking German great points and I love that you're bringing up these historical analogies they're so relevant right now um whilst I don't want to disagree with Warren Buffett I'll be a little bit of a contrarian and say you know if we were ever going to be talking about a post American world a post dollar order this is a good moment to be talking about that I mean we have a situation now in response to this crisis where the u.s. is on track to have an incredibly enlarged debt and deficit picture you know for years we've all been talking about how oh my gosh post financial crises China grew the biggest debt bubble of all time well the u.s. is now growing a you know if not comparable and pretty but by our standards a pretty big debt bubble arguably not as well equipped to handle that at the same time you've got all these trends that were happening already China and many other countries wanting to move to a world that is less dependent on the dollar less dependent on American leadership the decoupling that was already underway now being put on steroids and in case you're going to your point you know might have been nice and you have to have an administration that thought about the fact that you know we're getting 96 cent of the antibiotics supply chain from China before starting a trade war whatever whatever one might think you do seem to have this bipolar world developing now so if you all could both take a minute I know that's a big question but kind of sketch out for us what are the key things we need to be thinking about geopolitically and economically in that new more bipolar world assuming when we're not really going to reset to the 19 which I think probably all of us would agree with three three quick points firstly I completely agree by the way actually Graham that it's unwise to bet against the United States in fact my book begins with a fictional memo to sheesh in pink saying we have now begun a great struggle against the United States of course we will win but whatever we do we must never estimate this country and to give you one one line I use in the book I say that China has produced one Mao Zedong America has produced a thousand Mao Zedong right you have Bill Gates you have the founder of Apple so you know you have all these incredible Giants strutting around America so yes major mistake to underestimate America but the second point I'd make is that at the same time because America lacks a strategy it is not looking at where his vulnerabilities are and in my book actually I say exactly what you said Rana if I had to point to one Achilles heel that America has in this contest against China and I'm sure China's aware of this Achilles heel is the fact where US dollar is the global reserve currency and that gives America an exorbitant privilege and even though the president Trump complains about trade imbalances actually the rest of the world is very envious of the straitening balances because you can print money and import lots of goods other people have to work very hard to produce but the danger there is that it is as you know over time whenever the number one economy becomes the number two economy his role as a global reserve currency goes down we don't know exactly where that's going to happen but there is actually a queue danger that the Chinese could accelerate the process by creating a kind of what they call a digital currency based on AI and that's technically possible and that provides avenues for countries around the world to trade with each other without having to use the US dollar that's best technically possible hasn't been done yet and though that at that point is that and the end of the day that the people who are going to decide whether in this pipe all our us wins or China wins he's not the 313 million people in America not the 1.4 billion people in China but the six billion people who live outside and what's interesting is that the six billion people who live outside today the elites and you deal with them extremely well informed they're educated the best universities in Grant's plays Harvard and so on so forth so they do this they use a core calculus of reason to work out a cost-benefit analysis of which country provides them more in real things via real things right not speeches not rhetoric right if you need a new power station if you need a new part if you need a new hospital where do you go and increasingly this is just pure data more and more countries are knocking on the doors of China and so what the Chinese are doing a systematically building up a global network of influence where where countries are relying on China for real things not forwards and by contrast the United States has been redrawing from the world in real terms that creates the difference of where the directions of the world are going so that's why I don't think China has won yet but it's an absolute mistake for Americans to think that China cannot okay let me both agree and disagree so I think certainly I applaud teachers effort in the book to wake Americans up from complacency so for lots of Americans they believe that America's number one position is so naturally ensconced that it cannot possibly be challenged that's a foolish idea so I think as I've tried to argue we have to appreciate that this is a genuine lucidity rival indeed if I'm in China or I had been in China every other month since the book was published and I talked to many of the Chinese leaders they always say well well what do you think about the earth lucidity and proposition now and I say well if facilities were watching he would say both parties are right on script almost as if they were competing to see which will better exemplify the rising power and which the ruling power and he would say if I had been stretching my imagination I could not have imagined a better symbol for the ruling power than Donald Trump or the rising power then she said praying so that's the that fundamental is happening in any case then the question is how each of the parties manage their end and here I think maybe Kishore and I have a slight disagreement when I I say in the conclusion of my destined for war book that if somebody from if a serious strategist from Morris or Lee Kuan Yew or for example we're watching these two countries he would say pretty much what Lee Kuan Yew said which is each of you have a big problem that you're probably going to fail to solve most of that problem lies inside your own borders not abroad not with the earth apartment inside your own borders one of you has got 88 Partyland autocratic system which is a 20th century operating system on which you're trying to pace 21st century apps and that's not going to work that's what he said and the other has a democracy that's the monstre bleah dysfunctional I mean I call it DC stands for a dysfunctional capital so and you're gonna have to determine whether you can revive your democracy and reinvent it again to show that it governs because either of these societies could go awry in the Chinese story we know frequently autocracies end up with beard emperors so mom happened after to found the other element in the history of China many instances of quote bad emperors a teeth it's extremely hard to keep a benevolent dictator or autocrat benevolent we also know about the democracies that they have their problems and in particular the American democracy today so I I think this this is a contest that will go one for some time but whichever society can better deliver to its citizens what they want we'll end up demonstrating which is kind of more successful system and I think neither of the parties have solved that problem today well this is a very smart source one's told me which is that you know it made me that the fortunes of either country depend on who can best control the moneyed elites because as you're sketching out there are vested interests strong vested interests in both countries that have a lot invested in keeping things the way they are now I'm curious how you all see this you know the chances of both China and the u.s. being able break out of the current paradigm and make the reforms either in the case of China to to reforming the economy to get rid of the that you know the old less productive way is a funnel in capital state-run enterprises etc the kind of links between between the party and and that that system how that compares to America's ability to navigate at a time when everything that's happened in the last few weeks not to mention the last few years is forwarding a system that is going to make things more polarized potentially increased populism who's best positioned I mean how does the current landscape what if you were if you were in Vegas bedding or Hong Kong what would you what would you say so it's like that yeah please yeah well the you know you know I better I completely agree with Brian when he talks about the structural problems of autocracies and how do you ensure you have a good successor when you have a benevolent leader and so on so forth that's all that's true by a Chinese civilization also has his own cycles and when a successful dynasty emerges and by the way in terms of how much the standard of living of the Chinese people have been true so far the current Chinese government has done more to improve the standard of living of Chinese people in the last 40 years then any government is done for the past 4,000 years so what China may be seeing is the beginning of a new dynastic cycle which normally last 300 myths and he show at the end of 300 years as you saw in the Ching dynasty things about to fall apart but we are now only about 40 to 70 years in a 300 year cycle so that's why I would say going back against China also and in the case of the United States I'm glad you use the phrase vested interest because I have a chapter called can America make u-turns and given this give me one concrete example the real contest which in the United States and China is not gonna be played out in the delegates here well we know all our wording Brammer agreed a nuclear war you don't have a winner and a loser you have a loser no loser so the real battle is going to be in the economy and that's why the United States won against the Soviet Union and yet despite the fact there it is not going to be paid out on the military the United States is to supporting a fleet of 13 aircraft carriers and increasingly these aircraft carriers can no longer apply close to the Chinese course because the Chinese are develop hypersonic missiles for 100,000 dollars they can destroy a 13 billion dollar aircraft carrier so it doesn't make sense to spend so much money on aircraft carriers anymore so what you need to do is to completely change the defense budget and orient it towards a new military strategy to deal with the United States wait what what happens when you try to change the UN be the US defense budget every congressman every senator has got a slice of the pie in the defense budget which is untouchable and as you know defense secretaries have tried there others to cut the defense budget and I give a concrete example in the books where when the defense secretary asked for X million Congress did Express few hundred million so that some can go to the districts now that's not how you fight a long term strategic battle right but these are examples of the examples or in case of the United States where decisions are made not to benefit there are larger national interest not to benefit the people as a whole but to benefit a small cause more to people and that's why as I say the real contest today between US and China is between a plutocracy and a meritocracy and don't underestimate a meritocracy in such a struggle okay unconcious we're getting close to the question time but before we open it up let me let me I'm what talked about the rest of the world for a moment and how Europe and Southeast Asia and other parts of the world play into what's happening now I'm fascinated if you all have a view on whether we will be in a truly bipolar world going forward or whether Europe will provide some kind of third way some kind of counterbalance to this great power rivalry I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the trade and tech war within that one thing I find fascinating right now is how you're being pushed in 5g for example to either go with China or the US and you know in this world and if you assume that at some point Europe will have to pick sides at least from the from a kind of a tech hardware standpoint can it can there be a third way um where does this end so that's one question secondly Southeast Asia the Middle East West Africa in whole new games of great power politics happening there what is most concerning to you what would you call out Graham do you want to grab out my first so great it's a great question and again nobody knows what the speculation I said I I think I foresee a world in which we've got a lucidity and rivalry between two great powers and that's the principle defining dynamic of international relations for as far as we can see each of them are on a path to decouple elements of the relationship that provide vital that to decouple any any dependence on anything that's vital for them so if you look across the first the defense sector but now the tech sector China is doing everything it can not to be dependent on advanced semiconductors from the US and US patents because they don't like that vulnerability and you could see in the u.s. looking at the supply chains and noticing that many many items ingredients just as you said come from China and so the US will be pressing there so that's the fundamental dynamic but at the same time if you go to Australia or Singapore or Japan America's closest I or the Europeans and you talk to their leaders which I've done with many they say don't make less choose between our economic relationship with China which is essential for our prosperity and our security relationship with you which is essential for our security so we're not going to choose or if we did you would like the way we chose so I think this is going to be a much more complex relationship China is not the isolated autarkic economy that the Soviet Union was so it wasn't hard to isolate the Soviet economy because they were trying to isolate themselves in fact China's the largest trading partner of almost everybody that's going to remain so the chain the economic piece of this will be thick on the other hand if you ask me when I listen to leaders in Japan or Singapore or South Korea if they imagine the world with us as a security counterbalance to China they say don't leave us alone with China they don't think train is going to invade them they don't think I agree with Kishore they don't think it wants to impose a Communist Party with troops the way the Soviet Union did but they believe that the Chinese will squeeze them in ways that will be harmful to their will being without a balance so I think we're going to have a much more complex I mean the third the third party actors will make this competition considerably more complex than what we saw in the so-called bipolar world of the Cold War okay number of questions and I've written a book about technology but you're now going to have a real time test of whether or not actually make this technology work I see that Henry Macon Henry just clicked in himself looks like he's up hi can you hear me lovely we can hear you go ahead perfect so I'm curious in terms of I guess sort of examining the sort of the great power rivalry going on now these are the middle powers for instance Australia or South Korea Japan etc of deep economic relationships we China but Pat a strong defense relationship with the u.s. to what extent will we see pressure applied from either the Chinese or the u.s. drugs Boeing for middle powers to make a choice and I guess in terms of the second question that is I'm curious as to whether the middle powers who are stuck or in such a conundrum have been talking about training a defect or if not d'azur a Alliance to be able to have some sort of economy scale when dealing with very difficult economic strategic questions that might be forced upon them in light of the ongoing power okay either do you want to grab that one sure great there are just Raytheon on Australia I think you know I what I say in the book is that when if this duplicate contest becomes stronger and stronger and I fear it were some of the countries have be very badly affected will be countries like Australia and Singapore because you know Australia has got very very solid defense relationship with the United States but a complete is the economy is tied almost 70 percent to to China as a countries like Australia I think I'm gonna have a very very hard time which is why I think the key point that Graham made earlier which I think I hope many Americans will listen carefully to is the rest of the world is six billion of people who are saying please don't make us choose we want to continue pursuing our economic ties with China and yes we want to keep on our relationship with the United States and Graham is absolutely right when he says that countries for example in Southeast Asia would like to see a US presence remain in the region we don't want the u.s. to eat he wanted the u.s. to be here but at the same time we want a delicate sensitive thoughtful considerate US presence that understands that you know we have to live with China for the next 1,000 years so don't make us first have to take decisions they will end up in the long run getting in trouble so I'll give you a concrete example you mentioned technology the United States has launched a tremendous campaign against Huawei right and he claims that if we take far away you you know China will be spying on you but I see everybody knows through Edward Snowden the u.s. spies on you too so what's the difference as far as you're concerned whether the u.s. spies are you China spy for you everybody's gonna spy on you so what's the problem there so when when when the United States keeps pushing countries in in that direction we will alienate countries and we are moving at the end of the day one keyword that hasn't surfaced here is that you're moving towards a multipolar world with many actors one actor for example the has not be mentioned is India it's going to be a big swing factor in this game because only India is big enough to really match the two elephants US and China but that's an example of the and I think what one word which I think Bram used which we should emphasize is the word complexity this is not black and white this is a very complex game many players and many different nuances are coming and you've got to absorb that complexity if you want to understand the world is coming just like one comment I'm mostly I agree but I think they for the for the mental powers they're gonna find this extremely painful because they are going to be pulled in both directions they will the US will demand that they not do go away and some of them will do part fall away and this will become another strength they will try to organize themselves if they can and the great example of that is what Prime Minister Bobby did in resurrecting TPP after the u.s. dropped out so that club of trade provides some counterbalance to China's weight so basically if the US had been part of it you would have had 40% of the world's GDP on one side of the seesaw and China's you know 18 percent on the other side so that's a much better you get much better terms if you're negotiating those in that manner I just remind us of Thucydides is lying from the millions in this real world the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must I think that'll be the fate of the middle powers okay I see Peter Walker's waiting for a question let me let me let you in theater go ahead Peter can you can you speak I think you've got your mic muted so you might want to try okay didn't hear me now mm-hmm well I completely agree with key Shores point that at the end of the day this is all going to be about economics I also agree with the point that if you look at the economic momentum of China the fact that it has four times as many people that its productivity through urbanization still has a long way to go and if you look at the lift they're going to get from the belt road initiative and 2025 it's hard to imagine their relative performance economically to the West will not continue for the foreseeable future so my question especially for Kishore is to the extent his book is a wake-up call for America which I totally agree with what is it going to take for that to happen and what would be the consequences of that wake-up call okay what's what's it gonna take I unfortunately the history teaches us that it takes a crisis for people to wake up and at the end of day maybe after kovat nineteen people will stop looking at the world of fresh and say how do we keep ourselves safe and secure in this in this very different world and I think one one other dimension I want to emphasize is that that hasn't been put in the picture here is that people ordinary people around the world aware that actually we live in a very small interconnector densely packed what they call maybe a global village and the spread of it 19 shows that we live in a small village so if you live in a small densely packed village then clearly you you have to learn to get along with your neighbors and work with your neighbors and and and I hope that that that sounds like a very idealistic dye way of putting it but if the primary goal of the United States is to improve the well-being of its people the United States can improve the well-being of his people by cooperating with the rest of the world rather than by engaging in another zero-sum Joe political contest because yes as Graham mentioned earlier when he goes on the world and talks to people and so on so forth more and more countries in the world want to engage America they want to work with America so what America needs to do is to seize this opportunity by my changing its strategy and instead of imposing demands and other countries learn to practice the promisee look for win-win arrangements go back and rejoin the trans-pacific partnership which is which our grandma listen said was a gift to America there's so many things that America can do right if it can some or other wake up and realize that this is a different world today okay let me try and bring in a couple more voices Richard Merritt II as his hand up Richard do you want to click in yes thank you this is Richard Myrtle can you hear me yes we can hear you great thank you yeah I'm um I'm an American citizen I live in New York City right now and I am completely on board with working with the Chinese I actually lived in China for many years and I speak Chinese so so I I'm completely on board with working with the Chinese in a new economic order for the world but I grew up in the in you know in the 1980s and the waning years at the Cold War under this cloud of the threat of nuclear war and so when you know when the Soviet Union imploded and the 99 that was like a huge brush of breath of fresh air for me and I've been living very peacefully ever since until recently in this discussion Rana made the point about invested interests in the two countries and and certain certain parts of it's a society that just want to protect the status and I'm not concerned about the money you know the money elite in either country I believe that Warren Buffett will will certainly pivot very nimbly in this matter as well what I'm concerned about is the military deep state in the United States and I want to ask Graham Allison in your theory of the city's acidities trap what is your view on the on the threat and the danger of nuclear war going forward and is there anything you know how frightened are you about that and assuming that you're as frightened as I am about it what can is there anything we can do thank you so thank you it's a great question and alone we take a long answer but the answer is yes you should be concerned about nuclear war and in a through city and dynamic the trigger to war is rarely the destroy the rising power to attack the ruling power or alternatively the ruling power to attack the rising power instead what happens is some third parties action or provocation or even just an event triggers a vicious cycle of reactions that drags people to a war they don't want think 1914 and the assassination on Archduke so in the current situation Taiwan is a ticking time bomb as Taiwan watches what's happening on the mainland it's interested in being reintegrated the way Hong Kong has been has dropped to zero many people in the Trump administration and certainly some others in Congress have been emboldened in Taiwan to take steps towards greater independence if if Taiwan were to take a short move towards independence in the current setting I believe in most people that study China believe Beijing would react violently and by the end of the day we in a great China forced reiterate Taiwan forcibly if the u.s. came to the support of Taiwan which we might it's not clear but if we did I think we would have a with China and from there it's not hard to talk identify or to trace a escalation ladder that would end up with nuclear bombs exploding so for those of us that lived in the Cold War its we should think not about so many wanting a nuclear war but about getting dragged somewhere no sane person would want to go and we should never forget 1914 I think you can't study it too much okay let me bring in another voice Brian Gilmore you're on Brian can you um can you hear us I think you've got your mic muted so if you want to try and unmute or not we'll try a creek line hi how's it going this has been an excellent panel and I think everyone's had some amazing points to offer and it's been very educational I want to put it back to something that was said about the structural weaknesses in the United States and my question is is to what extent are these weaknesses structural in to what extent are they caused by the current occupant in the White House one could argue that we have the current leadership we do simply because there's the lack of faith and trust in institutions and that that simply resulted that weakness that Kishore was talking about is this something that we can bounce back from with just a different president or a set of leadership in Congress and agencies or is this something that is more systemic you know I I studied philosophy and I tree studied a philosopher called John Rawls very carefully and if you find that my book you find I cite John Rawls and many times and if John Rawls were alive today he will be absolutely shocked by what's happening to the bottom 10% in America also the United States today is the only major developed society where the average income of the bottom 55 0% has gone down over a 30-year period and this doesn't happen this happened way before President Trump it's got nothing to do with the current administration is the result of deep structural flaws in the decision-making processes in the United States that have led to this surge of inequality has led to what case and didn't call the sea of despair among white working classes and so on and so forth and in fact it will be very good for the United States instead of focus instead of starting a new job political contests against China and wasting resources on it why not use those resources who take care of the sea of despair among the white working classes take care of his own people first and and that's why I believe in the early the United States concentrates on improving the well-being of his people which the product of 3% is suffering and China concentrated bring the well-being of his people we can get out the facilities trap that Graham has been talking about solely locally I'm gonna grab one or two more questions and then I'm going to be turning it over to Dindo why don't we take Eric Tucker and then Peggy Blumenthal I just unmuting hi so my question is regarding Xi Jinping is is he the rightful / the the right character to lead China forward and to what degree is he riding on the coattails of his predecessor is notably done shopping who set things on certain course and certainly Zhu Rongji who enabled China to get into the WTO and to what degree is China beholden both to the other rising Asian powers of obviously Japan Taiwan South Korea Singapore and as an aside also every one of those Powers has gradually opened has become less authoritarian under Xi Jinping China is now reversing and the implications of that reversal may still be in play and to his credit of course he did reduce corruption but he did it in a way that did not enable a an institutionalized transparency to monitor corruption he did it in a capricious way that many argue favoured his own political interests so certainly China has had great success it owes a lot of that success to the openness of the US market and the global system and I think it's important to stop thinking of it as the u.s. system anymore there's been tremendous beneficiaries to a global system and obviously China can contribute but I'm curious I feel like there's more complaint than appreciation okay to also give her question a short question and then we'll let the panelists take them both at once Peggy go ahead yes oh thank you because it actually follows up on this past question can you hear me all right yeah we got you and it was a fisherman bhavani's description of China as a meritocracy versus what the US is now and I wondered how when you look at Chinese higher education and US higher education and how important a role education plays in growing the global talent would you really describe Chinese universities today as meritocracies and is the Xi Jinping's increasing political crackdown on them going to help them move into that place as the global host for talent okay great thanks Peggy granny you want to go first - no sir xi Jinping I have a profile in my book which is the only thing that the Chinese censors insisted on eliminating from the Mandarin edition of it for their sensitivities when I say and I believe that he is the most ambitious most competent and likely to be the most consequential actor on the international stage today that's a big one liner and I think on the meritocracy if I understand there's no question that that Chinese universities have made huge huge strides forward Xinhua is a great university bata is a great University but if I look at the processes for admission and promotion there and compare them with the American universities and if I look at that say there those as competitions in themselves which I do I would say that it's hard to conclude China is more meritocratic both of them make exceptions but I think in the Chinese case I would suspect more some t-shirt well I also discussed Xi Jinping in in my book and I would one thing on to emphasize is that we really don't know him as a person he's a bit of a mystery but at the same time we know why he accumulated more power than his predecessors because before him the regime before him two big problems was sprouting up one was corruption we just mentioned earlier and the other was factionalism and the Chinese knew that if this continued the corruption continued factionalism continued the Chinese regime would collapse and China's and go to the rejuvenate itself would have all died so he was like an emergency doctor sent in to solve a major like a cardiac arrest that was happening in China and that's why I reacted so so decisively and of course if you look at China through any set of liberal lenses China seems to be going backwards but if you look at the China from the lenses of the 1.4 billion people and what they actually want there is actually no question that the Chinese people because their number one fear is chaos no one when they have a strong leader in charge they feel relaxed they feel good my life is secure finally it's the opposite of a strong leader that is a problem in China so when she shipping accumulates as much power as yes and access decisively as it does he is responding to a Chinese political culture Chinese political dynamic and that the energy the only thing you're gonna judge XI by by the way is results in keeping the economy growing our people's lives improving is China standing in the world growing up and so on so forth so if you look at the results and yeah I agree with Graham there's absolutely no doubt that the single most consequential be the real consequence of EDA in the world today is Xi Jinping because he's the decision he makes that are now determining what's happening in the world okay um well we can keep going and I feel like this should maybe be a series I'm putting in my my bid for another round with you all at some point um I'm going to thank you both I know we've got a couple more questions but Dinda needs to come in as well and I want to be respectful of everyone's time so thank you Kishore Thank You Graham I've learned a lot more soon from you I hope and Dindo back to you thank you well I just want to thank that three of you for providing an incredible framework for how we might be able to find our way forward through this crisis and through the shifting global order and giving us a little bit of a sense of what the future might look like you know a handful of takeaways are words that popped out to me were complexity these are not black and white issues that's something that we Americans have a hard time with I think and that we are living in a small village and we hope that the world will not have to choose between the United States and China so I just want to thank you so so very much Kishore my Bonnie Graham Allison Rana frou har finally I wanted to encourage people to become members of China Institute it's a way to help us continue you know doing these programs and bringing these dialogues and discussions to all of you and so we very much appreciate your your joining as members and thank you all so much for attending we look forward to seeing you at our future programs thank you thanks

Phil Yuen, CEO of Aurabeat, says it can serve as a complimentary safety measure.",we have always been the air filtration specialists and uh late last year we have developed technology uh that can really uh uh that can take air filtration and not just on a filter uh not just filtering out the air but also actively uh eliminating uh any bacterias and viruses including covert 19 that is being filtered through now if you take a real life example uh what we have been doing with hospitals and collection points and businesses that are focusing on reopening what they have been doing is they they're placing these devices in areas where airborne transmission is a it's a very large concern and uh you're able to completely clean the air uh up to 3.4 times in one hour and at that and at the same time eliminate eliminating for the 99.9 percent of copper 19 amongst other viruses and bacteria okay so phil i'm trying to understand how quickly this can respond to let's say someone who sneezes or coughs in a closed office space because it doesn't seem to me that it could replace a mask i mean if you're still sitting side by side even socially distanced with someone is this an alternative or just a product that would be complementary to other procedures like wearing a mask and washing your hands we absolutely believe is a complimentary solution now there are two scenarios that we're focused on right so uh in a business environment uh in a business environment where uh folks are still wearing masks or sometimes have to mask us off what we're able to do is add a very high level of protection in that space in that area around that area uh that's number one number two is at homes when in general folks are not uh wearing masks at home that's where our added level of protection can really come in to make sure that air is not just being filtered but also making sure that uh bacterias and viruses like covet 19 are also eliminated as well so what we have been seeing actually uh in here in hong kong at least actually even globally is that no longer are is it enough to just have the air filtration system that filters uh we are seeing a huge uh increase in requests in air filtration systems that can not just filter but also eliminate uh whatever is captured in the trap because it does present a very significant secondary infection uh uh if it does not do the elimination uh uh capability and simply just filtering out um you know as you can imagine uh hong kong we have a relatively low infection count but globally uh uh you know since the launch of our product we have seen a uh a significant increase in uh in orders and uh distribution requests coming from university hospitals uh government agencies all looking to provide the same level of protection that we're able here to do in hong kong you ,True,False,False,False

I think I experienced everyone of them! For about 36hrs after my second dose I went through what I can only imagine what a mild to moderate case of COVID must be like. However, my side effects lasted much shorter than the real thing and I will not have any long lasting consequences that COVID itself can bring. I share my story to encourage everyone to get the vaccine. You may be miserable for a day or so, but it is much better than getting the real thing! The side effects are expected, manageable, and short lived. Worth every minute to not get COVID! I highly encourage you to get the vaccine when it's your turn.

This video is for educational purposes only.  It is not intended to diagnose or treat any condition in any way.  Always consult a medical professional for matters concerning your personal health.",after getting my second covid vaccine i now have a new appreciation of what my patients who have had coven 19 go through hi i'm dr louis crane board certified family medicine physician and let me tell you the second dose of the covid19 vaccine is no joke it made me feel worse than i felt in a long time stick around for the rest of this video and i'll go through my experiences and tell you why i'm glad i had some side effects and what i think it means for my response to the covet vaccine and how it might protect me in the future [Music] all right let's start back with the first dose of my vaccine which was approximately 31 days before my second dose after that dose i really didn't have a whole lot of side effects had a little bit of an achy arm mild headache and a little bit of fatigue for a couple of days but that was really it nothing real significant now after my most recent dose last friday i felt terrible i got my vaccine at approximately 7 30 in the morning worked the rest of the day felt pretty good my arm got a little bit sore faster than it did the last with the first dose but really not any worse than the first dose but by about 7 30 that night so about 12 hours later i really started to feel bad i started running a low grade temperature started getting really achy had a pretty significant headache to the point where i was on the phone with one of my relatives and pretty much had to cut them off and tell them i had to go because i just felt so bad i hadn't felt that way in a long time that pretty much continued through the night didn't get a whole lot of sleep friday night my temperature got up to about 100.5 and i continued to have shaking chills fever aches headaches just felt miserable most of the night woke up saturday morning feeling pretty much the same spent most of the day on the couch really couldn't do anything i was certainly glad that i got the vaccine on a friday so i had saturday off and didn't really have to do anything or go anywhere because i'm not sure that i could have pretty much laid around most of the day saturday was able to eat and drink normally just felt miserable that pretty much continued into the night and overnight most of the night saturday but happy to report that i woke up sunday morning feeling much better my fever had subsided the chills and sweats had really gone away still had a little bit of headache but that pretty much resolved as the day went on so really only had about 36 hours of what i would consider to be moderate symptoms now let me tell you why i'm actually glad that i had those symptoms i opted not to take anything for my symptoms because i didn't want to blunt my immune response any more than i had to i think if my symptoms had continued for any longer i probably would have but since i had the weekend didn't really have anywhere to go or anything to do i figured i'd just let it take its course and in hindsight i'm actually glad i did now if you look at the reported data from the moderna trial which by the way modern is the vaccine i got there are two of them out there right now moderna and pfizer my health system was giving the modern vaccines that's why mine was 31 days apart you can get it as quick as 28 days apart but just due to logistics and timing mine was 31 days if you look at the data in the trials 92 percent of patients had some sort of a side effect most of those were just injection site pain pretty common you got a shot it gets into the muscle that's where it does its job it makes the muscles a little bit sore 70 percent of people ended up having some fatigue 64 had headache and then as on down myalgia's arthralgias miles just just means muscle pain arthral just means joint pain chills nausea oh i had some of that too by the way i forgot to mention that um sweating fever about 15 of people in the trial had fever so i felt pretty lucky i had just about everything that everybody had but i have to say i would trade 36 hours of misery for getting coveted any day because that short period of time which is consistent with some of the other reports that i've heard from other people who have gotten the vaccine either in the trial or as part of the mass vaccination plan going on right now their side effects last in anywhere from 12 to 36 hours sometimes as long as 48 but most of them went away pretty quickly i would definitely choose that over getting covet and having days of symptoms and potentially the long-term complications that we're starting to see in a lot of individuals so i'm very glad that i was able to get the vaccine before i got coveted itself now why am i glad that i had side effects who wants to be miserable voluntarily right i'm glad i got side effects because if you understand why the side effects happen you know that it's your immune system's response to the vaccine that dictates you getting side effects the fact that i had side effects means that my immune system was kicking into action so hopefully that means in the future my body is going to be able to respond when exposed to the cobot virus and neutralize it before it makes me sick that's the idea behind the vaccine right now not everybody gets side effects and don't think that just because you didn't get side effects that the vaccine isn't effective that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying it's reassuring to me that because i had side effects hopefully that means i'm going to be more likely to be protected from getting coveted in the future now as we age our immune system isn't as robust as it once was and this was shown even in the trials those 65 and older generally didn't have a lot of side effects that's because usually people who are 65 and older have lower immune systems now thankfully in the analysis of the vaccine data they showed that it was highly effective even in those individuals over 65 so again don't take lack of side effects to mean lack of efficacy that's not what i'm saying now please don't take my experience with side effects or anybody else's experience with side effects to deter you from getting the vaccine trust me it's completely worth having a few hours of mild to moderate symptoms versus getting coveted 19 and all the side effects and symptoms and complications that come with it most people describe the side effects of the vaccine to be a mild version of coping 19 and frankly if that was a mild version i don't want the real thing and i think a lot of my patients who have had the real thing would agree with me so please don't let it dissuade you from getting the vaccine there's a good chance you won't have side effects at all there's a chance that they won't be as significant as mine there's a really good chance that they won't last but more than a few hours a day or two at the most and it is completely worth it now i chose not to take any tylenol or ibuprofen i suspect if i had my symptoms may not even have been as severe as they were and there's certainly nothing out there that says you can't take tylenol or ibuprofen i just chose not to that was my choice i'm certainly not advocating that that be your choice if you choose not to i don't think it's going to hurt you and it may help your immune system react more efficiently and effectively but there's so certainly no data that says that's absolutely the case that was just my choice so as the vaccine rollout begins to ramp up i hope you will consider getting the vaccine when it's your turn please if you have any questions about the vaccine ask your local health department ask your provider or if you have general questions leave them down in the comments below and i'll be happy to answer them as best i can alright that's it for today remember as always be safe out there you ,True,False,False,False

singapore the series is sponsored by elites commercial reads and rhb it's in a post-copic landscape hello again everybody welcome once again to reits in a post covered landscape and thank you for joining us on a saturday afternoon i hope you've enjoyed the past three sessions by our speakers vijay gave us some pointers on the most resilient post-covered reits and included three of his top picks matt's presentation was on the outlook for uk commercial property and why it's been a favorite with singaporean investors despite its challenges shaldeen presented a resilient gem elite commercial read charledine's presentation included an outline of the reits latest acquisition on which we've received some questions so welcome to our panelists without further ado let me bring on the panelists for today we have vijay natarajan real estate and reits analyst rhb bank singapore matt oakley director of saviles from london and sheldon wang ceo elite commercial reits manager a good afternoon from us here in singapore and a good morning to mat in the uk where it's uh six a.m in the morning right now i'm going to kick off with our first question what are the most important factors to consider when investing in reits and i'll put this first to vijay thanks gola thanks for having me in this presentation okay the most important factors i have covered some of these factors in my presentation also in the end if you look at reits investors are investing in real estate so the first and foremost factor is asset quality what is the quality of the asset a good quality asset can ride through different market size skills so asset quality is the first important factor i would state as a most important factor the second one would be an asset class especially this has become more prevalent in terms of uh covet 19. is the asset a new economy like how is it adapting to the digital trends in the economy and how are they i mean what kind of asset class is that that would be the second most important point last but not the least i would say it's the sponsors and management track record if if the read has a good manager and a good sponsor who are committed to growing the reit i think that's the most important thing for a week to have also okay thank you so now we'll come to one of the sponsors sheldeen so sheldon what do you think are the most important factors to consider when investing in reeds well i definitely agree with vj uh on the three points that have stated of course other things that investors will be keen to also looked at probably would be like dividend yields because ultimately that's the dividend that their returns that they're getting and of course the gearing the market cap and these are some of the the key points that investors will be keen to know when they're coming to invest and deciding which uh read to invest in and of course tenant risk tell us a little bit about your tenant right okay for us i guess we are quite unique you know in a way that although we have always been criticized of having a tenant concentration which is um having just one tenant however i guess the credit worthiness of the tenant speaks it all it's a double a credit rated sovereign tenant which none of i would say that none of the singapore reits at this point in time is focusing on they probably have one or two but it's not concentrated on this now ours is being used by the department of works and pensions which is dwp and it's a very counter-cyclical tenant so when the market is bad you know dwp works has actually exponentially growth rather than you know being concerned of the tenant trying to move the way what they need is actually they need more space now as compared to under normal times so that's something very unique about our reit here okay thank you shandy matt what are the most important factors to consider when you want to invest in reit i think i'm very very bipolar on this to be honest um part of me says and i want a specialist i want an expert so you know if it's a data center re they need to know everything about data centers or if it's uh if it's some sort of you know uk offices focused they should just do uk offices but the sort of fund management in my head says actually you want a variety of asset classes you want to spread your risk different different things move to different cycles i know the general thinking in the reap universe is that is that specialist is bad best as long as your specialist is an expert in a rising sector and you know let's face it we've seen globally over the last five or six years uh reits who were specialized in retail and hospitality have suffered hugely from being overweight in a single sector that that isn't fashionable or is declining so i i'm very very caught between between the two stools on this one but i think in a vj actually now that's the quality quality of the property and the quality of the management team um is always the most important thing but i wouldn't necessarily rush towards what is new and fashionable in many cases okay thanks and well let's stay with you matt because the next question that we've had is about uk property what are the opportunities for investors and some risks they may face when investing in uk property why don't i start with the risks um you know the uk is is facing two unprecedented um unmodelable events in the face of brexit uh you know the first time a country has ever less left a major trading block uh obviously covered 19. and okay with 19 is obviously not unique to the uk and both of those i think bring their challenges for investors and i think you know investors when they're looking at the uk are just going to have to take you know their own view on these things because you know while i'm paid to have a view it doesn't necessarily mean it's right the opportunities you know i think about the uk are that we have a fairly unique uh real estate market leases tend to be very long they're 10 years or more it's very easy you know it's possible to get 15 or 20 years the rents while your tenant is in place cannot go down regardless of what the market cycle is doing so and your income return is pretty secure and generally all the costs um that are related to right you know occupying that asset are the tenants problem rather than the landlord's problem so the uk is always very popular with international investors because it's it's relatively a fire and forget type asset class you know you buy it you pay someone like saviles to manage it for you collect the rent every quarter and that's it and regardless of the cycle unless your tenant goes bust the the money keeps coming in and you can be very predictable about that around sort of brexit and coverage you know our clients globally are not particularly worried about brexit i sat here you know just over a month away from it there are some who are clearly waiting until until next year before committing their cash into the uk but it's been priced into the market for three or four years now cabin i think is is is challenging some and exciting others and i'm sure we'll we'll touch on some of the sort of the big structural changes later on in this conversation none of which are particularly to the particular to the uk but i guess the only other point i would make about the uk is you know it's a very london-centric market you know we're a country of one big city so a lot of the uk asset value is in in london offices so if you're a bear on home working and its impact on offices that's probably a big challenge to the uk i don't think it's going to things are going to change dramatically in the office market i think most people will carry on going into the office most of the time okay thanks thanks for that michelle sheldon your portfolio is entirely uh in the uk and they're not all in london so yes what's your view on the opportunities for investors and some of the risks that they could face with your particular experience okay i guess what um the macroeconomics is exactly what matt says you know the covet is always something that um that no one has expected the brexit is something that everyone has been anticipating how it will end up you know we enter into the uk market exactly when theresa may was extending the brexit discussion every week so but as a foreign investors the whole regime in terms of investments in the uk it's very open so it actually encourages investors to looked into the uk for opportunities definitely it's one of the most actively traded market so there is a lot of activities going on in the uk more focusing on the london definitely but then again there is also other outside of london there are also other major cities that are actually giving better yields as compared to the city itself so um because of our unique tenant we have mentioned earlier the demand of the assets will be there for a long term hence we you know for us we are not actually so concerned about going outside of london for for investing into these assets because we know of their relevance in the long term hence in terms of investment opportunities we do see that london does present a much bigger opportunity however there's an expense of also a lower yield so in order to make sure that the the read is a has a blended yield profile which also then gives us the confidence that the assets are of relevance we do actually uh as a result we are open at looking into the regional cities for such assets of course the better ones uh are always of more interest than than others now in terms of risk i guess other than the macroeconomic as investors what we see is that you know things like the tax regime um understanding of the structuring of the entity on how you invest in and how we actually managed to you know try and maximize the uh the the kind of dividend that we could actually repatriate but i guess these are the con things that investors needs to be concerned about when they are entering into a new market and a different country okay thanks vijay have you had any experience of london property i guess matt and charlene are the experts here in terms of uk property but just to add in terms of uh i think london or uk still remains another global commercial half and global financial hub the second thing about uk market is that it's a lot bigger it's lot liquid that becomes very important in the real estate when you want to when you read once you enter a new market the first thing they see is that how big can they group if they establish a food tool can they acquire and can they grow on this market and even if they want to sell an asset liquidity becomes more important so that is very much present in uk market that would be some of the other benefits or some of the other opportunities i see in uk market i think in terms of risk wise to me regulatory risk is always one of the key important risk especially in uk market brexit what happens if some of the free trade agreements don't go through what happens in if european union place a hard ball on uk in terms of some of these so that's a regulatory list and suppose if if a reit is exposed to a tenant who might shift their offices or shift the positions post brexit is that a risk that should other than this i think especially for local investors the other thing to watch out is the currency and forex fluctuation risk right if you're investing in a uk you are investing in british pound there was one point of time british pound was falling quite crazy i think the british brand has stabilized at this point of time so that's something how the he redisposition how they have hedged their income and how are you hedging your portfolio for forex fluctuation risk is something which i think it should investors should take note of oh thanks yes yes yes of course uh the the currency risk yes and of course brexit should the financial center of london should it shift to somewhere in in europe that's another risk yeah indeed okay so let's address the elephant in the room kovit okay and and um which is also in the title of our of our our investment seminar how will the cbd change post covide you know cities are all into mixed use developments near transport nodes to reduce commute and carbon footprint and some of these are not in the cbd so how will this impact properties in the cbd and how are reits likely to respond to this i i'll start with matt because he works in the in in the world's financial center london [Music] um yeah i have to say i i'm not a big believer in that there will be dramatic change i think we tend to over predict change at the sort of nadir of the crisis you know i'm old enough to remember you know immediately after 9 11 um a lot of people were saying nobody will ever want to live or work in a tower building again and briefly rents fell on the top floors of tower buildings around the world and then it came back and we saw it around brexit in the uk as well that you know there's this speculation that maybe the entire financial community would move from london to frankfurt and i think about 7 000 jobs have gone so i think you know some companies were very resistant to home working they didn't allow their staff to do it or culturally there was this feeling that it wasn't proper work they've grown up and accepted the fact that that you know you you know you treat your your employees like adults they know where they work best so i think most people will work away from the office a bit more than they did before but all last surveys that we've been doing across london and the europe and the middle east indicate that most staff want to work in the office most of the time particularly younger members who are sort of building their career building their skills so i don't really see a lot of change i think there will be increased pressure for high quality buildings and i think that you know they will need to tick the environmental sustainability boxes i think we talked a lot about wellness before the crisis wellness in the workplace but i think we possibly didn't do very much about it we just went to lots of conferences on it i think there will be more focus on that but i don't think the structure of the cities in terms of the main asset class offices will change dramatically i think we will be picking up the pieces of of the sort of those who who've been mortally wounded after the crisis you know let's face it the crisis has triggered a huge recession companies always fail and at the moment you know the sector that is most struggling in the uk and in london as in many many world cities as retail and leisure because they're not open tourists are not visiting um office workers are not going to the office so we're going to see you know holes as it were in the high street where these companies have gone bust and there is a question of how you fill those and is that an opportunity okay thanks yes there's a lot of concern in in singapore over this sort of hollowing out of the cbd so i'm going to jump to vijay because we are concerned about some of our commercial reits that are listed here and with properties here isn't it vj yeah in terms of cbd i think overall if you look at from over the years i think there has been uh singapore has been trying to diversify some of their offices based into suburban like jurong hubs different hubs but i still believe that cbd has its place and overall even if you look at the big companies when they want to establish a presence in singapore the first point they look at is still cbt so if there could be some changes in terms of mix in terms of integrated developments like some of the development some of the development singapore is also trying to build residential apartments in the uh in the cbd spaces at this point of time so there could be some changes in terms of more integrated developments coming up in cpt but i think as matt rightly pointed out we tend to overestimate change over a period of time and probably in two three years there could be some changes in terms of how things are in terms of integrity development but cbd is here to stay for me okay your your portfolio is quite geographically uh diversified but i think all your properties are near on your um transport nodes what is uh how do you think cbds could change postcode i think i agree with both matt and vijay um a lot of panic reaction is happening now people are trying to see you know um because of work from home everyone is going to move out of the city center but i don't think in the wrong run that is really going to materially change probably the um the companies who are not able to survive through um might you know eventually get out of the cbd area and move to cheaper places but there's always other tenants that will be coming in and taking after faces in the cbd area so in general um key important things are like transportation close to amenities these are the fundamentals of a property when you looked at investment in it so in terms of the prospects of the cbd buildings there are still its attractiveness um despite the current covet situation it probably would take about a couple of years to to go through and when covet is over but in the long run i don't think it will be it will be out of um it will change as in like people will totally get out of the city area so it's still the place whereby most of the things could be found and people will call sort of like come together when you do a business yes we have been doing a lot of zoom calls now just like this webinars but then day to day contact and um sort of like communications within the community is still very much required okay so we'll let's move on to another topic of valuations okay because um there have been some covens has actually impacted some valuations and we've seen that with our retail reits um here okay so what are the metrics that valuers consider when doing valuation and how is the pandemic impacting these valuations and how will this affect the reits evaluations and their assets their net asset values and do revaluations have an impact on management fees now there's a whole that that's a lot to swallow but i'm going to ask matt what he thinks because he's he's with saviles and i know saviles does valuations here in singapore do they do valuations in uk we certainly do and we'll be delighted to value for any of your any of your watchers and listeners obviously um you know i think of michelle dean or mentioned earlier the uk one of the things of the uk is it's a highly regulated real estate market so um there's the royal institute of chartered surveyors who who lays down valuation methodology they intervene if if it's if we are not following it uh and indeed they act as an arbitrator if the two parties cannot agree on it it's also a very transparent market in a sense that you know all the big firms of our valuers and agents like ourselves and have research teams that employ people like me and we publish all the deals that are taking place in the market and so you don't need to rely on us to you know what us telling you is is right you can look at the market and see all the deals that have happened and check the value so i think that is a huge factor for non-domestic investors because you know you need transparency as well as liquidity and i think the uk is probably the most transparent real estate market in the world valuation however is is tricky at the moment and valuation is very tricky in a period of low liquidity and at the moment in the uk market relatively few transactions are happening uh primarily because of the difficulties of of uh transacting in a lockdown period um many of the clients who want to buy assets can't visit the uk because the travel restrictions and so on and so on and so on but in a period of low activity value you know valuers are only allowed to value based on evidence they can't say well a hypothetical value would be they would have to say i'm comparing this asset with these assets that have recently traded or all been leased and therefore the value is x at the moment it's very difficult to put a value on anything in the uk because there is no comparative figure i can tell you that it would probably get x and i'll probably be right but from pure sort of desktop property valuation it's a very difficult time and that is probably an unnoted caution in the sense that sort of valuations in the uk do tend to lag the market cycle and they do slightly underestimate the peaks and troughs as well it's just something to watch right okay so vijay when you're doing analysis and your recommendations do you look at the valuations the capital values of the properties when you value your reads ah yes yes i do again i'm a firm believer that valuation is both arts and science right valuation has lot of assumptions behind it in terms of you have to focus on the future trends i mean how would you forecast a covet kind of scenario when you are focusing your future rents so there is a lot of assumptions behind valuations in terms of valuations and deriving valuation metrics typically when we look at valuations here in singapore usually valuers use three three methods which is discounted cash flow capitalization trades and comparison approach and the most prominent one which is being used discounted cash flow approach despite this crisis i think valuation so far have not been impacted like past crisis i think the key reason here is low interest rates when there is a low interest rate the the cap rates don't change that much and there is also abundant liquidity in the market we do see a liquidity in the market and as my rightly pointed out there has not been lot much of distress sale like past crisis where you can take the cap rates as a reference point and then change the valuation methodology so overall yes we do take definitely take valuation into consideration in terms of considering our analysis in terms of evidence reads and property is a hard asset class so price to book is a key metric which we use for valuation also yeah okay sheldeen you know when we last had a conversation on your acquisitions i think i gave all of you your panel a hard time on passing rents versus market rents and so on and so forth so um i i wonder if you could expand a little bit about the valuations in elite a commercial reit uh in terms of of how your buildings are valued in fact there's a um that there's a question from the panel from our audience from actually kusuyong uh who's asking about the valuations of your buildings um uh based on because they're based on master leases i've asked this question to you before um so is there a secondary market for these buildings he's asking yeah right and i guess how confident can you be of those valuations yeah right okay thanks cola i guess some just to clarify you know um the read actually doesn't have a master lease like um a lot of other reads in singapore though so right every property it's got a long term so we've got a long term tenant whereby each of the building has its own individual leases so um the the valuations of the reit has been based on the income method whereby it takes into account the cash flows of each of these properties um because of the long these terms that we have uh things has been considered i guess in terms of the whole portfolio per se our valuation has been very conservative um the valuers that has been looking at it actually has put in a couple of assumptions um yes some of these buildings are in uh not the major uh london city or or birmingham or manchester city however these are the places where i guess the government needs the space more there are a lot of considerations behind the um the long-term use of the building so there are certain commitments by the government requiring that every citizen should be able to access to a job center plus within 25 minutes transport time so and then you will need to see on the surrounding area is there any other competi uh similar kind of properties um having said that in our portfolio uh we have assumed very conservatively at the break last year which is in 2023 50 of the leases uh is expected to be broken on that assumption although we know that the government is unlikely to break that many build options to uh leases at the time due to the uh not only due to the covet even prior to covet we don't think that's going to materially happen well they have gone through a round of rationalization before they decide which are the buildings that they need for a long term hence they signed a 10-year leases but in less in all other long leases in the uk it is very typical to have a five years break clause sort of like inbuilt into the lease it's not saying that they will break the lease but then that gives them flexibility and in terms of the rental rates negotiations you know um if you sign a full 10-year lease without a break it's probably going to be a um a lower rent rate compared to one with h with a five year spread so these are the considerations that has been built into the leases and when the valuers looks at the lease itself um taking into account very very conservative assumptions we believe that the value of the weed it's very conservative having said that you know the second questions that you have mentioned is that on uh su yong's questions was that what if we have to put up some of these buildings into the market right what's happened to the value is there a secondary market to this one key important factor when we looked at properties in the uk was we realized that there's permitted developments rights given to commercial buildings which means that the commercial properties has the right to be converted into residential should should and doesn't have to go through a long process of getting it the developer's license stand up accordingly so which means that there are alternative usage of the assets well of course as the reit is a commercial read of key primarily uh primary objective will be to continue its use as a commercial property but should it be a day whereby we think that there is actually a better returns from that property for other usage there is also nothing stopping to read to be able to recycle some of the capital one of the example that i think we have put in our prospectus was a property in preston we have a neighbor which is identical to the building that we have bought i think it was previously also used by the government but they have actually vacated the building being sold empty to a developer and is being converted into a an apartment is so at a price similar to a 10-year lease that we have so fundamentally there is already a base minimum of the uh of the valuation of the assets in there where we think that we could preserve so i would say that not every property will have will be similar but majority of the assets that we have are located in like key prime town centers whereby that is actually accessible to a lot of amenities and also transportation thus provides that kind of opportunity as well so um and even after we have acquired the property we have been receiving a lot of unsolicited offers for conversions of the properties into um olfox homes i mean sort of like the um oh homes or the apartments or other usage you know it's quite enormous that i was quite surprised particularly at certain areas which are more popular for such usage so definitely for the reits perspective we don't expect that there will be a huge discount of valuations should we need to consider a second use of the property itself yes okay thanks for that and also i remember giving you a hard time asking for comparative valuations because you value your your properties based on income cap and dcs isn't it but by com but if you compare them and i think i think your your cio went on a long uh he sort of he explained that comparatively they are lower than uh adjacent adjacent properties yes actually you know i think i've met uh mentioned that in my presentation um recording uh yesterday just take for example the building that we have or we are going to acquire in london itself you know the one that is actually close to finsbury park um that is actually lisa only at 18 pounds per square foot per annum so you know it's it's probably not a great a building but it's in the location whereby you could do something about the property and bring it up to a much better level should one day if the government decides to leave and with that location you know it'd be just compared to the neighboring uh leases which is probably leasing out at about 30 pounds per square foot per annum um that is definitely some room whereby we can actually enhance on the property to achieve that kind of rental rates so these are just some of the examples of the properties why the rates are so low is because the government requires it to be very affordable i don't think any government in the world would want to pay very high rent on properties and in order to entice them for a long lease we have it at that rate yes okay so st stay there charlty the next question is on on long wales okay whale stands for weighted average lease to expiry because i think in the uk it's it's called by something else but anyway uh uh so long whales are important for stability of distribution we'll recognize that and and your assets your portfolio has long wales but however you know there are rental escalations that are built into long leases and we've come across this in properties in the u.s and australia and so is there a danger of a cliff effect with negative rental reversions when leases are renewed and rents are marked to market okay that's one question and what the second part of this is what will the solution be for such cliff effects well i guess rental rates escalations you know typically growth in tandem with the um the inflation rates so there is a steady growth and of course if rents are structured in such a way whereby there's a fixed rental growth rate at a very high percentage what it ends up is that it actually doesn't matches um the inflation growth and hence you have at the end of the lease term a very high rental rates but when you look at the market rental rates it's actually much lower than that so so that that forms that cleave effect that that you're mentioning here but i guess what we have in our leases is that we have actually um got a lease which is actually linked to the cpi index and with the flooring cap as well so even if the cpi happens to grow beyond five percent we will not get the above five percent growth rates so it's sort of like being moderated out and ensure that at the end of the lease terms we are still in line with where the inflation rates are going and that helps in terms of stabilizing or preventing some form of a cleave effect for one and of course if as a portfolio manager we do we can actually diversify the um the leases into different years and that's where you know where rental rates are growing at different rates then then you won't also have that concentration of least expiry with just one um one kind of market rent rates that's happening on that particular year that you are seeing so these are probably some of the ways that we can we can look at in terms of structuring our leases to ensure that we don't have that effect well of course if you're able to do more asset enhancement into the buildings you know upbringing the quality of the building to a different level which actually takes into account a different kind of rental rates that is also some way that you can actually manage to sort of like stabilizes the rent uh more rather than you see a lot of like pith and troughs in your in your rental rates okay thanks okay matt you you mentioned long leases in your presentation um for the for your for the properties in in the uk is there any concern over cliff effects where you know you're passing rents a lot higher than your market rents and when the leases are up for renewal there is a marked market effect downwards in terms of rental reversions not really because actually the kind of indexation that chardin has uh has on her portfolio is relatively uncommon in the uk um relatively uncommon but highly sought after by investors um but yeah you you may get it sort of on logistics property more commonly occasionally on leisure property but you know it's quite unique um you know one of the perhaps you might argue that you know one of the challenges of uk real estate is the lack of indexation in the sense that you know if you were to buy an office property in birmingham at the absolute top of an economic cycle it's possible that in five years time when your rent has been reviewed the rent hasn't changed and then in the five years time when you it still hasn't changed and in five years time it still hasn't changed so you get zero rental growth over a 15-year period just because the economic cycle moves moved against you it can't go down but indexation is is is so highly sought after and yes you know i think we all know that it does create the potential for a cliff edge but actually for office property i always find myself saying you know the bigger challenge is is not the cliff edge it's that the property is getting older and older and older and you have obsolescence is probably the biggest challenge to people investing in offices because fashions change tenants want more um and at some point the owner of that asset has to write a big check to pay for upgrading that building i think that's a far bigger challenge than a cliff edge in rents okay right vijay you know we've had some reits that have problems with these cliffs yet what do you think is the solution to them you know we know that some of them passing rents were much higher than than market rents and there were a very sharp negative rental reversions because of that i think i think matt and charlene talk more about the indexation effect especially in europe markets but let's say in markets like us and australia what you have is that they have a long leases with inbuilt rent escalations meaning this is not dependent on inflation which is non-existent at this point of time the leases are escalated every two three percent per annum so what happens sometimes is that if there is a 10 year lease and at the end of the 10th year the rents would have escalated by 30 percentage and suppose if the market rents haven't kept in track with this kind of escalation you would see this cliff effect happening so what can be done i think one is more disclosure of information so if you are seeing overseas reads in particular they do give nowadays they do give a breakdown in terms of what is the market trend versus what is the passing rent of each and every individual property by this way investors are better informed if there is a cliff effect whether the unbuilt rents and the properties are keeping in track of the market or is there going to be a cliff effect the other base are avoiding is of course in the management so if the management is aware of such a cliff effect to happen how are they taking proactive steps are they at least communicating to the investors that there is a risk that this property is overrented so we do expect some sort of uh downward revision from this properties which investors should watch out for of course charlene talked about balancing the risk in terms of uh spreading out weighted average lease portfolio as well as having a mix of ones with longer lease and ones with a shorter lease can help in sometimes some words of balancing this risk so the key thing is information provide more information to investors so that the investors can judge for themselves how big the cliff effect is and how are you taking steps to balance this effect by diversification by diversifying your portfolio yes indeed and that's also one of the reasons why we see our reits growing bigger they're merging and they're making big acquisitions just so that they can diversify their whales yeah yeah okay so um let's move on um okay we will come to the questions from from the live questions from the audience in about 10 minutes okay but i just want to um have a couple more questions from from the previous from the questions that were sent in by um our viewers and um there is one question which is quite interesting on the advantages of an externally managed reit versus an internally managed reit you know there has been a long debate of which types of reits are more efficient and provide better return to investors and we have a case in singapore where a couple of hedge funds want to requisition an egm to remove the manager and internalize the reach so i just wondered whether the panel has any views on this uh could we start with you vijay i think there has been a long long debate in singapore which one is better whether internal or external is better my my personal uh preference is that i would say in a small domestic market like singapore where uh acquisitions is very competitive and you don't have uh when you face very difficulty if you are paying a small reit in terms of acquiring a portfolio etc an externally managed read with proper checks and balances works well singapore wants to become a how big a market you have if you want overseas players to come and list in singapore i think you need an externally managed tree that has become but what is more important is that externally managed should have proper checks and balances it has been proven right the amount of growth what singapore reads has seen in the last 20 years it actually took 50 more years for markets like us and japan to achieve the same amount of growth and that's mainly because and that's mainly because it's externally managed streets even in this market there is a steady pipeline of reach that want to list in singapore the reason is because it's also externally managed leads but the key key thing is that you should strike a balance in terms of regulations to make sure that such kind of happenings or a reit list for the purpose of growing the dividend income and reits should list so that the sponsors the investors can grow the dividend income along with the people who are listing the reads so that should be my personal personal preferences externally in managed leads works well for singapore and that's the model to go but where and when needed increase the regulation to make sure that such a kind of happenings doesn't uh happen indeed for example the case of equal hospitality okay thanks thanks okay dean well yours is an externally managed yes what would you say to those that think that it could be their gpus could be higher if it was internally managed okay i guess um you know people always complain about why externally managed reits are not actually in favor was more because of the of the um how they have been incentivized the fees that is being paid so i guess in singapore what has been very clear is that the reit managers fees are paid uh or mo at least if you see all the recent years listing the form has changed and basically the they are incentivized based on the uh returns of the um of the unit holders so they are aligned one i guess that's what vijay has mentioned as well the two which is one very important other factor is the governance and also the transparency so we do have a very stringent um governance for reits in singapore the amount of disclosure that we're required to make is extremely huge so that gives confidence to investors for external um external manager in addition we do need to have a board which is more than 50 50 or more being independent directors should it does not require uni holders to approve the um the board members so the presence of a huge amount a large amount of independent directors actually serves to scrutinize what the managers are doing and make sure that they are actually working in line with the government's governance policies that are put in place so that is one very important point that gives assurance to investors of a externally managed structure well of course there is also other advantage as external manager is that we could be able to tap on the sponsor's expertise you know tap on the sponsor supports when it's required so i do see that in the long run especially in in in southeast asia or in asia pacific except for australia this model has works and it proven that it can work well so i do think that the external managed model does works for reads as long as the key criteria is adhered to transparency and governance okay that's great okay so so we're externally managed reits have worked for singapore and they work very well to singapore so don't break something don't change something that isn't broken but now we'll stick with charlting because we have some questions on elite commercial read so um okay so there were a number of questions but i sort of try to amalgamate them and uh stay with stay with me charlene so comments on the possible dilution of the existing units due to your recent acquisition okay that's question one have you got that oh yes okay one second okay okay oh they okay so he uh uh there's a question on the cro okay we'll do them one by one all right so dilution yeah is there a dilution and uh uh some obviously investors are concerned about concerns with okay i guess we have make it uh quite clear that um the acquisitions that we are making uh is a creative so in our base case um we are talking about a 3.2 percent accretion um with a small fund raise that is going to the market now um so this is not a dilutive acquisition so i don't expect dilution in the in in our our units um should the market be non-conducive as in like we can't do an uh fundraise immediately to complete the transaction we have also ensured that the structure itself could ensure com that we can complete the transaction with the debt that we have in place of course that means uh increase a bit more gearing but that also implies that the accretion is much higher on this transaction the highest amount of accretion that we can actually achieve with this would to come to be about slightly above eight percent but of course it's not the objective of the reit manager to have a higher gearing in the long run our our intention is still to do a small race as per our base case scenario and then to bring it down bring down the gearing uh to a level that we are comfortable with which is about 37 in our base case with a small race and it's still a creative so that's where we are looking at so we it's not a dilutive acquisition here okay so the other question is is it was it nav uh dilutive or was it not i think it was neutral to any of you right neutral it's a still about 61 pence yes okay all right that's fine okay so um so so so there's another question on your borrowing costs okay so what are your borrowing costs someone said it's two percent and can this be improved i think there is more than just borrowing costs isn't it there's a the uh icr the uh cover ratio the interest cover ratio which is also quite quite uh good on your on your reach isn't it yes so yes could you give a comment on that and could you and i think the uh questioner is asking whether you could get lower interest rates because of the quality of your tenants and the occupancy rate right i guess um the rent rate the interest rates that we are taking now has actually built on the base of the stable rental incomes that we're collecting and the quality of the assets now um it's a very competitive uh um sort of like borrowing rate it's actually something that we think it's um it's actually something we think that is actually in line with the market so we have borrowed our um our borrowings from from uk and it's actually in pounds so actually um we do see a decrease in our cost of borrowing since listing we have actually reduced this by about 30 bips since the point we list till now because 50 of our loans are actually on fixed rate 50 is on floating so on the floating part of course we have been benefiting on the lower interest rates uh in the market but we think that this is actually a prudent mix it is not the reit manager's objective to be speculative on interest so with this particular interest rate we think that it's prudent and in terms of icr with the new acquisitions um even at a gearing of 37 we are looking at about five times um icr which is also very healthy for a reit as well so um in terms of the uh the rates we do think that the the reits um interest rates is quite competitive and compelling into uh that we have structured in and what portion is fixed is there a portion that's fixed or uh is what percentage is fixed currently our we have 50 of our um loans fixed and 50 on floating rates okay so we have managed to at least sort of like make sure that we know how much we are paying on half of it and the other half is actually still benefiting on the lower interest indeed lower interest rates yes indeed okay so um we will we'll take a question from the current viewers and um okay this question i think we'll start with we'll start with vijay okay vijay a singapore listed reits with overseas assets are traded substantially like well like manulife u.s reach over here there's an example and of course also elite although i know that your uh incoming unit holder believes that elite should be trading at four percent because of your tenant um it is still trading at like six six to seven percent isn't it seven percent right okay so all right so singapore listed reits with overseas assets and this is not just manual life and elite i think even cromwell i think it's like eight or nine percent now okay traded substantial discounts to their reits listed in their own markets why is this so and how can that discount narrow could you could you try to take that vijay first and then uh we'll ask chaldean what you can do to to get tighter yields on on her read i guess gola the obvious answer is firstly investors familiarity always investors familiarity plays important role investors know about capital land it's again comes back to the issue of how much i know about this and how how much premium i can be many investors are still in a learning path for markets like us and uk and singapore has also had a past history on some of the overseas companies listing here hasn't delivered up to their promises and that has happened in the past so it takes time for the investors to get in grasp with overseas markets overseas assets overseas regulatory environment so that's been building up so that's why it is very important for overseas uh listed singapore needs to educate the market to properly educate the market in terms of what is the asset positioning how is the market what is the regulatory landscape etcetera so it leads it is more of education perspective it was the first part of the equation and the second part is again uh the trust with the sponsors right some of the overseas the state reach we have seen recently is that there has been a trust issue so it becomes a sponsor so it becomes uh which sponsors and what is a track record so i think the key here is to educate the market in terms of both in terms of assets as well as the sponsor and eventually things will narrow you are now seeing that more singapore leads are going overseas so that is also a way to educate the market you are seeing ascendancy buying us uk big reads are going overseas so that would provide much more education and eventually once the investors are educated the discount will automatically narrow okay charlene um you know i know that one of your major unit holders whose incoming unit holds i think your reach should be trading at much lower levels what are your thoughts for that on that yes i guess um if you look at the how the reads are trading in in the london exchange um we are actually quite a premium to them we provide a higher yield to it like what vj says is education education education people are not familiar with the sector it's not familiar with the um the country's perspective unlike you know anyone that is investing in singapore understanding the whole reits market which has been around for years you know they understand the basics they are they are familiar with the sponsors and whereas people like us who has gone to the uk first it's not only the um the sponsors it's actually uk itself questions always pops out why are you going to uk and best brexit going on you know yes you know this always comes back this question again and again so it's the familiarity with the market the openness and the amount of data that is um that's available in terms of for investors is very very different from what we get in singapore like what matt has mentioned you know you can almost get any data in terms of transactions past transactions um in in uk so and completion time of acquisitions is so much faster we have seen a property of similar to what we are investing um that was put on sale in in london during the lockdown period it was put onto the market and was completed within seven days so that's the kind of speed that they are able to do because of the information that's being available to to investors so these are things that our investors needs to understand when they come to read they need to understand the market they need to understand the um the read itself so we believe that in the long run with continuous education and also to ensure that the read is moving at the right direction confirming and proving to investors what they are delivering i think that will give the confidence to investors in the singapore market to invest in foreign reads and that will eventually bring down the yields to a level which we believe where it should be okay thanks thanks but just to stay stay uh uh here chardin for a moment there was a question i think it's just disappeared it was on the on on the tax um is there a tax leakage i know that some foreign reits um have tax leakages and some of them have give all that they managed to to have actually no tax in in the foreign jurisdictions because in singapore we all know that there's a tax transparency if you have local assets and there's no tax on the reach there's no tax on us investors when we are on our gpu either could you just give an indication of the tax leakage in the in at the reit level okay i guess for elite commercial we won't say that there's actually a tax leakage we do pay corporate taxes in the uk so other than the corporate tax that's being paid locally there's actually no other taxes that is actually chargeable to the wheat when we talk about dividend remission back to singapore so it's it's the same so it's only the local corporate tax that we are paying do you get a lower tax if if you have a certain structure like i think in australia we have the managed trust uh regime where you get a 10 or 11 percent tax uh not on the uh the structure that we are having however i guess it's always in the mind of mind of the read manager we are exploring and seeing that you know with consultations to a lot more tax advisors if we are able to um enhance the tax structure we'll definitely quickly do that and bring that benefit back to our investors here in singapore okay so matt are you still with us because it's very early in the morning you're still there right is there any way we can get the lowest tax possible as singaporean investors in the uk what's the best way and i'm sure you've you've advised people on this now tell us no no absolutely no you know i i don't give tax advice and i'm not going to start now okay so is there any is there any structure for a fund or a trust of a property trust to get a a more efficient tax rate um again it's not my especially subject you know all i would say is is the uk is relatively unique in a sense we don't tax non-domestic investors differently to domestic so you know it's a level playing field you come and buy property in the uk you pay the same taxes locals unlike if you go to the us i'm sure there are ways around it but you know consult a good good firm of accountants okay so we'll take there's another question from our viewers and it's similar to a question that i've skipped here and that is which is the you know which asset class offers the best value in in singapore today and you know we had this question we had a question earlier what reach sectors are likely to be the most promising in the next three years retail commercial industrial logistics hospitality healthcare or data centers maybe we should start here with vijay maybe vijay you could take this first and then we we let's ask matt what he thinks are the best asset classes uh the outlook for the best asset classes in the uk okay i think i would take this question from an income resilience and demand perspective right i mean there are two ways right you know the data centers i mean from a resilience income demand perspective its data centers definitely the most promising asset class followed by logistics which has also been most promising as a class and i would say business parks and healthcare would rank subsequently right again these are all from an income resilience perspective of course reits has a two two sides of coin to it whether valuations how much valuation suspected but purely from a perspective of income resilience demand where there is going to be a lot of demand the preference is data center logistics health care and followed by routine business bucks okay matt what's the outlook for your uk property in terms of sectors then yeah i think you know i would generally agree with which i think you know logistics it has been the world's probably most popular real estate asset class for you know quite a number of years now and i think there is no doubt that it will continue and if you're looking at the uk you know we have a very high adoption of online shopping and it's going to continue to rise and if i was looking at other parts of europe i would say the same thing's going to happen so i would probably buy logistics but it's very very expensive right right the years are very tight now aren't they logistics yeah yeah everybody wants to buy it you know this is not a uk story that you know the yields for the first time ever on logistics or pretty much around the world are lower than yields on retail uh slightly contraceptively i look at bits of retail i think um this sort of blanket repricing of saying all retail is bad we will never go to a shop again um is wrong and i think we're seeing a lot more investor interest in what we call in the uk and europe retail warehousing which is you know relatively cheap warehouses full of furniture and carpets and white goods they've proven to be very covert friendly uh good for social distancing lots of car parking they've re-priced it in line with the rest of the market but the type of goods they sell are not the type of things that people buy on the internet so i think there's a there is a bit of a contraceptive play there if you're an expert in retail but you know again amongst all the noises about seniors housing and data centers these are tiny tiny asset classes just in terms of the direct market and if you wanted to buy a reit share that in these that they know some of them were almost non-existent um i think you know most of the money will end up going to cbd offices it always as investors go to a risk-off strategy globally coming out of a recession they say we'd like to buy all these things and then they go well the only liquid area of the market is big office buildings in london paris new york tokyo and that's what they will buy and that's where the performance will be okay charlie you don't have much choice because you've only got commercial property but if you had 100 million and you were going to start your own read what would you buy we are not just commercial property you know the uniqueness is that we are actually very much an infrastructure related commercial property right so it is very unique it's different and it's despite covet despite a downturn we are there to stay and even in the good times you know the growing population of the aging population in uk is the one that requires the facilities for pensioners so we are always there so i'll buy elite commercial read then okay so everybody that's uh that's that's the takeaway i've got one more question look there is another elephant in the room and that and that is interest rates okay so i think this will be the last question um so what are the what are the panels views on the direction of interest rates would a post covered 19 economic recovery cause inflation and hence put up with pressure on interest rates because we know that interest rates uh are very pertinent to reits and the effect rates in at least three to four ways vijay you start i think the talk about interest rates rising has been there for quite some time right and especially in especially in the post-government world i think the focus now is not an interest rate even if you look at central banks they have been adjusting their targets like job economy as well as a job restoring back the jobs is the most pertinent target which they have rather than inflation even fed us come out to say that the two percent target which we had is going to be an average target so i think inflation is at least two three years out from though and that is not the main concern we have at this point of time whether there will be hyperinflation whether the inflation would come back strongly or not i don't have an answer to it but i think at least for the next two three years inflation is not on the horizon that's my view so from an inflation perspective i don't expect that to impact rates in the next one two years at least so you don't expect interest rates to arise okay charlie in your portfolio are you even considering that you should be having a lot more of your loans hedged or you do you think interest rates are going to remain low and you've got the right amount i think we do have a right mix but in the long run interest rates might increase but it's not going to be immediate you know um we don't see the economy recovering um immediately after coving the impact and the effects would be will last out for a couple of years more of course at the back of it there's still brexit that's overhanging it depends on the outcome the economy it's you know how it's going to perform we expect that in terms of the pound sterling um the the interest rates is going to remain at a low level for quite a period of time okay okay matt brexit brexit and brexit does brexit have any impact on interest rates um well i suppose it it could uh you know if if there was a massively disorderly brexit and and everything fell apart and we it was a bit of divorce and the uk economy suffered then interest rates theoretically might have to go down but there's not a lot of headroom and i think you know people have been as vj was saying people have been predicting you know the normalization of interest rates pretty steadily since the global financial crisis and it hasn't happened if you wanted one thing that economists consistently get wrong it's interest rates going to go up next year um sat where we are today you know most governments on the planet um have you know their debt to gdp ratios are at record levels there is no prospect i see you know in particularly in in the western economies um of a sharp rise in inflation um and and hence a need to move interest rates they will go up but they're not going to normalize back to the levels that we we saw in in the 70s 80s or 90s so it's i wouldn't worry about interest rates there's a lot more things to worry about out there than that oh okay thanks thanks matt you you can go off and have breakfast now good luck because we we've run out of time and so thank you everybody for joining us and thank you the panelists for joining us today and sharing your great insights and thank you audience in the digital world i hope we can meet face to face uh sometime next year yeah so and to our viewers if you've

#gengrit",growing up it has made me exposed to mental health conditions at an early age to a point where i think by the time i was four i was telling my parents i am experiencing anxiety so they found a stranger at foyo using the word anxiety [Music] [Music] it just flared non-stop to a point where um i couldn't really straighten or bend my limbs because the moment i moved my arm or straightening it my flesh would just crack to a point where my i think my limbs had no more skin on it it was just flash like raw flesh so it was really a very trying time for me i think at that point i was just following instructions and i didn't pay attention to how i was feeling emotionally but my skin was so bad that it was very hard for me to go to school also so i was getting bullied because i smelled bad it was like a rotting smell bloody smell and it was just very hard for me to go to school and at that time also i think i had a lot of anxiety [Music] everyone thought that i was just being very naughty but i don't blame them i really feel like at that point there was not enough education out there about mental health about what were the side effects of going through medical trauma that was causing me to act in this way i think it was just a lot of enduring the treatments and also at the same time dealing with the emotions i felt from being rejected or not accepted or being discriminated against because i think kids like when they're younger they don't really know when someone is different from them and because i was smelly and i looked scary they would call me a freak or like don't touch that weirdo um if i touch that person right then i will get it too so it was quite a lonely experience for me growing up until i think when i was 20 that was when i realized that i actually had a bigger issue [Music] [Music] really enjoy the work that i'm doing because i can see how now they're more resources for young people as compared to them when i was suffering i never had anyone tell me i think that maybe you had this or this is a sign and symptom of such and such i feel like these are important things to learn about even for people who do not have any of these conditions because you never know who around you is actually going through something and the help that you could possibly provide for them you ,False,True,True,False

That could be due to increased mental preparedness following the SARS outbreak. Associate Professor Vijay Kumar Sharma from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Sociology Professor Paulin Straughan from Singapore Management University discussed the research and mental preparedness among Singapore's healthcare workers.

psychological distress when compared with previous outbreaks that could be due to increased mental preparedness following SARS for a closer look we're joined by associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma in the NUS a young rule in School of Medicine and by sociology professor Pauline strong from the Singapore Management University thank you both for joining us I will come to you first a pleasure Vijay how much correlation is there actually between increased mental preparedness and stringent infection control measures versus anxiety and psychological distress levels among healthcare workers you know it started from the South period when in 2003 we were attacked by us there were about 238 individuals which got infection and surprisingly 97 which makes about 41 percent of them were healthcare workers and the mortality at that time was 14 percent so there was a lesson to us and that prompted us that we should be prepared that something like this can hit us again so in the car you know I take it back like this that probably we were anticipating there's something like kovat 19 we'll be coming back again so since 2003 we had implemented an Hospital very strict infection control measures they were training programs for masks hand-washing and they were very frequently done almost like six monthly everybody has to undergo that kind of training so that prepared us so what happened the as soon as we got this Cove in 1900 at least our all health care workers they were immediately mentally prepared that we can jump into this war field and then we can battle it out definitely so this was actually this showed that we were mentally prepared now one important thing in this fighting you know such an outbreak like covert 19 is that we should have knowledge and we should have confidence so we were prepared with the knowledge because Hospital had prepared you know education programs there was a transparency we were updated on a daily basis what was the condition of it 19 how old 19 gets infected how people get infected how to prevent yourself from getting infected all these things they were in place so that prepared from knowledge point of view and confidence we were trained strongly and for a very long period how to fight infections how to be clean how to prepare ourselves for this infection probably that prepared us to fight this battle so we were both strong in another confidence as well as mentally preparedness from our experience so professors Vijay saying that then how is the situation here in Singapore compared with other parts of the world that are also struggling and you know dealing with cover 19 so I can talk about the healthcare workers so I I told you about the about a Singapore story but what happened outside there are very very few studies which are available on healthcare workers what is psychological impact of this illness whatever we have we have got a couple of studies one came up from Italy one came up from China and it was seen that almost all work health care workers they were having some kind of psychological impact and it was at least moderate in severity you know it is big it's to be taken in account that both these countries Italy as well as China they were massively hit the the you know the magnitude of impact of covenant infection was immense the Italian studies showed that about 10% of those who got the infection they were actually health care workers so this was such a heavy toll they will definitely be having much more psychological anxiety stress depression and all kind of emotional reactions which was seen in media you know from Italy and China they were probably reflection of the magnitude of the scale of this event and we know we know it that Europe and best they were never prepared for such kind of attacks they never have suffered these kind of attacks its Asia Africa which have been going through all these attacks in between you know the epidemics they keep coming so we were definitely mentally as well as physically as well as from resources point of view are definitely better prepared and professors drawn we're one week into the circuit breaker now and already some tightened measures have been kicked in as a result of some who've been so testing boundaries if you like based on what you've observed so far are people behaving in in a way that's sort of expected during a time like this office let me thank all our healthcare workers I think that they really deserve our admiration and praise and for keeping things in control so with regards to the general public right I think we had the opposite right Vijay said that the health care workers the professionals were prepared for for the next infectious disease you know attack and therefore when Kovac came they were already the lay public on the other hand we've been so safe in Singapore we have been so used to having you know a very peaceful life so this came as a big shock to us right and when the measures stepped in that we had to vary our normal everyday life it took the Singaporeans along the time to get used to it because I just don't understand at one lever you know that this disease is so infectious and at another lever it is also difficult to break from norm habits because we we have lived in the very very densely packed society we're used to rubbing you know elbows with each other so therefore if I'm not touching you that's already the social distance in my mind right so what more there's 1 meter 2 meter thing so I think we had to learn and I think the way Flender had laid out you know the rules as they're lay it on was quite remarkable it demonstrated to me and made me realize that it was a step by step calibrator approach and in every stance you know government had trust the Singaporeans you know to to abide by the boundaries and when we failed then most stringent rules had to be stepped in had to be Roden because we had to protect the vulnerable so I think that at the end of the day most Singaporeans okay obviously when you go out to the streets now it's very empty people are law-abiding no one is crowding you out in the supermarket or in the hawker centres and we're trying our best to to be good citizens and to do our part we hear of you know those who are you know who break the rules because for whatever reason but most of them I think most cases because they don't understand but by and large I think the community has pulled together this is certainly one of the better places to be in at this time in this global crisis I think all of us who live in Singapore are very grateful that we are here so or in oh I think we're doing what we're doing out our best we can do better and I'm sure in the weeks to come we will demonstrate that we will be able to do better okay well thank you both for speaking to us this evening associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma from the NUS young Newland school of medicine and sociology professor Pauline stron from

is available for purchase on the world scientific website and also in major bookstores across singapore without further ado i will now hand over to professor david chan who will speak for about 20 minutes and followed by a question and answer session prof chan please thank you uh eugene i hope you can see me hi everybody david chan as eugene from word publisher has informed you this is the first time i think we are doing this just for the record it is not really a book launch it is a book talk as most of you would have known by now this book is about the kovic knighting crisis and i decided to write it quite recently and then the book was published in fact in july so it's just about a few weeks old i think it's available on the website uh available at the bookstores and when world publisher uh uh wsbc uh scientific and i we talked about having a book launch obviously we cannot because of the physical restrictions of gathering and then we ask ourselves should we do an online book launch instead and i said no maybe not i think what we should do is the book talk and the reason being that instead of publicizing a book which is not an intention perhaps the intention is for us to have a conversation that's why we decided to do this live i was told that right now we have about a few hundred people uh listening in and i'm unable to see you unfortunately you can see me i hope and some of you are my friends but there are many of you according to the registration list that i actually do not know who you are and i apologize for that but uh from the organizations or the occupations that you listed i noticed that we have a few hundred people right now listening in who are from diverse segments of the population we not only have academics we have policy makers we have people of course from the public private and the people sector and there are just a few of us who are just logging in uh just uh having an afternoon listening to a chat talk and so on so first let me thank you once again uh for spending your precious friday with us uh what i'll do is i'll just spend the next few minutes not too long uh very casually colloquially and formally to chat with you about some of the ideas that i've written in the book in order for us to reflect on not just the last few months that has happened quite quite dramatically to the world and to us by looking forward and say what can we learn from some of these lessons and my purpose of doing this talk is really for us to think through uh because it is really a protracted crisis right it is not something that uh that is just going to come and go in a very short while and from all predictions uh you know for the next year or so not only we cannot travel for your holidays there's going to be quite a great disruptions in every aspect of our lives um and the way i see how we can organize our thoughts and reflection whether it is for individual actions or for collective action or for policy making or even as an employer or a co-worker how do we navigate the harsh realities that's ahead of us perhaps is to look back and document and think through and reflect uh what how have we behaved how have uh the government behave how has the businesses behave uh how have our family and friends and ourselves behave and the way we think the way we feel can we learn from these lessons in the past few months because if it is a protracted crisis uh things that have just happened could very well happen again and i'm referring not just to waves of infection it could very well be in the case of singapore that there could be another outbreak in the dorm that could be an outbreak in the community when we have certain gatherings or when the fiscal restrictions are eased a bit further and if we are complacent uh if we are not socially irresponsible or even if even if we are and there could be things that happen and when we find ourselves having to go through different types of restrictions again it could also mean that those of you who have gone back to the office may not be able to have to go and go back home and start working from home it could also be a same business model that you have been working on and you thought it is fine i'm going to revert back to my old business model and then you find that you can't do that again so perhaps the way to look at it is to organize the kind of information that we already know after the six or seven months of outbreak uh into three types of issues which i'll briefly share with you about and then i hope to be able to pause and take live questions uh that from you uh eugenia will be able to see the questions that you put into the chat box i'm unable to see for technical reasons and then i'll let the eugenia decide what questions to ask so that i get to hear from each one of you and try to address issues perhaps issues that are not even listed in the book now back to the issues that we want to organize to reflect ourselves to reflect about the issues i tend to look at it as three broad issues and the first issue is for all of us to understand the context of this virus and the second issue to understand the leadership and the public responses in reaction to this crisis and then the third type of issue is about the psychological preparedness for that all of us have to be prepared as we move forward as we think and as we look forward so the first issue is about the context now by now unless you're living in a cave right all of us know that it is a pandemic um by pandemic if you think the epidemiological or public health definition it simply means that you know when you have an epidemic that's already occurring in various countries in multiple continents and then you get declared as a pandemic like what wh o the world health organizations did some months back but i would say that this is really a crisis of pandemic proportions and by that i mean that it is not just a health crisis right by now we all know that it is also an economic crisis and even not just an economic crisis it is really a crisis that has multi-faceted dimensions it has affected us sociologically socially politically psychologically and so on um and so it means that it's quite important for all of us to come together it's not just a political propaganda kind of a statement to say let's work together and much stronger together i think the important point is for us to be a bit more humble all of us take a step back and say you know there are things that i have assumed things that i thought i knew perhaps i don't know everything and i don't know as much as i thought and it is time to look around look back on the assumptions that we have made whether it is in organization leadership business or just the way we react to uh we relate to our families and think through and ask ourselves say are there things that we could have done better what are some of the things that we have done that in retrospect uh we really shouldn't have done it not so much of hindsight buyers but actually over there in the past when you look at the information that we had we could at that time have made another decision which could have been better but i know it's the kind of a humility that i hope that all of us can can have and the kind of a spirit that when we have whether you are reading this book an article or speaking to another person or having a meeting to review issues and so on so the context of the crisis then uh the pandemic crisis crisis that we're in the the properties if you like the features of the crisis it is very very important it is not something that is just meant for academics or public health professionals or profession or politicians to profess about but let me try and explain this this pandemic is one that's undergoing exponential growth so what that means is that if you just follow me here if you have a graph that's on the x-axis representing time it really means that when we say this evolving rapidly it is not a straight line right it is actually a curvy linear line it's an exponential curve it goes this way and then it goes out very rapidly so you know that is why it is not surprising at all for those of us who understand the statistics behind the spread that within a few months you find that the numbers get doubled in the shorter time so we actually we as globally the world actually managed to reach a 10 million cases in about six months or so and right now in seventh month you already have more than 20 million right and it also means that if status quo or if nothing is done if people or government do not take precautions and continue to be complacent or become more likes the cases could increase dramatically and when that happens it also means that governments have no choice but to take actions in order to protect its citizens that means you could go back and revert back to lockdowns and so on we have already seen this internationally we saw this in vietnam we saw this in hong kong even new zealand which has been a model you find that just recently there are some cases again and the government has decided to impose a some kind of a restriction restricted lockdown so in singapore we seem to be pretty fortunate as some of us would say in a sense that while there are quite a number of cases in a relatively short time compared to the population they are relatively contained within the doms of course it raises a second a different issue about what's happening in the dormitories uh in the case of the community the cases are quite low and in fact it has been falling at rather low and stable for the past few weeks um just bear in mind that there are cases that are mount symptoms or asymptomatic uh from all evidence we can tell the virus is still in the community somewhere and that is why you can continue to have community cases which are unlinked there could also be people who get the virus but because it's asymptomatic and you just rest and you recover from it and there could be that time that you are actually also infectious so i just want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that wearing your mask social safe distancing and all the safe management rules are actually as important if not more important than the previous months that we have been vigilant and so on i think that's an important point for us to note when we think about the context of the kovit 19 virus now the second thing i just want to talk about is the leadership and the public reaction right and that presupposes or rather a premise on the important issue about adaptation demands now what do i mean by that it means that when we are confronted with this crisis there is not just a crisis of public health but economically it has affected businesses affected families and in a very drastic way because of the lockdowns and various fiscal restrictions on people movements and people mingling in the community we find ourselves confronted with demands that we have never experienced before now some of you i know will disagree with me and say look david we have gone through various crises we have gone through the sas crisis we have gone through september 11 we have gone through asian global financial crisis you know in about the last 17 20 and even as recently as the last 10 years now i would argue that all these experiences that we had which we did well we came back and bounced back quite quickly are really qualitatively quite different from what we are going through now for one this is a very protracted crisis the second this is an extremely multi-dimensional crisis unlike the previous crisis where the domains or the people who are affected are relatively contained and in some sense if you were to just spend less money if you were to just hunker down be more disciplined be more prudent you know when the crisis in the past blows over we can come back and this is like business as usual from all that we can tell now i think people recognize that when this crisis is over it's going to be quite some time but even then even if it's eventually over things will never be back to a pre kovit 19 status so hence the term post pandemic realities and what those post pandemic gravities are becomes important but even before we get to the post pandemic realities i for the past few months have gone through various demands demands that are new to us right you know in the past some of us love to work at home and we thought that working from home is wonderful and it is a privilege that belongs to only some select field now after working from home for many months some of you actually detest you know i don't like to work from home and to be fair uh even from day one there are many families that find that working from home is really quite tough especially when they coincide with hpl right the home-based learning where you have to deal with take care of your kids to make sure that things are okay take care of households and all happening at the same time where you are doing zoom like this having a meeting and having to meet the demands of your bosses so we were in a situation where the demands were completely novel to us you know i i'm very very sure that none of us have had the experience of having to work at home not by choice but by constraint for several months right just that alone is something quite dramatic for many of us but much more important than that where the economic crisis the smes and that we're talking about almost three quarter of the singapore's population have gone through a very tough time and that economic uh difficulties that that the people have gone through actually spilled over to many many different parts of our lives of the singapore society and it's not just an economic issue and that is something that leadership becomes important our public responses become important how do we deal with some of these negative reactions that will happen how do we enhance and make sure that that continues to be social responsibility and how do we make sure that anything that is negative can be contained can be dealt with very quickly and also for example when we start having technology to do contact tracing uh you know do people have that trust uh in what you say as a government that you are respecting the privacy the information you collected uh the way that you're dealing with it is indeed the way that you would actually deal with it so issues of public trust all this becomes important and of course you will need to read the book uh to understand my views or to to get a sense of what i think is happening in the dormitories uh and how we have dealt with that successfully but also at some parts where communications especially could have been much better and those are very important issues i think for policy makers uh public servants some of you are probably listening in right now uh to reflect on because as time goes by remember the same things can happen again and when the same things happen again we really need to do better than the first time that we did because we all should have learned from the consequences of certain mistakes or certain things that we should have done otherwise and so so the first issue as i said is the context of the virus the the pandemic that we need to understand the second issue is about the importance of leadership the importance of trust and the importance of the public responses in terms of being socially responsible how to handle the negative reactions as we adapt to the various demands and the final thing that i just wish to say is the notion of psychological preparedness um many of us will just use the the term say resilience you know let's go through with it and so on it is really much more than that right the good news is that if you were to reflect back on the the various months that we have gone through even people who found themselves in difficulty took time not just to appreciate our frontline workers but also took time to help out with people who are in in fact to seek them out but not just our friends but even strangers and that kind of positivity that all of us have in the sort of innate in us it is a very effective counter to the negativity that we sometimes have no choice but experience with the difficult demands that come along and in the book what i try to explain is that there is no contradiction to feel negative sometimes and sometimes you really ought to feel negative when things are not right with the notion that we need to enhance the kind of positivity that all of us have as individuals as groups as organizations or collectively as a society so in the third part of the book what i did was try to let us take a step back think through about the positivity constructs that we all know about actually and how to apply that in our personal lives apply that of course at the workplace and also apply that in your policy making in your communications for those of you are policy makers because it's a protracted crisis uh positivity is just critical i think if we are not uh aware of positivity and if we don't start enhancing positivity i think it is very difficult for us to develop the social and psychological capital that we need for the country to emerge stronger and for the country to actually go through this crisis there are going to be a lot of practical things that uh uh uh to be sure they're gonna be a lot of practical difficulties right that we will face uh let me just give you a quick example because i noticed that while it is being talked about in mainstream media uh maybe less so in social media i don't think it has been given the kind of attention that uh it deserves you notice that during the the crisis and it's still ongoing there are many people who have lost their jobs and we are very concerned uh and everyone is very concerned right both the people in the government with people from lower income families and you want to make sure that they are taken care of you know that they can still have their meals they can pay their rent and things are okay with them on a very basic sustainable basis but i think what we have forgotten also is that it's not just the lower income right there are people who are in what we call the middle class even the upper middle class that as a result of the crisis you could have closed down your business you could have lost your jobs it is quite a different set of issues altogether because what happened is that for many of these people who have been getting a very decent salary all their lives suddenly when they move from a state of self-reliance to a state of dependence and when you're in a state of dependence uh when we're not careful uh when things are not clear you might first not get the help that you need and second you might actually lose the dignity that you have so it is very important i think for the government for the organizations and employers to recognize that uh the people that we have been dealing with the people that you know that we have been dealing with on the day-to-day basis where you think that everything is fine you can take care of yourself might not be quite true right in the next few months or even one or two years to follow it is important for us to be sensitive to their needs uh needs which traditionally we think that it will not occur to them because they are self-sufficient individuals so to speak so that is a something that i think we need to give much more attention to both in the media in policymaking as as employers and co-workers we will need to look out for each other i would love to go on and on but i don't think i should uh the purpose really of uh having this job talk uh the purpose of having this book talk uh is to really uh get a conversation going with all of you and i hope that all of you could uh be very frank and ask questions by typing into your chat box any questions that come into mind we probably cannot address all questions i'll leave it completely to eugenia to select the questions and then can speak aloud so that everybody can hear the questions and we try to deal with these issues each one of them as much as we could in the remaining 20 minutes we have so we're on time we have exactly 21 minutes now to take some of your questions uh thank you eugene can i hand it back to you thank you very much for your insightful comments let us now begin the q a session i can see that we already have quite a few questions from our live audience um so the very first question is from justin and justin says question for dr david chan amid the health pandemic and a economic depression on the brink of occurring was kovit 19 a gift so as to speak that it polarizes the structural changes that are already occurring even before covet 19 and that kovit 19 was the catalyst of that forced singaporeans to adapt and transform digitally on top of that do you see singapore coming out stronger mentally after this covet 19 crisis especially those growing up and entering the job market as a fresh grad thank you all right thank you justin i think your question really has four questions in it right the idea of generally uh is this the plus or minus and secondly whether structurally uh it actually is useful right it's a blessing in disguise so to speak and you give the example of digital digitization right where singapore and many other countries are trying to push us towards not just cashless payment but to make use of a digital electronic communications ict information communication technology much more and the assumption is that there have been some resistance either by employers by different segment of the population and this kobe 19 is therefore a blessing in disguise it has catalyzed and forced us to go ahead and do that but in so doing uh which is the third and fourth question whether people are affected are there going to be some people that is going to fall behind and uh and do better or do worse so uh i not sure if i can take all four questions but let me just say this right uh in most crisis uh there's always plus and minuses the very obvious thing is that the initial reactions as you notice uh what i try to say in my book is that you must pay attention to the negatives first because in the crisis management any good leadership will know that if you are not paying to the to the situation of preventing the adverse consequences from happening and when you let it happen when it is actually preventable there is no chance to talk about positivity later because you simply cannot bounce back right so i think most governments in uh in the world except for some which i shall not name most governments in the world actually did the right thing by very quickly uh ring fencing by very quickly doing lockdowns either partial lockdowns or full lockdowns contact tracing people and having what we call relatively harsh fiscal restriction kind of a rules whether you are from the eastern or western culture they proceeded with it and i thought those were very important and correct things from the public health perspective as well as from an economic perspective because if we don't take care of the public health situation and let it run out of control we cannot talk about you know bouncing back economically and so on so it is never an either though you take care of the life first without life you can't have livelihood and so it was right in the first few months to focus so much attention on the life and sometimes even at the expense right requiring businesses to close down and by and large i think people are reasonable they understood that situation but you cannot maintain this situation forever and hence you needed to focus back on the economy to bounce back because people need livelihood and so on now the plus that justin talked about is about the digitization i think it's a yes or no clearly for those of us who refuse to learn zoom and some of you have now learned zoom because now you're with me myself included right i've never used zombie for the kovit 19 and now we know how to use zoom and that has been helpful without zoom i probably it's not so easy for me to have an audience of several hundred listening to me right now uh and then i could only share it with a more limited group of people so clearly what uh what the kovit 19 unintended positive consequence that has happened is that inmate digitization the good things about digitization happening faster than it should because we are forced to do it so you do not talk about communications talk about delivery and so on but remember the faster you do it when we are not careful and when you don't have a caring and a good government to take care of things there will be people who will get left behind right people who are not necessarily just elderly folks but people who may not just be having conducive environment to do things electronically if we don't take care of these individuals and these families then you will see the the larger the digital divide in singapore we are pretty okay because i think uh government ngos and people do pay attention to this widening digital divide and as we move along we just make sure that nobody is left behind so it is not a given that things will all be positive but what we can do is to ensure that the positive to be and the positives don't turn into negatives eugenia all right um so another question from alif so alice is wondering what is the psychological impact of how people view work moving forward and what are some tips you might want to give to better leaders i suppose i suppose leaders you men are leaders in the organization but actually it will also mean leader national leaders right our political leaders because they have a great say and a great impact in their policy and decisions on a day-by-day basis to affect how organizations structure their businesses structure their work and so on i think the psychology of work of course is multi-dimensional but the psychology of work is pretty important uh let me just go back to the example i gave right the example that uh that your traditional groups that you are vulnerable we tend to think about vulnerable groups as elderly people you know people who cannot find for themselves you think about low income you think about people with with various fiscal or mental disabilities yes these are vulnerable groups in fact because precisely they are well-defined vulnerable groups uh government and ngos pay a lot of attention to them so in the history of our country i think we are quite confident that we will try our very best to make sure these individuals don't fall behind too much and make sure we equip them with the necessary skills not just for survival but to to actually do well subsequently to have a social mobility to have a good good quality of life so to speak uh recall that i mentioned that there are many of us who may classify ourselves as middle class or upper middle class doing very well you could even be staying in a private housing estate but things have changed so much that suddenly you find yourself in both economic and social difficulties now these are the individuals i think we need to be very very careful now recall that we have a jobs council uh started a chat by uh senior minister tarman where we are going to have uh trying to create job opportunities training ships so that you can transit and take up something before you move on to a permanent job and so on the message will be and i can understand the message is that we should not be choosy you know you should learn to adapt and you should take up the jobs but you also need to understand you meaning all of us need to understand that it is not easy for somebody who have been living a life of self-reliance for many many years having a decent salary with a mortgage to pay and a family to support to suddenly change and do a job where you are quite skillless where you don't have a necessary skill to do it for long what will happen well people may just not do the job or when people who do the job they will not actually perform well so when you ask about the question of the psychology at work it might sound fluffy to you but i would say it is totally critical for us to ensure that as we create jobs as we find people and move people to jobs never forget the importance of the fit between your job demands and the job skills and the interests that you have because those interests while you can develop there are some sets of things that you can imagine some sets of things you can't match now what can we do as a co-workers or employers in the organization you can do relatively simple things that are free of charge you can make your job make the redesign the job so that it's more meaningful so that when the worker is doing it the worker continues to feel motivated because you are able to use the skills that you have and able to work with people to accomplish a task and see how the tasks relate to what i'm doing so the sense of responsibility the sense of autonomy the sense of meaningfulness in a job is absolutely critical it will continue to make us motivated to learn new skills to stay in the job to do well and so on so so don't take this as a transient things and and don't send the message that everybody please lower your expectations yes we need to be realistic in our expectations but it doesn't mean that we need to sacrifice the meaning of work because the purpose of work and remember this for all employers and all psychologists or policy makers we must make sure that through work we enhance our human dignity and develop it and not to work you diminish the dignity that we have regina yep right so the next question is singapore has been doing very well in handling the pandemic compared to many other countries so why do we still hear so many criticisms do you think these criticisms are ignorant or unfair well that question is quite tough because you started with a premise that singapore is doing very well relative to other countries is that a fact well it is a fact in from many perspectives uh but it may not be effect from other perspectives if you look at death rates we are exceedingly low you know we are very good and that's because of our wonderful not just healthcare facilities but the healthcare workers that we have their commitment and so on but it's also because of the ecosystem the healthcare ecosystem right whereby it is very well linked with other public services linked well with contact tracing we are very good in our contact racing and also with the political and civil service leadership that they had to make difficult decisions so it is a whole health ecosystem that that we have built up uh and so we managed to actually on the healthcare front did very well in a in context raising uh in the quality of the healthcare now from that perspective i would say that we are among the top in the world uh and that is something that you don't just accomplish overnight right it took a four-sided to build up but then there are other things that some people will say that well how did the large number of infections occur at the dormitories uh there are various perspectives to it right i can't go into detail given the little time that we have but as i try to say in the book that there are some things that we could have controlled better but there are other things that we actually did extremely well so whether we did well compared to other countries it very much depending on who is evaluating it and which aspect of the issues that we are looking at it is true right compared to many other countries we have been doing a pretty well in many dimensions but don't let that get into our heads you know and be complacent and say you know we are wonderful and so on and bear in mind that even if we have done really well we have to open our borders at some point it's 20.5 million right now and is and all over around us there are there are many infections we can't close your bottles for too long right and then soon you have to deal with imported cases community cases and so on so i think that is kind of a reality check when we make the assumption that we have done relatively well to other countries so i'll just end this answering this question with one more point and that is that the question seems to also assume that why singaporeans or people living in singapore could be singaporeans pr or foreigners tend to be very harsh right with either the authorities on how we manage the crisis because the question says why are we criticizing are we ignorant are we unfair in every country yes there will be some very negative criticisms of the authorities of everybody in fact that are ignorant that are unfair that happens in every country and there's no reason to think that singapore will not have a segment of people that adopt that attitude but i dare say that that is a statistical minority that most people when they criticize it is not based on ignorance or unfair right it was based on a contextual situation that you were completely affected by the crisis and there's lots of uncertainty it was volatile and the situation was such that um the response either in policy or people or yourself or your family were not meeting those demands and those challenges adequately and in the absence of good communication then the criticisms arise so i would argue that don't blame it on the people the critic being ignorant or unfair there will be some but understand why those criticisms occur especially when those criticisms are occurring and they are surprising to you because you thought that you have been doing very well when i say you it refers not just to policy makers it could be an employer of an organization and so on right so i want to take these opportunities to call out those of you who have some influence right in leadership positions uh do not always not always to not uh try to whenever possible externalize the problems right the first step is to have the humility to say hey could it be me could it be my policy could it be my leadership reaction that actually caused this as opposed to saying that oh people are full of negativity in the way they criticize they are ignorant they are unfair you know what we need to avoid in the country and everywhere else is a kind of destructive cynicism people who just criticize with no good reasons right regardless of the facts but what we want to promote is actually not just positivity what we want to promote is also a sense of healthy skepticism because we need a population they are able to descend right to be able to know that when someone say something what is the evidence for the claims uh we need to ask because transparency and accountability are important once we adopt that attitude uh things will be much better you know and you want to turn the person with a healthy skepticism to one who is actually positive understand the situation do well and then we can work collectively together and then you can talk about notions that emerge together stronger and so on gina yep thank you paul johnson you mentioned borders reopening i have a question here about that so from ac he is asking kobit will be here for a while and when the borders reopen we may see spikes after spikes until a viable vaccine is available at a large scale so we can be looking at yes how do you think the government can help sustain and for how long with the help of measures and relief packages or how can it tweak the current approach after all the governmental surplus are not unlimited and income tax receipts will fall as more lose their jobs or switch to lower paying jobs yeah the person asking questions the person asking these questions sell very much right from the ministry of finance so i'm just joking it is true right and it's a very good question because i don't know how much results we have we don't know right but no matter how much results we have it is a limited reserve but you can't possibly use up all your reserve for one crisis because a subsequent crisis may occur and so on it is also not right to keep on using the reserve remember i talked about self-reliance you know there are many people who are not just there waiting for money to drop on the sky or given by the government there are many people who want their problems soft and what they want is that to have the kind of money to be able to tie through a period to have the kind of opportunities to restart your business to go back to work to take care of your children take care of your elderly parents and also to find your own job so that you become not just independent uh self-reliant but be able to to to lead a good quality of life by your own motivation and your own effort the psychology tell us that that is true of all of us right and don't have don't ever have the mentality that you know singaporeans are all just waiting for money to drop from the sky i don't think that is true and i think the government recognized that and hence uh the government actually took a very drastic step right in not just the amount of money you withdraw they withdrew from the reserves in the four budgets that was given up in a very very short time but also in terms of policy ideologies right the underlying the ideology you are giving out people giving money to masses right in fact you read the papers that you were giving out money to people sometimes without requiring them to produce any documentary proof which is something that is entirely unusual of most governments and especially our government who are very particular about doing things systematically being a good stewardship of public money and so on so the point to remember is that we don't know when some of this help is going to stop at some point you will have to stop what is important for the government and the policy makers to recognize is that you know you just can't win people and say i stopped giving you money you're on your own right you need a graduated approach right aggregated approach whereby you you have need to have a something in place of that right and that's why you have the situation of not just having job fairs but able to try to match people with jobs get people trained with the necessary skills and the very harsh decision that the government has to make is to sort of allow some sectors to die off because it is not viable in order to make sure that the people in these sectors have time and skills developed to move on to other factors other sectors and then continue to do well i think those are the difficult challenges on paper in theory it is simple to say simple to to talk about in practice it is going to be very very difficult i should just make a point since in last week there was a news that ministry of manpower has been releasing information going to decide to release information on a weekly basis about jobs in order to help people to get jobs know what skills you need to pick up and so on that is a pretty tough thing to do you have to release information weekly i would suggest very much to the ministry to think through uh how do you want to release information quickly promptly but may not need to be weekly and also what kinds of information you want to release because there are some macro indicators information they are not useful for the individual to make decisions about your career choice about shall i go into this sector and so on so we need to ask ourselves what kind of information that individuals need and then we release those information so that they are not flooded with all kinds of information that actually may not end up being useful to them right so that is important i think a issue right there as we try to help and release more information we release useful information that is important i should also add that it's not the number of job fairs that we hold that is the kpi that's important the key performance indicator because these are activity-based they are not irrelevant they are useful without job fairs you cannot reach out to people but these are outreach indicators what you need is to make sure that you have impact and outcome indicators there must be a way of tracking that all these efforts and money that we have put in or you have put in as public service you are indeed matching the people to the jobs you know they are actually getting good prospects they are getting the proper training that eventually they are likely to turn them into some permanent jobs and so on so try and make sure that as we continue to have activity based kind of kpi have a very good measurement and tracking system right to follow through to make sure that we we understand the outcome and the impact are actually the intended ones and not have a whole whole flood of unintended negative consequences gina all right um i think that's about all the time we have let me just round the q a up with this final question um prof chan so what is the most important impact or change that you hope your book will bring about okay just the last last question you get back to the book uh i don't want to say too much about the book because i think some of you have already read the book i heard and the book is freely available that you can get access to but i do want to share with you since the question is being asked about the impact of the book we kind of go back to the chapter 1 of the book of trying to explain to my readers why i write the book i think when you think about a crisis like this unlike say even sas or or the asian financial crisis whether it is relatively short it is a protracted crisis now if we don't start documenting things that happen like in a book and don't document it honestly accurately and don't give and if you don't try to explore the kinds of actions that we have taken that could improve on and if we don't talk about the underlying psychology what that means is that if you wait until the pandemic is over and you start doing a review and you start talking about it it is too late right over the one two years there will be so many people's lives will be affected negatively because we have not reflected and there will be so many of us that could have done things better had we given alternative perspectives and so on so that was the purpose of why i decided to write the book in a very rare situation of doing it in a very short time very quickly when we are still in the early stages of the book and i hope to the question right i hope that the impact of the book is that it will make us reflect um you don't of course you don't and you probably won't agree with everything i said in the book and that's not the point the point is that to have it documented as accurately as i could about what happened provides you the basis of what we know from science about what psychology psychology tells us of how we can do things better about how we can counter for example negativity with positivity how we can be better in our policy communications to ensure that we build trust and so on so that when things happen again and it could be very soon uh we can do it better in fact i think i would be extremely pleased if you read the book more than once and that is because when you read the book the second time compared to the first you have accumulated real life different experiences and then if we can reflect back from some of the ideas of perspective in the book and then we can ask ourselves uh could we have done things differently maybe the first time you read the book it's quite different from the second time and hope hope that it is a more positive situation because you are able to apply some of the ideas or some of the ideas approach or appeal to you in quite a different fashion so i will just conclude that uh the purpose of this is not uh a book talk really right it's not even a book launch right and the purpose of this i think is to start a conversation for us to be courageous in speaking up what we feel and what we think and be constructive in the way we do it so that all of us can come together and have what i have been uh calling the hlc you know hlc is my acronym that i've been advocating for many years h is humility because without humility you can't learn and l is your learning orientation then we need to learn things that we don't know and c is your collaboration so before we can get people together to work together we really need to have hlc that the humility the learning orientation and then we can talk about collaboration and with that uh i think the notion of working together emerging stronger can really make sense i hope uh in this short time i've helped some of us to reading some of the

42,RbPUS9RNMXE,CNA,1 in 3 adults faces psychological distress due to COVID-19: Duke-NUS,2021-01-28T15:39:14Z,"Researchers in Singapore have found that one in three adults is anxious and depressed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those more prone to psychological distress include women, younger adults, individuals of lower socio-economic status, those living in rural areas, 
as well as people at high risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings came about after a Duke-NUS Medical School team performed a meta-analysis of 68 studies conducted during the pandemic.

44,E29wOCJIxOM,Jade Seah,Coping with COVID-19: A Positive Psychology Perspective | Jade Seah,2020-04-14T12:00:15Z,"Hope everyone is keeping safe and healthy in these dark times.

Health doesn't only mean in the physical sense; one's mental and emotion well-being is as important as being physically healthy and alive.

The physically infected aside, it has been estimated that over 7 billion people worldwide have been affected mentally and emotionally by the virus.

Filmed this podcast (but in video form too, in case you are a visual and not audio person) just before the latest ""Circuit Breaker"" measures were implemented in Singapore, putting the country in an almost lockdown state, but I think many of the things discussed are even more pertinent now that we are in total #stayhome mode.

As an extreme extrovert who leads a very active, outdoorsy lifestyle, I honestly struggled with the social isolation the first week. Have relied on a lot on Positive Psychology principles to cope mentally and emotionally, and hope to share some of these with you.

We discuss fear; how it affects us and how to deal with it. We also talked about useful, simple and actionable steps we can take - all researched and steeped in science - to increase our well-being and happiness, even in these times.

I share 5 things that have personally helped me, and we also share 3 tips on coping with social distancing and isolation.

Hope you find this useful, and please share thoughts on what I can try to help with as we journey through COVID-19 together!

This video is NOT sponsored.",I think it's for me like I'm ever thinking about this right now because I haven't been called in yet but if I yeah geez you say yeah I'm just being realistic [Music] hi hello this is Stefan and you know this is quite impromptu yes I in this time of coffee at 19 I just thought we'll get together and talk about ways to be happier to be a bit more resilient and coming from positive psychology expert like Stefan you know hopefully we'll find ways to deal with corporate 19 and you is the mental stress that comes no coffee nineteen together I mean honestly I think that we are in I don't really dare to say it because I don't people for planning which is why I think the government is not saying it but we are more or less in does harm it just that we haven't put it lightly hasn't been the official statement has an emperor as such that's it if you actually read more what those convey actually means is not cause for panic it just means that yeah of course it's Allah for that it's a bit more urgent than dire but there's no need to like or and stock up and all that right so I think I think they've done a good move in not labeling it because when they label the dusk on orange bird you like lost their yeah minds a little bit I think it's I mean I feel like because we're not medical professionals I don't really want to talk about it from the point of view of like a medical person hmm but just more you know you being like a positive psychology practitioner and the expert more like how we can cope with it because I feel like even though you haven't been medically infected with the virus I feel like everyone has been infected with the virus in some way you know I mean whether mentally or emotionally or psychologically like just it's just not been great you know generally the the air is a little bit negative in all senses of the word not just in terms of being infected I said but just because minds so I think as I myself trying to figure out how to stay positive and the stay mentally strong in these times I think that's what I would like to be able to discuss and to find ideas from you and from like listen and anyone watching I just just give us some ideas yeah I think first and foremost my heart goes out to those people who are in the medical for you and especially in civil service who are putting a lot of great lengths of time and effort and energy and even to try to reassure us during this crisis right yeah and so I think we also want to raise awareness in this area that there is also always a choice and how do we respond during this crisis yes and yeah a hundred a hundred thousand people have been infected by Kovac 19 it physically yeah but 7 billion people have been in fact about it mentally and emotionally yeah yeah cuz the numbers every day sure how many people have been impacted how many people are dying and it's not that these are numbers that we should not pay attention to but I think it's good that we pay attention to the 7 billion who have been affected mentally I think there's not as much say or done about that maybe because this you know like yeah of course you're dealing with the people who actually have the disease but I guess people are as we can try to help and how ourselves and how the other seven billion we have not had any loss of form in vanilla yeah I think it also goes back to the time whereby you know we talk about common issues like mental illnesses because of the word mental illness is very elusive because that also cue it's very broad-based we talk about depression anxiety stress and you know of course all these stuff right but these mental illnesses have already been under current before the emergence of the pandemic and when this pandemic happens we bring forth this points to the extreme so a small anxiety become extreme inside here right now a small a bit of a sadness we have intense sadness and worry right now so I guess that this is also part of being a human being and we want to address these things that how could we recognize these signs and then pay attention to our own mental resilience so that we can stay frosty in whistlin and so that will not become a victim what do you so if you look at I always say office of a Singaporean to we are Singaporeans with me we start let's stop go back to the time whereby we talk what panic buying yeah yeah and there's a lot of thoughts about like buying Roe okay yeah and one of the one of cutting funding does she was asking that why are people buying toilet paper why I mean also I find it like very interesting thing like I'm saying people are buying things like rice or canned food or instant noodles which are like if you're feeling you won't have food to survive um know much about the people also what was your thought in from her by my personal reaction if we is that because we are losing a sense of control of the world yeah we have no idea what's happening there's a lot of anxiety and then there's and there's a lot of uncertainty so the first thing that we can control off is to take care of ourselves so like sanitary products like toilet paper or tissue people I think that things would equip us hygiene must come to mind because that when we buy them we have control over the situation I think this is akin to also eating disorders if I'm not wrong cuz when you feel a lack of control in other areas of your life this is what you want to control I think the article that I read was that toilet paper because it's voluminous right in size it's like what will you buy a stack of paper is huge what compared to like like a can of see preservation above us so if people feel good about it like oh yeah you're right I'm thinking about myself because I have bought like a law file before they can see it physically like I have bills and bills of other people I am prepared mmm right so I mean what is from like a positive psychology perspective what are some ways that we can deal with like I say ways to build up our own personal resilience so that we stay frosty yeah there are many there are many many different interventions that we can use right from very simple once the very difficult ones but I think before we go into the interventions maybe a little bit more above yeah yeah which everyone is aware what fear is well I think we need to read into it the fact that how fear is impacting us during these times I'm going to normal times right like if I summer panic by is exactly a action Afiya maybe a fear that we are afraid that we could have run out of pixie supplies and this like it's like let's focus on a doom and gloom of the situation let's have some control by less by what my family needs let's hunker down and let's survive and we first um go over yeah but the very fact that if we participate in this behavior which is fine for the basic needs for the same time we are also spreading the behavior we are also multiplying the behavior because we learn from each other yeah and and talking about fear fear is the most biggest thing primate feeling that we have to keep us alive by the same time that you know when our brain pants in this fear all the time is send a signal to our guts our our gut our digestion system and then at the same time we look at the media outside what's happening you keep on going back in this basis okay so the why try and say here is that we keep flooding and so our sovereign this feedback loop again and again and again and again and and in the normal fearful situation it could be we have a small injection of yet but after the situation has passed we relaxed and our body come down and we are okay with the around I mean with these emotions but now when we look at the media these situations uncertain we keep on going back again and again and again and another day we may not contract the virus but mentally emotionally we hammer our own immune system we become less amel because we are highly stressed and this is what I wouldn't say about fear okay so I mean it is from even from a psych psych physiological perspective as well a psychological perspective important to manage the fear I was he saying that you can stress the body and we can you actually physically we can you from the stress yes okay so how do you think is people should best you with their fear and how do you think people should help others deal with your fear because I think there's a lot of fear and paranoia going around I mean I myself like personally you have people like a Romney right I'm not quite sure how to help them I know that this is a terrible virus but then the level of fear I feel that is not helping them it's not serving them how do i how do I help well first we have to be very realistic of the whole situation in terms of that this is a critical situation and this is happening not just to a spot around the whole wall so we are in this together collectively and the first thing is if let's say a person is panicking extremely and saying that okay no let's let's survive less worry less stress are okay we really have this view of people we cannot we cannot we cannot because they have really really self imprison and something the state of mind okay yeah and because if I said you have that sort of belief they will do everything else as a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah so if I say the persons recover in the inventor imprisonment we cannot really help them upfront but you can have them by the side okay first we drink huh myself reassuring that everything is not that bad and then you can start by making yourself available to the person that everything's gonna be okay yeah and when a person go past that fearful period and yeah go back to normality a little bit this is where you can go in and help them okay yeah we are more sensible that's my fear activates right we our survival instincts are activated we cannot comprehend logic it's just like when a lion is chasing after you find the olden days that say we are the caveman right yeah you don't think about weather how should I do this situation you just run so right now if I said the fix is set on you just run and wait for them to run and slow it down and then you go in talk to them okay yeah because I think what I'm saying this is because there are many I think they are very good many good people out there they are trying to give advice saying that no these are the things that you can practice that's be more positive these are the three stats but I will say that these are good things that you can apply but if a person is instead of feeling worried they cannot apply this discount easy surviving okay okay I understand and so we got a you're saying we only have to a certain point when they're on at that point how about helping ourselves that were if we identify that we are perhaps um if therefore we want to get ourselves out of it how do help ourselves but for those people who are much more who raise discussion about helping ourselves I think yeah a bit more aware yeah and the more on your positions do think about okay I have enough of this what can I do next or how can I do differently then with this awareness we can do difference of interventions and there are many different of interventions first maybe the most common ones would be bringing your attention back to our body let's consider in intervention yeah it could be told you I was sorry just thinking and step back for people who may not understand what exactly is an intervention okay intubation is an activity that you can do that will bring you to a good outcome especially for it could be really good to your well-being development now your relationships or personal development although when you say is a resilience intervention it is something that you do to build resilience yes like an activity yeah okay okay so so you say one way is to bite you I mean because not everyone me understand right so so it's like an activity so yeah WOWY is to bring awareness back to yourself is it and how do we do that yeah well resilience maybe we need to define like what is resilience there's so many different definitions yeah by the common understand the meaning of residents means that when we face an adversity or stressful situation we can have a choice to bounce back okay yeah and let's say that we are in a negative State this is the adversity we we collapse maybe bounce back but we don't bounce back to the original form where at least where we start that we can even bounce back further okay I mean you go past the origins wrong that's how you like build resilience right mmm okay okay so so one such resilience intervention or activity would be to bring awareness back to the self yeah and how exactly keying it with it well my favorite activities activity would be focusing on your breath okay and because we talked about fear a lot of that happens in our brain and goes into our our nerves and I'm just going to organs right so in shot is in our body fear and emotions are now about so the first thing is you bring the awareness back not from your thoughts but into our body so you can put your hands one on your chest I want understand what is all my favorite ones then you can feel how your chest and your stomach is expanding and contracting and having this one from your body will remind you that you are touching your body so when you breathe in you can focus on your breathing how how your body expand and contract and there's a very simple exercise you can close your eyes and count like maybe three counts of three breathe in in one two and three and then hold your breath for three seconds and exhale for three seconds a very simple exercise but we do we there's me that shift yeah I like these interventions because that of course also being being quite overwritten sometimes due to the pandemic situation or when I do this exercise I remind myself that I don't think it's okay and when we focus our breath our thoughts will not run around and that's very important so does one do this when we feel panicky or is is a proactive thing that you do like every morning this will be more proactive things in exercise or intervention that we do from time to time okay so maybe I guess like what could be helpful and this time is to so schedule it into your morning because I for me like if you like when you want to be like happy then I'll put the inner spot something that I do every day maybe it might be every day I brush my teeth every day so maybe what I can do is I can do this straight after I brush Frankie or straight that before I make my bed and how long would you recommend doing something like this for I recommend maybe around let's say two or three minutes well that's really quick I think so maybe a nice way to start the day I mean I feel like I want to try this is like maybe when I wake up and stay off okay this is terrible but the first thing is to reach my phone maybe itself there I can reach for my phone and say a two-minute timer mmm and I might fall back asleep but but but you know I mean right I guess that the point is to just get it into your day mmm-hmm I like the energy was very easy to do are there other such resilience interventions or activities that we can do yeah yeah there's so many out there I and you can just try many of them and see what really sticks for you yeah and just so you are asking earlier that if lack see a person is triggered who is already in that just stay and they are lively fearful right and how could you if you find out that you're in that state and your weather is happening can this activity help you or this intervention yes it can but sometimes even in the state of here so but usually come and self doubt it can be quite difficult maybe in a different environment you are outside then you find that you may not like this activity yeah for the first intervention that can help you where you're anxious is to recognize that we're to do this dissociate or yourself from that environment that you are in okay let me give that example if I say that I am feeling anxious when I'm in my room right for other reasons and I found myself that I'm feeling very anxious I cannot do this activity the first thing first I have to unzip my room and go to some my house yeah of course I recommend that you like we will say that we good let's go to a neutral point okay a neutral point is that away from our current situation or current environment I go to another place and ship your energy and shake your breath over there I can go over there and do this intervention for example okay yeah and this is the first thing this is a lifesaver I would say yeah we well I mean a back story we were also teaching this tank to the Kobe 19 crisis responders in China okay and yeah facing facing a lot of stress because in China there was a lot done previously and many people are calling in to this hotline and these psychologists and counselors they also been focused at me and he said that this is really very good very simple and very fast I think for me the interesting thing is also that you are suggesting that it should be a proactive thing like you don't wait until you feel panicky to do it but like it's something that you train and you do everyday I think that's pretty good because in these times like I don't think you we should wait until we get to that point so you're saying if we like do this every day we know that our resilience anyway and like something how does it work well it's also a little bit more about stretching your resilience muscle like for example I know that you you exercise a lot and then you do this things like strength training or resistance training yeah but resistance training only helpful when there are some sort of resistant so think that so so for this shishun take stress and worry as a form of resistance okay once you are aware that you are it's just a resistance then you change the tongue anxiety or stress to is just resistant and that awareness or shift you from a stress level to a development space okay yeah do you think just labeling it differently and seeing it from a different perspective is a good way to deal with it yes I do think so because you know a lot of the feel on the street is there is it this there's a lot of doom and doom obviously around the current situation and a lot of negativity there I feel it's not helpful but I'm saying it from a maybe not from an expert form view so I guess this helps me to confirm then you know just thinking about it from a positive space is actually helpful and has been proven to through hop in general it's not just like like Oh think positive long but it does actually help your state yeah it's very difficult to think positive many people think that process I mean we talked about if you talk about posture psychology it's not about thinking positive it's more about focusing on healthy habits you can be thinking learning or many different things so if the person is really panicking you know you're having this off anxiety it's not possible for to tell the person hey let's practice three positive things now yeah it's counterintuitive people cannot receive it so I guess the question is how do we do negativity then now how do we do negative people because there is a lot of negativity in this current time I think a big topic yeah okay maybe we'll save that for the next one yeah I'll save that for the next one I think if I can how about you how do you with how do you do with stress and anxiety yourself and be you can share as I know that you learn post psychology and you'll be practicing with your personal intervention yeah yeah how so how I delete yourself so they have a very physiological person right so I feel like I expend a lot of energy through like physical things so for me sports is a very very big part of it and I think it's interesting because previously I used to use sports as an outlet like you know when I'm upset or stressed I'll go for a run or I'll do some sauce for I still do that but I also do it probably now so I make sure that I do something active because there is what keeps me I feel like before the negative energy is a chance to do that I do something to get rid of it first so what what does it mean exactly when you start to feel it means like I don't go for days without working out okay because I feel like that there's no way for me to extend off negativity because sports is a way for me to deal with it the other thing is I feel like the perspective shift also it used to be for me I'm not also mumbo-jumbo okay law change your thinking change your life right I mean you'll say things like the airline that is so like okay cliche oh it doesn't really work but to be honest it really does work like when I think about this whole situation I feel negative about it - I'm human right but then but then I try to see the positive in it as in the world is so resetting know nature is resetting like it's a reset because you know cruise ships are not sailing factories are like cutting down production in the world it's time to doze off we said and I feel like I have time to be sad lion I want to make use of this time properly I mean I was studying for exam before this but now that that is over this week I told myself since work is a bit slower you know and instead of worrying about what we slower like you know income is less then maybe I should tell myself but the whole world is going slower everybody collectively is something suffering the same fate so why not use it positively and I finally perch my house of all the clutter so easily I don't have time to do it actually no I have time so instead of using that time to like whine about they're like oh my gosh you say this and there I didn't use it positively right so tear clutter I taught myself the other things I want to create more positive content on how you know like we hear about three together like I want to create content on how I'm dealing with I wouldn't say I'm socially isolated but every more isolated than I used to be because I have friends who choose to not come out for example right and I kind of missed them a me on a very from a very extreme extrovert power of you I just miss some friends and family who maybe choose to not come out and I say I don't feel like that is wrong if you like this is a choice that they have made so by a kind of Miss damn and then so I find ways to deal with it and I'm also gonna make more content on I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels like that you know there's a lot of contentment for introverts but I think in this time like I mean I know it's very far so problem for the people who I'm not actually down with the disease like how we cope and not just go by how we thrive in this time yeah you know you could be used so much more positively so I think for me that perspective shift has helped so I want to create more content like that here my house use it productively at this time and really big time to spend time with like my mom and spend time with family that obviously all know time long time but actually now because what I saw I have the time is that how do I want to spend the time so for me that's how I deal with it that's how I do it stress I even in school like if there's an exam I'm stressed out about it but I also tell myself but it's like a game it's like spot you know it's like okay then you study very hard and you like how plan your like training but I mean cuz I see everything like far as I plan my study and then it's like you're not meaning you taper off like how you people off for sports so you take off like the last hour maybe may not stress myself as much you know and and I have like a ritual maybe before I go into a test I don't really like to talk to people before I say fun exam okay yeah I mean yeah I really don't like I feel like all the informations they don't talk to me because it's not my fault you know so I feel like that's just how I do with that I try to make it like fun make it like a spot mmm and try to see it productively hmm maybe it's a very type a thing to do also do always wanna be productive we can talk about that big topic in another podcast yeah but I also do my self so because I know I am tiny I want to be productive so hence we're trying to see this so-called negative period in a way like okay how can I be productive in a different way like carrying my house which has never been the thought my list of priorities but always been there nagging me and staring me in the face like and pissing me off because the clutter pisses me off but like always no I'm not I have time yeah it's a time to declutter physically and mentally yeah yeah so I mean that's how I kind of deal with it and I think there are a lot of other things that you know we can talk about and we will talk about in a in a another podcast yeah but I think for now this is great you know is is creating how we have talked a bit about the situation and how we can cope with it small ways I think we can come back and talk about how to deal with yeah what smaller thing is when we talk about social distancing yes I think I want to let you focus on the fact that is really not social distancing is about physical distancing okay because social can see it seems to suggest that we are trying to isolate publish other social yeah yeah so it's time I should do what may be misrepresented yeah so I think there are like a lot of fun ways you can keep in touch I have to really close friends one of whom is in Vietnam and one is in Malaysia and everyone's kind of stuck right because we can't fly out for each other or drive up boo JB then see my friend in Malaysia so we've been doing like conference calls mm-hmm you know and then they a lot of like one of my friends just it's the one she made me download it Scotty you know Tsubaki is one of them but there's another one that's called I literally just house party house party have you heard of it this is fqo house party no literally I mean this time of Convy okay right so you can so I said why don't we just use zoom or like what's that video she's like oh no no so you can like play games and stuff like that so we have a house party tonight wow yeah so I think they are like fun ways that you can keep in touch with your friends who like may not want to come out of the house hmm right and I think it's really about making the time in FL ah mm-hmm right so I think all right it's not it shouldn't be called social distancing it should is literally physical distancing just just you know to flatten the group but we should still make the effort to engage and keep in touch with friends mm-hmm right and it's like yeah it's like having a long-distance relationship with my nice new friends we always joke that we have long-distance friendship mmm but with some friends so I and sing about who may not want to come up we have long-distance friendship also long or we have like you know I mean it's so good now in technology we still can keep in touch mmm you know and then I think the other fun thing is that they all these stay home challenges like I just sent you one yes which is like ten unpopular things so the list of 10 things to listen ten things that you don't like there are other people probably like like for example is that like Bubba P L Game of Thrones okay you know like most people you don't like bubble tea or Game of Thrones I don't this way strange things that you said and you kind of get the know if you look at this positively you may not a lot of times when you meet you may talk about mundane things or you mean spend time like gossiping about them but in this way like you are actually getting to know your friends a bit more mm-hmm and they are like quite cool ones like I just got seven this weight ball bingo so it's like a bingo chat today you think of the stuff that you have experienced I have you been yanked off an obstacle I mean weak body or people with quite a weak fats would know or have you gone through it overseas WIC partly you kind of try to get a bingo but there many versions of this not just for big father's like there's a network version so you can do it in your interest groups and they are like non-sports believe the ones also care no I some very like only suppose that there are TV versions I'm sure which what the movie buffs and TV buffs you might like or there might you just a just a way for you to get to know your friends better like these fun games they are like social media fun games that you can like just you don't have to download anything some of them is just a screenshot and you just think you know so I think there are fun ways to keep in touch and found ways to like engage with your friends and engage with with people they don't require a physical you to actually be there so you don't be should just be a bit more creative yeah and I have no intention luckily like my intention is to keep up connections with people and like in my house and be productive in that way so I think setting goals for me helps yeah for the technique personalities yeah right for the maybe not so type of a personalities it's mindfulness and getting back to the self that could be things that like I think we should talk about that in future podcast yeah so I think you know let us know like if this was helpful in any way please get in touch in many ways you can leave your comments you can drop us a line on social media and let us know what sort of topics you want to hear us talk about yes you know whether it's physical talking more about physical distancing or managing negative emotions how to do negative people I think me all this I think I've had a few requests what do you do at home you know how to do it social isolation night yeah interesting ways to spend your time because for me like everything about this right I haven't been called in yet but if I am she's you say yeah I'm just being realistic it is a scary time Minister I really hope not but like you know like what if like like Malaysia Singapore goes into total lockdown right then I have to find my center day myself at home ah yes I I'm really trying to find ways and I'm really like very interested in content like that so let me know and let us know if interested in content like that will make that for you yeah as well yeah if you have if you want to know more about any sort of psychological interventions how to be more resilient or any how do you keep yourself away from anxiety yeah please let us know so yeah I mean Stefan is like someone that you really can't have to find more positive psychology ways to deal with all this and I think this this thing about interventions otherwise known as activity is okay right or exercises that you can be very helpful because is little steps that we can all do to keep ourselves happier and mentally stronger so let's not let Stefan and I we'll know like what else you want to hear oh maybe the next time we do this we can try some of the interventions life yeah yeah okay for watching thank you for listening watching bye bye ,True,True,True,True
45,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,CNA Insider,COVID-19 In Philippines: The Starving Urban Poor. What Went Wrong? | Insight | Poverty In Asia,2020-09-16T12:00:03Z,"The people in the Philippines are suffering from one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world. As the government struggles to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the ultra-strict quarantine and social distancing measures which have now stretched to more than half a year, have left the economy on its knees. The move has also left millions of people jobless and hungry. The dire situation has now pushed millions of people to the brink of starvation. Why did the pandemic hit the poorest of poor so hard? With the Philippine economy slipping into its worst recession in decades, can the poor pull themselves out from the crushing poverty? Will their cries for help be heard?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",it has one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world but the ultra-strict quarantine measures have left more than 5 million filipinos hungry [Music] more than 10 million people have lost their jobs and their livelihoods destroyed me uh why did the pandemic hit the poorest of the poor so hard when a crisis like this hits an equal society like the philippines it's like amplifying the inequality in the social divide so the poor are bearing the brunt of an equal distribution of the impacts of this crisis as the philippine economy is crashing into its worst recession in decades how can the country's poor pull themselves out of the crushing poverty [Music] manila the capital city of the philippines a business hub plagued by economic disparity as the city progresses 35 percent of its population or more than 4 million still reside in slums they are laborers who have to contend with meager incomes of less than two dollars a day and now manila has become the new epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak in southeast asia with slums considered as viral hotbeds for the transmission of the disease space is a luxury for the rich so the poor they live in small homes in crowded congested communities the vulnerability of course with any sort of infectious disease it's the enclosed space the post interaction the amount of people you're interacting with uh the poor really have it worse in in in the normal time they also have it worse i think in times of crisis right now [Music] but the country's urban poor is facing a fear far more frightening than kovid the fear of starvation [Music] as work and incomes dry up starvation is forcing the urban poor to cope in unthinkable ways midnight at one of manila's biggest slums 64 year old bernadette sablazar and her neighbor elena perena together with elena's 16 year old daughter leia breach quarantine restrictions in search of food as an elderly bernadette is required to stay at home and like her teenage leia is also not allowed to be outside of her residence yet in spite of all the restrictions they're venturing out during curfew hours and risk being caught but they're too hungry to care for rules foreign they're braving their way to divisoria manila's largest public market to scavenge for vegetable scrap or collect leftover goods freely handed out by generous sellers the lockdown has crippled elena and bernadette's ability to work and earn an income bernadette is an egg seller who used to earn 15 u.s dollars a day elena is a freelance massage therapist who could earn up to 30 us dollars on good days she was doing well enough to even put up a small store to help with the family's daily spend but everything just fell apart during the first week of the lockdown elena's family was forced to consume every foodstock they had in this small store the crisis has damaged significantly damaged the asset base of urban pool street vendors couldn't sell on the streets jeepney drivers pedicab drivers tricycle drivers couldn't operate couldn't go out and pick up passengers so it would be very difficult for them to recover economically from this crisis [Music] like bernadette and elena many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown in fact the philippines hunger incidence rate is at its highest in six years according to the social weather station a non-profit research institution the poll reveals that 20.9 percent or 5.2 million filipino families have experienced involuntary hunger at least one in the past three months of the quarantine period [Music] after four hours elena bernadette and leia have collected more than enough to tide them through the next two days and are planning on giving their extras around their neighborhood the philippine government has come in with aid to help mitigate the problem of hunger among the people a week after announcing its quarantine measures philippine president rodrigo duterte signed into law a package of emergency cash subsidy to 18 million low-income families beneficiaries will receive at least 100 u.s dollars to a maximum of 165 u.s dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid and aid had to reach swiftly but many like elena didn't receive her subsidy right away even after waiting for more than a month me borrowed just enough money to purchase rice christmas depression [Music] if not for these loans as well as elena's risky venture to the market earlier today her family could have fallen very ill or worse die of starvation [Music] foreign [Music] lockdown is the government doing enough to alleviate their pain will help come in time before the situation spirals out of control [Music] so soon after announcing a nationwide lockdown president rodrigo duterte signed into law the social amelioration program or sap under the sap the government provides 18 million low-income families with a much needed emergency cash subsidy each beneficiary will receive at least 100 us dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid the distribution had to be swift so that aid gets to the more vulnerable segments of the population as an urban poor elena perena qualifies as a beneficiary for the social amelioration program she was expecting to receive the promised first month cash subsidy immediately but help didn't come along until two months after aid was not only slow but it was also very little elena received only 138 u.s dollars on her first month of subsidy equivalent to about four days of her usual daily income is the emergency cash subsidy is only about a quarter of what a family of five actually needs in a month to get by based on current estimates by economists and urban poor advocates well the thing is the subsidy was not meant to be like a cure-all it was just meant to be a a partial subsidy so and we have to recognize also that government has its own risk constraints they don't have infinite money elena's problem is even more dire that's because she has 10 children and 13 grandchildren living under the same roof except for one all of them don't earn an income after their employers had temporarily ceased their businesses the government claims it has nothing left to extend its subsidies but the harsher reality is elena's family are much better off than most other families had waited for far much longer to receive their first month emergency cash subsidies three months into the lockdown five million families are still wondering if their raid is ever going to come the majority waited so long and also the trash they got was next to nothing it is equivalent to about nine pesos per person per day over the last five months you can't do anything with that a huge cause of delay a random distribution of aid we also we've heard a lot about irregularities in the distribution some local officials were prioritizing their own relatives their own probably friends they would prioritize their friends because we have a very weak democratic system that hardly works in some areas and that of course affects the poor who are supposedly benefiting fairly from the distribution but some of them were not able to receive this assistance because they were not part of that patreon client system in their area under the law an irregularity like this is a criminal offence on the second month of the lockdown the national government received more than 2 000 complaints against village council officials for the delay in the distribution of aid currently the philippine prosecutor's office have charged 134 officials with various graft related cases 50 officers are now suspended from office but the crux of the matter is local governments are also facing systemic problems the philippines has barely begun transitioning to a national id system though a newly created law mandates it that's why city governments had to rely on an outdated list of their constituents based on a national census that was held five years ago as a result many filipinos have been excluded during the pandemic even if we wanted to have universal cash transfers we couldn't because there was no mechanism there is no way for us to locate any everybody now nearly six months after announcing provisions for emergency cash subsidies the government has given the second month subsidy to almost 95 percent of beneficiaries the original sin with the social administration program is that the government was so stingy about it you did not get a sense that they wanted to help as many people as quickly as possible elena is unsure if her second month subsidy is coming in the meantime elena's deaths are piling up she currently owes about 100 us dollars from friends on top of utility bills she has to pay salomon in elena's family has also become too poor to protect themselves against covid19 [Music] the philippines is known to have one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the world a special pass was needed to move around to buy essential goods those who violate the curfew and social distancing measures or fail to wear a mask will be punished they range from fines to detention mass gatherings like protests are banned but on the third week of the lockdown a hundred filipinos gathered at edsa a main thoroughfare where historic protests happen sixty-four-year-old caesar galamosa was one of them as an elderly he's not allowed outside of his residence but caesar is desperate he lives from paycheck to paycheck after he lost his blue-collar job foreign famished caesar decided to join his neighbors at edsa he arrived at nine in the morning there was no relief distribution in sight later a team of police arrived to disperse the crowd driven into a corner time and options are running out for the urban poor will the government be able to deliver a solution or will anger spill out into the streets [Music] three weeks into the philippine lockdown a commotion over food aid erupted at edsa one of manila's main thoroughfares a day before the incident rumors spread across the slum village of san roque that a sack of rice would be given out as aid at edsa although mass gatherings are banned about 300 people turned up the following day soon the police arrived and advised them to disperse but driven by desperation 64 year old caesar villamosa stayed on you know the pandemic really put a strain on the poor they are already the most vulnerable they put a strain on the floor because absolutely poor would not want to get sick as much as possible they don't want to be sick because they know it's going to cost money they know it's going to stop them from working the poor do not want to get sick but they will risk life and limb if they're not going to be able to money that's how caesar ended up in detention for five days together with 20 others they were charged with five cases allegedly in violation of quarantine rules and health emergencies these offences could have put them in detention for six months in the philippines violations are quite commonplace since the lockdown was implemented in mid-march more than 300 000 quarantine violators were apprehended by authorities violators were warned fined detained or charged most of these violators come from impoverished families the night of the commotion philippine president rodrigo duterte addressed the country about the incident he suspected that leftist insurgents were behind it and promised to act tough against the room among us [Music] there is no understanding there is no social consideration there is no value being given to the life that is supposed to be saved that is the most difficult part for me to understand you enforce a quarantine because you want to save lives you want to save lives by spreading by by stopping the spread of disease and yet here we are here is the government having very little consideration for that life it just goes against the grain the very green for humanity caesar and the other 20 detainees are now out on bail paid for by two influential celebrities it cost more than 6400 us dollars to release them an amount they could not have raised by themselves fortunately they also received free legal assistance if not for these caesar and his family would have no choice but to accept the punishment but caesar continues to confront his worsening poverty day by day nearly six months into the lockdown he and his daughter are still waiting for a job he also faces a pile of debts and the prospect of eviction from his rented home even as they're trying to cope with the problem of starvation [Music] ironically many urban poor come to manila in search of a better life away from rural poverty but even in the city life has been a constant struggle covet 19 has threatened to displace nearly 11 million workers from the informal sectors and erase years of progress on poverty alleviation the truth is there are not enough policies and mechanisms to help pull the poor out of their poverty but also i think because people are seeing how unequal the philippines is and how problematic our politics is i think we are in the middle of a moment people are actually asking is this the government we deserve are these economic policies we need why are people so bad off the philippines has been fighting chronic poverty since the late 1960s for decades the nation had always been dubbed as the sick man of asia but a series of economic reforms in early 2000 paved the way for growth from opening country to country international trade foreign direct investments like business process outsourcing as well as hospitality and tourism in 2013 the philippine economy finally gained strength the world bank described the philippines as asia's rising tiger with its gdp rising steadily the philippines was no longer the sick man of asia but a breakout nation with one of the most promising economies in the world philippine poverty rates were finally going down but it was just numbers these income indicators actually one don't fail to capture so many other dimensions of poverty but secondly i think it's the worst thing for us it's actually used to hide high levels of poverty we have the richest 50 filipinos having a combined wealth of 4.1 trillion pesos which is equivalent to the combined wealth the poorest 60 to 70 million filipinos that doesn't make sense a clear evidence of uneven exclusionary growth is right in the slums the urban poor have been struggling to own homes in the last 10 years caesar's informal settlement has been defying eviction and demolition about six thousand families live on this government-owned property but a part of this real estate has been sold to a private developer with no plan of resettling its slum dwellers is so while gdps have been rising job opportunities and better labor conditions among the urban poor are barely improving many of the urban poor remain as workers in the informal economy as drivers of jeepneys and brick shores street peddlers owners of small convenience stores or manual laborers in the construction industry statisticians and economists estimate that at least 62 percent of filipinos are working in the informal economy that's about 30 million informal workers suffering through decades of income inequality you also have a lot of workers who don't have legal protection of the law but they are still there they you know the street vendors the tricycle drivers the barkers of jeepneys they are workers they are contributing to the economy but they are not part of the mantle of legal environment it's no wonder the urban poor like elena bernadette and caesar are the most vulnerable during the pandemic the urban poor like them already had it worst before covert 19 as mere daily wage earners without safety nets and social protection i'm still calling this pandemic as in a way as low as a form of slow moving disaster why because disasters or crises don't exist in a vacuum in the case of the philippines we have very weak democratic institutions and for us to be able to manage this well to begin with this has reached this level this unprecedented level because i think it was poorly managed from the start the philippine government wants to recover from the pandemic by providing corporate tax breaks and loans to smes but so far they've been silent on how to help the urban poor in the informal sector or perhaps there is really none at all now the urban poor are resorting to self-help while a new sector is plunging into poverty but how much can they do to solve their financial and health worlds [Music] in manila philippines the urban poor are left on their own to survive through the pandemic [Music] in san roque an informal settlement with roughly 30 000 residents many have been jobless throughout the six month long quarantine in place of their jobs the city government helped to distribute rice to local residents [Music] m to solve hunger in their community fair sidco decided to help in a community kitchen the non-profit organizations helped to raise funds to kick-start this initiative they established 28 community kitchens throughout san roque providing breakfast to 3 000 residents aside from this kitchen the non-profit organizations helped pull together community health volunteers like jelen rossilo as most of them are under-educated volunteer doctors taught them about how to respond to the threat of covet-19 infections and what they can do to avoid falling ill but they have a more important task volunteers like gellin look out for covert 19 symptoms around the neighborhood and deliver food to those under quarantine in closed and congested places where covet virus would most likely thrive mass testing at san roque hasn't even begun the residents also claimed that government healthcare workers avoided their slum community they've been told that government frontliners lack personal protective equipment or ppe too that's why most residents feared for their lives so from the point of view of individual vulnerability the poor is already vulnerable their their immune system is low they're not they're not eating the food that they need to survive and they don't have the rest mandatory precautionary measures like safe distancing hand washing hand sanitation and mask wearing are luxuries for slum dwellers is [Music] relied on private donations to assist her community but nearly six months into quarantine help has stopped coming in foreign [Music] back in the community kitchens funds are also running out no new pledges have come in chalita's community kitchen used to feed 75 people five times a week now they are down to 35 twice a week [Music] this week's feeding will actually be the last hungry as she may be chelita had not been eating from meals they'd prepared that's because she feels others need the food more than her i know [Music] but community volunteers like faye is not giving up she decided to grow vegetables on her backyard to be a food source whenever someone asks for help at the end of the day if this community kitchens dry up and we stop providing food the government has to come in uh at the end of the day it's their responsibility to provide relief and to help the struggling urban poor in their own vicinity in their own city so if the government is not part of that it's like you are exonerating the state from its responsibility to provide the needed assistance especially of the urban people there's only so much that kellen can do to protect herself if she gets infected with covet 19 she will not receive any free treatment the national government extends help to those who contribute to estate health insurance but gellan is too poor to make the voluntary contributions [Music] foreign as many of the urban poor struggle on their own through the community quarantine another sector of society is increasingly desperate jeepney drivers are resorting to begging or protesting to go back to work jeepneys are the most popular transportation in the philippines it's known for its crowded seating so the government allows less than five percent of jeepneys to ply through the roads as a containment measure well if we're looking at their numbers there's more than i think 170 000 jeepney units nationwide so you're talking about 170 000 families nationwide relying on the jeepney industry so you multiply that by what five or six members so we're talking about close to 1 million people relying on the jeepney industry alone and if we're not serious with listening to their demand or at least hitting their appeal then it's like you're basically ignoring one [Music] section of your population now in just six months jeepney drivers have fallen into poverty [Music] chito bustamente had been driving a jeep for more than a decade to save up for his dream home now he is not only out of work chito has also no house to live in had to rely on loan sharks to help supplement his unstable income and send his seven children to school income [Music] 19 year old trisha is honorario's eldest daughter who has a year left before finishing her engineering degree all she wants is to graduate from a university be gainfully employed and help her father honorario in sending [Music] adding to their worries is a contentious government plan to phase out jeepneys they require jeepney owners like honorario and chito to upgrade to environmentally friendly vehicles but it's an investment they cannot afford they're still paying loans for the current jeepneys they own the government hasn't extended assistance to jeepney drivers like chito and honorario except for emergency cash subsidies it's also unclear if they will ever get back on the roads even when covert 19 is over we know at the end of the day gp drivers will be displaced um we do agree there is a need to modernize gps but there's a way to more than sgp's without leaving the poor and vulnerable drivers behind again it involves the government subsidizing the transition and that's the basic demand of gp drivers amidst these uncertainties honorario's children suffer the most trisha's dreams are put on hold as honorario was forced by circumstances to drop his children out of school family now sells native delicacies to enable the family to eat three times a day while cheeto has to find other ways to put food on the table the only recourse is to scavenge for junk foreign while strangers fear him chito actually has fears too he worries about getting infected from the junk he collects for this morning he traded the stash he's collected for one us dollar and 50 cents it's enough to buy him a kilo of rice the government isn't doing enough that's why they're so dismissive because they know the filipino poor have suffered so much through all the years they will survive it's not a question of them recovering even if pushing the ground they will try their best to make do with what they have poverty is a vicious cycle a self-perpetuating condition that can't simply be broken without external help caught in a daily struggle for survival before the pandemic that challenge was almost insurmountable but a crippling lockdown brought on by covert 19 has turned that challenge into a huge battle against hunger and hopelessness how long can the poor hold on to hope before starvation takes over how long more shall they wait before their cries for help give way into silence [Music] [Music] you

47,qSAK28CKt2o,Salon London,The Psychology of COVID-19 with Stephen David Reicher,2020-06-19T07:50:15Z,"Stephen has recently co-written Together Apart: the Psychology of COVID-19 (preprint available online) with three other social psychologists which details the importance of understanding and harnessing group psychology in dealing with the pandemic. The authors have advised a range of bodies on how to best support the COVID-19 response and in the book, they explore how psychological theory - and the social identity approach in particular - can help us better understand, and respond to the COVID-19 crisis.","hello hello hello and welcome to salon London well salon lockdown for the psychology of covert 19 with Professor Steven Riker I have know a couple of people who are in the digital house tonight so I just want to say hello to Pascal and Duncan in West London Sylvia and Peter in North Yorkshire Paul and tests in northern Italy Pauline in Southwark and professor Katherine Loveday in Barnet hello and you you are very very welcome and if you'd like to comment and get involved ask a question get involved in the community cell um please do we've got the comment section just there and you can just get in and put your question to Steven and if you don't know me apologies I'm Helen Bagnall and together with Dickon towns who is uh now my producer and Juliette Russell we set up salon London twelve years ago and it's all about getting us together with academics and authors and their ideas normally in a physical space but since locked down in a lockdown space and thank you so much for being here tonight on the Thursday evening it's my great pleasure to introduce Stephen Ryker he's a professor of Social Psychology at the University of st. Andrews in Scotland yes a social psychologist and a leading academic in the fields of crowd and group but a group behavior particularly in the way groups behave when in emergency situations more recently Stephen participates in spy be the independent science pandemic influenza group on behavior which is part of the sage subcommittee advising governments on behavioral science the UK and Scottish Government's and he's also an active participant of independent sage advising the UK and Scottish Government's he's also one of the four co-authors of the book together a part which an extraordinary book and I know I've sent it to people on the salon mailing list and you want to get in contact I can get Steven generously said you can have a PDF of the book is extraordinary and the book really works to analyze the psychology of our behavior during covert nineteen and we're going to be discussing that tonight for about thirty minutes and then we're going go on to questions so please do send your questions in hello Steven hello hello nice to see you Harrison Andrews well I'm not actually in some town foods but I'm in Scotland and it's lovely it's lovely clean air government I know it's really hard to read about people who are watching from North Italy or from in the countryside Nicholas I know they are so Steven I've got to say I have found it quite a challenge to get the bins out during lockdown and so I really very much like your ambition to write a book about this very significant and constantly unpredictable a world event of our lifetime whilst it is still happening well you know I didn't have anywhere to go I didn't have anything else to do well I did but you do realize actually a lot of our academic activity and rutting all over the place and you know travelling around the world actually it's not that necessary and if you stay at home you sometimes have more time unlucky I have a 16 year old who can look after himself got a bit bored but can look after himself so I didn't have to do parenting I know many many people found it very very far from easy so I'm privileged but I guess I then felt a responsibility to use my time usefully thank you and how is a response to pick the book boom I don't know you tell me mmm I will I will do exactly that well we're gonna come some of it this evening so I guess my first question is of course it's very easy to understand why we need to understand why that how the virus behaves but why is it as important for us to understand how people behave well I sometimes say until we get a vaccine but even when we get a vaccine every single intervention against the pandemic will involve at his core a behavioral dimension so that was very obvious during lockdown people had to adhere to lockdown however effective it was as a measure in in theory however it's affecting in effect it depended on levels that he routes and every few percent changes that hearings would have a great impact on the level infection now we're coming out of lockdown then the extent to which people adhere to distancing to hygiene to track trace isolate and support will be critical in moving forward just to take track trace isolate and support the problem there is it's it's a leaky system so you've got to get people who are prepared if they're feeling a bit ill to contact the testing centers and get tested then be willing to give their contacts then if people are contacted they've got to be willing to self isolate so at every single stage behavior is going to be critical and each bit of leakage will multiply together so understanding the psychological issues dealing with the issues of adherence are going to be absolutely critical but the other point of course is that this pandemic is not only having an effect on our physical health it's having a huge effect on our mental health not only the anxiety of the disease but of course the impact of the measures we're taking against it the impact of the what's going to come next in job insecurity and unemployment so the psychological very much is absolutely at the core of this pandemic and absolutely the core to responding to it effective yeah I think so and it's been really interesting how mental health has been absent from the debate so far and it's something I really wants to come on to hopefully further on into our interview I want to go back to the beginning if we can first of all and I was I was really interested to read in your book Stephen that this idea that the government had demonstrated a lack of trust in the psychology of the people in the early days of the virus and I wanted you to explain what you mean by this and why it matters so much well over the years I've been involved in a number of government committees often around how people will behave in an emergency and within government circles so this is not surprising there is a rather paternalistic view that human psychology is fragile that's human beings are beset by biases by frailties by the inability to deal with uncertainty the inability to deal with probability and so on there so they need government to look after them to get them to behave in the right way to tell them what to do after all if people could look after themselves you wouldn't need government so this notion of human frailty often leads to particular ways of treating the public sometimes not giving them all the information they need sometimes not involving them in the development of policy sometimes being patronizing or sometimes only being willing to give positive information because the assumption is that will track with negative information which has negative effects now one of those negative effects is simply that if you don't treat people with respect they won't respect you in turn there won't be a partnership they won't be trust and there won't be adherence but the second and possibly the more worrying consequence is this the frailty assumption the assumption we are psychologically unable to deal with difficult circumstances and in particular when there's a crisis when there's pressure that we will crack a so called panic perspective can sometimes lead you to not giving people all the information they need for fear they won't be able to build it but when you look at the literature on emergencies and disasters and you look at the factors that lead people to die in emergencies and disasters it's not the overreaction of the public on the whole is under reaction it's not recognizing the danger in time and not trying to get away until it's too late and why do people under react often because they're not given the information they need so the danger has to say about this frailty perspective is it leads you to do things which makes things worse rather than better so I would start from the adage that on a whole trust the people treat them as partners and you will be surprised as indeed the government were surprised during this pandemic about how they'll react mmm fascinating and so if I understand it's understood it properly as there is this idea that the government tends to think of us as psychologically frail it meant that this was one of the factors why the government was slower perhaps to implement lockdown than they perhaps were being advised who for fear that we would get fatigued because that would be something you would expect people to experience fatigue in lockdown if they were psychologically frail well exactly what happened is rather murky we hear various things about psychological frailty about the notion of behavioral fatigue it's not entirely clear exactly where they came from and it's not entirely clear what role they played in delaying lockdown I think I mean that's one of the reasons why I think we need an inquiry and need to understand how science was used or misused and affected the response to pandemic I think such an inquiry is very important but let me take that notion of frailty of behavioral frailty now the first thing to say about it is all the psychologists I know and all the psychologists I discussed it with didn't know where that notion came from the second thing is it's really important to distinguish between what might be a psychological frailty affecting behavior and other forms of fatigue so for instance there's quite a lot of evidence that in pandemics are within the h1n1 pandemic demography is back in Singapore if people stopped feeling anxious stopped feeling there was a problem then they would cease to abide by the restrictions because they didn't believe it was worthwhile people only do something if they believed it was worthwhile so you need clear information about danger and secondly you find that yes people do find it hard to keep her to restrictions and that was true under lockdown but again it wasn't psychological it was because it was practically difficult for many people who were in precarious positions it was hard to stay under lockdown and the same time to put food on the plate that was even or through in poorer countries for instance so the point then is that if there is fatigue often it's due to failures to communicate the danger and failure to give people the practical support they need to abide by the restrictions it's not psychological weakness and to call it psychological weakness in effect is to project the failures of government on the failure of our psychology is to miss attribute where the problem lies it's to allocate blame from where it actually lies so I think the problem has not lain in our psychology it hasn't lain in the frailty of the public in fact if anything the heroes of the piece thus far have been the public the faults and the problems have been very much I think in the information we've been given about what's going on and I think that's a particular problem at the moment and secondly in terms of providing the support that is necessary so that when government says we're all in this together and we'll all abide by lockdown together to make sure actually that is true in practice and everybody can afford and has the resources and support they need in order to do what is asked of yeah because we know when you look at the figures and you look at the compliance figures I think you quote one report that said ninety two percent of the country supported lockdown yeah it with even 50 percent of that we're experiencing hardship in order to do it I mean that is a heroic effort 92 and percent I think those your words sorry yes but you know why isn't that why isn't that the headline story of our experience with Kobe well well the number of points about that I mean first of all you're completely right so the figures there are different figures at different points in time but roughly 90% of people largely abided by Locke that many people going further actually than what was asked of them and not going out at all not because it was easy so lovely research by Bobby Duffy's group at King's College London we love Bobby well you should know that basically I it was something like 48% of the population was under lockdown in doing okay 44% was suffering genuinely suffering they were suffering psychologically they were suffering materially but they still abided by look them now that surprised the government and when it happens people often think oh well there's something special about us they'll say ah well it's it's ours Brits we were wonderful all those days the Blitz spirit and in other countries saying New York well say our well you know that's 9/11 Matt's in New York spirit actually if you look at the literature on disasters and emergencies you find that the whole notion of panic of people cracking up people being frail is actually very misleading it hardly ever happens what tends to happen not always but what tends to happen is that people come together and they come to support each other and they come to be if you like assets for each other and so together knowing that we have the support of others we're much more able to deal with the challenges of hard times and what underlies that is that due to the common experience of a disaster the common fate a common threat we develop a sense of shared identity and that sense of shared identity means that others are not in the sense psychologically other to us they're part of our extended self what happens to them is happening to ourselves and so we become more concerned about that we become more supportive of others as I say together we develop resilience so resilience is not a quality within particular individuals resilience is a collective quality when people come together with shared identity and they say it's been magnificent of the public but not just the British public people have been magnificent in many different countries one of the great ironies for me of the pandemic has been in many ways there's been an inversion of leaders and followers if you look at the arguments about going into lockdown in many ways the public was a head of the government when it came to you know the economic support that was necessary so that people could actually abide by lockdown in a sense you know the government kept on saying or we'll do this little bit and people said that's not enough they did a bit more again the people were leading even in the last few days we've seen with Marcus Rochefort in the outpouring of support for for what he was saying about school meals it was the public who led and the government which which was dragged behind so there's been an inversion and I think I think in many ways while there have been many problems I think of government and governance we've been saved by the collective resilience of the Republic largely held Tibet that together by shared identity beginning to fray and has been damaged I think by some of the things that have happened but to the extent it's held firm it really has been the most precious asset we've had you know and it's it's so so it's so good to hear that because it just hasn't been there and you and why why wasn't there why didn't it feel like we were doing so well why does it feel like we perhaps should be doing more why we're we in here in London just so terrified to go out in case they closed the parks or you know why would people shaming people who had to go on public transport to work why were you know why are we so hypersensitive to our neighbors perhaps Dean Foster that could endanger us why didn't it feel like we were part of such a collective good so well let's stop we are way back before lockdown when we heard all sorts of things about panic buying we heard all sorts of things telling us that you know everybody else was rushing out and being irrational and buying everything up well the first thing to be said about that is that when we waited for a moment and looked at the figures it showed a very small minority of the community wasn't actually doing that that's number one number two to the extent they were doing it it wasn't because they were panicking and irrational they were doing it in part because they were told that there we're about to go into lockdown they're gonna be scarce goods everybody else is buying things so you might as well perfectly sensible thing to do given the information we had and the third point is that if we then had shortages it was not so much due to huge amounts of excess buying it was due to the Just In Time supply systems we've developed over the last 10 or 20 years which means if there's any spike in demand the system collapses so again we blamed on human psychology what was a systemic problem and the other point is this for the media to show a picture of loo roles in Tesco's is hardly a headline to show people fighting over loo roles or to show empty shelves that is a headline so the violations are far more newsworthy than the non violations and this very simple process which people talk about which is the availability heuristic it's nothing actually particularly obscure it's what we believe about the world isn't what is in the world but what we're told is in the world and if the media finds certain things more newsworthy than others it will distort our understanding so very few people will panic buying the papers were full of panic by or again on a during lockdown another example we were told all these things about Co vidiots going out and and and not observing social distancing in the parts well the first point about that again is not that many people were doing it number two to the extent they were doing it they weren't doing anything particularly stupid they were told you can go out so they went out and the only places they could go to in the urban areas were parks and then they found themselves with lots of other people there what's the solution well the solution might be instead of saying oh you're all fools and we're going to laugh at you to say well actually we've got a problem inadequate space so let's think about increasing the amount of space which is publicly available and throughout that period a number of us myself others involved in spy be like Susan Mickey was saying look why on earth don't you do things like open the golf courses open the playing fields give people the space they need again we were blaming on human psychology what was a systemic failure to make the resources available for us to do the things we should and the final point again of course is that the media the story of violations that is far more newsworthy the extent but in some papers they were using long distance lenses to make it look as if everybody was squashed together when they weren't so the way things were represented in the media I think sometimes misrepresented what was actually going on and I think when we come to drop the balance sheet I do think the meat you will need to look at itself I think you know we live in a free country the media can do what they like but actually to represent things in a way which undermines our sense of solidarity and belief in others in a pandemic like this I think has not been journalism's finest hour thank you and it's really interesting there to hear that the advice you were giving to the government about opening up more spaces and I want to go back to your earlier point that if the government had treated us as partners and acknowledged the many ways that we were trying to solve the problem how would it have looked how could it looked how could they have harnessed what we were doing well better well when you look at the literature on why people obey the law why people go along with Authority there are two views one is the big stick view or or instrumental compliance if you like we obey the law because if we don't we'll get punished well to some extent that is true if I stand by you with a big stick and threaten you unless you walk the left your walks are left the problem with that of course is if I'm not there or I take the stick away you won't walk the left audio warps the right so I want to persuaded you and so I have to use more and more and more repression to get you to do what I like the second form is what's called normative compliance we do think because we think it's the right thing we think it's being done for our good what's gonna make us believe things are done for our good is the notion that the authorities themselves are others and for us they're not an alien power imposing on us they are part and parcel of the community and acting for the community so how do they do that and one of the arguments is well you do that in the way that you treat people if you treat people as equals and as a partner then they will respect you they will see you as of us and they're more likely to go along with you that the technical term is procedural justice and that takes a number of forms one is involving people and listening to them another way of talking about that is co-creation if for any policy if you however good it is if you just impose it on people it's alien it's their policy if you involve people talk to them listen to them in the development of policy then it becomes our policy and you're more likely to go along with it second thing to do is to be open and to be honest about problems about limitations about floors not to you know not not to try and hide unfortunate truth from us as if we're children but to treat us as partners a third is to show respect to people a fourth is to yourself abide by the same rules that you impose on others so a whole series of factors are going to be really important now let me illustrate that by making a contrast between the situation in England and Scotland with with schools so what happened was that in England the government announced suddenly that we would get to open schools right didn't have any dialogue beforehand didn't talk to people it imposed it it imposed it in a way that the the stakeholders the parents and the teachers felt alienated and got into an argument with government it was imposed quickly without preparation as well and the consequence has been that things have been set back as schools at Woking open in June it's gotta happen in September in Scotland Scotland see much more cautious it's moved much more slowly but it has involved parents and teachers in discussions it has prepared things in advance to make sure that schools are ready and people have trust that they're going to be safe and the irony is because moving more slowly the schools are now going to open earlier in Scotland than in England so I think that's a rather nice example of how these principles work but the bottom line is this if you want people to go along with you treat them as a partner treat them as one of us treat them with respect and that respect will pay off and yet that's what yet another reason why this psychology of frailty is counterproductive because it leads you to treat people as if they not partners as if they're not equals as if they can't be trusted as if they're children and that way you've a lien eight people you lose their trust and you lose your ability to actually influence and leads them fascinating Thank You Stephen there's so many questions I feel we could do a whole other salon on why the government can't treat us or doesn't treat us as a partner but we I don't know if we can do that today who have many answers but you mentioned policy and government now I do want to come on to to leadership in general and then talk a little bit about that I mean in the book you you look around at leaders from around the world and precisely we just said you know what has made some leaders more successful in their attempts to recruit the energy of others to their cause it doesn't really yeah sorry I feel this in a panel show now because I'm going to I'm going to do a plug so the books a little bit like London buses it takes ages for any to come along and then they come along all at once so we've just completed the book on the pandemic but we've also completed a book myself and a number of colleagues that we've been working on for years about leadership which is going to come out on the 30th of of this month we're very excited about that because leadership is one of the things that really interest me and let me just make a very simple point about leadership many of the classic models of leadership what you might call the great man theory of leadership and they are theories about men they are because leaders are men and it's a very masculine way of looking at the world is that leaders are different from us and what makes great leaders is precisely the ways in which they differ from your feeble human beings like you and me the special qualities they've got the amazing charismatic qualities they've got on a search has always been for that right stuff if only you could find it and you could bottle it you could have perfect leadership and not only empirically has that search for the right stuff failed they've been it's like it's been like a search the holy grail it really hasn't been thousands of studies and at best you know they have a very very small relationship to overall leadership success because the point is this actually what makes a good leader is what they have in common with us what makes a good leader is the way in which they represent the norms and the values and the things we think are important about our group leadership is always about what we share with a leader in a social group which is why leaders of other groups with leader levers feeling completely bemused as to why they're so popular but one of the points about that then is anything which separates you from the leader undermines leadership effectiveness in terms of their ability to influence you the rather nice literature for instance that shows that pay differentials actually decrease performance in an organization um one of my colleagues Alex Haslam has got this lovely rather cheeky little study which shows the same in universities if you look at performance of universities research performance it has a negative relationship to the differential between Vice Chancellors pay and ordinary people's pay so one of the reasons why we should be against top pay it's not only that it's unequal and wrong in itself it's also counterproductive to good performance because we want you know we're gonna be a go along with leaders who we think represent us again who are of us who have of our groups and equally if we do things which separate our cells one rule for us and one rule for them we catastrophic ly undermine that sense of common group membership which is at the root of effective leadership and effective influence and I think one of the things we've seen in this pandemic is it in some cases the leadership has been exemplary if you look for instance at just in there are in in New Zealand in in all that she does in the way she talks to people she talks to people as if she's talking to equals he doesn't talk down to people her manner the way she dresses the way she's not embarrassed about being an augury person an ordinary mother and so on and also the language she uses she uses a language of inclusion there's a lovely literature which which shows something very simple if you look at political candidates so this study has been done on prime ministerial candidates in Australia and also has been done in presidents in the United States those who talk in terms of we and our more are more likely to be elected from those who talked in terms of I and in terms of me so leadership is an us thing right it's about being of the group and acting for the group and as I say anything that undermines that is truly I think corrosive of leadership yeah it's really interesting in your book you have it's only a tiny tiny thing but you have the the text that went out in Australia and the text that went out in New Zealand the night before locked down and I found myself really staring at the New Zealand one because you feel so cared for it's really kind of like thought through where the Australian one just feels so like you're on your own really get on with it you know the the there's such a difference even in that tiny I think it was a tweet actually rather than the text it was just yeah so again I think we can look at the messaging in the UK and I think the Scottish message EIB begin to sound like a cheerleader for for the Scottish government or not I look at them and I assess them against what I think should be done and messaging has been very good I mean their messaging has been about who we are and it's have been about what our norms are what our values are it's being drawing upon those in order to support a sense of community and to support a sense of pro-social norms and and let me just say couple of words about why I think that's important again actually it's a rather profound very simple point is rather profound point in terms of of psychology the assumption that is often made is that we always act in terms of self-interest the human beings are disposed to act in terms of self-interest and rationality is about maximizing self-interest but one of the points that the work that I've done that my colleagues have done over many years is to say look that might be true but it's the self is more complicated than you think if I was to ask anybody in the audience I do this if there's a light apply for a live audience you know who are you they will tell me something about themselves as individuals they'll tell me what makes them distinctive I'm friendly I've got brown hair I like but they'll also tell me something about their group memberships which is just as important you know that I'm a socialist I'm a Catholic I'm a woman I'm a well I'm a Spurs fan I don't know who but they were tell me about those group memberships are critical and the point is that sometimes we think in terms of I and sometimes we think of we sometimes our self is extended so the question when you say we act in terms of self interest then raises the question well what self what is the self of self interest is it the I in which case only what is good for me is in my interests or is it we in which case what happens to the group is in my interests now let's look at the pandemic if people were acting in terms of individual self-interest you know if you're a young person you're healthy right then actually you're very young likely to get very ill by going out and staying in is gonna be a huge pain so in terms of individual self-interest you might say well actually my interest lies in breaking lockdown and lockdown wouldn't work but if you act in terms of collective self-interest what's good for us what's good for the community if people are thinking of themselves in communal terms then going out is very bad for the community because you're gonna kill people you're gonna kill Varner about people in a community so a critical factor in adherence is the extent to which you nurture that sense of shared identity that we feeling and get people behave accordingly a good leadership is about nurturing and building an inclusive and very important that's inclusive an inclusive sense of membership and actually empirically again when you looked at the factors that led people to abide by lockdown it was less individual interest then a sense of community we're in this together we want to come out of this together again that came out of some really nice work from the LSE from Jonathan Jackson's group at the LSE so that so that sense of of shared identity that sense of weenus is absolutely critical to adherence and and Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York but it beautifully he said look this isn't about I it's about we get your head around the week concept in many ways our book is aimed to help people get their heads around the week concept and why it's so important and that's and so this is why it is this whole reason of leaders like Boris were who attempted to see themselves as an exception you know in the early days of shaking hands of kind of the difficulty is it's going against this idea that we're all in it together and that you know making yourself an exception to the rules that we're all having to follow the damage that's done is that right the damage is that your your leaders are then working against this idea of collective self-interest since this extended way that we're all all in it together well I think I mean Boris Johnson leadership uses a technique which was effective in some contexts but is actually counterproductive in the present context you see like many populist s' he benefits from a skepticism about politicians and he seeks to be the anti political politician he seeks to tell us I'm not like the rest of them I'm not like all these clones in there you know who are well dressed in their suits and their ties who are terribly polite and say the right thing all the time I'm a bit chaotic and I'm messy and my hair's all over the place I'm a non-politician when the categories are the people against politicians then politicians who violate the rules of politics were anti political actually become one of us and and his populism was precisely that he cultivated a sense of being chaotic and disorganized the fact that he is chaotic and disorganized think capable of detail but all rather powerful ways of saying I'm not a traditional politician however in this pandemic the categories are very different they're not about politicians versus the people they're about bringing a community together and the stick that works for him in that different context doesn't really work in this context and there's another point which is that to get elected perhaps you have to say I'm one of us but to stay elected and to be effective I've known as an elected leadership you not only have to got to be one of us you've got to be able to deliver for us and that I'm chaotic I don't have an eye for detail type of persona is the last thing you need in a disaster because it means he's not on top of the detail he doesn't know what's going on he's not able to bring together a strategy he's so desperate to be like you know that the benevolent parent who gives us good news but he's not prepared to face up to the realities so what served him very well as if you like an insurgent and an anti political 'since urgent is completely counterproductive in a national crisis where you need to bring the country together where you need actually not only good good good presentation you need good strategy to get us out of this mess and not feeling that there isn't good strategy or that the leader isn't in isn't on top of the details that leads to a feeling of feeling psychologically out of control so that you almost like carrying to the Bukharan the burden yourself for for behavior I mean we need leadership I mean in a crisis we need leadership for a number of reasons as I said we need to leadership to bring us together as a community we need leadership to produce clarity and as you say to to give people a sense of control and a sense that if they act according to what they're asked to do it will bring an actual result so I mean very much I hope our leadership will be strong I mean I may may or may not like the government we've got they're the only government we've got and therefore we've got to do everything we can to help us them to leaders out of this mess and I very much hope that they will and did you think the dominates a couple of questions come through it mentioned Dominic coming so wrap them together but you know do you think that the dominant comings event or situation do you think that further damaged our ability to do what is needed to successfully move through covert the situation with co19 well let me distinguish two things like so I think is very important to do so did the Cummings affair undermine trust the answer is unambiguous yes it did I mean whatever people think about the rights and wrongs I mean there might be some people who still believe that it wasn't breaking the rules to to drive half the links of the country into to drive to bernard council to test your eyesight some people might believe that I suspect I'll never persuade them it's a matter of opinion but what is not a matter of opinion and and the evidence is completely consistent this but there's been a catastrophic drop in entrusting government in fact actually on my deathbed I think I will remember the moment where the Daily Mail did a poll and they asked how many people thought the dollar that Boris Johnson was right to back Dominic Cummings and the answer was 13% and because I tweeted about it they asked how many people agreed with me that he'd undermine trust and 68% agreed with me so in the Daily Mail to be Boris Johnson by 68 percent to 13% I never thought I'd see in my lifetime and I now like to think of myself as the unofficial Prime Minister of the of the United Kingdom is absolutely no doubt at all that the Cummings affair undermined trust in the government and undermined the influence of government but that's different from answering the question of how it impacted behavior because one of the reasons why people were adhering for things was not because of the government it was despite the government and actually again there's some rather nice evidence from Johnson's Jackson's group that people who were more angry at Cummings were less likely to violate restrictions and in a sense to the extent that he positioned himself as out-group not like us then he wasn't an example he was a counter example so the cost is that we might have a government we don't trust in current leaders at the same time it might enable people to do things for themselves and again I come back to this point that if things have gone well in this pandemic in many ways it's despite the government not because of the government it would be so much better if it was with the government it would be so much better if we did have trust we have a leadership that we could that we could go along with them we and could guide us and again I hope the arguments we make will help give us that good leadership but as long as we've got bad leadership and we have to do it for ourselves well the good news is a lot of people are doing it for themselves so the short answer is that the Cummings affair catastrophically undermined the trust and the influence of the government but they didn't necessarily under undermine adherence because people were doing it despite not a constant adjustment okay thank you Stephen I think that's I think that is an answer to Carol and I think the owners question hello Carol hello Fiona I think we've covered your questions I actually got those question from Jill hello Jordan are you in the house tonight hello hello this really interesting and and I know it's a he is a really contentious issue right now so I wanted to ask you she says if we now have a shared sense of identity why are people so loathe to wear a mask when they go out so they don't potentially pass the virus on to others mm-hmm well I think I mean one of the things we need to think about are the nature of social norms and how can we work on those social norms and it's perfectly true that social norms on the whole are gangs wearing masks um when I was acutely aware today I went into my local shop and just before I went into it I stopped to put a mask over my face you know six months ago a man going to a shop pausing putting a mask over his face and then going in would be treated in very very different ways so clearly these things have have particular meanings but those meanings are not set in stone so for instance sometimes people will say are well it's a cultural difference you see they'll say oh well in China they wear masks and we don't and we never will in this country but that's a terribly essentialized notion of culture and terribly a historical because actually the Chinese didn't wear masks actually it was a campaign by the Communist Party in part about notions of modernization and health which led to norms of masks wearing so culture changed it was a function of leadership and it could be done here as well and what we need to do is to begin to think about how we might reconfigure those social norms and I think I mean what we would need is very good and very clear messaging around it because the interesting thing about masks is this to some extent they protect you not that much because microparticles can get through the types of masks that most of us were where we wouldn't be wearing surgical little masks on the whole they protect others so the interesting thing is if properly messaged then wearing a MA becomes a symbol that I care for others and in fact that's exactly how it works in China we need to change the meaning and to change the meaning we need determined consistent and good messaging from our leadership and again I think it's one of the areas when more work needs to be done okay thank you thank you see you then and thank you do and hello Catherine Catherine love day and Catherine's question is I'm Steve do you think there is anything about the pandemic or the way it has been handled that has exacerbated devices nests and hate crime the question I mean it's a really good question and it's a really because it actually goes to the core of the issue so as I said earlier on what you tend to find from the literature on disasters and emergencies is that there is an emergent sense of shared identity but it's fragile and often when you look at the history of a disaster I mean so for instance work has been done by a group at Sussex John Drury who's done actually far more work on emergencies and I should say that and when it comes to emergencies John's the man not me and some of his students including evangelist and Otis lovely work looking at how shared identity develops over time and often the actions of authorities can undermine that shared identity perhaps in the in the rescue efforts they favor one group or another and and so on so it's fragile and it can be nurtured by good leadership and it can be undermined by bad leadership and that bad leadership can exert can be problematic on a number of levels the first level it can be problematic is rhetorical just simply in terms of talking about an inclusive sense of us or a divisive sense of us and them Trump is a superb example of being particularly divisive I think Johnson's comments at the weekend which suggested of them and as a culture wars around statues was deeply I'm helpful so some good things have been said and some bad things have been said but of course it's not just a matter of rhetoric because creating a common category in language is no good if the reality in your experience is very different if we're divided now I think the government did just about enough to keep us together with the furlough schemes with with the schemes of the self-employed again in part because the public demanded it but they did enough so that in practice people could just about abide by the restrictions it was difficult I don't know how many people watching saw the day after the Cummings press conference there was an item on champ channel 4 news which in many ways I thought was the most powerful thing I've seen in the entire pandemic and it was about a black family a single mother of two kids eleven and three that the mother got covered 19 and and was helpless that the 11 year old was looking after three year old that they have so little money that their food was was watered down baked beans and yet still they showed that the resilience and they showed that the strength that Dominic Cummings couldn't show in those circumstances I mean they were really quite extraordinary so people could just about do it but they were under severe stress and the problem is that if in practice you know people can't act in the same way the normal rhetoric in the world would do no good if people can't afford to stay at home then you will be divided so I think we did probably just about enough that held us together for a period but now I fear that that's changing you know these these schemes will change let's think for instance about the track and trace system if you ask people to be tested to reveal their content and they contacts then to self isolate that's a really difficult thing to do it's a difficult thing to do because first of all you'll probably be feeling well if you're contacted secondly you're being asked to self isolate precisely at the point that other can go out and thirdly it's not to yourself you don't benefit from self isolating you help the community because you're not going to affect them now how can you ask people to do that unless you give them the support that's necessary to do that how can you ask them to do that if they subjected to them financially how can you ask them to do that if they live in crowded households or multi-generational households you need to think about the support that you give to people and one of the problems that there's been debate about you know tracking traces of people have forgotten the material issue the material support that we need to give people in order for them to be able to do things so I thought to me the first thing in any policy is to say what do we want people to do let's not start from the premise that they are weak stupid and and lack will let's start from the premise which is what the evidence shows that they're actually highly motivated and let's look at how we can support them let's have an approach which is about facilitating people to do the things that we asked them to do and I'll just finish with this was again it's a piece of research I thought it's a very powerful piece of research that came out in the midst of lockdown which showed that poor people are six times more likely to break lock down and black people three times more likely not because of motivation their motivation is exactly the same that's not the point the point is material it's about support so I would give the government seven out of ten six or seven out of ten for the rhetoric I would give them about three out of ten for the support and things are getting worse and unless we do something about the support then the critical intervention at the moment the track and trace intervention will not work Thank You Steven it's powerfully put thank you catherine is a superb question hello that I should it's always the people who you think of as your friends who ask you the really difficult yes you've just got to come with the answers Syrian it's really interesting you talk about things changing cause I think this leads on to Helen G's question hello Helen I think you were also digital hello hello and she says Stephen what's the psychology of coping with a pandemic in the medium to long term how different will our page need to be well one of the things is that I think I mean I think clarity of messaging is absolutely critical you see I go back to this notion of fatigue I think that human beings there's quite a lot of evidence of human beings are pretty resilient and could put up with hard times there quite a long time sometimes people even relish challenges if by overcoming them they assert their membership of of particular communities it might sound very different but we did some work on a very grueling mass festival in northern India where elderly people bathe five times a day in the Ganges sometimes before well actually every day before dawn even when the water is virtually freezing and it's a real ordeal but in doing it they assert that they are true in those and that most of all deal actually is a very very powerful notion of many is we rather forgotten it but I think people can be resilient in in those terms if they understand why my real fear is that we did have a reasonably clear overall message during lock that we were told that unless we observe lockdown then the infection will spike the NHS will give way and who taunts the people will die but the messaging now there's no overall view there's no overall mental model social representation of what's going on it's more everything's relaxing everything's becoming easier happy Monday we're gonna stop doing this and stop doing that and stop doing the other and there isn't the Clare t-that actually that's not true we are still in the middle of a deadly pandemic the infection is still there higher levels and it was probably in early March and if we relax or if we become less vigilant then it will spike again and many many people will die people forget that if you look at the Spanish flu pandemic of a century ago it's the second or third waves that killed many more people what's changed now is that what's happening is that we've changed strategy and that and the metaphor I use is it's a bit like you know if you're in a conflict and you're being attacked every night bombers are coming over every night you don't know where everybody's got to get in the bunkers to stay safe but once you discover radar and you know where you're gonna be attacked you can see where the attack is coming then you can target your response accordingly not everybody needs to hunker down so we're changing to a targeted strategy but it will only work if we maintain vigilance if we maintain social distance and physical distance actually we shouldn't maintain social distance we should maintain physical distance if we increase hygiene standards if we abide by track and trace and unless we have an overall understanding of that danger rather than this rather inchoate good news Bon Ami which we get from the government and which we get in the messaging the real danger is that we will fail in those targeted strategies and things will increase so my real fear again it's not a psychological issue of weakness it's the importance of an absolute overall clarity of the situation that we're in and the need for continued or even increased vigilance as the quid pro quo of coming out of lockdown that's where the dangers lie they don't lie in the frailty of the human psyche that's not our problem got it and actually you know really interesting Hannah's question really does kind of bring into sharp focus this idea it's just not it's not going away and you know I want to just ask one one or two more questions before we come to a close but you know I think we have to think we have to talk about mental health you know and questions coming from marina one of our solemn members hello marina and I see Matthews there as well hello hello and marinas got a question about our mental health I'm gonna broaden out a little bit you know we have spoken a lot about people's physicals health that I want to talk about people's mental health and that really wanted to understand from you as an expert on groups but you know as this goes on how much is being cut off from the usual groups that we were part of and the sustain our you know our good mental health how is that going to affect us and why hasn't this been discussed by government well I mean my wife is clinical psychologist and so I I am very aware of of the mental health issues but it's nothing new I mean interesting out up how many times over the last ten years we've been told we must make a priority of mental health I mean it seems like every Tuesday we told mental health will be a priority I remember Nick Clegg used to go on it about it a great length and others go out and it never ever happens and similarly at the moment we are told well mental health is a huge issue there's going to be a tsunami of mental ill-health quite right but yet again it seems to be the Cinderella we're gonna have all sorts of problems we're gonna have problems of people who are traumatized by what's happening oh you know during a pandemic we're going to have the mental health problems of those who are vulnerable and remain shielded we can have mental health problems of people who are anxious about losing jobs and absolutely it's it's an absolute priority I just want to go back though to one other point I was making earlier because it's another dimension of the group psychology which we write about and which at least gives us some hope because just a moment ago I corrected myself I use the word social distance when I shouldn't have one of the paradoxes of this pandemic is but being physically close is likely more liable to kill us or at least give us the infection so we need to say physically apart on the other hand being socially isolated from other people harm does as well right and there's some lovely evidence from my co-authors in Australia they look at health risks and if you compare for instance isolation to smoking 20 a day or drinking or having a bad diet you get people to rate them and they say oh well member the most important things are of course smoking and drinking a bad diet actually the most important thing is social isolation social isolation is more likely to kill you than is smoking or drinking or bad health but the good point is that if people feel socially connected and if they feel part of social groups so even strangers who are part of those groups they think might support them that's an incredibly powerful prophylactic to health so I'll give you a couple of examples I really like that number one when you retire if you lose to social group memberships the chance of dying within two years or 16% and these social groups could be acquire could be anything being a member of salon London whatever yeah absolutely very good idea it's good that's true tonight but if you lose to group memberships you've got a as I say you've got a 16 percent chance of dying if you gain to you group memberships you've got a 0.5 percent chance of dying a 30 percent difference or again if you're an 80 year old right and you have you're a member of many social groups you're well socially connected you will have the cognitive acuity of a 70 year old but if you have poor social connections if you're not members of social groups you are likely to have the cognitive acuity of a 90 year old a 20-year difference so groups are really good for our health the term that has been used is the social cure they're more powerful in any drug we've discovered if you want the best prophylactic against depression it's not taking pills not very popular with the pharmaceutical industry cuz they're not going to make much money out of it it's being a member of social groups so the question then is how do we keep people socially connected how do we keep people socially together while physically apart which is why our book is called together apart and so those issues of group membership are powerful in bringing us together and powerful in terms of making us effective practically with pandemic but they also preserve our psychological well-being within the pandemic of course it's not the only factor around mental health but is a very well empower powerful one and some ways and you know if we are to find optimistic things people are finding new forms of connectedness families for instance are having quiz we have it we have a family quiz night every Sunday and I used to see sort of all members of the family you know all around the country about once a year or so now every Sunday we meet up we connected we we see the new baby that's been born or whatever it is so perhaps we can learn about the power those forms of of connectedness and perhaps their ways in which we can help people who are suffering from social isolation so as I say the group is powerful in helping us out here it's powerful in giving us the mutual support the mutual aid that's been so important it's powerful in terms of our preserving and mental well-being which is why we feel group psychology is one of the best assets we have in this content you know so if it is music to our ears I think you know that these social activities are not optional extras they're crucial to our you know excellent psychological functioning and that you know we can join a choir you know we can struggle long with the Xoom family chat yeah we could do we can do these things these are in our power and we as an organization who does this we can work out how to reach out to people who are alone and and and deliver interesting make them parts of groups it's certainly given me a lot to think about I mean choirs are a lovely example because there's another whole literature about how embodied coordination is good for psychological coordination there's a great book by historical McNeill and it's called something like marching together in time it's about dance and drill in history and how if you move together be marching together it might be dancing together it might be singing together it might be playing music together all these things that coordinators in an embodied way also bring us together psychologically and again that strengthens us we're part of a web which sustains us when you look at developmental psychology there's this notion everybody will know about a socially secure base if you feel you've got security in your parents you're more likely to feel confident going out into the world well what group membership gives you it's a socially secure base if you feel part of a group and you feel that other people in the group are there for you you know that if you come into difficulties when you go into the world other people will support you and that lowers stress and the interesting thing is that's not only good for your mental health it's good for your physical health because lowered stress has all sorts of physiological consequences which feed into health so doing things together with people embodies coordination choirs in particular they're all very good for you brilliant and one of our co-founders Juliet Rosso he's one of the leading UK vocal coaches and runs a community choir we'll be so happy with that answer and marina and Sarah I hope you've got some answers that you can take from that from both of your questions we have to bring it to a close now Stephen but I just wanted to I could squeeze in a quick very quick answer because I've got a question for my dad Peter hello dad how are you and he said thank you for a fascinating talk his question is if you were publishing the book now what key updates would you make knowing what we know now versus 6 weeks ago what six weeks it has been okay well hello hello aunt Helens dad and thank you for that question because it allows you allows me to make a proviso what I've been saying because group psychology in many ways you could argue is like dynamite in that it's incredibly powerful and it can be incredibly socially constructive after all Nobel you know invented dynamite because it helps in the construction industry helps us build roads and helps us build bridges and so on it can of course be used in an incredibly destructive way as we've discovered in the last two centuries so I'm not saying that group psychology is always good I'm saying it can be good if that power is used constructively and it can be used destructively and the way it's used destructively is to change from an inclusive way to a sense of we and the bay and in particular when you set up particular other groups as as a threat or a danger to our society and when that happens actually the worst or behaviors come out in pandemics because historically yes we find lots of examples of good behavior in pandemics we find appalling examples as well in the Middle Ages during the Black Death there was huge amounts of anti-semitism because Jews were blamed for the black death on one day alone once and Bartholomew's day thirty and forty nine in Strasbourg 2,000 Jewish people were burned to death five thousand Jewish communities were destroyed and I think it's really important to recognize when things go wrong and when in part because of the actions of government dividing us into us and they that social cohesion of a common group leads to division into different groups and leads then to the potential for huge conflict so I think we talked about that in the book and we warned against complacency that so far at least in the UK we haven't had that social discord we haven't when we wrote but we looked at the conditions under which it might happen and we've seen that happen in the United States so I think what we warned of as a possibility we would now have the opportunity to be able to analyze much more openly and show that the importance of building a common way is not only because of the positive its brings but because of the absolute destructiveness it comes about when you divide a community and certain people are placed outside the community and certain people aren't given the material support they need to be fully part of the community and still worse then when you start bleh people from not being able to abide by restrictions I think that would have slightly greater prominence in the book if we were writing it today okay thank you Steven and thank you Dad great question you're the best Steve's been such a pleasure and to talk to you and understand I'm so much more from your trailblazing work in how crowds behave and thank you so much Hey finally the book is free to download so if it's possible to put up the link it's about to come out in hardcopy I do feel terrible I feel like SSA is 3 and if you buy the book all money is going to go to save the children so we're not making anything out of it I just hope it will be valuable to you and that you'll be able to use it practically in whatever walk of life you're in yeah absolutely I think we sent it out to to all of our list and we can put it on our website and on our Facebook and if anyone doesn't can't find them anywhere email us and I'll send you a link to see the problem if people haven't had time to ask a question you can always email me and I'm very happy to reply if I don't it's because I get too many emails but reminds me I always I was I was answer in the end so if you want to ask you're more than more than welcome and I'm sorry to be talking to you without being able to see you perhaps someday in the future I'll be able to actually see you soon so thank you thank you see Vinay very much hope so too because we run a festival and you've got a lot to say and we want to hear it so I hope to see you at a festival soon I was going to say thank you so much for being part of this incredible salon I've wanted to work with Steven for a long time and it's been such a pleasure to talk to him and thank you very much all our members thank you for being with us for Thursday night for our salon lockdown and as Steven says please do get our copy of his book there is a free pdf available if you'd like it or it's being sold but I think if the publisher is sage and all the profits are going to save the children so if you want to do that's an option - thank you ",True,False,True,False

#subscribetocollinseow #systematictrader","congratulations for joining us in the Mucky inside virtual submit I'm so glad to see you here today stay to the end of the training and I'll send you a 30 pitch report called winning trading strategy so say to the end of the video and email this free report to you hi Colin just beer so thank you thank you for this interview my pleasure I should be fun what's that yes I'm in Scottsdale Arizona it's gonna be a beautiful sunny day here and it's seven o'clock in the morning my time I guess it's 10:00 p.m. your time so I guess I could say good evening or something I just woke up and had breakfast oh yeah yeah it's it's been interesting because my life is it doesn't change a lot I'm adjusting my camera here the my life these days in retirement is spent on my website a lot and trying to do my own trading research I write they still write a few research papers every now and again on the markets still express my opinions on social media if anybody's following me you'll see that I'm not too shy about that and you know so to me this time isn't all that much different than what I could I tend to do most of the time but I have actually played more golf because golf provides social distancing because especially if you play with most golfers if one guy hits it on the right side the other hits it over here and the other side you're a hundred feet apart so you really don't get you know get too close to each other and it's it's a good way to have a lot of fresh air get some sunshine so they decided that that was a safe activity however you don't touch the pins there are no ball washers there no wet rags to to wipe off your clubs or anything it's all very you can't touch anything ya know so I've actually played more golf than I usually do I've actually won a few tournaments and you know and I've done well and others it's it's just you know like most golfers would tell you it's just who shows up that day and sometimes you're you have a little luck your goes your way and and you add to that some talent and and you prevail and a lot of other times you don't it's kind of like trading there's very a whole lot of similarities first thing that comes to mind is that there's no way that you can ever be perfect at either trading or golf you know there's always another percent return you could have made if you had had a little bit more ability to to somehow figure out what to do golf's the same way there's always one more stroke you could shoot the record score of your life and immediately know that you could have done one stroke better if I just made that putt on 17 so that's one thing the second thing is it's it's tends to be a profession trading tends to try to find your weak spot psychologically speaking if you're prone to being greedy or gambling or you you like the you know you like the whole thing of trying to you know trying to get the big kill it's the same way in golf is going for the par five and two and over water or something you know there's a lot of there's a lot of of similarities and I'm gonna mute my phone here I didn't do that I apologize a little bit like going for home running treating you exactly right it's the same exact thing and then the other thing is there's a lot of to me practice and research that goes into trading that's why I spend a lot of time still on the computer I'm still I'm taking a course in c-sharp and and you know trying to build out a little bit more of a trading platform for myself you know those types of things it's kind of i liken that to go practicing your chipping or putting in golf it it seems on the surface somewhat boring but i it's kind of builds the fundamentals so that you can be a better trader you you don't just all of a sudden come to the trading game and all of a sudden you know turn on your quote machine and and everything is easy all of a sudden that doesn't strike me as very likely to be successful so if there's there's lots of analogies i all my life i've golfed all my life i've traded if it's always right there's principles that are always right well yes I think so statistically for instance in golf putting if you just did two putts on every hole would be 36 putts if you made par on the course you shoot maybe 72 so you end up with half your strokes would be putting so putting is far more important than most people would give it credit for and I happen to be a good putter which helps but you end up I think in trading it's the same kind of thing you're there's if you can have movement in the markets then you can do profits in the markets if you don't have movement in the market it's kind of hard to buy and buy low sell high when the market isn't going anywhere understand so there's a tendency there's certain things in trading that are sort of truisms like let your profits run cut your losses short during uh you know in golf it's how many greens and regulation can you hit how many putts can you make those types of things are far more statistically important than how far you hit a driver understand and what you're also saying is control things that are within your control like in trading you focus on doing the right thing and then at the end of the things that you cannot control the result is something that sometimes it's out of your control it is there were times sometimes it's the win it's windy sometimes it's rainy not on the golf course same thing golf sometimes sometimes you know President Trump does a tweet and the market goes nuts one way or the other and and you know you're in the middle of a position and you get your stop set and you know that's the nature of the game it's not it's not anything that it's unexpected it is just something that you know you have to build into your thought process and your approach to doing what you're doing saying yeah so what are the few critical things in trading that you know is you must have like like do you treat like certain setups or are you a trend follower are you a scalper what kind of things do you particularly look at I would always say especially after retirement I am much more inclined to you know do stuff long term it's just easier I look at daily data typically I also I tend a trend follow and I can get a trade to go off on a trend following trade and just sit there and sit there and sit there and I don't have to do many things so I can you know leave the office and I don't have to be sitting here glued to a machine all day long which doesn't strike me as a retirement that I want so and even though I spend a lot of time on a computer I frequently am working on I'm taking a course in computer language or I'm playing around with a research project I'm not sitting there glued to the quote machine okay so you know looking on on trading itself rather than to treat so yeah right moving your process Roger glory yeah one of the things that struck me back I was fortunate to think of this back in my 20s probably was that human endeavor can sort of be broken into two camps there's the things that a machine could do for you and there's the things that machine's cannot do for you so if you think of it in today's world real easily with just a laptop computer you could set up a small trading operation you could do it in an Excel spreadsheet mm-hmm you could actually automatically transmit your orders to your broker without you touching them whatsoever yes now that squeezes out human endeavor because human a you know just what I would call the repetitious type of human endeavor that simply does the same thing over and over again if you've I've probably put in tens of thousands of orders over my lifetime I'm 67 now okay I have no idea I've never counted them or even tried to figure it out but it's got to be tens of thousands across all the markets we've done now if you take that and you said a human being had to do those tens of thousands that gets pretty boring after a while it's about the same exciting thing that breathing I mean you breathe in breathe out you don't even think of it and that's kind of the way putting orders in but when you get that board of something you tend to make mistakes understand so a computer doesn't get bored it just does what you tell it to do so if you write the program right it sends the order in now writing that program that's the other side of human endeavor that's the creative side that's the side that allows you to create art create music create a new program create a new trading program that will do something for you and leverage your time mmm if you spend your time as much as possible building new processes and new ways of of telling the computer to do your sort of drudgery work for you that allows you more time to be more creative which is a lot more fun than just writing up a bunch of tickets so I always try to think of my endeavours I you know after there's some things I do every day that are not automated that I still have to spend some time doing I mean I have to take the garbage out to the street for instance so it picks up once a week you know there are certain things that we don't have robots for yet but there are a lot of things the more and more I try to spend time creating new and interesting ways in my life to not have to do the drudgery and and that's fun I think it's a it's a lot of fun it makes for a a lot of challenges because you're always thinking of ahead and trying to be positive and enjoy the ride basically you know enjoy the ride say ETR yeah enjoy the right doc don't worry that world yeah if you want to learn more about trading you can go to the website enjoy right well you can there's a lot of videos and entry education materials over there yes there's a cow on the side I'll tell you a story of how that all got started okay my wife and I were sitting there at the pool in Spain one day in October about two years ago mm-hmm and I said you know I'm having this problem people keep sending me emails over and over again and they asked the same questions over and over again and I give them the same answers and I've answered thousands of emails at this point in retirement okay retired about 16 years at that point okay and I decided you know if we could come up with way where I could asynchronously answer people's questions in other words I don't have to be directly in conversation like right now we're synchronous you're asking questions I'm giving answers we're having a conversation so we're both present but if you were sending me an email I could go play golf right now and maybe I answer your email this afternoon yes and then you would answer my email maybe tomorrow correct and so that's ace asynchronous mm-hmm and so we decided then and there that hey how about if we do and enjoy the ride world website mm-hmm and I will just keep putting my brain my knowledge of trading into the website and put things on hedging and things of that you know books that I think are great to read videos of me talking about trading webinar recordings things that people might might help people get into trading and understand some of the basics that way again I'm doing one thing one time and then it goes to the website and then people can get education off the website and it leverages my time I don't have to hit you know if 16,500 followers on twitter I cannot if everybody the same day sent me a direct message I would take me all day long and the next day to try to answer everybody but if everybody can go to the website and get a lot of answers there then it's it's just a lot more efficient way to transfer the information so that was just my idea that's the story behind enjoy the ride dot world and so far it's been successful it pays for itself I don't have to go into my pocket to keep it running and it's fairly easy to keep it running I update stuff every now and again and a research paper here and there but it's a lot of fun I call it's my it's my retirement website where he was most active because I see you active on Twitter I see you on Facebook website where if people want to look for info look for you or lick get the latest view from you where is the best place to look for you is it I usually when I do something on Twitter I do the same thing on Facebook so either one works I prefer Facebook myself because it has a little bit easier ability to message and it has a little bit more ability maybe I like saying things in long sentences but the the character limit on Twitter drives me nuts sometimes I have to I go ahead and I I've gotten to where I just do my pronouncement that I want to do that that in that tweet and then it usually always runs over and then I have to go in and change all the ends to ampere signs and and and throw in a - instead of a tee oh and I just kind of like start getting characters out of the tweet okay and so it's kind of a challenge for me to deal with Twitter but once I get Twitter done I always do Twitter first and then I copy it over to Facebook because Facebook doesn't have the limitations so I kind of prefer Facebook in the end but I use both I don't do a lot of Instagram I I still haven't figured out you know how how how that's useful I sometimes I'll throw a chart up there or a picture when I'm on vacation something but it doesn't uh yeah I yeah Instagram was a little strange to me I haven't figured that one out yet yeah so you're talking about Facebook is your Facebook page or is it your Facebook profile wow that's another story Facebook on my personal portfolio or a personal Facebook page has the limitation of five thousand and they notice you have the same problem you have so many friends that you hit your limit then people keep sending you friend requests and they can't get into you know you can't accept them because Facebook will reject it and so I ended up creating a page called enjoy the ride dot world so it's because it's adding joy the ride dot world and it's just my it's the same thing as my normal page I do all my posts over on my page you can like that you don't even need to send me a friend request just follow it like it no that's you're gonna get everything that I ever put out if you try to do a friend request I dutifully will process it up to 5,000 and I'm getting closer so I'm gonna end up having to reject people and mean why all the page is unlimited so that's the easy way to go you don't even had to send me a friend request and if you like my page you can always communicate with me by messenger or whatever I don't see it as a downside I'm telling me exactly my friend coming back to trading the thing you mentioned to enjoy the right to write the train and how do you actually write the trend do you use like a trailing stop laws to use like a moving average well yeah I a big fan I'm a big fan of trying to include things like volatility into my calculation so things like Keltner bands yes Bollinger Bands and dungeon channels are probably my three favorite because each one has a sort of component of volatility built in in other words if it's very volatile market and the bars are very wide or the candlesticks are very wide you're gonna have dungeon channels that are wider mmm automatically okay Kellner's are based on an average true range so you have a moving average in the middle of the prices and you have a top and bottom band based on x times 2 3 times whatever the average true range which is a measure of volatility so as soon as the market gets volatile the Keltner bands start going wider and wider and the top line is where I like to buy the bottom line is where I like to sell simple everything in between is noise I ignore it then top nineties when you enter the position enter the position and the bottom line would be where you go short or get out of the position ok so you want something to move into that in that direction and I wanted to I want it to start moving ok go through the top line ok so now it's no longer noise noise is what we ignore in-between okay once once we get above the top line it's no longer noise it's a trend to read he says at room it's a real move after move beyond it exactly so you know depending on your time period you guys I've got I've got some stuff that I do that's fifty days okay count their bands I've got other ones that I'm doing where I'm doing some combination indicators on a nine day basis you know very short term for me short term maybe for you long term if you're a day trader that's that's forever but you know I think different time periods can diversify you different markets can diversify you different indicators can diversify you I see nothing wrong with especially if you can use computers to your advantage into running several different strategies at the same time because they can you can diversify by approach or by strategy for example let's say you have a trend following strategy that's a 21 day Keltner ban alright so that's the first the first thing you're looking at is a trend following model and let's say you're doing it across 20 commodity markets so you're trading gold and Japanese yen and you're trading the meets you know the live cattle and you're trading you know grains and all sorts of things you have a diversified portfolio okay okay sooner or later you're going to end up with times when that approach is going to end up having a rough time you know just by sheer chance no matter whether you're diversified or not there's going to be times where statistically they're all going to be kind of not going anywhere and if it's not going anywhere that type of an approach is not going to make money it's going to lose money so down you go well how about if you have a second approach that trades perhaps those same markets but does it some kind of a mean reversion where you look at the same range and you try to trade the noise so you set your stops you look for a place where your stops are closed you look for it to be stretched out maybe an RSI stochastic or some kind of a measure of overbought oversold is included and when your overbought you sell or when your oversold you buy with a tight stop and you attempt to try to work the range well that's going to tend to make money in the sideways when the other strategy is losing money and this thing so what you end up doing is sort of helping each other you know keep the performance sort of a straight line going up the page instead of all the you know the up and down I you know especially in retirement I like straight lines just fine I I'm not looking to hit home runs I'm just looking to try to plot along and increase the portfolio so it is by diversifying by strategy it's hard to do if you're doing it all by hand but if you keep adding it with computers you can do different things that have different return streams and add them all together and smooth everything out a little bit more and it makes it easier to enjoy the ride because you aren't you know something there's always something good happening somewhere and there's probably something bad something happening somewhere and it sort of evens out your mentality it doesn't even though your equity curve also right exactly so you have some tester sunrise you have some strategies there's trend following and following the trend and then some strategy there are mean reversion so what time when when the market over time and market move whether it's trend trending or my day is non trending over time you must move up there equity curve is that what you're saying yes exactly I'm trying to smooth the equity curve every day return to risk goes very very high if you do that because your risk gets very small and your your overall portfolio risk the risk of any one position the risk of any one strategy could be fairly great but when you add it all together you've designed it so that it sort of smooth say they fight each other all the time and that's kind of a good thing it's just the same thing as the diversify a stock portfolio where you have if you could find truly diversification and stocks that's harder and harder these days because I noticed them when the United States goes down you know Far Far East goes down the Europe goes down we should go back to New York and start all over again and it's not real easy to find a place to hide these days out there in the world when I started back in 74 coming out of college in university it was a lot easier to get diversification by doing foreign stocks and and there was the currency fluctuation that helped out and there was a lot more nowadays it's so so I can get everything yeah it's everything's computerized so it's just as easy for somebody to go on their computer and go into their broker and you know by Hong Kong index or something mm-hmm as it is to buy the S&P you know and so it's it's a type of thing where the world's gotten to be a very small place evidenced by I'm talking to Singapore right now live with video that wouldn't have been possible back when I came out of university it would have been possible even a few years back yes interesting thanks for sharing in fact I'm also doing some algo trading on our own we try to diversify across strategy also what my main challenge is sometimes even in trending market there is high volatility trending market and low volatility trading market and in yeah so that is I was right always trying to figure out you know when I am great when is trending is it high volatility or low volatility same thing for when the stock market there's also such thing is in the second we market rate kendos are very long or the can doesn't really short in assembly market so we also trying to figure this out myself yeah thanks but thanks for sharing kappa kappa no channa something events right so maybe I will look at that Bollinger Band something that I use so thanks for sharing that also yeah so so correct me I'm wrong so it most of your trading system at Trading America seeding the missus based on rules that you backed ass yeah I was a chemical engineer by degree and loved computer programming so I I'm still taking courses in cos so I fairly comfortable sitting in a computer and knocking out a little code I'm not as good in c-sharp let's say that I that I was back in the Foxborough days but that still existed before Microsoft shut him down and Trent at my firm back in the day had about we estimated about a million dollars it cost me personally to build trend step although all the trading strategies and the platforms and the broker connections and the equity checkouts and we were handling through over a dozen desks it's you know I think several hundred clients and six hundred million dollars in u.s. and across 30 currency pairs eighty futures markets about 25 mutual funds we were trading is a lot going on that's a lot of data there's no way my 10 persons staff could handle that without the 40 computers that we had doing all the work so I've always been a process type of person because if you think of a chemical factory which is what chemical engineers think of you have chemicals come in front side you process it you know you put it in tanks you heat it up you cool it down you distill it you combine it with other chemicals and you then ship it out well isn't trading the same thing you're bringing in data you're making decisions with it and processing it you're shipping out orders the same thing so I I always looked at what we did at Trent said as a mini chemical factory except with data instead of chemicals and I ran it that way so everything was sort of combined together the more I could process stuff and the more I could make it efficient the more the chemical factory ran more efficiently with less errors and the better we did you know so I that'sa spend my slant on life mcc's life a lot easier I you're not except if the internet goes down or you don't get any data more then and stress levels go right up and you have to try to scramble and figure out how you're gonna get your order s'en but yeah most of the time it's pretty easy so trading right now it's like discretion early if this kind of discretionary means you still look at the market or how many percent is really like this system trading that's a hundred percent system and percent discretion yeah that's my go-to yeah I always am kind of amazed that people will direct message me or something and saying you should really look at and then they give me a ticker symbol I don't ever look at any ticker symbols I I don't even you know I I just kind of politely say not interested because I have everything systematized yeah what you're trying to do with various languages is just have a platform where you can take a set of data and you come up with an idea let's say you you say okay well we just mentioned Keltner bands a little while ago so maybe say I want to check what a Keltner bandwidth is going back for 20 years so you get the 20 years of data and you write a little code mm that is just nothing but Keltner band and by the way you could go to investopedia.com and getting the formulas for about a hundred different indicators you don't have to just look at Kellner's there's there's so many that like I don't even know them all I have to go to investopedia some people say you ever looked at an arun oscillator and I'm through now I've never even heard of it and so I just go to investopedia and I look it up and oh okay that's what it's not yeah yeah that's interesting that's different you know there's so many different indicators and there's new ones being invented every day and what you know somebody said Arun oscillator its AR oon and not UN on the chair is EF de algún is this yeah I mean but I somebody asked me that the other day about a week ago and I've never heard of this so I mean I'd have been around I've been trading heavily for forty five years and before that when I was a paperboy at twelve I bought mutual funds so I've been in investing for a lot of years and I had never heard of this indicator and I thought all right now go to investopedia and there it was and with the formula and everything and I can look at the math and I can understand what it's doing and it even gives you an idea of how to use the indicator but the point I'm making is there's just so many different ways to sort of attack the markets and I think one of the important things that everybody on this call should think about is what are you trying to solve what's that what's your personal investing puzzle that you are trying to solve you don't want to trade like Tom or I would submit like Collin each person has his own skill level mhm has his own knowledge of say computers has his own knowledge of math maybe you are more of a discretionary trader and that works for you because you're you have that type of mental framework I'm not that type of guy hmm but I've run into people who are excellent discretionary traders I'm not in saying you can't be but with with your net worth your nationality in terms of what country you sit in the laws of that country on what you can trade what you can't trade the liquidity of those vehicles everything is different you can't just take what one person does and translate it over to another person super easy but what you can take is the principles and that's what I always try to stress the people is to think about what skills you have and what how much capital are you trying to train and what markets are you most comfortable with some people are terrified by trading futures me I've done it 40 years it's like breathing to me but it's it's a learned skill I mean when I was born I did not have a knowledge of futures I had to read books I had to try it I had to make mistakes it took me four years to break even the fifth year I broke II I finally made money and I think once I got going and I understood the advantages of it I decided okay I got to get better at this and you just keep doing it but what I I encourage everybody to do is to think of sort of a buy-sell engine that makes your decision think about your position sizing because and that's what I wrote a book last year on position sizing and that's on the website okay it's ten dollars it's not going to break anybody's bank and what it is a simple math that allows you to say should I buy a hundred shares or 200 shares or a hundred fifty shares on this stock that I'm considering because once you know the risk and the volatility you can then go ahead and attempt to do a consistent position sizing just to buy the same size and shares in a whole bunch of different positions mm-hmm means you have different dollar sizes different volatilities you're not really balancing the portfolio very much mathematically and so there's lots of easy tricks to do but if you can build a buy-sell engine build some kind of position sizing that tells you how much to buy so now you know whether you're going long or short how much you're going along it short and you're indicator tells you what price you're going long and short mmm how you starting to get the the aspects of creating that first order and it's for you it's not for Tom it's not for Collin it's not for anybody else on this call mmm that makes it easier for you to solve your particular investment puzzle I think solving or copying somebody else's solution does not necessarily fit yours but just in sizing using volatility is it like you use some saw like an ATR to complete the size instead of a 2% ways you just pay survival so an easy example the stocks going up and down one dollar a day okay you've got $100,000 in your portfolio and you want to put 1% of that into your position so you know you got the volatility is one dollar a day mm-hmm you know you're allowed to put $1,000 or 1% of volatility into that position mmm you would divide the $1 into the 1,000 and it would tell you to do 1,000 shares and you would have exactly one percent of your equity at risk to the volatility of that one position and I think you could volatility match 10 positions and they would all have one thousand dollars of volatility so one position might be a thousand shares the next position might be 800 shares and the next position might be a very volatile stock you might only be able to buy a hundred shares but they would all contribute to your portfolio precisely the same at that moment in time still measuring size based on capital you measure size based on volatility right yeah and then risk you could do it too you can say I'm gonna buy here and I'm gonna sell there so I've got $1 worth of risk my stop is at $1 I've got $100,000 I'm gonna take 1% risk of any one position so I can buy a thousand shares of the stock because I've got a $1 if I've got a $2 risk then I can only buy 500 understand so the bigger the wreath the smaller you you can follow the position and that what that does for you is in a week should address the you know the the latest markets I mean this virus thing virus crash you could call it or whatever you've had huge huge increases in the volatilities unbelievable I've seen numbers and I've seen bars and candles that I have never seen in my life of trading these are so huge circuit breakers kicking in it has been fascinating for me to watch and throughout the whole thing I haven't changed single thing I do all my strategies worked great it's probably one of the most profitable periods of my lifetime and so what do you do to deal with that and stay very serene well the easy solution is sizing because mmm if I'm I don't know pick an example short Nasdaq futures or something and I'm enjoying the ride downward now but because I've had multiple contracts I say I had 10 contracts to create a simple example and the volatility is now doubled and I'm now way over the amount of volatility as a percent of my equity that I'm comfortable with that Nasdaq position and I've already preset those numbers I mean I can say all right I don't want any more than two and a half percent of my portfolio is volatility coming from any one position well let's say I'm at five percent because the thing has gone insane well sell-off after position now I've got five NASDAQ contracts okay I'm still short I'm still enjoying the ride I still got two and a half percent volatility of my portfolio no big deal it's the same as it was when I was at two and a half percent volatility you know before the thing started crashing current to ten so everything stays the same relatively and with Commission's being so inexpensive these days in many places with the electronics and everything you can adjust your position sizes fairly easily and inexpensively hmm and that adjusts for volatility some people suggest that you could even do it the other way if volatility got smaller you could actually increase your position size because you you end up with keeping volatility the same again so you're still staying with your buy sell strategy button by adjusting your position size your your you're keeping everything a little more constant in terms of your mentality and the effect on the portfolio mathematically understand interesting thanks for sharing this usually we have you know like percentage of capital but all activities I'm thinking it's a variable it changes over time it does and the more your volatility adjust things the more with changing conditions you can keep things the same understand yeah cuz quite a lot of maybe the people attending this webinar most of them maybe are not into systems so I think that the the main thing to go into a system is to be able to remove the emotion because sometimes when the market is crazy would you agree with that is removing emotion I think it helps for some people and I think it hurts for others so let's go over both for me mmm-hmm I'm an engineer I understand numbers I understand computers I understand the limitations of what those computers can do for me and in a lot of cases I'm the one that programmed them so that I know that I'm responsible for whatever happened anyway and for me that's comfortable now for a discretionary trader mm-hmm he's not going to trust the computer or she's not gonna trust a computer she's they're gonna say that this is crazy stuff you know you're gonna feed data into a computer and outcome the answer that can't possibly work you got a you got a discretionarily decide so various personalities and people will have a different different way of dealing with automation for me process makes it a little bit more simple now let's go to the mental side that you just mentioned mmm you get into a situation like what we've just gone through the virus crash you end with a lot of people you say that process you know having it all automated and all that helps your mental side well it does for me and I was able to make it through this whole thing without changing a single thing okay however a lot of automated I know fully automated traders literally in the middle of the crash just shut down the machines mmm and said this is so insane I don't trust it I don't trust my strategies to deal with this and some of them may taken some hits understand so the system so they overwrite it so so you got to remember that no matter whether you have computers or not it's still the human being and your emotions and your mentality and your discipline because you have the ultimate so you can always pull the plug on the computer and turn it off and so it still comes down to mental as dr. Thorpe once said you know in the end trading is nothing but mental because everything comes from your brain and your emotion and all that and what you do even if you do it computerized is a reflection of who you are and and your discipline and your ability to keep that process going so in the end it's all mental understand so what we what we advise someone to do is it based on the temperament or should they go more systematic or did should they go into more or hybrid kind of model well what I always try to tell people to do is think of it as an inventory of your of yourself start with a piece of paper with the blank and write down all your current knowledge of various markets you know small large whatever it is what's your skill level in various things like computers are you you have never touched a computer you don't even own a computer you operate on off of a phone there's lots of different things there who do you know well all of you know Colin and Tom now because you're on this call and so you have resources out there there's the enjoy the ride dot world there's lots of free stuff there you can just go on with a browser and start reading and reading research papers and listening to interviews I've done over the years I've covered just about every trading topic that anybody could ever cover with me I think I can't imagine something that Colin could ask me that probably has not been asked at least twice before but what ends up happening is one to get this sort of what I would call inventory personality inventory what's your capital level how much time can you spend on trading if you're working a full-time job and you're you only have Saturday morning to be able to spend two hours before you have to go off and play with the kids that's got to be your trading strategy it's got to be a once a week two hours on a Saturday morning type of trading strategy so maybe you look at weekly candles and weekly bars there's again you know each person's individually different and very unique so what ends up happening is once you get that all down then ask yourself so what am I trying to achieve with trading okay given this is what I've got and what you've got is very different than what I've got or Colin or anybody else on this call now that you have that try to read you know trade your way to financial freedom was a great book that I just loved because it covered the buy/sell part of the strategy it talked about position sizing to some extent and it talked about the mental side of trading so it's the one book I like to recommend that seems to cover a wide aspect of all parts of the trading ok once you know what those parts are without having it solve you the problem you got to solve your own puzzle to a certain extent at least you know you need to have some kind of a way of making a decision to buy and sell so I call that the buy sell engine you got to have something that tells you and it could be discretionary it could be whenever I see a stock that has a less than 10 PE in less than 10 price and I can put my risk here I buy it that so that's discretion that's not necessarily you know totally automatable it may be something that you have to look for a chart pattern or whatever the thing is once you have that buy sell engine and you can say how much do I buy okay and that's the next kind of part of the problem okay and then the third part is to have the discipline and the mental and contingency planning so that you and execute that you could you have the mental process in the fortitude and the discipline to actually get that done day after day or week after week if it's once a week it's once a week if it's once a month it's once a month I I have friends that I help out where I say do 20 or 10 different etf's exchange-traded funds so get one that's a gold fund get one that's a stock fund get one that's maybe a tech fund and find 10 different funds every month just go through and rebalance them so they're all equal okay so kind of Robin Hood strategy you take from the rich and give to the poor so whichever one's doing really well take money out of that move it to the one that's done the worst mmm these are long-term strategy very long-term strategy but it will outperform buy and hold those tastes same ten things if you do nothing by the same ten I've proven this time and time again to meet myself take those ten ETFs okay doc don't rebalance them there's a research paper on enjoy the ride dot world that it shows the study if you take and rebalance versus not rebalance how often you if you can do it the more you rebalance the better if there's no cost okay if the cost of rebalancing and commissions or slippage is very great than doing it a little less often would be more appropriate but the the Commission's have gotten so inexpensive these days that you can afford to rebalance in some case ETS are very very I mean if you especially for trading a big portfolio it's just not that expensive so I'd rebalance as often as you can stand doing it and you will actually benefit yourself and you you will actually get a couple percent edge on buy and hold so take care of the crash no it doesn't take care of this recent crash mmm there you have to do something a little bit more active maybe you have to put some stop losses behind each of the ETF so that like in my IRA I have an ETF strategy I'm hundred percent cash a long time ago just watching this mmm it kicked all the stops off and I went from 23 positions to zero inside of about a week and a half for two weeks okay and so as I mentioned one thing about a p/e ratio because in Singapore there is a lot of causes about because both you and me most system system traders you know but in Singapore there's a lot of people talking about value investing you know like sure ah what is the view of those valuing estimator I think they're they have their own edge and if that's your slant on life it's perfectly okay Warren Buffett's made a lot of money just buying inexpensive companies and holding him forever he's had his days in the Sun and days in the doghouse too just like every trader but he's a longer-term guy and he he looks at the companies from the standpoint of the business and there's nothing wrong with that but he has to be able to sit there and say I've got billions tied up in this company and it just went down 30% I'm okay with that I'm gonna buy some more mm-hmm you know most people it's mental yes it comes back to mental because if he's got a you know if you're gonna buy and hold then you got to be willing to say to yourself I think the stock market in the u.s. just went down 32% from top to bottom if I remember the number right yeah I didn't sit there and calculate that I heard it on the news or something and so if you are in and by the way when I came out of college in 74 it had just finished up a 50% down market the tech crash some of the tech bubble in 2000 2001 that was some of those guys were down 80 percent okay so if you're gonna go in and buy and hold I encourage you to realize that you are going to put yourself into probably a 30 to 50 percent down somewhere along your lifetime if you're young enough yeah I'm not okay with that personally maybe you would be maybe Warren Buffett is but you have to take on that kind of mentality and as long as you're okay with it and say oh that's okay I'm young it'll go down I just buy more no big deal all right that's fine but what I see happening most people most people will say I can I can withstand quite a bit of risk I'm just gonna buy and hold and then when it goes down mmm all of a sudden they're not so comfortable or than anymore and to me sound they then they abandon it right when you shouldn't because now it's ready to go the other way now we've just said I just heard this morning on the news as I was getting ready to come in here to the office I I heard that in four days the US had the best stock market returned for a week and we're not even trading today because he's good Friday best return for the week since 1974 okay how many years ago is 1974 that was you know back that's back when I'm getting out of university and I'll you know like 22 years old I'm 67 so you're talking a massive amount of time never has the market had such a good week that's right in the face of what two three weeks ago we're dropping you know 10 20 percent a week it's insane and so you have to be able to say to yourself okay it's down 32% but I knew that that was part of my strategy because that that goes with the the flow there and as long as you're okay with it I'm okay I'm okay with it that's your strategy what about opportunity costs like if the stock is down 40% and then you have to hold for the next one year you you lose that in opportunity costs right exactly but you know guys like Warren Buffett over the long run of work magic with that so yes you're right and that's what bugged me to death so I I wouldn't I would not trade that way myself but I'm not saying it's not a way that a certain individual certain like a very busy let's say you're a young doctor and you're making a lot of money and you you dollar-cost average okay and the money's coming in all the time and so it's down 32% you buy you buy a 1/3 more shares at the lower price and over time that adds ends up at giving you an edge on this thing is about no personality oh you know what well how much time can you do this thing and it really comes down to can you run whatever strategy you come up with because having no strategy is still a strategy if you want if you want to buy and hold and not have a strategy that's still a strategy it may not be a really good one but it's definitely what's gonna happen and so are you going are you putting are you designing what you're doing to match you and your puzzle that you're solving because when you do that then life gets a lot easier and you can enjoy the ride and it's you know the market goes up and down does its thing and you just go along for the ride and and and you understand what you're doing you understand the risks of what you're doing you're not surprised by anything so therefore your emotions don't go up and down a lot you don't get a lot of excitement out of it if that's what you're looking for that's an a completely different puzzle to solve you might as well go to the casino or something and get the excitement gambling but then if you're looking to just be a serious investor and make some money over time mmm you know design your strategy so that you're comfortable with it if 1% of equity and volatility is to fast a movement and it catches your attention and you get emotional when it goes up and down make it a half a percent understand make it smaller so that doesn't catch your emotion that way you can be even keeled make your decisions rationally keep going for the long run how does one speed up this process because yes what I hear is correct you I mean I need to know the strategy according to my personality but sometimes you need to lose money to learn the mistakes so is there any way that we can speed up this whole process I would yes Howie I'm not sure I'm not sure that I didn't speed my own process up by reading the chapter on Larry height for instance and market wizards that helped me understand risk control I later very shortly after developed a volatility control reading some other comments of other traders I would say that enjoy the ride dot world has got a wealth of stuff just look at the recommended reading list and for a few hundred dollars you could get a wealth of information of what other people have talked about in trading and give you some of the principles that might help your cause and I have the recommended reading list in the order that I would recommend them so trade your way to financial freedoms first and my own my own book is you know number four or five it's not number two I don't think and the reason for that is because I think you need a basis over the overall trading process before you get into specific topics like position sizing kind of thing I think that's a way to jump start another way to jump start is to well to come to calls like this one I'm sure everybody on this call already probably has a few ideas that I may or may not affect their own trading just from listening to us talking and I think that you know it may cause some people to question what they're doing and that might be good and it might be reinforcing to other people about what they're doing and that might be good mmm but there's there's a I think trying to find what what suits you is going to be your answer and so you're seeking out the overall structure of the process by going to places like you know my site or other books and video series and things that talk about this and then you have to take what comes through in that and say okay I understand I need a buy sell engine of some sort mmm what is my specific buy sell engine going to be and it might be moving averages over a 200-day period it might be you know the Keltner bands we mentioned a while back it might be dungeon channels it might be doing day trading because that's where you want to you know operate you have to design everything for you if you don't you're you're swimming upstream you're you're really fighting the universe every day of your life and it's no fun so that's the way to get ahead and it jump-started is to understand the process and I think we've talked about it pretty clearly here and then to try to apply try to find the details for yourself within that process and that that will get you as fast as possible to where you want to be this is some rice talk about pre fast by cell ng and a money management engine and then the last one is really the emotional part you know the execution path engine yeah exactly pass off that's the way I look at it okay there there there's some ancillary other things you could do portfolio risk and other things that that are in there but I think if you those three things would probably be what you get need to worry about and I tell you how I would rank them he's very interesting most people this was a good a good example I did a webinar on by soul engine and I did a webinar in position sizing and I haven't done one on mental yet but I'll probably do one in the future yeah in my mind mental is the most important because you can screw up the other two if you don't do the mental right right and the position sizing is far more impactful to how your emotions and mental are going to operate then than is the buy/sell engine is a buy sell engine you know if you take Keltner bands well a good example the hedges that I put on on my stock portfolio side of things during this recent crash all three indicators that I have on my hedge page and enjoy the ride world the I spell out exactly the math behind what I do in detail mm-hmm and every single one of all three of those mmm went over exactly the same day to the Southside so so people obsess over Oh Tom uses Keltner bands maybe I should use Keltner bands instead of dungeon channels or ya know if you run them all against each other he's about they'll all do about the same they'll all get similar signals it's whatever you understand and what you can use easily to solve your own puzzles oh I'm so over it so the buy/sell engine I actually did a study once where I flipped a coin random number generator to buy or sell I positioned sized it based on that risk okay the risk that I put in and I used like an ATR stop on that study and then I trailed the stop dutifully so whenever I flipped it long I bought okay I put the stop behind it and I just kept moving the stop up and move up okay all right and then when I'd stop out I'd flip the coin again okay buy sell whatever every time you have a major run mm-hmm you're always in on it because even if you flip it wrong let's say it's gonna be a big up move yeah and you flipped it because you're out of the position you hit your stop you're non-cash so you want to put it back in the market so you flip it and says go short mmm all right so well the markets going up well you're gonna hit your stop stop out mmm then you're gonna flip it again and one of those flips you're gonna go along you could have you're gonna catch the entire rest of the run and that's where you make all your money and so it turns out with a random number generator across I think I used 20 markets mmm this was a study in futures actually I actually had a slight propensity it wasn't much it wouldn't be a strategy that I'd recommend but it shows how minimally important the buy sell engine is compared to good doing good position sizing doing good risk management on your stops and stuff and being disciplined and following the strategy mmm in my mind the mental is most important position sizing is second most important and the buy/sell engine is the least but most people when I did a webinar series I had a hundred and twenty people sign up for the buy/sell engine I had about thirty five for the position sizing nobody cared and then I haven't done mental but I'm almost afraid to because I've almost nobody will show up and so it's funny how people do exactly the opposite of what what somebody who's done it for 45 years thinks about the topics and so the I would encourage you to study the mental side and to increase your awareness for instance there's lots of books on increasing your awareness and things like you know a lot of Tharp's material that he talks about doctor doctor Tharp over North Carolina the Tharp Institute does a lot of mental side of trading courses and things you know examine yourself because you are the one that holds yourself back a lot and people don't realize you know they don't ever sit back from themselves and observe themselves and say you know it's really me that's screwing this up and it's not it's not the Keltner band it's not my position sizing I'm the one that didn't do the trade like I was supposed to do the trade and now I'm wondering whether I should get into the trade or not because now I'm late and is it too late to get in now I get these questions on direct messaging you know I was supposed to to buy SP wise a week ago is it too late now how do I answer that one I don't have a crystal ball I'm running my stuff I'm doing my stuff I'm already in on it sorry you missed it but you know this is your trading strategy not mine you got it you got to come up with your own you know you got to learn from that and say I'll never do this again hmm and then you got to really mean it and you got to do it yeah and I take my computer along on vacations and my wife knows that for 20 minutes a day on vacation I get my processes started I set my orders and I'm back on vacation but she gives me that 20 it's it's part of the deal of being married to me and and she's okay with it she understands that it's how we live so you got to think through these things and design what you're doing to fit your situation and including what happens when you get sick what happens when you go on vacation what happens when the kids get sick or you have to go pick them up from school because you know they they were not a good boy or girl and you have to discipline him more and it distracts you from your day trading or whatever you know you have to think through what you're going to do and whether or not you can do it and mmm and that that's going to help you be successful mmm yeah so it's really about psychology first and then positions and things again and the buyer is really the last yeah it's it's important to trigger you and to cause you and you want to do something that is easy to do and that you understand like a moving average is simple and a lot of people understand it and if you if you're just doing once a week training that's probably a perfect place to start looking and understanding but you have to you have to come to grips if you're not a mathematician you know maybe Bollinger Bands with standard deviations and all this stuff is a little bit I don't understand what a standard deviation is you know you don't want to get into that well that's fine because do something like a Keltner or if that's too complicated do it do a Dutchman that's pretty easy to to understand or look at some other indicators there's price channel indicators that do this there's lots of different ways to trade and but the buy/sell engine needs this you need to understand it well enough so that you're not afraid of it and because that's just gonna make you uncomfortable and then your metal side screws up come okay I'm on the mentor site exactly reading books on top is there any other things that you do that can help you to be better in your psychology right I think I would say being able to step back and observe your so if for instance keeping a log at the end of the day of trading if you could sit down and if you had made some mistakes or if you followed everything you're supposed to do and lost money even following your strategy you lost money Thursdays I'm down I don't make money every day but for me I understand exactly how I lost that money and it isn't necessarily a mistake on my part it is my strategy matching up to the market and if I can step back from that and say is there anything I learned from today that would cause me to think of an even better way to trade hmm so that this type of a day would I could actually exploit that move in my favour instead of losing money maybe there's a strategy I can come up with that exploits that situation yeah you you then separate yourself from the emotion of sitting there in front of a screen and reacting and reacting as always you're one step behind it the markets throwing stuff at you and you it's pushing your buttons mentally it's trying to find out if you're greedy find out if you're emotional and it's gonna cause you to do the stupid thing mmm if you can then sit back after the markets are closed for the day and just analyze the day imagine that you're somebody critiquing yourself mm-hmm and and what did you learn what did you do well what did you do poorly that's very educational because it starts getting you into more of an awareness of the types of things that you repeatedly do that don't make any sense long term but you keep doing them and you can ask yourself why do I keep doing them and is there something I can put in place to prevent myself from doing them or you know scheduling myself better or you know locking the door so the kids don't come in and bother me or whatever it is you know it's different for every person but you know my mistakes would be different than somebody else's mistakes but I think that's very educational in the mental side because it helps just like a if you're training for the Olympics and you're you're trying to get done with your rehearsal or your practice and say to yourself okay I did you know X seconds on this particular run how do I make it a tenth of a second better what is it that happened let's analyze how I launched myself let's see how I came up to full stride how did I cross the finish line what can I learn from analyzing all that and to do it better and that's sort of the same thing mentally and I don't think a lot of people just get through the day and they made money they're lost money and they go off you know God got the dinner they they don't think twice about what they did that day and I think when I've tried to observe myself I what ends up happening is you start observing yourself live you don't observe yourself once a day like I did you know when I was in my 20s now I I i can actually part of my brain this is weird it's gonna sound weird part of my brain is watching myself move my hands like this mm-hmm and knows that I'm doing it and the other part is concentrating and what I'm going to say next and it's bizarre but there's like two parts of my brain going on at the same time all the time exactly that's a strange way of putting it but that's about what it is in my brain so and yeah and that's a learned skill I did not have that when I was a when I was a child I didn't have that I was very very shy I was I got good grades as a child but you know I was frequently bullied I was just the the little intimidated little kid growing up as a elementary school hmm and as I got more into the workforce and started trading and learning more about myself I have the confidence to go on and speak to hundreds of people and I'm perfectly normal with it and having a good time and I think that's something because of the observation the observer self if you want to call it and there's lots of books written on the observer self so you can go look up google that word and you find out all sorts of different articles and books but to try to actually see yourself doing things while you're trading helps even the discretionary trader because the discretionary trader is very prone to emotional swings I think and to try it if you really look at a lot of good successful discretionary traders they're very good at knowing how to just keep themselves even and not let themselves get high or low and stay detached they can just keep looking at the screen stay detached it's just a bunch of numbers it's a game we're playing mmm it's no different than a slot machine pull it pull the lever it is to them it's just unemotional they're just doing another trade in another trade in another trade and they don't get higher low over it and they don't even count the money until their walk away you know they just their job is to trade and some of them are very good a lot of these people that do discretionary trading that I've met in my life mmm don't even have college education so they just come off the street they're street smart they they find something that works and they just repeat it over and over again and they don't think a lot and very detached that means they doesn't really put any emotion there ready - very detached yeah and then when the fusillade emotions they say instead of saying I'm angry I say I'm feeling the the feeling of angry yeah exactly this menu I do some calm meditation also where I also do the same thing and okay the beauty do you meditate or do you think I have I have meditated in the past but what I found out was when you meditate you're trying to sort of blank your mind mMmmm in my mind you're sort of trying to just keep slow everything down and that's really good for your blood pressure and other things but for being aware mm-hmm I am not sure how much it increases your awareness because for me just doing an exercise for instance like if if you wanted to practice speaking go in front of your bathroom mirror mhm and give a small speech mmm to who to yourself you're sitting there watching you're standing there watching you give the speech mm-hmm and you're seeing your facial expressions and you can tell whether you're smiling or not or if you're frowning or anything else because you're you're watching yourself do it yeah you're feeling your facial muscles you're thinking of what's going on in your brain and you're actually sort of creating an observer self situation in an artificial world yeah but then once you get good at doing that you can start saying well I can kind of guess what my face looks like without looking at the mirror now I can tell I'm smiling because I can feel that I've got you know there's a little tension right here in my cheeks and that means my cheeks are being pulled up and I'm probably smiling alright and so what you end up with is by doing exercises and observing yourself you get better and better and observing yourself just like you would practicing running or playing golf or anything else you know in life is the act of doing that makes you bet that I think rather meditating doesn't give you that feedback loop much but it does some good positive things I'm not against meditating I just think that it to me it calms my mind mm-hmm meditating hmm I don't know that it increases awareness and as much as it's just observing yourself doing things that's that but that's the fact that you observe in yourself right right the fact that you observe yourself makes it easier to observe yourself interesting yeah so he stumbles time maybe just one last part any advice you have for and everyone if you are if those hundred and this other 116 people now 140 people any advice last advice for them to be a perfect abode trade that will probably be the advice I would my advice would be to create a process for yourself that's for that's designed for you mm-hmm okay execute it a hundred percent of the time mmm and enjoy the ride it's very alright because it will be a ride yes I want to thank you so much for doing this I really appreciate your Oh Colin it was it was a blast I enjoyed doing it as well and hi to all my Singapore friends yeah yeah so this one thank you for your time you know that people are thinking thanking you right now yeah really appreciate here so for those that people are still here thank you so much for coming we will end this by Mina so thank you very much again thanks Colin okay thank you talking soon bye ",True,False,False,False

Like any virus, SARS-CoV-2 has been mutating constantly since the beginning of the pandemic. Until November of 2020, though, that didn’t seem to matter. That’s when scientists in the United Kingdom noticed an alarming change: The virus had mutated in a way that made it more transmissible. Within a month, similar reports were emerging from places around the world. Suddenly, it seemed the virus was changing at an alarming rate.

SARS-CoV-2 hasn’t actually been mutating faster, though. Instead, by letting it spread around the world, we’ve just given it more and more opportunities to mutate as it replicates. The result is that, after countless random mutations, there are signs that the virus is beginning to adapt to our natural defenses. And because it’s completely normal for a virus to change over time, we shouldn’t expect it to stop. The only real way to stop those changes is to stop giving the virus so many opportunities.

us ppe as well as a harvard medical school professor and dr raja what's interesting is we're kind of looking at what bloomberg's pointing out as potential waning when it comes to vaccine enthusiasm right now of course close to 40 percent of the u.s adult population has gotten at least one dose but it sounds like according to their data states are now piling up some of the vaccines there and that would seem to be a bit of a concern considering how far we have to go before we hit earth immunity so where are you in terms of grading where we're at right now given the new concerns around variants and johnson johnson well zack i'm i'm really disappointed i saw that report as well and the fact is that even when we look at the state level that doesn't give us enough information it's important to think about getting down to the local level because even within a state especially if there's a large metropolitan area there can be a lot of really diverse vaccine acceptance throughout a state so if you look at some of the southern states in larger cities the vaccine is getting used and people are waiting in line for shots but out of the large metropolitan areas there are a lot of vaccines that aren't being put into patients arms and that's really disappointing because especially in those more rural areas they don't have a lot of health care resources either and so if patients do get sick it's a real strain on health care resources in all of those areas having said that doctor we're looking at some states that have now passed that 50 percent mark in terms of those who've gotten at least one shot now we're talking about potentially a third chap that's going to be necessary down the line i mean does that change anything in terms of the timeline that we've been looking at for trying to get most americans vaccinated by the end of may it's a great question akiko i don't think that it changes anything right now what we know about the vaccine is that it does prompt that the various vaccines do lead to a really strong immune response for the vast majority of patients when we start talking about a third shot we're talking about one that's say six months a year out from the first couple of shots because of the fact that quite honestly as with the seasonal flu vaccine it's perfectly reasonable and logical that with the variance we'll need a booster shot as time goes along but i don't think that changes the timeline of getting vaccines in most americans by may yeah dr roger that was kind of why i was a little confused as to why there were so many headlines around what we heard from the ceo of fizer talking about the need for that booster shot 12 months down the line because even back in january when we were talking to the ceo of moderna about that he told us that it was going to be likely that we would need to see that here's what he told us all the way back in january i just want to play it and get your reaction on the other side take a listen i believe suscob2 is going to stay with humans forever we're going to have to have boost adapted to the virus like we are for flu it's the same thing we are both mrna viruses and we'll have to live with it forever so i mean obviously staying with us forever was was pretty drastic when we heard it back then it sounds like pfizer would agree with that in terms of the booster shot but if you kind of put together the fact that right now it seems like americans are kind of getting i don't want to say not going to get vaccinated here but clearly kind of a de-evolution in terms of excitement around vaccines i think if you look at the stats does that become worrying if even those people who were excited to get it as soon as it was available to them now has to get a booster and you worry about maybe them even them also uh kind of skipping a booster shot what does that mean for our recovery and reopening it is disappointing zach i for years doctors have been talking to their patients about the importance of getting a flu shot and this is going to turn into the same sort of discussion i tell my patients every year as we start approaching flu season that they should get a flu shot and i've got to tell you that there is varying acceptance of that and given the pandemic it makes sense that everybody was excited to do what they could to get to a point where we can loosen restrictions and have herd immunity but eventually that that that crisis is going to pass and this is going to need to become part of our annual treatment of and preventative medicine treatment of patients and that's where i worry because once it becomes something that has to be done every six months or every year we're going to lose patients willingness to do it well dr raj i want to ask you a little bit about that because i know that uh when we were kind of discussing this before getting on the show about the idea that it's a forever virus there's a chuckle there so i want to know do you think that the the part about it being forever is drastic is it just that we'll have to do sort of uh concurrent vaccinations until the rate globally gets low enough or are we truly looking at sort of like a seasonal flu type situation anjali i think it's a little bit hard to tell right now i think that calling it a forever virus is a little extreme right now just because we don't know and once you say forever to a population that is that is so bent on trying to get this thing under control it really it can become demoralizing and i think what we need to focus on right now is the fact that yes we'll need to need will need boosters for six months a year a couple of years down the line but we will understand more about this completely novel virus in that year or two and i'm personally still hoping that we can get it to a point where it goes away well let's talk about um in the meantime all the other vaccines that we're looking at coming out there we know there's been sort of that stumbling form astrazeneca as well as johnson and johnson other vaccine players have just completely fallen out so a lot of pressure and a lot of focus on these mrna vaccines do you anticipate anything out of that cdc uh panel meeting next week in terms of maybe an age restriction and if so what what might that how might that impact our vaccination progress anjali i do i hope for two main things coming out of the panel uh that's meeting now as as you mentioned in a week the first is that i hope that they restart and then they allow for and recommend restarting giving the johnson johnson vaccine as we've been talking about all week the risk of these blood clots is exceptionally low the j j vaccine is very effective and we should be using it the second thing is i hope they get information about who the risk of blood clots is greatest for right now it looks as though my 60 year old male patients really shouldn't be hesitant about getting the johnson johnson vaccine if what they're thinking about is blood clots but there's probably a population of patients who should be a little hesitant and there needs to be recommendations made around that so those are the two things but i really hope that we restart the jnj vaccine as soon as we can certainly a lot of people waiting for it and potentially having to reschedule those appointments dr ali raja great to talk to you today co-founder of get spp

Although children may be unable to fully grasp the concept of their mental health and wellbeing, restrictions posed by public health protocols have taken away aspects of their life, just like any other member of the community. We urge you to keep watching this video for some insight on home safety, transition to online learning, nutrition and exercise, the impact on special needs children, video games, and many more environmental factors that impair a child’s mental health and physical perception of the world around them. We also provide an outline of a prominent resource developed by SickKids called CARD. This system allows parents and caregivers to make a personalized system for children to make their routine during the pandemic a little less difficult.

about the fear and uncertainty about their own health the health of their loved ones their financial situation and job outcomes as well as tackling social isolation through following public health protocols mental health is inclusive to all age groups and should leave no one behind in terms of spreading awareness with this being said have you ever considered the effect that covid19 has had on children we could say that children are unable to fully grasp the concept of their mental health and well-being but the pandemic has taken away aspects of their life just like any other member of the community we urge you to keep watching this video for some insight on the mental health of the children within our communities and how you as a parent guardian or any type of caretaker can help to ease their experience although there are many factors to address children are particularly vulnerable due to their limited understanding of the current pandemic because of this many of them are also unable to physically and mentally escape the harms of the situation as they have little to no coping strategies and it is hard for them to communicate their feelings easily unlike adults although their understanding is minimal children can pick up on unverified information through social media or word of mouth as adults communicate which can aggravate mental distress and feelings of uncertainty as misinterpretation is bound to happen children are also in a continuous and critical period of development as they require special care in order to preserve and promote their mental health which has been primarily affected by a drastic change in routine the suppression of all class activities and learning as well as a shift to an online schooling has led to the creation of an isolated learning environment essentially schools are responsible for providing structure to a child's daily activities many articles have postulated the importance of physical activity during the quarantine as it is associated with a decline in symptoms of anxiety and depression research has also argued that schools play a primary role in providing a consistent daily calorie intake to ensure that children are getting their nutritional needs yet amidst the pandemic these essential needs have been significantly decreased a nationwide study in canada conducted by the international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity found that children and youth were actually less active played outside less where more sedentary engaged in more recreational screen time and slept more in comparison to before the covid19 restrictions but special needs are extremely vulnerable to the psychological impacts that come along for example shifting to an online learning environment has disrupted their daily routines and therapy sessions children with autism or neurocognitive disabilities are more likely to show problematic behaviors such as irritability aggression and social withdrawal online learning has also led to a decrease in assistance to these children as parents cannot replace special education teachers there is also a lack of technology to assist with this transition in addition to that social distancing and its effects are extremely new and difficult to understand especially for children that are experiencing developmental and intellectual delays for these reasons spreading awareness of the mental health of children with disabilities needs to be done on a global scale it is also no surprise that the pandemic causes parents and caregivers to become fearful of their own concerns research shows that fear can be contagious as children are sensitive to the emotional state of the adults that surround them to make matters worse parents are also unable to alleviate the stress through familiar mechanisms that were established prior to the pandemic such as visiting family and friends or going on excursions such as watching movies or dining out the process of isolation also imposes more constant contact between parents and children with this being said not all homes are safe places for children to learn or play due to exposure to various types of abuse during quarantine abuse complaints can actually decrease in frequency as there are limited ways for children to flee from perpetrators as schools usually act as an avenue for children to report issues regardless the frequency of children experiencing abuse at home may increase due to continuous contact with perpetrators in quarantine additionally browsing on online social media platforms and lack of supervision over the internet access has also increased vulnerability to online offenders attempted fraud and sexually inappropriate content due to these circumstances issues such as deteriorating performance aggression and regression may escalate these are all examples of environmental impacts that impair a child's mental health and physical perception of the world around them despite any of the negative impacts the internet has been a critical tool for children and youth in learning entertainment and even social interactions since the start of the covet 19 pandemic in particular research has shown that video games offer a temporary escape from real life but they also provide a fair amount of social engagement one of the greatest digital game distributors known as steam reports that since the pandemic started the number of users has increased significantly this report indicates that weekly users has increased from 19 million to 23.5 million although it is generally believed that video games have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of children recent high quality research by the journal of clinical psychological science shows the effects of video games on mental health and well-being is very small video games can help children and youth to fill in the empty gaps by interacting with their friends through online gaming additionally during the pandemic many children do not have enough physical activity so it is recommended to mix physical activities with video games there are active video games that kids can use which can be very helpful while the outdoor movements are restricted for example christopher alexander a professor of video games at ryerson university in toronto says video games can be positive activity during the time of self-distancing if we can take the time to discover the types of games that are best for you so what can you do to help your child during this pandemic there are several avenues of support that can be offered for children to ensure that their mental health is being addressed in this video we will cover the card system provided by the hospital for sick kids for parents and caregivers this system provides strategies that parents can play to help their children cope with stressful situations card is an acronym that stands for comfort ask relax and distract the comfort aspect involves talking to your child about what they can do to cope with their anxiety try to empower your child to overcome their negative thoughts by saying things like you are stronger than you feel also be sure to validate your child's concern by saying things like it's okay to be upset some other things that can be done specifically during the pandemic include limiting exposure to the media and news being mindful of the conversations that you have around family members and creating daily routines that give your child predictability and control next by asking questions your child is given an opportunity to open up some questions you can ask your child include what questions do you have or how are you feeling or what are your friends saying about this and lastly what fun things can you do today thirdly by relax this means to do things that you and your child enjoy to help them feel more secure and connected this can be done by listening to a mindfulness or relaxation activity together practicing positive self-talk or engaging in an enjoyable physical activity lastly a great thing to do is distract try to talk about things that are important to your child such as sports or dancing or art some great activities include reading books watching movies playing board games working on puzzles or even helping your child with their homework using card you can make a personalized system for your child to make their routines during the pandemic a little less difficult and hopefully this benefits your mental health in return because mental health as we said earlier is inclusive to all take care of yourself and don't forget to subscribe and share this video with anyone else that may need some advice during this time of need ,True,False,True,False

About the show:
Singapore’s harmonious race relations has often been cited as one of its most remarkable achievements. But where do we really stand on race relations? Janil Puthucheary, chairperson of Onepeople.sg, the body that promotes racial harmony in Singapore, goes on a journey to find out what Singaporeans think. From conducting one of the largest nation-wide surveys, to having difficult conversations, the film sets out to pose the profound question on how we should confront our inherent biases.",what is privilege to you I think privilege is having it easier then others you are given something more of a priority sometimes it's probably maybe even undeserved like you didn't really work for it but you get special treatment I never think about privilege growing up like call all these years in Singapore and that in itself was privilege for me I'm gonna do an experiment with ten participants I'm going to ask them a series of questions and they're gonna step forward or backwards depending on how they identify with the statements if you agree with this you step forward if you disagree you step back in the last one week I have seen an advertisement with a model of the same race as me my boss is the same race as me agree step forward I have never been the only person of my race in the room in the last month you try to get food and the person spoke to you in a language you didn't understand if this has happened to you step back in the last one month your friends in conversation have used the words you people to you meaning your whole race take a step back this has happened to you take a step back if this has happened to you you've done something well and you've been congratulated because you're a credit to your race your race has been brought up in a job interview someone's made fun of you at school because the color of your skin at school or at work you have to or less food stalls where you can get food you like you've ever been asked to stop loitering at the point deck you've watched a racial stereotype on TV and you thought it was offensive step back you've heard your friends make a joke about race make a joke about a racial stereotype but you're too afraid to say anything I didn't want to cause offence you felt this was a problem but you didn't say anything if that has happened to you step back never happen to you step forward so when I first started this experiment I thought oh I would end up somewhere in the middle I didn't expect to learn right at the back I thought I'd be somewhere in between I ended up being the last one and it feels weird because I would think that someone who is of more minority than I am like the Indian lady will be behind me when the experiment and I turn around and there were people who were kind of close to me and then people who were like really far back as well and I just felt like whoa just so much difference in our experiences in Singapore even though in my head I knew that this would happen it still felt like well like I wouldn't have wanted people to have felt all these negative experiences I never actually had an encounter with my close friends where I felt that they were being racist towards me I always felt that they were being racist with other people but not to me it didn't hit me then but when I start again it just hit me that time yeah I do feel lousy to see that hour after so many years of research Amelie somehow I feel that inside us people do feel that they've been discriminated step back if you agree with this at school or at work you have two or less foods last month you tried to get food and the person spoke to you in a language you didn't understand for me mostly if you talked about privilege I think its language and I do have friends and colleagues who come from the dominant race and and maybe consciously or unconsciously they speak you know didya their language for a prolonged period of time I was happy in the fact that my son was not far ahead of me or because he used to discuss with me and then he used to debate with me that he said I don't think so I will not have that sort of issues but when I looked at him he was not very far away from me so I guess that is reality and that sort of opened up his vision about it I didn't expect to be as close to my mother at the back because I felt much more privileged as opposed to my mother when turned when it came to the problems that she shared with me about getting a job her age her race when he asked all these questions I realized it how come I experienced all these things before hug I never really thought about it I think I dismissed it a lot and I think I always thought that to be to be progressive in this society you not you need to not let these things affect you I think I grew up with that mentality and then I think that's why I did a blind eye towards a lot of these things you've watched the racial stereotype on TV you thought it was offensive you've heard your friends make a joke about race but you are too afraid to say anything I don't see that I'm enjoying a special privilege in Singapore I feel that is pretty equal to be honest I feel that in Singapore currently oh I think that racial harmony is a okay thing because it's not like people discriminate each other there are certain things that the majority race would not identify with because they're not exactly mitt aware of the fact is not they purposely want to go out there on a marginalized a Emily I want to modernize an Indian just said it's their way of life and they're just not open to seeing how other people's way of life is I don't have special privilege but in the milder Moratti they feel the I think they felt that we have a lot of privileges and they for us we don't even so I think the important things that as a majority you have to be a bit sensitive but other we see our or even in the job opportunity other I've never been able to discuss race issues with anyone not at all not at all or throughout my years no unless you are very close friends you can discuss about it but someone was a stranger you you sort of like accepted and deal with it you know race this kind of issue is more sensitive and we don't really um talk about you know sensitive issue nowadays now I think it's important that we are able to talk about it then just you know let it brush off because if you just keep sweeping things under the rack then we wouldn't even see it as a problem and then it will just one day exploit something bigger so this conversation is really good it's a good starting point I think I realize that okay I've neglect this as a important issue like it's it's real you know it's it's not just something that I read online because I'm always on social media it's not something that I read online and people like get upset about it but it's it's really real

Like fear, anxiety or stress. A little stress can be helpful. It can be the motivator that keeps us self-isolating or washing our hands. But constant or high levels of stress can negatively affect our mental and physical health. Taking care of our minds is always important, but doing so in the middle of a pandemic can be really tricky. Here are some tips and techniques to help us all get through this. Start your day well It can be tempting to reach for your phone or switch on the news first thing in the morning but starting the day with a simple mindfulness exercise, such as ‘Notice 3 things’, can help you check in with how you’re feeling and connect with your environment. Mindfulness is well known to make people feel calmer and cope better with stress. This quick exercise takes less than a minute. Before you get out of bed: pause and concentrate on 3 things you can see. For example, your patterned curtains, the blue sky or even just a lightbulb. Then listen for 3 things you can hear. The sound of cars passing by, a singing bird or the hum of your boiler. And finally, notice 3 things you can feel in contact with your body. Your PJs, bedsheets or even your cat. Get planning Although it’s tempting to stay curled up in bed - adapting and creating positive new routines can be helpful and keep you motivated. For example, in the place of what was your morning commute or a school-run: listen to a podcast or go for a walk Incorporating some form of exercise outdoors if possible, into every day is good for mental and physical wellbeing. And set aside time to speak to friends, family or work colleagues every day. Connecting with others releases feel-good hormones that help to relieve stress. Stay informed, not overloaded Although we are able to cope with some stress here and there, being constantly exposed to a rolling fear-inducing news-feed can impact your mental health Hearing upsetting or anxiety-provoking news triggers a stress-response in our bodies. Keeping informed is important, but managing your social media and information intake will make a big difference to how you feel. Try to limit the time you spend listening to, watching or reading things about the outbreak Turn to one or two reliable sources for news and check them just once or twice a day to stay informed. If feelings of anxiety spring up in your day, try a breathing technique, such as box breathing. Concentrating on and controlling your breathing is a scientifically-backed way of making you feel calm. Box breathing is quick, easy and can be done anywhere. Breathe in deeply, through your nose, for a count of 4 Hold your breath for 4 Breathe out completely, through your mouth, for a count of 4 And hold your empty breath for 4 Then repeat 4 times Getting ready for bed Good quality sleep makes a big difference to how you feel. But feeling worried or anxious can make getting to sleep difficult. You could set a coronavirus news curfew, so you don’t watch or read anything to do with the outbreak after 7pm and aim for a regular bedtime. You might also find it helpful to: avoid caffeine before bed, Not eat or drink too much late in the evening Have a warm bath and keep screens out of your bedroom. If getting to sleep is proving tricky, you can try ‘the body scan’. This simple exercise helps you to relax both your mind and body, and with practice - you might find that it even sends you off to sleep. Whilst you’re lying in bed or resting, take your attention to your feet. Relax and soften them into the bed as much as possible. Then scan up your body, moving to your ankles. Release any tension and soften them into the bed. Once they feel relaxed, move up further to your calves, then knees, thighs and so on. Keep moving slowly up your body, all the way to your  head, softening and relaxing every muscle along the way. We hope these simple daily steps will help. Take care. ",True,False,True,False

was no news but COVID news. There was this time when every word of every
story of every front-page of every paper either directly or indirectly dealt with the Coronavirus,
but, now, many months on, that is no longer the case. The world has awoken in a way that there is
more of relevance. However, in certain circles, in those most
dramatically impacted, COVID is still everything. That is certainly the case in aviation. Almost nothing they do nowadays is not dictated
by the ever-present backdrop of the century’s first pandemic. Most of what anyone has been talking about
recently, including us, has been on how this will fundamentally change the industry—on
how the airline of 2029 will look markedly different than that of 2019. Today, though, in October, 2020, we’re nearing
the one-year mark since when SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have made the jump from animal
to human. With this amount of time behind us, the airline
industry has already changed. The airline of October, 2020 is already different
than the airline of October, 2019. So, to see what’s happened already, we’re
going to look at eight flights that, for reasons either big or small, would have been considered
strange, unique, or even unimaginable just a year ago today, but now, are nothing out
of the ordinary. We’ll start with the end for one aircraft—at
least for a while. On September 25th, Qantas’ VH-OQI, an a380,
flew from Dresden, Germany to Victorville, California—a route that is quite clearly
unordinary for an airline based in Australia, but its not the route that made this notable. VH-OQI had been flown to Dresden in March
for cabin refurbishment. By September, though, it became clear that
not only was the refurbishment unnecessary, but that the aircraft was too. airborne until, at least, 2023. This demonstrates that this is the soonest
Qantas believes passenger demand could return to 2019 levels—when the a380 served as its
flagship aircraft. However, the fact, specifically, that the
airline would bother storing the aircraft, rather than scrapping or selling it, also
marks a hint of optimism. Long-term aircraft storage is not cheap—it
involves quite regular maintenance and monitoring—and so this means that Qantas does truly believe
that demand will return to the levels of before—an opinion not held by all. Qantas desperately needs every dollar they
can get right now, so they would only spend money on keeping their a380s if they truly
believed that there was a significant need for super-large aircraft in the medium-term
future. Therefore, while its plenty easy to find negative
signs for the future of aviation, this flight does represent a belief that the good times
will return for airlines. This next flight, meanwhile, didn’t, and,
in some ways, couldn’t exist a year ago. On October 8th, Southwest flight 1920 flew
from Phoenix, Arizona to San Jose del Cabo, Mexico. This certainly looks like a fairly normal
flight—just another big city to resort town route—but the backstory behind it explains
its peculiarity. Mexico is one of the few major countries that
has not restricted entry to Americans, so, when the US emerged from lockdown in May and
June, Cabo was one of the first international destinations added back to Southwest’s network. This is, without a doubt, due to the fact
that it’s both open to Americans and, crucially, a leisure destination. Airline demand is traditionally split into
leisure and business, and these two segments have had very different stories of recovery. Leisure demand picked up quickly and sharply
as soon as stay-at-home orders lifted, while business demand has barely increased at all. This is no surprise considering that, overwhelmingly,
offices are still closed, conferences are still cancelled, and clients are still cautious. Therefore, airlines have had to respond by
removing capacity from where people travel for work, and adding it to where people travel
for vacation, such as Cabo. Right now, there’s a huge amount of capacity
being dumped into the Florida and Mexico markets. For example, in the coming winter, there are
twenty-four flights a week scheduled between New York and Cabo, versus just two a week
last winter. Some leisure destinations have not only recovered
faster, but have come out ahead versus how they were before. This is certainly the case with Cabo, and
the October 8th flight from Phoenix represented the first of many, with Southwest adding this
city-pair to their network. Overall, leisure is winning, business is losing,
and therefore airlines that have historically been more leisure oriented, like Southwest,
have fared far better than their more business-oriented competitors. One of those more business-oriented competitors
is United, which announced this new route from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Fort Myers, Florida. Much like Southwest's flight, this probably
doesn’t seem that strange but, for United, it’s a dramatic deviation from the mean. You see, like most legacy carriers, United
has traditionally been a strict follower of the hub-and-spoke school of network planning. Every single flight they fly, with very limited
exception, either originates or terminates in DC, Newark, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, or Guam—their hub airports. This flight, though, along with a whole package
of others announced at the same time, does not. United wouldn’t break from precedent without
a good reason, and so this must mean something. Most likely, it indicates a mix of desperation
and innovation—desperation because they’re now seriously competing on leisure-routes,
something they avoided before; and innovation because United is reinventing its network
design and getting a little more creative. Creativity and innovation is what pushes an
industry forward and so, even if it comes in the form of a route that is just ever so
slightly different, it demonstrates a characteristic that would be welcome once the downturn is
over. Airlines are now willing to find revenue wherever
it might be, whereas in the past they might have only chosen to pursue the most profitable
form of revenue, so this flight, UA2861, from Guam to Singapore on a 787, is another that
could never have existed a year ago. Now, Guam is a United hub, but it’s never
had flights to Singapore, definitively never had these on a 787, and absolutely never operated
them without passengers and yet now, four times a week, they are. With the current lack in long-haul flights,
which traditionally carry freight in their belly-holds, global cargo capacity is down,
meaning prices are up, meaning airlines can reliably turn a slight profit flying passenger
airplanes without passengers. In a matter of months, United has turned its
Guam hub essentially into a mini cargo hub, with regular flights stopping over from the
US, going on to Asian destinations. Beyond this, globally, United now operates
hundreds of cargo-only flights per week, even though one year ago, it didn’t operate a
single one. Whether it’ll turn Guam into a major passenger
hub for the US to Asia market is an unanswerable question right now, but at the very least,
this further demonstrates how airlines will truly take any revenue they can get, even
if it involves turning into a cargo airline in a matter of months. Revenue is, of course, half of the equation
for profitability, but the other part is, of course, costs. Therefore, for weathering this crisis, airlines
need to get as much revenue as possible, while also minimizing cost. This American Airlines flight from Eagle County
Airport to Aspen was not about bringing in revenue, but rather about reducing costs. You see, only 29 miles or 46 kilometers separate
these two airports, meaning nobody’s really looking to fly between them. However, this flight was part of an overall
flight that went from Dallas, to Eagle County, to Aspen, to Montrose, and back to Dallas,
meaning a passenger going to Montrose would have to sit through at least two stops. Now, a passenger is much more likely to take
a one-stop itinerary than a two, so in a time when American Airlines is fighting for every
customer it can get, why would it fly such a clearly uncompetitive itinerary? Well, the reason is that American didn’t
really care how many people took this flight because it was always going to be very close
to none. They couldn’t, however, just cancel it because
airlines in the US received a package of financial aid from the government in exchange for, among
other things, agreeing to continue serving every airport they did previously. American had previously served these three
airports which primary act as entry points for tourist towns—each of which implemented
restrictions preventing visitors during their stay-at-home periods. This meant demand for travelling to these
places was essentially zero—in the case of Aspen in May, for example, just 7% of American’s
seats were filled. Therefore, instead of operating three different
empty flights, they rather operated just one that stopped at each of the three airports,
thereby creating that 29-mile flight which was, at the time, the shortest commercial
flight in America. Until the CARES act’s expired on October
1st, American and other airlines found ways to both stay loyal to their new masters in
the government, while also minimizing cost to the lowest level. But back on the revenue side, on September
25th, Qantas operated QF1570 from Canberra to Gold Coast Airport in Australia. Exactly one week earlier, on September 18th,
Queensland, the state that the Gold Coast is in, announced it was opening its borders
to the Australian Capital Territory, the territory that Canberra is in. That very same day, Qantas announced that
it would start a new route between these two airports one week later. Now, normally, when airlines announce new
routes, they do so months or even years in advance. For example, when Qantas announced a new route
from Brisbane to Chicago, originally slated to start in April, 2020 but now pushed back,
they did so in July, 2019—a full eight months in advance. To shorten this to one week is unprecedented,
but with borders opening and closing at a moment’s notice, predicting demand has become
incredibly tough. So, in this case, Qantas saw that demand for
travel to Queensland was going to surge, and they were able to respond lightning-fast—allowing
for them to capture it. Other airlines around the world have done
the same, and the industry, in general, has become more agile and data-driven. These will be useful skills for airlines to
maintain long into the future as, when there is demand, a company’s excuse should never
be that they couldn’t act fast enough to capture it. Sometimes, though, it’s strategic to ignore
demand. On October 6th, American Airlines flew its
last flight from Greenville, North Carolina, for at least a month, but likely longer. An airline pulling service from a small, regional
airport in a time of economic crisis is nothing unexpected, but this case stands out. The cut was originally announced as only for
a month, from October 7th to November 4th—a date recognizable for its proximity to the
November 3rd US election. There’s no reason for an airline to believe
that the economic conditions that make a route unprofitable on October 7th would be resolved
by November 4th—if anything, they should get worse as winter nears—so suspending
a route for only one month to save money doesn’t make sense. In addition, this service suspension was announced
along with fourteen others impacting fourteen small airports in fourteen different states—including
Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, and other swing states in the 2020 election. Also, many of the states that American Airlines
cut service to have incumbent senators who polling data indicate might lose on November
3rd. This includes Thom Tillis who, as happens
when small airports lose their only commercial service, immediately faced pressure from his
constituents to bring flights back to Greenville. American Airlines is essentially playing chicken
with the US government. With CARES act funding having now expired,
airlines desperately want more financial aid from Congress, and with fifteen routes to
fifteen states cut, there are now 30 senators that have to answer for why they haven’t
passed an airline relief bill to help save these small towns’ service. In the end, three of these suspensions didn’t
go through, but most others were extended another month—thereby ratcheting up the
pressure on Congress by signaling that these temporary suspensions might not be so temporary
if they don’t get the relief they say they need. While in the US and elsewhere, airlines’
continued survival is increasingly linked to politics, in other places, it’s always
been. China’s aviation recovery has played a key
part in the country’s narrative of overall recovery which is, at least compared to other
places, genuine. On August 28th, Chengdu Airlines flight 2712
was the first to leave from the airport that, eight months earlier, undoubtably played a
central role in spreading the virus across the globe—Wuhan Tianhe International. This flight, though, was the first of hundreds
to leave Wuhan that day and that day, in fact, was the first when the number of flights in
the country reached 100% relative to January 1st of the same year. China’s aviation recovery was fast, in part
because China’s virus recovery was fast. The country’s airlines are not completely
back to normal yet—their load factors and fares are lower than before and their international
market is still nearly nonexistent—but China’s airlines, along with those of New Zealand,
Australia, and all the other countries that have successfully curbed the virus, demonstrate
that the economic crisis cannot end until the public health crisis does and therefore,
no matter which one cares about more, the route to recovery always starts with health. The YouTube algorithm, as any creator knows,

for us in the educational niche, our audience likes different things than the average YouTube

that doesn’t line up with the stuff that the YouTube algorithm will favor. For example, I wanted to make this video longer,

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",today is a door stop sit down door stop uh so it's a shorter session just want to report a few things um so for me i want to report on the vaccination progress so as of 6 july which is today total doses administered is 5.9 million under our national vaccination program but these days we report this number every day more than 3.7 million people have received first dose of covet 19 vaccine 3.7 million is a little bit of a magic number almost 65 point something percent so i would say by end of today two-thirds of our population would have their first dose would have their first doses so as you remember during pms the prime minister's broadcast 31st may i believe he set the target that two-thirds of our population should have their first dose in early july so end of today will achieve that target and what it means is that once two-thirds have their first dose a few weeks later two-thirds will have their second dose so we are on track to achieve two-thirds of our population fully vaccinated and i think we can go further i will explain later um as of now 2.1 million or 39 percent of our population have received two doses and on average we are now vaccinating uh 76 000 individuals per day our target our or rather our total capacity is 80 000 or so so actually we have capacity to vaccinate more so we do need more people to come forward and get vaccinated let me give a breakdown by age groups and this age group i'm going to give you percentages of those who have received at least one dose or book an appointment so so long as they are turned so long as they turn up for their appointment they will also get vaccinated first those followed by second those so these numbers that i'm giving you are potentially the proportion of our population that can be vaccinated yeah so seniors above 70 years old is now 71 i think the last time i sat here the update was 69 so this group is really quite asymptotical quite saturated but we managed to push up by two percentage points yeah 60 to 69 years old 85 percent 50 to 59 years old 86 40 to 49 years old 86 percent 30 to 39 years old 78 20 to 29 years old 80 percent and 12 to 19 years old 80 percent so i'm focusing on these numbers because i think eventually they're all converted to first dose and second doses and potentially if you look at if you look at the numbers they're all hovering about 80 except for the seniors above 70 years old which means i think we can realistically expect our population eventually to reach this level of uh vaccination about 80 or so if all these numbers come true but what we really need to do is to get more of our seniors vaccinated you compare across the ages those above 70 has the lowest first dose and booking rates it really should be the other way around we really ought to have them have the highest percentage we all know they are most vulnerable and what we have observed in countries with high vaccination rate and have opened up such as the uk israel us for example you do see infections infections gone up infections gone up mostly amongst young people because they are up and about and less vaccinated but hospitalization and severe illnesses quite stable but mostly amongst the old still yeah so i think for countries that have opened up it does show that those who fall severely ill are still the elder uh the elderly and the seniors um and the reason is because when high vaccination rules are relaxed society open up people move around and then the o are more likely to be infected as a result and in so it's not a matter of the elderly saying that no i don't go out and therefore no i'm safe it's it's not that at all because these days when we look at our infections and our cases most many of our infections are actually have actually occurred at home so it's not really a matter of not going out yeah when society open up your family members go out and can bring the virus back home so the seniors must get vaccinated we will be making a bigger push to reach out to our seniors knocking on their doors if necessary and this is the work that we need to do so any one of us we know of an elderly neighbor or relative who is still hesitating please help reach out to them and persuade them show them our videos in various languages um just a short update on vaccine efficacy from data from singapore i've been updating this but data has been further refreshed in particular ncid and moh they have recently concluded a study of about a thousand households contacts or covet cases between september 2020 and end of may 2021 and using their data they found that effectiveness of vaccination against the delta variant regardless of symptoms is about 69 so this is effectiveness of protection against infection 69 so this is quite consistent with other international observations uh recently there's a reported figure from israel that pfizer vaccine efficacy against infection is 64 so hours registered at 69 so it's roughly that and this data will be submitted for international publication with singapore's contribution to the understanding of the delta variant and the vaccines as for protection against severe illnesses our data showed that protection against symptomatic disease is between 80 and 90 percent effectiveness of vaccination against severe covate disease requiring oxygen supplementation icu care or death is at 93 percent so amongst the local cases reported since 11 of april only one percent of those vaccinated require oxygen and none were admitted to icu compared to the unvaccinated cases who developed severe illnesses the percentage is 10 yeah so it's one percent versus 10 now um this is an important point next with two thirds of our population now having done the first dose i think in the coming days or one or two weeks we will pretty much saturate our coverage of first doses and which means our objective of covering uh or giving as much as many of our people as possible good protection that objective would have been achieved so we will now have to urge individuals to rebook your second dose appointments earlier because your second dose appointment might be in august rebook them earlier so that the interval between first and second doses is four weeks instead of six to eight weeks we are not constrained by supplies anymore and in fact we have capacity to deliver more dosages so remember the earlier you can get your two doses the better the protection against severe illnesses a uk study recently showed a recent uk study show that against the delta variant vaccine protection from symptomatic disease is 35 percent if it's one dose 79 percent if it's two doses so get your two doses you'll get better protection earlier we have been sending out sms's to those with later appointments to ask them to move forward 131 000 have moved forward their appointments there's another 200 000 or so outstanding we hope they will rebook soon so help us reach out to them and ask them to rebook their appointments get themselves protected early all eligible individuals in singapore are now already offered vaccination everyone has been offered so long as you are eligible so at current rate of vaccination we expect 50 of our population to have received two doses of vaccines around the week of 26 july that means around the starting of the fourth week of july we would have achieved 50 of our population having received two doses by then that that is an important milestone and i think we can open up even further and with good vaccine coverage from a public health point of view we can also allow the vaccinated individuals to participate in more community and economic activities once we reach that 50 mark because they are less likely to be infected and therefore less likely also to cause disease transmission so and it is also better if you are not vaccinated unvaccinated not to be part of such larger gatherings in order to better protect yourselves so we are planning for vaccinated individuals when we reach the 50 milestone to be able to dine in bigger groups and to take part in bigger events if they are all vaccinated and that includes participating in events settings such as religious services so minister lawrence wong will speak about this in greater detail in a short while and also when we reach 50 percent milestone 50 two doses milestone it will also be timely for us to have a more definitive roadmap as of now i think we are our coverage is still close to 40 percent two doses so i think we are still cautious but once we reach 50 percent it will be timely for us to have a more definitive roadmap to transit towards endemic colvin the transition you know our style will never be a big bang our approach is always doing steps doing phases in a safe in a cautious way yeah and it will not just be about s and m measures not about safe management measures as we the co-chairs have explained in the article that was published last week it must cover other aspects such as our health protocols how we report cases what are the travel arrangements overseas travel arrangements so the mtf is working on this and details will be announced when ready okay i will now pass the flaw over to minister lawrence wong thank you good afternoon let me start by thanking everyone once again for your cooperation during the period of heightened alert through our combined efforts we have been able to bring the infection under control and importantly we have made very good progress in our vaccination program as you heard just now so we can now proceed with the next stage of our reopening in particular with effect from 12th of july groups of up to five persons will be able to dine in at fmb establishments wedding receptions will also resume on the basis that if you have a group size of up to 250 persons then you will need pre-event testing if it's up to 50 persons then the pre-event testing will only need to apply for the wedding party likewise indoor high intensity activities like in the gyms and fitness centers without mask on the group sizes of five persons will now apply and you can have an overall class of up to 50 persons or the capacity limit of the venue whichever is lower at workplaces work from home remains the default but social gatherings at workplaces will be allowed subject to the group size of five persons in line with the broader prevailing community rules effectively we are going up to five persons across the board and that will apply on 12th of july we had earlier also rolled out a new regime of testing for staff working in higher risk settings like fmb personal care services gyms and fitness centers we call this the fast and easy test using antigen rapid test kits over the past few weeks we have on-boarded companies businesses onto this new regime and we have put many of the systems and processes in place so with effect from 15th of july this new regime of fast and easy testing will be made mandatory for all the staff who are working in these higher risk settings particularly dining in fmb personal care services gyms and fitness studios beyond 12th of july as minister ong said just now as our vaccination coverage continues to increase we will look at differentiated measures differentiated safe management measures for vaccinated persons and as explained there is a good public health basis for this because if you have been vaccinated you get good protection against the infection and again severe illness and therefore you you know you don't need to have such strict measures applied to a vaccinated person or to groups of vaccinated persons but if you are not vaccinated then obviously you will not benefit from the protection of the vaccine and you will therefore require a set of tighter safe management measures to keep yourself safe so what are we looking at basically if the overall situation remains stable and when we reach 50 percent of the population in singapore being fully vaccinated which we should get there by around end july we will consider the following measures one for activities and venues like cinemas religious services mice events live performances spectator sports and wedding solemnizations we could have a doubling in this group size if they are attended by fully vaccinated persons so if a religious service attended entirely by fully vaccinated persons instead of a 250 person limit we could double it to 500 persons for higher risk indoor mask off activities like fmb dining we could differentiate the guidelines so that a group size of up to eight persons can be allowed for fully vaccinated persons otherwise the group size will remain at five persons work from home will continue but we can allow more to return to the workplace based on the percentage of the total employees who are fully vaccinated so these are three aspects where we will consider having differentiated safe management guidelines for vaccinated persons come the end of july when we reach half of our population being fully vaccinated obviously there are still details to be worked out for example there are still unvaccinated persons and they are also people who are not eligible for the mrna vaccines including children so we will have to work out what guidelines might apply for these groups of people we will work through these details and we will announce the new measures nearer the implementation date but we wanted to share with everyone now to give a sense of what you can expect in the coming weeks all this is part of the broader roadmap that we are working out and which we will also share as part of our reopening and as part of our transition towards a scenario of endemic covet and that roadmap will cover local measures within singapore as well as travel related measures we hope all of this will once again encourage everyone to take up the vaccination or to bring forward your appointments and get vaccinated earlier and as we see our vaccination coverage and our vaccination rates continue to rise steadily over the coming weeks and months we will be able to proceed confidently with our reopening plans thank you thank you ministers we will now begin the q a segment dear members of the media please remember to use the racehand function on zoom if you would like to ask a question and a reminder to keep to one question per media only if you are called upon you will be prompted to unmute yourself so please do so accordingly may we have the first question from timothy go st thank you ministers uh dms now we understand that those who took sinovac aren't counted in the national count but given that we're relying on hitting specific vaccination levels to ease measures this means that about some 17 000 people will never contribute to our vaccination target why are we excluding this group our national account simply because the vaccine is not part of the national vaccination scheme and why will those who have taken cyanofact not be allowed to take part in the perks offered to fully vaccinated people thank you thank you very much timothy for the question i'll start off by talking about the counts actually we do track all who receive synovic vaccinations in singapore the clinics that we have allowed and licensed to provide vaccination using the cyanovector vaccine report details of those who have gotten vaccinated and therefore we do have a count but we have uh not uh attempted to conflate the reporting that we've done by only reporting those uh that are vaccinated with vaccines under the national vaccination program so as to better reflect the efforts we're taking within our national vaccination program to get the population vaccinated and to achieve the milestones at an opportune moment when we the numbers build up we may give you a sense in terms of the numbers who also have been vaccinated using the synovic vaccine but at this time our focus remains on the pisa recognized vaccines that we are using also the we still have uh little data concerning the uh efficacy of the sonofac vaccine specifically against the variance of concern that uh currently uh uh uh that we are currently seeing and that's particularly the delta uh variant whereas uh in the other vaccines that we're using the mrna vaccines there's a little bit more data available at this point in time concerning the vaccine efficacy against the delta variant and this is partly the reason why we've chosen uh in our milestones to rely on the more tested vaccines that which we have sufficient evidence that there is a good amount of protection from that vaccination and use that for our data when it comes to achieving the targets that we have maybe i just add a few points one is that i do know that many of individuals who can't take mrna are not comfortable they when they come forward to take sinovac vaccine and they too are contributing to um the resilience of our society so i also want to thank them for taking this step but as dms mentioned unfortunately there aren't when we consult the experts they're just not enough data to show how effective is sinovac against delta because synovic is well used in say china but they have not really experienced delta it is being used in places like uae indonesia that is now experiencing delta variant but data is not coming out from these places as well so really we don't really have a medical or scientific basis having the data now to establish how effective sinovac is in terms of infection and severe illnesses on delta but i hope this data will emerge soon and allow us to make a assessment or allow the experts to make an assessment the third important point is this notwithstanding this when we reach 50 vaccine coverage two doses i think we need to still differentiate um but once we reach a higher level even higher level of vaccine coverage we will have stronger heart protection which means this vaccine effectiveness may be less of a factor and therefore in time we should be able to also be more inclusive in allowing vaccinated people or some partially vaccinated or unvaccinated people to participate in bigger events so our herd protection is also a major factor yeah thank you dms and minister ong can we have the next question from kang wait i go after minister ndms uh so basically recently they have been the case about the 60 year old who have uh have cardiac arrest center after receiving the first dose of physical medicine so we won't travel there's any update in the investigation whether it's linked to the vaccine and if there's if there's any other further action that we've taken after this thank you very much uh for that question we are concerned about the case that occurred over the last weekend and we continue to keep a close watch on on developments the hospital looking after the boy is doing its utmost to provide the best of care and they've been keeping the family updated regularly about what they're doing at this point in time the information we have is that he suffered from an out of hospital cardiac arrest and this was after an episode of severe australia's physical activity in the gym he had been lifting a weight where there was nearly twice his uh body weight uh so that is in fact quite a an exceptional activity to to to undertake in the gym and he had been also taking some supplements we don't actually know what the actual causes was out of a hospital cardiac arrest the specialists in the hospital are keeping their eyes open into all the various possibilities and it is indeed one of the possibilities that this might be due to an inflammation of the heart muscle or myocarditis it could be possibly related to the vaccinations but this is one of several possibilities that they are chasing i understand that they have not got the further information from some of the tests that they're doing some the tests take time for example analyzing the supplements to determine whether this might be contributory to the boys cardiac arrest at this point in time our hearts are with the boy but we continue to trust that the doctors will provide good and appropriate care to look after him the expert committee on coven 19 vaccinations has uh taken to account hsa's review completed recently and before this particular event and at that time they had already determined that there was an increasing signal of myocarditis occurring uh amongst younger people i think they've now reported 12 cases that they've received and and they've noticed for the first time compared to the earlier data the earlier signal that some of these cases of mycolitis are also occurring after that first vaccination and this is why the expert committee reviewing the data and also acknowledging this recent case have recommended a change in our policies for vaccination and have now recommended that after any dose of vaccination people who are undergoing vaccination particularly those who are younger and adolescents to avoid strenuous physical activity for at least one week following that vaccination and this would be for both the first vaccination as well as second vaccination dose doctors have been advised also to keep a close watch on all who present to them with chest pain breathlessness abnormal heart rates and to investigate and exclude this possibility that indeed these people might have myocarditis after vaccination however looking at the data the expert committee in conjunction with hsa they've also looked at the emerging evidence from other countries and it is still there considered opinion based on the risk benefit assessment that it is still beneficial for vaccinations to be offered to all who are eligible for vaccination and the ministry therefore have has accepted those recommendations and continue to provide vaccinations while awaiting further information uh to uh to come in from either local or overseas sources and for further information also about this 16 year old boy's case so just a very short addition i know that the media and the public will be very curious what is the cause of this cardiac arrest of this boy but as of now the hospital and moh our key priority is the well-being of the child yeah so i think let's focus on that i think in time to come the causes investigations results will come out in time to come and in the meantime follow the safety precaution that dms has talked about thank you dms and minister ong just a gentle reminder to members of media to keep to one question per media only with that we'll have the third question from chen lin reuters um hi governor ministers so for those who have already received cyno back would they be allowed to receive fizer or modena under the national vaccination program if they regretted their choice and why do you think santa back has an overwhelming response in singapore thank you i'll ask dms to talk about your first question i don't think it's overwhelming per se uh the is because of supply demand i think we started off in certain number of clinics the clinic started with a very cautious operation so cues build up and so certain images show that there's long queues but doesn't mean overwhelming i think we have a good number of people come up um and we are slowly clearing the queue as we speak so let me ask dms to answer the first part of your question yes indeed when we looked at those who had registered to take the sonofac vaccine we understood that in the first few days there was a there was an interest among many who had been waiting perhaps for for the synovic vaccine to be made available but since then uh the registration rates in fact have started to slow down and level off so i think uh uh uh whatever demand is uh that has expressed itself and it's not necessarily a case where this is overwhelming demand certainly there are a lot more people who are making registrations for the pfizer biotech and modern vaccines than they are for the synovic vaccines even now we have looked at the possibility that there might be individuals who had taken the sunovec vaccine whether one dose or more some might be those locally but there might also be those who come from overseas returning singaporeans who had received a dose of a different vaccine and now come to singapore asking us whether they can get vaccinated with the vaccines that we provide under the national vaccination program we have not stopped them although the data is still lacking concerning what the effectiveness is of this uh strategy using two different vaccines we call this a heterologous vaccination strategy and there are some theoretical benefits that may suggest that they would get good results but there isn't much data available real-world data available to confirm this but nonetheless if there are those who are eligible to receive the vaccinations from our national vaccination program we will allow them to register but we will advise them about the fact that the evidence is uh is not available considering uh how well the response if they had received other vaccines before and it becomes a situation where these individuals uh uh weigh the pros and cons and agree to proceed forward but we are not uh stopping them from registering and and we continue to accept them for our vaccination uh programs under the national strategy thank you minister ong and dms we'll take the next question from feli's wall street journal hello once covet 19 is considered fully endemic what do you anticipate would be a normal or acceptable fatality rate or do you think that this is a disease that if it's handled properly shouldn't be deadly at all there isn't much data at this point in time concerning uh what the situation will be and of course all of us uh within the uh covet task force hope that in a situation where the majority of our population are vaccinated we would see no fatalities but we are also quite pragmatic and we do accept that there may be vulnerable individuals who get infected who may have other medical problems and who are already much weaker compared to others and for them the risk of an adverse event and the risk of of a a bad outcome including death is always present our experience with with infections particularly with the delta variant amongst those who had vaccinations and those who did not has been that those so far who have been vaccinated and had infections have all been either mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic and therefore it's reasonable to expect that within the vaccinated group the chances of having an excellent outcome is very high but given that you may have a mixed group of people in this category including those who already are frail with severe other concomitant medical conditions one would never be complacent to say that there will never be any bad outcomes in this group of people however in those who have required oxygen supplementation and in those currently in our icu they're all unfair unvaccinated people so we continue to expect that as long as we will have some proportion of our population who are not vaccinated we would still safeguard our hospital resources and expect that in for some of these individuals we will still have to extend the best of care because they are ill and they may have a severe outcome just wanted to add that i think there are already indicators and signs from countries with very high vaccination rates that it may well be possible to make covet 19 more like influenza in terms of morbidity and mortality provided you have high vaccine coverage especially amongst the vulnerable population which means the seniors there are indicators from countries that are that have achieved that kind of a vaccination coverage so this is why we think that it is possible that we could enter into a scenario like that of endemic covit and where sars kovi 2 is treated more like influenza and we will be able to you know get on with our lives normally and we are therefore preparing this road map towards this transition of a new scenario thank you dms and minister wong we'll have the next question from polling channel 8 tv news hi ministers and dms phone from china it's museum for the differentiated sms for a vaccinated person around andromeda mentioned that group sizes will increase to eight am i right to say that all these eight people have to be fully vaccinated so what happens if there's a household of eight that wants to die out if the grandfather is not fascinated does it mean that he won't be able to join the family yeah would appreciate if you can get a response in chinese as well minister lawrence wong will answer in english and i'll do the translation yes excellent the we are mindful that there will be households who want to go out to dine in a group of eight and within that household there may be people who are not vaccinated by choice or because of contra indications or maybe they are children and therefore not eligible for vaccination and that's why as i mentioned earlier we will work out some guidelines around this for example it may well be that some of them may have to go for a pre-event test before they can participate in that group of eight or in that larger gathering or we may very well allow some exemptions for children but up to a cap because from a public health basis you know the assessment is that for children you know the risk of severe illness is much lower so those are the detailed guidelines which i mentioned we are still working out and when we are ready we will announce all of these details um thank you ministers we will now take the final question of today from mindytan the business times bye afternoon uh does the mtf expect the border closures to permanently affect the size of the forward workforce and real business and consumer costs go up for good thank you no we do not expect a permanent border closure and that's why there should not be a permanent impact on our workforce we are as part of our roadmap we will be taking progressive steps not just to ease safe management measures within our community but also across our borders and we are very mindful that there are affected industries construction marine offshore engineering being the most affected we are already finding different ways to bring in workers for these sectors in a safe manner so that there's already ongoing efforts on that front but beyond these specific projects where we are trying to bring in workers safely for these specific sectors we are looking more broadly at reopening our borders again synchronized with our rate of vaccination and with our real reopening plans and this will happen because our rate of our vaccination program is being accelerated this is not we're not talking about something that's happening you know many months down the road but we're talking about in several weeks time we will be able to progressively reopen our borders allow more travel and i think that will help with businesses who are looking for workers too ,True,True,False,False

tandoxing hospital cluster we are testing all patients and visitors who had been at tandoxing hospital on or after 18 april including discharged patients and all 12 000 staff on campus so far unboxing hospital has completed testing all inpatients and the results have all been negative other than those whom we have already announced yesterday we completed a second round of testing of these inpatients and the results are pending some of them may be incubating and may become positive in the days ahead and we will continue to monitor them testing of tandoxing hospital staff is in progress so far we have completed testing around 10 000 staff we will give an update as and when the results are out our aim is to leave no stone unturned and try our best to find in factor cases as early as possible we are carrying out surveillance testing for individuals who have been to public places that the cases have visited during the infectious period this can help us detect cases quickly so that we can ring fence them and prevent further transmission in the community i understand many turned up at our regional screening centers yesterday and had to wait their turn to be tested i thank singaporeans for the understanding and we will continue to improve our process over the past week tandoxing hospital has progressively implemented measures to reduce the risk of further transmission and free up more manpower to take care of our patients including seizing emission of new inpatient cases until further notice for patients seeking specialist outpatient clinic services tandoxing hospital will defer the appointments of stable cases and initiate teleconsultation and medication delivery where appropriate other institutions in the healthcare family are stepping up to ensure continuity of care for tantoxins patients i thank them for their support and for rallying together to help one another ministry of health has worked with public and private hospitals to activate various capacity management and load balancing measures so that patients requiring care will continue to be attended to for example from 3rd may some hospitals have started deploying doctors nurses and allied health professionals to assist untoxin in attending to their existing patients even as we are progressing progressive aggressively tracing and testing for this cluster we are also preparing the healthcare system for any potential rise in community cases and emergence of new clusters we hope it will not happen but we must be prepared for it for example ministry of health has asked all our hospitals to defer non-urgent surgeries and admissions as well as non-urgent soc appointments until further notice where applicable teleconsultation and alternative care arrangements will be put in place until the situation stabilizes our healthcare workers are on the front line fighting the virus every day and caring for our patients i hope singaporeans were rarely around them especially those from tantoxin hospital and the national center for infectious diseases and show them the well-deserved support that they need a kind word of encouragement or thoughtful deed goes a long way to boost their morale during these difficult times the cluster at untoxing is a reminder that the situation can change and escalate quickly beyond this cluster community cases have also risen over past weeks we therefore need to step up efforts to keep the community safe and break the chain of transmission by review by reducing interactions in the community and in the workplaces the multi-ministry task force will therefore put in place additional measures from it may to 30th may and my co-chair minister lawrence wong will provide more details in a short while we will continue to monitor the situation very closely depending on the local kovitt situation we may introduce more measures if there's a need to do so vaccination continues to be an important strategy in our fight against covid19 the kovie-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated but it does not eliminate the risk of infection completely locally we have seen some cases who have been infected despite completing the full doses of vaccination but because of vaccination these cases are either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and none has required oxygen so far therefore vaccination remains an important tool to help lower the risk of infection and severe disease these cases are also a useful reminder that vaccination is one out of a suite of public health and safe management measures that need to work in tandem to reduce the risk of transmission of covet 19. we must expect that our journey during this covet-19 pandemic will not always be smooth sailing and we will that we will progress always in one direction there will be periods when we need to tighten our measures and we need to be nimble in our response and be prepared to adjust measures as the situation evolves the additional measures will only work if everyone adheres to them and continues to be socially responsible the next few weeks will be critical for us so let us all play our part and keep one another safe the civil lining is that we have successfully brought our cases down before and we can do it again so long as we work together let me s foreign thank you very much minister as of the 4th of may 2021 the ministry of health has preliminary confirmed five new cases of locally transmitted covit-19 infection all of whom were detected from our proactive testing of patients visitors and staff at the tanto shen hospital or their closed contacts and had already been placed on quarantine and based on our investigation so far the cases are in the community and there are no new cases in the dormitories in addition there are 12 imported cases who had already been on stay home notice upon arrival in singapore so in total there are 17 new cases of kobe 19 infection in singapore today we're still working through much of that details of these cases and further updates will be shared via the press release that will issue later tonight we have been performing phylogenetic testing of all kovic-19 infections which we had obtained in singapore which had sufficient viral samples as of the 3rd of may 2021 we had detected 29 local cases with either variants of interest or variants of concern identified this includes eight local cases with the b1351 variant sometimes known as the south african variant seven local cases with the b16172 variant and this is also known as one of the indian variants three local cases with the p1 or brazilian variant three local cases with the b16171 another indian variant and one local case with the b1525 and that's a uk variant there were also seven other cases with the b117 or uk variant in addition there were four reinfection cases with the b1351 or south african variant of note seven cases in three of our local classes have the b16172 or indian variant and these viruses isolated in each of the clusters have been found to be phylogenetically distinct now this means that there are other variations that have been detected in the makeup of these viruses in each of these clusters which are different from each other suggesting that the clusters are not linked five of these cases are part of the cluster at tan tok singh hospital one case in another cluster was the ic officer deployed at changi airport terminal one and the case in the third cluster is a cleaner deployed at the ccf at south and further details again will be provided in the press release this evening we have not completed the phylogenetic testing of all cases that we have and we are likely to see more viral variants identified over time all necessary public health action has been taken promptly to isolate and ring fence all these cases and given the possible increased transmissibility of new viral variants it is necessary for us to take tighter measures to mitigate further risk of spread in both our healthcare institutions and in the rest of singapore the presence of these viral variants of concern amongst our local cases affirms our strategy to vaccinate all healthcare workers and prioritize vaccinations for older singaporeans had we not done so the tantoxin cluster would have been significantly larger at this time and the likelihood of that cluster getting out of control that much greater this is therefore a reminder to all of us that we should get ourselves vaccinated and protected when our time comes and we cannot afford to be complacent i looked at the 40 cases that we had reported in the tantoxine cluster eight patients who had been eight cases who had been vaccinated were either asymptomatic or exhibited very mild symptoms and non-required oxygen therapy of those not protected by vaccination seven of the 20 had need of oxygen therapy and we are aware that one patient unfortunately has passed on based on the early phylogenetic information that's available to us the cluster is due to a viral variant but the vaccine appears to have done relatively well against it in those tested and had received the full vaccination in our testing they had demonstrated evidence of antibodies to the spike protein which demonstrates a good response to vaccination but as minister has shared vaccination does not prevent you from getting infected 100 but it will safeguard you from getting a severe infection and it protects provides some protection in limiting further transmission we're still not out of the woods as far as the tantoxine cluster is concerned and we remain vigilant in looking out for more cases amongst patients who remain in the hospital among the staff at the hospital and in those who are presently under quarantine the measures that will be announced in a short while will help reduce further our transmission of infection in the community and help us return to the situation we enjoyed for several months at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 21 and we can all do our part by being disciplined in our mass wearing and adherence to safe distancing measures thank you good evening as you know we have been continuing to monitor the internet international situation carefully and globally the virus situation continues to worsen especially with new variants that are more infectious the new cases are rising in many countries especially in the south indian continent but now they are spreading also to southeast asia so far we have kept our borders tight with a stay-home notice or shn regime of 14 days for travelers coming to singapore when we saw new variants from specific countries for example the united kingdom south africa and india we lengthened the stay home notice or shrink for these countries to 21 days it's not because the new variants have longer incubation periods in fact there is no evidence that the new variants have long incubation periods but the purpose of lengthening the shn at that time was to minimize the risk of having more variant cases leaking into our community since then the global situation has worsened and we are seeing new variants not just from these specific countries because the variants are likely to have spread all over the world so we have to tighten our border measures further and we will make two additional moves which will take effect from 7th of may 2359 first we will lengthen the shn duration from 14 days to 21 days for travelers coming in from higher risk countries or regions second when it comes to the definition of travel history today our border measures are determined based on the travelers recent travel history in the past 14 days so likewise we will now extend that to the past consecutive 21 days so 21 days in terms of your travel history and then when you come into singapore from a higher risk country or region the shn will likewise be extended to 21 days we are adopting this more stringent border measure up till the end of may beyond at that time we'll do a further review depending on the global situation and our local situation and we will continue to update and fine-tune our border measures so that's the first set of changes we are making around our border control measures within our community we have also taken several steps to tighten last week to ring fence the cases and to control the spread and as you see as you have seen reported in the last few days we've picked up many cases that are linked to the tantoxin hospital cluster both the tantoxin hospital cluster and the ica cluster incidentally are also variants associated with the indian mutant as you have heard just now from dms the new variant strains have higher attack rates they are more infectious they are causing larger clusters than before we have tried our best to ring fence the cases through contact tracing but we must assume that there are still hidden cases out there in the community and we must also recognize that we are dealing with a new variant of variants that are more infectious and are likely to cause larger clusters so we need to tighten our measures within our community too and we will do so from the 8th of may to 30th of may it covers several key events and public holidays mother's day is coming this weekend hari raya next week visak day on the last week of may so i recognize that this will cause considerable inconvenience to everyone but i hope we all understand why we need to put in place these tighter measures let me summarize quickly what these title measures are first the current permissible group size will be reduced from eight persons to five persons that means that when you go out whether it's for a meal for social gatherings no longer eight persons five persons likewise the cap of distinct visitors per household per day will be reduced from eight to five we had earlier said that individuals should have keep to two or less social gatherings per day whether visiting another household or meeting with family or friends in a public place so that still remains but the group size will be reduced from eight to five second we will require more people to work from home rather than go back to the office today up to 75 percent of employees who are able to work from home may be allowed to return to the workplace we will tighten that from 75 to 50 percent third we will reduce event sizes across the board for a whole range of different events so live performances for example um we had allowed up to 750 we will now bring it down to 250. pre-event testing will be required for all attendees of these events if there are more than 100 attendees so the cap is 250 if you have 100 persons there is no need for pre-event testing if you go beyond 100 the cap is 250 and pre-event testing will be required for such events and performances likewise for congregational and worship services the same with apply the cap is 250. if you have not more than 100 then there is no need for pre-event testing but so long as you go beyond that you are limited to 250 and pre-event testing must apply in addition we had earlier allowed congregational singing in religious settings but we will now suspend that particular measure for weddings we are applying a slightly tighter restriction because in a wedding setting the risks are higher people are gathered together without mask and eating so the maximum cap remains at 250 with pre-event testing but if there is no pre-event testing then we will apply a stricter cap of 50 persons not 100 but 50 persons for funerals attendees will be limited to on the day of the burial cremation they will be limited to no more than 30 persons that's down from 50 persons and for the days of the week it remains at 30 attendees at any one time for spectator sports and participation sporting events as a new requirement all such mass participation sports events will be suspended and no spectators will be allowed next we also recognize that there are some settings which are of higher risk this is from international experience it's also from our own local experience and such settings are typically where there is a high density of people who are unmasked and in close proximity with one another often for prolonged periods the good example will be settings like indoor gyms and indoor fitness studios so we will close such indoor gyms and indoor fitness and health studios during this period of heightened alert outdoor exercise activities and programs may still continue subject to a class size that's smaller than before be used to allow 50 we will now reduce that to 30 attendees in total with safe distancing measures in place we had also earlier announced that trace together only safe entry will be implemented from 1st of june that's where you enter public venues with a high throughput of visitors you use the trace together app or token to enter these venues so the start date was originally planned for first of june we will now bring that forward to 17 of me effectively when you look at the range of measures which i've just given a summary of the measures will bring us back to phase 2 for a few weeks from 8th of may to 30th of may this is not a circuit breaker we certainly hope not to have to invoke another circuit breaker but we have proposed a rather quite a stringent and very tight set of measures so that we can respond robustly and preemptively to the latest set of club latest outbreak of clusters and do our best to snuff them out early and reduce the likelihood of having to impose more drastic measures down the road so we seek everyone's cooperation to comply with the latest set of rules not just the letter of the law but the spirit of it so for example even though the start date of these measures is set on 8th of may and that's to give businesses enterprises organizations time to adjust we ask everyone to start in fact doing your part with immediate effects starting to tonight try to scale back your activities as much as possible scale back your social interactions and stay home to the extent you can meanwhile for those who are medically eligible we would strongly encourage you as minister ghan had said just now to get yourself vaccinated get your booking slots early as soon as possible and get yourself vaccinated we have been able to bring down infection rates we have been able to keep the infection under control before we can certainly do it again working together and get back on track with our reopening plans let me just say a few words in mandarin now but waiting sushi and sing the gun ranch m chile thank you ministers dms members of media press materials have been sent please note that all materials are embargoed until after the end of the press conference we will now begin with the q a segment media agencies please remember to use the race and function on zoom if you would like to ask a question do also remember to unmute before asking your question kindly note that we will only take one question per media so as to allow more to participate may we now have the first question from sd timothy please thank you ministers gms now minister bomb earlier mentioned that we certainly hope not to have to implement a circuit breaker and i can understand that sentiment but the number of unlinked cases right now is about the same as when we first entered the circuit breaker we currently have about 10 active clusters almost on par with what we had when the circuit breaker was announced last april given that the circuit breaker did work the last time why are we choosing to tighten measures in a phased approach rather than taking a full measure of another circuit breaker and given that the situation has been worsening over the last few weeks will minister gun consider extending his stay in the mtf already staying on an advisory role thank you well we are monitoring the situation situation very carefully and if you look at the indicators in terms of unlinked cases and more carefully in terms of this what we are picking up from the sentinel surveillance i wouldn't say that the situation is where we were bef like where before we entered the circuit breaker last year our public health experts who have been monitoring this very carefully would liken it more to the early phase when we entered into the [Music] kovit-19 outbreak and we were seeing a sprinkling of community cases throughout our community right maybe more like the situation um february march rather than right before the circuit breaker so there is a qualitative difference in the situation assessment by our public health experts that's one number two we also have far better capabilities today compared to den we have more testing capabilities we also have better contact tracing capabilities where we are able to move in faster identify the potential closed contacts and even the out the wider ring of possible exposures and get everyone tested so that we can more quickly ring fence the cases and prevent further spread of the virus so i think if you look at where we are today it is not quite the same as a situation before the circuit breaker we think we are able to snuff out the current outbreak of clusters and bring things under control but as a additional preemptive step we are taking this move that we have just described bringing the whole suite of measures back to phase two and taking a much tighter posture overall and we believe that if we do that and if everyone cooperates from now to 30th of may or end of may we have a good chance of bringing cases down and getting things back on control thank you i think it's important for us to clarify that we have not ruled out the possibility of a circuit breaker certainly we hope that we won't get there and we must do what we can with this set of measures that we've just announced and with the cooperation and support of all singaporeans i think we probably will be able to avoid having to get to a circuit breaker situation but we cannot rule that out and that is why we will continue have to remain vigilant and monitor the situation and adjust our measures as we go along just now you also ask whether i'm going to stay on in a multi-ministry task force i have to say that we have scheduled for me to change to move on to a ministry of trade industry but i have been discussing with my co-chair minister lawrence wong as well as the incoming minister for health mr ong kang and we discuss how we can ensure a continuity and we have agreed that we will continue to work together as a team the three of us will continue to be involved in the mtf and we will continue to share and support one another as we go ahead so i think not to worry even if i have been moved to ministry or trade industry i will continue to work with the other two co-chairs in order to make sure that there is continuity in the work of the multi-ministry task force thank you ministers can we have the next question from chao bao hi good evening ministers and dms this is children from sao paulo firstly could the ministers assess how serious is our current situation and also for the situation in time tossing hospital may me know why is the transmission so widespread is it because patients and visitors were not wearing masks in the wards as it has been reported in several media interviews and my last question since these title measures would last to 30th may would this affect our travel bubble arrangement with hong kong on 26 may thank you i must say that we take this current situation very seriously and it is a serious cluster that we are seeing and not just one cluster we have several clusters emerging concurrently and therefore that's why we have to introduce additional measures to prevent further spread of the transmission and i hope that all singaporeans will also take this seriously and let's work together this measures um my note by no means easy and i'm sure it's quite imposing on many of us some of the activities have to be cancelled postponed or scaled down and many businesses may be affected they have to make adjustments and therefore we don't take this lightly but i think if we work together we will be able to keep the situation under control i asked the dms to talk about the situation in toxins specifically thank you minister we have been studying this and we continued our epidemiological investigations these are not completed yet so we will not be able to give you a definitive response at this stage but we are looking at various possibilities of course you have mentioned one is it because of not wearing masks or a lack of discipline in maintaining discipline and infection control well that is one possibility that we always look at but we did note that there was a clustering of cases really around one single ward that is one d one delta a nine delta or nine d uh and uh we are exploring the possibility that there are the local influences particularly uh related to the ward that may have also influenced to a super spreading event occurring leading to these cases so we are studying the possibility that there may be issues with the air flow and ventilation in the world among various other hypotheses that we're entertaining so until the studies are complete we will not be able to give a definitive response but we are exploring all possibilities and we're taking precautions accordingly as we manage existing patients emitted in tantok saying hospital on the question of the air travel bubble i think we mentioned the last time around that there is a set of indicators that we use to decide whether or not the bubble will proceed or whether or not it will be suspended that's at the sort of very measurable set of indicators based on unlinked cases but beyond that both sides singapore and hong kong continue to remain in touch we will monitor the situation and we will review and assess whether or not there will be any changes and make give updates in due course thank you ministers dms members of media just a gentle reminder to ask only one question so as to allow more to participate can we get the next question from cne deborah please hi good evening ministers and dms thanks for taking my question so my question is uh for mr wong now you've made it very clear that this isn't a circuit breaker but what are the indicators that the government would be looking at closely and what levels must they cross was to return to circuit breaker days for instance are we expecting any titan measures for schools thank you there will be some tightening around the school sort of based measures be it the suspension of the school games as well as some tightening of the safe management measures that will be put in place as part of this return back to phase 2 which we are putting in place from now to 30th of may and that one moe will release the details separately as to whether or not these measures are adequate whether we should whether we might have to go further as minister ghan said just now we never rule out the need for tighter measures or even the possibility that we might have to go back to a circuit breaker but based on the assessment of the situation based on where we think we are today a very um you know the clusters that have formed the cases that we have seen we think these measures are already a rate these measures that you know bring us all the way back to phase two are already a very strong preemptive move that potentially if we do it well potentially can arrest and snuff out the hidden cases that are even in our midst well i mean there is no guarantee of course that this will be sufficient so we will have to monitor the situation over the next few days and weeks if there are more unlinked cases if new clusters emerge and we all know that based on the experience so far the cases that we are seeing popping up are due to the new invariants they are more infectious and larger classes are forming as compared to say months ago where we did have unlinked cases but then you would have one or two and they would stop there you wouldn't have such big clusters this doesn't seem to be the case more recently with the ica cluster and the tan toxin hospital cluster we hope we will have contained these clusters and with the new measures we would be able to slow down the spread but if new unlinked cases continue to pop up new large clusters continue to emerge in the coming days and weeks then certainly we will not hesitate to take even more stringent measures even the possibility of having to enter another circuit breaker down the road but we let's try our best to avoid that scenario and let's all do our part first to as i said comply with the new measures the latest set of measures and do it not just following the letter of the law but do it in in the spirit of it so do our best to minimize our social interactions and activities and stay home as much as possible that will certainly help reduce the chances of new cases emerging thank you minister can we get the next question from writers chen lin please with name ministers and dms so currently of all the infected person in ttsh and i say classes how many are fully vaccinated and which vaccine brand they took respectively and does the latest outbreak in singapore share any fresh light on vaccines ability to cut transmissions thank you thank you very much for the question uh i have information with me concerning the tantoxin cluster i don't have all the information about the cluster around the ica officer but we'll try and give you some information in due course of the 40 individuals that we've identified associated with the tantoxine cluster we've had nine individuals who are fully vaccinated and these are mainly staff in the hospital and as i mentioned well seven of them are staff in the hospital two of whom are patients all of whom were relatively asymmetric or had mild symptoms there were 24 individuals that either were not vaccinated or had at most one vaccine dose of these three were staff members 14 were patients and seven were either visitors or caregivers associated with patients who had been admitted into the hospital so that gives you that total of 40 that were present they were vaccinated with a mix of of the two different vaccines as you know we vaccinate with either the pfizer vaccine or moderna the majority of uh of uh people who were vaccinated were vaccinated with the pfizer vaccine but there were at least one individual i remember i'll have to check the further details but at least one of the individuals had a modern vaccine administered thank you dms can we get the next question from wan pao can't wait uh please minister and dms is come with one part uh as previously shared some cases in the ttsh cluster actually some have carried the indian variant and we also see that there's numerous confirmed locally transmitted cases who have written the skype earlier in a year and were only tested positive during departure so would the minister want to give like a review if the closure of border could be done sooner and if the ministry is looking at people who had returned since early this year to go for either voluntary or compulsory copy testing as well for to do a more creative chat thank you did you okay um can you repeat the second part of your question i didn't quite catch it uh because there has been some kid a lot of cases that have been tested negative and it came into singapore but tested positive during departure so is that would there be any action taken to preemptivity maybe ask them to go for either compulsory or voluntary kovid tests to see whether we are more and like cases in the community without knowledge got it thank you well on travel i think we should again look at the broader picture unlike some large or resource-rich countries that can more or less shut their borders for a long time singapore cannot afford to do so certainly not for prolonged duration of a prolonged duration of time why because we are small we do not have insufficient resources we need migrant workers to build our homes we need migrant workers acro across a wide range of essential services for our own needs we need migrant workers to care for our elderly and so it's really very hard for us to close our borders permanently instead we have always taken a risk-based approach in managing our borders from the start how do we do so number one we control the inflows of arrivals so if you look at the situation today say from january to now the overall number of inflows have been about stable sometimes a bit more sometimes a bit less but overall it's been about stable in fact it's been coming down this was even before we started restricting arrivals from india we have already been very tight to the point that the backlog of applications from companies and from potential employers here in singapore has been growing significantly considerably and to the point where you know many projects have been suffering from delays as all of us know and more recently when we restricted the flow of workers from india and from the entire south indian continent including bangladesh it means considerable delays will be added to all our projects some of our housing projects bto projects may now well be delayed up to a year or more so it does come at considerable cost to singaporeans number two beyond controlling the inflow and keeping it very tight as we have been doing and then even more so recently we have always had a stay home notice regime so the migrant workers coming in or the inflows coming in do not come in without any isolation they come in they have to serve a stay home notice regime and we have been progressively tightening the regime over the last few months not only recently but even in the past for the workers coming in in the construction marine and process sectors we already put in place a 21 day shn before today's announcement of extending the shn across the board to 21 days the workers in the cmp sectors were already serving a 21 day isolation in the shn facility and the onboarding centers and we were testing them more regularly in order to pick up the infected cases thirdly we prioritize the vaccination of officers who are working on our borders and checkpoints in order to minimize and reduce the risk of transmission so we have put in place all of these measures from last year all the way till now but despite these measures we know that there are leaks into the community from time to time we knew that this risk could happen even for example in a ch in a country like china where they have also very tight border measures i read a report recently where they said that the indian variants had likewise leaked into several cities and have been picked up in several cities so the point is we continue to keep our border measures as tight as possible but we cannot rely solely on border controls we have to make use of other tools at our disposal testing tracing safe management measures and now vaccination and if we do all of this well then we can control the spread of the infection in our community and the same the same work will then happen for the question was asked about cases that came in earlier much earlier they completed their shn tested negative but when when they were going back to whatever countries they came from when they did a pre-departure test they tested positive we don't quite know what these cases are because there are two possibilities number one they could have been infected within the community it's quite possible that they picked it up within the community because you know the virus still circulates in the community they could have picked it up number two it could be an older infection and so they are intermittent shedders right and they were negative at the point of exit from shn but when they returned to their country they tested positive because they are intermittent shedders so less likely to be infectious so there are a range of possibilities that could apply we are examining all of these possibilities we are continuing to make sure that our shn facilities are tight but at the same time we have to make sure that within the community we take all the necessary precautions and safeguards which is why we are now making this additional move to tighten our community measures to extend the minister's reply we've also been looking at any potential situation where we might be missing cases that may come in uh although we have a very robust shn isolation testing regime at this stage so one example of a study that we've launched is looking at recovered travelers who recovered cases where travelers coming into singapore we've not uh uh discounted the possibility that some of these recovered travelers might in fact have reinfections and therefore uh uh bring that in and and pose a a threat to us so a study is in progress right now looking at recovered travelers to see whether any of them in fact are in this category of reinfections we've previously picked up some such cases but so far in those that previously had passed through us and have been categorized as recovered uh travelers we've not picked up any uh uh other signs of a recent infection so it appears as if so far up to this time that concern is is is there but we've not actually seen other cases now coming out beyond those that we've already picked up thank you minister dms can we get the next question from channel 8 sushuwan please good evening uh with regards to the ttsh cluster so moh actually encourage individuals with possible exposure to get their subtest done but it's not mandatory however some companies have made it mandatory and that's why we see a lot of employees rush to get their subtest yesterday and cause a very long queue so is moh going to make this uh mandatory where so there is no misalignment of directive to all these uh possible exposure individuals and also about the shangri-la dialogue which will take place in june so it's only four days after the after our new measures validity so is there any uh adjustment or any uh to that date uh thank you very much for your questions i'll take that first question first indeed we've invited anyone who might have visited the hospital to come in these are people who are at lower risk the only risk exposure is the fact they had visited the hospital in fact everyone that we identify as at a higher risk for example they've come in they've gone into the wards they've visited the wards of concern they are caregivers or visitors or especially or patients in that ward we've already placed them under quarantine and indeed as we pick up these additional cases they're all people under quarantine but we understand that we many other people who are worried anxious even though their risk is low and this is the reason why we also invited them uh to get themselves tested if only to assure them that despite the fact they had visited tantok saying they are they're okay and and there's no need to make this mandatory but we would allow them to come forward to any of our regional swap testing centers or phpc uh clinics which can do swap testing and they can go to any of these centers and get themselves tested those whom we've already identified with that sort of increased risk simply because they've visited the hospitals at the the relevant time periods would have received a message from us inviting them to come forward and indeed as they come forward as they identify themselves we would perform that test [Music] without any additional charge and this is really to give them that peace of mind with respect to companies making it compulsory to their employees to get themselves tested because of this same risk we don't think it's necessary to make it mandatory from our point of view but we understand that there are some companies that want to give further peace of mind to the employees and and and asked all of them to do so we certainly wouldn't object to it but it's not necessary at this stage for all companies to make this mandatory with regard to the shangri-la dialogue or for that matter any other events that are going to be planned in the coming months i think they will just have to monitor the situation very carefully and stay up to date based on the latest advisories and guidelines because the situation is so fluid it's moving you know by the day by the week we really don't know what will happen in the next few weeks it may worsen we may have to do more in which case you know some of these events maybe may have to reconsider the proposition of doing it physically or it may well improve and then you know we may be able to exit after the 30th of may and then get back to something closer eventually to phase three so because it's fluid it's uncertain i we are keeping in touch with all of the organizers providing the latest information and then likewise the organizers in due course will have to consider the options available based on the latest situation and they will i'm sure provide updates to all the attendees thank you dms minister can we get the next question from today payton please yes um hi ministers uh maybe understand uh earlier you mentioned that uh the investigations are still ongoing but maybe understand whether there was any particular issue with existing sops at tanton toxin hospital that led to the clusters formulation uh secondly we also heard that there were some uh hotels that had some staycation guests that told their station guests to cancel their their reservations in the coming months uh so um because they are saying that they are assisting the government in uh kobe 19 efforts maybe find out more whether hotels are affected um yeah thank you uh thank you very much uh in the initial investigation so far we have not identified any specific breach in uh processes and protocols uh that uh tanto singh had put in place and required staff to to carry out but of course uh investigations are still ongoing and until we complete those investigations i will not be able to give you a definitive reply to that particular question uh it's a bit difficult for us to comment about uh several guests cancelling their stay the staycation stay in local hotels and that could be for a variety of different reasons indeed sometimes it could be that they have other work commitments that have now suddenly arisen they could be participating in the the efforts to help to manage the outbreak but without further information it's a bit difficult for us to tell certainly we've not picked up any indicators to suggest that there's now a deluge of cancellations occurring in our hotels uh and and and and at this stage uh no no uh signals that we're getting that this is a problem uh i think maybe the the question was misunderstood we are trying to understand whether there is a directive to hotels to uh get their guests to cancel destinations i understand well what we are doing is really to build up sufficient shn capacity especially now that we are extending the shn duration to 21 days so sdb is i mean all the agencies that are overseeing this shan facilities i'm sure engaging the hotels this is ongoing the key requirement though is not just about the hotel saying they are interested in doing shn but we are also making sure that all the stringent requirements the precautions the security measures the control measures are in place before new hotels come forward to serve as shn facilities because we also know that it's not just about longer is better you it it's also about what happens in the hotel and if the you know measures are not tight enough you can easily have leaks in an shn hotel so we are working through you know the process of discussing engaging the hotels making sure that we have sufficient capacity and ensuring also that the infection controls and the precautions and security measures in these hotels are in place just to perhaps to answer this i apologize if i had misunderstood your question earlier but ministry health is working also with some of the hotel groups and with stan toxin hospital to support them because some of their staff have indicated that they would appreciate perhaps some support for for accommodation at this time as they're working additional hours supporting the work to control the outbreak and they want to have some peace of mind knowing that they can perhaps stay away from the rest of the family members on an abundance of caution not that because they have an increased risk to them but really to give their own family members some peace of mind also there have been some uh reports we hear of of healthcare workers uh being told that they're not welcome after the landlord found that they're working in tan talk saying this is a concern for us because these workers are well and they've committed a lot of time and energy to us looking after patients in tan toxin hospital at this stage so we endeavor also to support them making sure that they have uh support uh and accommodation uh through this difficult time when they're caught being called up to to to do much more than what they would normally be expected to this is uh something where we as singaporeans can also pull together to show support for health care workers this happened again last year when we all came together to extend our appreciation for people who have been working long hours without complaining in the hospitals looking after patients both with and without covet 19 infection and we ask that you also show your support then to tantak singh hospital and and to their workers and also their welfare which is very important at this stage thank you mr dms can we get the next question from cna digital jalila please thank you um can you hear me yes we can thank you the additional measures being announced today take effect in a few days time if the risk is already uh why not implement the changes immediately and does the current situation mean there is a need to accelerate the vaccination program well as i said just now um when you make these changes there will always be some adjustments that are needed um groups will have the businesses will have to make adjustments so we are giving some time for them to take to make the necessary adjustments um but we don't have to wait for the new rule to kick in as i mentioned all individuals all of us can do our part and start minimizing our own activities and start to scale back stay home as much as possible so that's a call out to everyone don't have to wait till 8th of may even starting tonight we can all already scale back our activities and the more we do so the more we stay home the better the chance of reducing the spread of the infection as far as a vaccination program is concerned we will continue to do as much as we can we have um never held back our vaccination right so so long as supplies come in we are rolling them out as quickly as we can so the only um sort of the the key to get more people vaccinated is not so much on the supply side but really the take-up rates and that's why we also encourage everyone who is medically eligible to step forward if they have not done so get a booking slot as soon as possible and get themselves vaccinated i should also emphasize that while we are the effective date is still a couple of days away we should not go out and try to celebrate and try to squeeze in and have a big power before the measures come to effect so as mr wong mentioned highlighted we should begin to exercise caution because the virus doesn't really respect rules the virus will not wait until the the effective date so therefore do what we can to minimize the risk of transmission if we can stop uh cut back our social social activities cover our social contacts all the more better so i encourage everyone to exercise caution and the vigilance even as we approach the deadline of the implementation of these measures thank you ministers we will now take the last three questions can we get the next question from ard german tv sandra please i have you for thought about implementing a measure that china already has which is asking all incoming passengers to present not only a pcr test but a blood test as well so you can check on antibodies actually we have been doing that um even earlier not just today we've been doing that earlier particularly for the workers the migrant workers coming in uh in the cmp sectors right construction marine and process because this will enable us to determine the level of antibodies particularly for those who have been infected before then we know get a better sense of their status so we have already been doing that and we will continue to do that for incoming travelers so that we are not only relying on one test which is the pcr to test for the presence of the virus but also to test their antibody level but you haven't asked that any other passengers it's just the migrant workers who do that at this point right that's right so we are studying and we will consider whether or not to extend that further thank you minister can we get the next question from tamil morissa venga please good evening ministers um so since the additional travel restrictions were put in place for the indian passengers um are there any numbers for the numbers of singaporeans or peers trying to come into singapore and are there any further plans to help the situation in india so today the indian cases uh crossed the 20 million mark and last week 256 oxygen cylinders were given and before that the indian air force had actually come here to take four creogenic tanks as well so are there any further um plans to help the india kovit situation thank you very much i don't have the specific on the numbers but they have come down significantly after we have restricted travels and there will still be a occasional fuel coming back and mostly entirely now because of the restrictions only returning singaporeans and prs very few because the flights have also been curtailed so i like i said the numbers have come down but if you talk about before the restrictions were put in place like i i just to give a context the numbers were always very stable right and a large proportion of the flows from india were in the construction marine and process sectors and that's where that's what the profile was like and then after we put in the restrictions we tightened the inflow initially and then we restricted all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors that number has just dropped down quite significantly in terms of the situation in india we you know our hearts go out to what's happening there and we recognize that it's an important issue because no country is safe until all of us are safe and therefore we all need to do our parts to support one another so to the extent that we are continuing in touch with our indian counterparts mfa is certainly in touch with them and to the extent that we can help we will certainly do so thank you minister we will now take the last question from shin min daily news gig link please hi ministers okay so my question is because i see from press release that um there's a serial number for the ring factor cases like rs16 ri 17 are 18 right 20. so i guess there's some kind of serial numbers being um given to this ring better cater so how many reinfected cases uh do we have now and then are we now considered can we already consider singapore now is back to phase two yeah thank you very much for the question i don't actually have uh the final number on number two infected cases but we can make that available after we check and get a more accurate figure we have a system of numbering all our cases you realize uh on a daily basis when we issue our press releases there will be a numbering system that comes on and that's a numbering system for those who are tested positive uh pcr tests and when we have imported cases coming in we have a format for uh looking at them and and here and also for reinfected cases uh the numbers uh when we present at the press releases may not necessarily come in running order and that's partly also because as we identify cases we give a number immediately but as more details come up as the test other test results become available we may realize that these are all cases these are uh not really reinfected cases but we don't necessarily then restart the clock we just remove those those case numbers assigned to that particular patient and then the next available case number is assigned to the next uh person who fulfills that criteria down the road so whatever you see on the press release you know if you see a number that says 2021 it doesn't necessarily mean that 21 cases but it just means there were 21 individuals where numbers were signed and then subsequently some of these cases might have been rescinded as more information became available but the exact numbers i'll go back we'll check and it will make that available to the media on the second part of the question yes we are effectively back at phase two based on all the measures that i've just described eight to five the new limits and new restrictions effectively we are positioning our measures as going back to phase two like i described earlier there is a word a view that based on the assessment of the situation today the fact that we had gone out very quickly last week to tighten up to identify the cases the closed contacts to get everyone tested that the range of measures we have already put in place might be sufficient to contain the clusters that's one view right and then based on that we might be able to control the spread already but we do not know we will never know whether there are cryptic hidden cases that may have escaped our net it's not possible to be 100 sure so what we are proposing today and what we are announcing today is in our view a robust and preemptive move to tighten up across the board reduce movement across the board reduce interactions generally and we believe that if we all do this well we will have a much better chance of reducing the spread of the virus breaking the chains of transmission and controlling more outbreaks of clusters in our community thanks i just want to conclude by saying that the situation remains quite fluid going forward over the next few weeks so we need to continue to monitor the situation and we also have to expect that some of the measures need to be further adjusted as we go along depending on how the landscape how the situation evolves so i urge the singaporeans to bear with us to be patient with us as as and when we will the situation evolves we will need to continue to adjust the measures and we will keep singaporeans updated on the situation as soon as we know uh of the development so thank you very much once again for joining us at this press conference ,True,True,False,False

Welcome to Public Health on Call, a new podcast from the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Our focus is the
novel coronavirus. I'm Josh Sharfstein, a faculty
member at Johns Hopkins, and also a former Secretary of
Maryland's health department. Our goal with this podcast is
to bring evidence and experts to help you understand
today's news about the novel coronavirus and what
it means for tomorrow. If you have questions,
you can email them to publichealthquestion@jhu.edu. That's
publichealthquestion@jhu.edu for future podcast episodes. Today, I speak with Dr.
Vernon Lee, the director of the Communicable Diseases
Division of the Ministry of Health of Singapore. He is a graduate of the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and
the business school at Johns Hopkins. We speak about
Singapore's experience with the novel coronavirus. Let's listen. Dr. Lee, thank you so
much for joining me. Let's start, if you
could just explain what your job is in Singapore. DR. VERNON LEE:
Thank you so much. And I'm happy to
be on this call. So I'm the director of
Communicable Diseases at the Ministry of
Health in Singapore. And my job includes prevention,
preparedness, surveillance, and response to infectious
diseases across the country. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: And how long
have you been in that position? DR. VERNON LEE: I've
been in this position for more than three years now. And during that
time, we have had quite a few
interesting challenges due to infectious
diseases, both outbreaks that we have to deal
with, and also we have been preparing for,
of course, epidemics. And that includes dealing
with our preparedness plans and also building a
new National Centres for Infectious Diseases, which
is a brand-new clinical unit in a hospital to take care of
infectious diseases patients. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Got it. And your background is
that you're a physician, and you're trained in
infectious disease. And you've got a public health
degree and a business degree from Johns Hopkins. Is that right? DR. VERNON LEE: I am a
preventive medicine physician, with an interest in infectious
diseases epidemiology. And, yes, I have an MPH and
an MBA from Johns Hopkins. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Great. So I want to ask you about
the novel coronavirus and Singapore's experience. And I want to start back
from when you saw that this was happening in China. What happened in Singapore
when that was going on? DR. VERNON LEE: So I
recall that China first reported a cluster of
severe pneumonia cases, I think it was 31st
of December, 2019. And we were following this
very closely, of course. Initially, we did not know
if it was a zoonotic disease, it was limited to
human-to-human transmission, or if it was something
more sinister. Of course, to be
prepared, we had, in fact, by the 2nd
or 3rd of January, informed all of our medical
practitioners and health care workers to be on the alert if
we see such severe pneumonia cases of unknown origin, and
to consider such a diagnosis. Very quickly, of
course, after that the disease was reported to be
due to this SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. And a laboratory test was
quickly available as well, so we could actually test
suspected cases for COVID-19. And there was also more
evidence emerging from China that there was, in fact,
efficient human-to-human transmission. So that was when we were
already ramping up some of our preparedness measures. And that really caused us
to increase our preparedness and surveillance
for this disease. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: I want to ask
you about testing a little bit. So Singapore developed its own
test based on the genetic-- is it the genetic code
of the virus, is that-- DR. VERNON LEE: That's correct. So co-located in the National
Centre for Infectious Diseases, we have our National
Public Health Laboratory, which is a reference
lab in Singapore and also a reference
lab for the region. And we developed our own test. And that is basically
the foundation of all of our public
health response. The whole idea is that we will
test and test to detect cases. So our surveillance
is based on the fact that we have a robust
testing capacity, which we have built over many
years since the SARS outbreak in 2003. We are able to test quite a
high number of tests per capita, and from that, we have just
been looking for cases. Initially, of course, we were
looking for severe pneumonia cases. But we have since expanded
our testing regime currently to testing even prolonged
acute respiratory infections, or anyone with-- who physicians suspect to
be a possible COVID-19 case. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN:
When you found-- you began to find
cases, so now let's go to sort of the second phase. So you were prepared. You had your clinicians ready. You had developed a test. And then sure enough, cases
started coming to Singapore. So what was your
response at that point? DR. VERNON LEE: So the
first several cases were all travelers
from Wuhan city in China, where the
largest number of cases occurred at that time. So when we detected
our first cases, our plan was very simple. And this was a plan that we had
developed, again, and refined since SARS and during
the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The whole idea was to detect
as many cases as possible through our surveillance system. For every case
that we detect, we will do active case
finding to detect more cases around that individual. And for all the
positive COVID-19 cases, we will isolate
them in hospital. And we do contact tracing to
identify all close contacts. And we would quarantine
them for 14 days. So that would then break
the cycle of transmission, because the case would
be isolated in hospital. And all of the contacts
would be quarantined. And those that developed
disease, of course, under quarantine will not
be exposed or infected anyone else. So that has been the mainstay
of our containment effort since we detected our first
case on 23rd of January, all the way up to today. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: And how
many cases have you had? DR. VERNON LEE: So
right now, we have had now more than 900 cases. But more than half
of those cases are imported from
travelers to Singapore. So initially, the number of
imported cases from China was about, I think, 17 cases. So they were actually
fairly small. Of course, at that
time, by the time we identified some
of these cases, they had likely seeded
some local transmission, but not much. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN:
And of those 900, were you able to
isolate them all and try to find their contacts? Or how did that go? DR. VERNON LEE:
Yes, indeed, so it's sort of a tale of
two sort of phases. The first phase,
as I mentioned, was travelers from China seeded
some local transmission. We managed to contain that. But then, of course,
the disease now has spread across the
world, and it's a pandemic. And because there are now a
lot of returning residents from many countries, including
Europe, the US, and elsewhere to Singapore, we have had
a lot more imported cases compared to the initial
imported cases from China. But, of course, right now
we're a lot more efficient at detecting cases. So the time from
onset to isolation has decreased substantially. So we are able to
isolate, whether it's imported or locally identified
cases, very quickly. And our contact tracing capacity
has been ramped up many-fold. So we are constantly trying
to stay ahead of the virus by increasing our
capacity, whether it's our capacity for isolation,
a capacity for testing, capacity for contact tracing
and quarantine of contacts, and also ramping
up our health care resources to deal with cases. Most of the cases are mild. But we isolate every single case
in either hospital or community isolation facilities, which
are sort of private hospitals that we have used to manage
some of the cases, where the more severe cases would be
held in our national centers, where we are able to provide,
for example, ICU care or even beyond. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Wow. So, I mean, you're able to do
that because you don't have too many cases at one time. And you're able to get
everybody into a secure place. DR. VERNON LEE:
Indeed, that's correct. And we have also been training
our health care workers to deal with COVID-19
cases since day one. In fact, all of our
public general hospitals have negative pressure
isolation rooms and many other single
sort of isolation rooms that we can actually put
COVID-19 patients in as well. So it's not just at
the one hospital, but we are able
as a whole system to deal with quite a
number of COVID cases. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: And so have
you had a lot of transmission to health care workers
or not so much? DR. VERNON LEE: Not so much. In fact, most of our
health care workers have actually obtained--
acquired the disease either because of travel
or in the community. I mean, we have a lot
of health care workers, so health care workers are
no different from anyone in society. And so they are, of course,
liable to be infected in the community. But so far, we've
had very few cases. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN:
And how many people do contact tracing in Singapore? Like when you say you had
to scale up many times, how many people are we talking? What's the anti-coronavirus
public health force right now? DR. VERNON LEE: Sure. It is actually a whole
of government effort. So it's not just the
contact tracing teams. But we have, for
example, officers doing the quarantine operations,
phone surveillance of people on the quarantine, and others. So right now, I mean, the
force doing just the contact tracing operations numbers
into the many hundreds. And that's a huge scale
up from previously. And although we are able to
deal with the number of cases that we are seeing now, and the
number of returning travelers have decreased, so
in fact, we have been seeing a decline in number
of cases over the past few days because we're seeing
less travelers now. So our contact
tracing operations are able to handle that. But even then, we are not
resting on our laurels. We are expanding our
contact tracing efforts-- sorry, our contact tracing
resources and capabilities as we speak so that
in case there's any increase in
number of cases, we will be able to deal with it. So we are constantly looking
at expanding our capacity in anticipation of. Hopefully, we will
never get there. But if we ever get
there, we will still be able to deal with it. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: And where
do you find the extra staff to do that? DR. VERNON LEE: So we
have a lot of volunteers. Of course, this is not
the peacetime group of contact tracers. So we have been doing sort
of train-to-trainer sessions with volunteers. We have also received assistance
from our police, because they are pretty good at doing
investigations obviously, and other government agencies
as well who are coming in to support us in this effort. So it is really a whole
of government effort to ramp up our capacity. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Let me ask
you about social distancing. While you're doing this really
aggressive public health response, what was going
on in society in Singapore? DR. VERNON LEE: Yeah,
so in Singapore, we've adopted a balanced
approach, and what we call a risk-based
approach to containment that is proportionate to
the risk that we face. So we tried to stay a step
or two ahead of the virus, and tried to anticipate
what the spread might be, and to roll out some
of the measures, precautionary measures,
I would call them. But we don't go to
the extreme as well. So for example, schools
and workplaces are open. And people are going around
their business with, of course, an abundance of precaution. And we have been introducing
social distancing or physical distancing measures
over the past couple of months to try to reduce spread. So for example, at this
moment, at this point, we have suspended
events, mass gatherings. We've closed some entertainment
facilities, but not food and beverage outlets. So people can still go to the
restaurant and eat and so on. But we have limited gathering
sizes to 10 or less. So you can still get together
with your family and close friends but not in
large gatherings. We have recommended a safe
physical distance, for example, of at least 1 meter
between individuals. And the public's actually been
catching up quite quickly. If you go to, for example,
food establishments now, you can see that they have
crossed out alternate seats and have put in place
measures so that people are seated 1 meter apart. In lines at the shopping
malls or supermarkets, they have marked out sort
of markings on the ground 1 meter apart, so people
are sort of spaced out. So people are adapting
to this, and they realize that it is necessary. The other thing that we
have done a lot of as well is public education. So we think empowering the
public is very important. It's not just a sort of
government rule of law that people will follow. People want to feel
empowered that they are in charge of their own lives. And what we have communicated,
a few very simple things. Number one, good hygiene. This is respiratory
hygiene and hand hygiene to reduce transmission. Secondly, be socially
responsible to protect yourself, your loved
ones, and your friends. And that entails if
you're ill, put on a mask. Go see a doctor. Your doctor gives
you a medical leave. Please self-isolate at home. Even though it's not
necessarily COVID-19, you would reduce spread
of any respiratory disease to your family and loved one. So by doing this, and by
having the community behind us, we are, in fact, able to
keep the outbreak in control while still maintaining some
semblance of normal activity. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN:
Well, it's really a-- for places, other
parts of the world, like the United States,
where we're now, many of us, are under stay-at-home
orders, the idea that there is some future
that could look like Singapore is very appealing. But I wonder whether
you would agree that it is your public
health capacity that makes that possible. It's your ability to do
isolation and quarantine effectively that makes you
more comfortable keeping the restaurants open and
having a more open society than other places
right now because you have that very powerful
public health capacity. Would you say that's
a fair statement? DR. VERNON LEE:
Yeah, I would think that that is a fair statement. Of course, it's not just
the public of capacity. But it's like I mentioned,
our sort of whole of society being behind this whole effort. But certainly, having a
good public health system is extremely important because
we have the confidence that we are able to identify cases. We're able to ring-fence
and contain them. Well, I mean, of course we can't
identify every single case out there. I mean, we do have unlinked
cases and unknown trace of transmission. But these are kept
to a minimum, which means that I don't have a
runaway outbreak at this point with a widespread community
transmission, which allows us to do the social-distancing
measures that we've mentioned without going to any
sort of extreme measures that have its own
issues as well. I mean, extreme measures have
a lot of health, societal, and economic impact. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Right. I think we're all figuring that
out here in the United States right now. Let me ask you two
final questions. One is Singapore has now really
been seen across the world as a leader in how to
respond to this pandemic. And I know you've been doing,
from your office there, talks around the world. What's the most important
advice you're giving to people? DR. VERNON LEE: I think the top
two advice that I would say, firstly is you cannot
underestimate the virus. You always have to stay
a step or two ahead. And so we try to anticipate
what might happen over the next few
days or few weeks, and roll out measures
that are, as I mentioned, proportional to the risk that
we think we will be facing, and to get the public
behind us on those risks. I think the top two things
that I've been telling everyone is you have to build up
your public health capacity. Test, identify every
case, and ring-fence those cases and their contacts. I think if you can
do that, then you will at least have confidence
that the outbreak is not going out of control. Secondly is transparency and
communications to the public. I think the public wants
to know what's going on. And we have been providing
as much information to the public as possible in
a timely fashion, and also to empower them through
educational messages and so on. So once you have the whole
public and society behind you, then you actually
work as one unit to try to contain the virus. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN:
Very well said. My last question
is, I'm looking over your shoulder at a certain
diploma you have on the wall. And Johns Hopkins-- I
wonder whether there's anything from your student days
that have been helpful to you in this, or any inspiration
that you picked up in Baltimore that has been
helpful to you in Singapore. DR. VERNON LEE: Oh,
very much, very much so. A lot of the inspiration for me
getting to infectious diseases, epidemiology and taking
up a public health career has been shaped during
my time in Johns Hopkins. And the contacts
I've made, lessons I've learned, both
in the academic sense and in the practical
sense as well, have put me in a good
state for dealing with COVID-19 and
other challenges that I've faced in my career. And of course, the business
administration degree has also helped in managing
different stakeholders, because a lot of the
work that we do here is actually in
stakeholder management. So it's really
understanding the needs and the wants of
different stakeholders, and trying to find
a common ground so that people can come together
and work together as one. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Well,
you are absolutely making everyone in Baltimore proud. Thank you so much for
everything that you're doing. DR. VERNON LEE:
Thank you so much. And stay safe. And we hope that we will,
as a collective, sort of global effort,
be able to contain the coronavirus pandemic,
and we'll come out stronger as a global community. JOSHUA SHARFSTEIN: Thank you. Thank you for listening

He added that if community cases continue to fall, the country ""should be"" able to relax existing restrictions after Jun 13. https://cna.asia/3fBgpco

PM Lee's comments were followed by a news conference from the multi-ministry task-force outlining its strategies to reach a ""new normal"":

- Singapore will accelerate its vaccination programme, starting with students aged 12 and above. https://cna.asia/2RPjWuF
- It is looking to step up testing to respond to virus mutations: https://cna.asia/3fVAp8y
- Those who can't take Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for medical reasons will get access to alternative vaccines, including those by Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Sinopharm: https://cna.asia/3fzjf1f

cluster at tantoxin hospital and then another at changi airport more cases soon followed we also started seeing unlinked cases implying community spread so we had to step back from phase three we went on heightened alert to reduce social interaction and new infections everyone has responded to cooperate on the measures we had to take offices malls and the streets are all visibly quieter because of your support the number of daily cases has come down barring another super spreader or big cluster we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control we will know for sure in another week or so meanwhile i count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigiled please continue to stay at home work from home if possible and go out only if you must most importantly if you feel unwell see a doctor immediately even if you have been vaccinated if our situation continues to improve and the number of community cases falls further we should be able to relax the restrictions after the 13th of june compared to a year ago when we had our first big outbreak we are in a much better position today we have built up our testing and contact tracing capabilities crucially our vaccination program is well advanced with stronger defenses in place we've not had to impose a full circuit breaker unfortunately we are also fighting new more infectious variants of the covet 19 virus the b117 variant which was first detected in the uk has become widespread in the us and many other countries we are now dealing with a b16172 variant which was first detected in india and is now in over 50 countries more variants will inevitably emerge and we'll have to deal with them too what does a more infectious virus mean for our fight against covet 19 it implies that we must continually adjust our strategies and raise our game to keep corvette 19 under control specifically there are three things that we have to do more of and do faster testing contact tracing and vaccination let me briefly explain the multi-ministry task force will provide details later on first we must test faster and more liberally and extensively this will enable us to detect covet 19 cases more quickly so that we can isolate them and ring fence their contacts promptly before the virus spreads further many different types of covet 19 tests have become available for example antigen rapid tests art saliva tests breathalyzers waste water surveillance even sniffer dogs we've been using some of these and evaluating others for some time each of these new tests is suited to different use cases for example antigen rapid tests arts produce results much faster than the pcr test the polymerase chain reaction tests that we have mostly relied on arts are also cheaper and easier to administer however they are less sensitive than pcr tests and may miss some cases that are actually covet 19 positive arts are therefore invaluable as a quick check if you visit a gp or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection you will be given an art in addition to a pcr test within 30 minutes the art will show whether you are likely to have kovin 19 if the result is positive you can immediately be isolated and the pcr test will confirm your diagnosis later which may take a day or two that way we reduce your chances of infecting others if you're already ill but don't realize it other tests are coming on stream breathalyzer tests which take just one minute have been set up at the causeway and the airport they can be deployed to many other places too and soon you'll be able to purchase diy tests over the counter at pharmacies they are simple to use and not so uncomfortable you can administer these on your own if you are worried that you may have covet 19 and want to put your mind at ease or if you are a front line worker and want to test yourself frequently or even daily these alternatives to pcr tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious this will be a big help in slowing down the spread of covet 19. as the virus mutates to become more transmissible we must respond by testing more widely we already do rusted routine testing rrts in a number of higher risk settings migrant worker dormitories construction work sites shipyards air and sea ports hospitals and nursing homes with faster cheaper tests we can do routine testing at more workplaces like offices restaurants and shopping malls we can also routinely test individuals whose occupations involve close contact with many people and could result in super spreading events like taxi drivers and bus captains physiotherapists and missers stage performers sports and fitness instructors and educators all could be tested regularly this will reassure their customers patients and students and enable them to work safely even with covet 19 in circulation in short we are shifting our approach to testing henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up we will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well in normal work or social or community settings to make them and these places safe extensive testing will give us confidence to resume larger scale events or gatherings for example we can deploy fast and easy tests before religious service a football game a concert or a wedding reception and participants can be assured that the event is covet 19 safe therefore you should expect routine large-scale fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal second we will contact trace faster and more widely our contact tracing operations have vastly improved the contact traces are working faster and better because they have more experience and skills and better tools traced together helps them identify and quarantine close contacts of an infected case within hours rather than days with safe entry they can identify thousands of people who had visited the same places as infected cases and inform all these potential contacts to come forward for a free covet 19 test this is what we did for white sands gem west gate and now ntuc food fair in anchorvale because of singaporean self-discipline public spirit and support of trace together and safe entry we are contact tracing faster and more comprehensively we can improve our contact tracing further by casting the net wider our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household therefore in future when we identify a close contact of an infected case we will not only isolate him himself the first degree contact and test him for covet 19. we will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately without waiting to see whether the first degree contact tests positive if later the first degree contact test negative we can safely release his household members from isolation but if later the first degree contact test positive we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier this more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly and with fewer cases [Applause] third we will vaccinate more people and faster we've made good progress since vaccinations started in december our healthcare and frontline workers and the majority of those 45 and above have already received at least their first dose these are the ones more at risk from covet 19. now vaccination of those age 40 to 44 is underway the mtf recently announced that we would speed up vaccinations in the next two months and prioritize first those vaccinations this is in progress we want to protect as many singaporeans as possible as soon as we can especially with a new kovit 19 variants this approach will quickly provide the maximum number of people with good protection instead of a good number of people with maximum protection we are vaccinating as many people as our supplies allow our 40 vaccination centers island-wide are running smoothly the constraint is vaccine supply this is why we've been working very hard to confirm and speed up deliveries of vaccines from our suppliers i'm happy to report that since the last update by the mtf we've received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months with the latest supply schedule we can further boost our vaccination program we can offer the vaccine to everyone even sooner than we expected the next group to be vaccinated will be students in this latest outbreak we've seen more cases of children getting infected in schools and tuition centers the children were not seriously ill but parents are naturally worried therefore we will take full advantage of the june holidays to vaccinate students bookings will open tomorrow we will give priority to the graduating cohorts for o n and a levels as well as special needs students then the other students 12 years and above will take their turn including students in our institutions of higher learning after the students we will vaccinate the final remaining group young adults 39 years and younger this should start around mid-june this group is quite large therefore we will give the singaporeans among them a two-week priority window to book your appointments first before we open up generally to the rest who want to be vaccinated finally i want to make a special pitch to our elderly your response has been excellent nearly three-quarters of our elderly 760 000 senior citizens aged 60 and above have had at least one jab or booked a slot already but 280 000 of you have still not yet booked appointments please come forward to get jab as soon as possible most people of your age have already been vaccinated including many of your friends and neighbors the president and i have been vaccinated too and so have all my cabinet colleagues the vaccines are safe and they will keep you safe we will make the process even more convenient for you if you are above 60 you can now walk into any vaccination center and get vaccinated on the spot no need to register no need to book in advance just turn up at the vaccination center and you will be jammed if you are not mobile or unable to make your way to the vaccination center contact the silver generation office a doctor and nurse will visit you at your home to give you the vaccination for those with elderly parents or relatives please encourage and persuade your old folks to get vaccinated today nearly four in 10 residents have had at least one dose of the vaccine our next target is to get two-thirds of residents vaccinated with at least the first dose with our accelerated vaccination program we should be able to do this by early july provided supplies come in as planned and everyone who is eligible for a vaccination and wants one should be able to get at least their first jab by national day whether you're old or young please come forward to be vaccinated once it's your turn with a more infectious virus strains we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity or get close to it this is the way to make everyone safe and resume more normal activities even as we tackle our covet 19 situation the pandemic rages on around us many countries are still not able to bring it under control fully much less eliminated india has suffered a huge surge of new cases although their numbers are now coming down in southeast asia many countries have not started vaccinations in a big way and may see more spikes in the next few months malaysian cases have been rising and they are just entering a nationwide full lockdown even places that have kept covet 19 well under control like taiwan australia and vietnam have recently experienced outbreaks one day this global pandemic will subside but i do not expect covet 19 to disappear it will remain with humankind and become endemic the virus will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come this also means we will see small outbreaks of the disease from time to time in singapore as well in this new normal we'll have to learn to carry on with our lives even with a virus in our midst our aim must be to keep the community as a whole safe while accepting that some people may get infected every now and then just as we do with a common flu or dengue fever which we now manage through public health measures and personal precautions [Applause] and in the case of the flu with regular vaccinations too covert 19 vaccinations will not entirely prevent you from getting kobit 19 but the vaccinations make this much less likely and if you do get sick despite being vaccinated you are also much less likely to become very ill living with endemic covet 19 also means we don't completely close our borders we need food essential supplies workers business and other travelers to keep on flowing we must stay connected to the world with effective safeguards and border restrictions to keep ourselves safe we will not be able to prevent some infected persons from slipping through from time to time but as long as our population is mostly vaccinated we should be able to trace isolate and treat the cases that pop up and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak singapore's priority is to get through this pandemic and position ourselves strongly for the future even as the virus continues to rage around us if we stay united and continue to work together we'll be able to progressively open up and achieve our aim in the new normal covet 19 will not dominate our lives our people will be mostly vaccinated and possibly taking booster shots every year we will get tested often but it will be fast and easy we'll go to work or school meet friends and family participate in religious services and enjoy entertainment and sports events we will reopen our borders safely visitors will again come to singapore singaporeans will travel again to countries where the disease is well under control especially if we have been vaccinated and eventually we will even go about without masks again at least outdoors right now we are some ways off from this happy state but we are heading in the right direction in this new normal the countries which are united disciplined and put in place sensible safeguards will be able to reopen their economies reconnect to the rest of the world grow and prosper singapore will be among these countries more confident and resilient than before and toughened by what we have overcome together and experienced together as one nation i have outlined our strategy for the next phase of the fight against covet 19. to keep our people safe while reopening progressively we have to test we have to trace we have to vaccinate and we have to do all three of these more quickly and more extensively the heightened alert has two more weeks to go i thank singaporeans for your forbearance cooperation and support each individual effort counts our collective discipline and social responsibility have served us well and taken us thus far let us go the distance together as one people so that we can look forward to a new normal and emerge as a stronger and more united singapore thank you good afternoon good afternoon to all prime minister lee shin long has just outlined our strategy over the next few months in the battle against kovite 19. with the support of all singaporeans we have made progress in rolling out vaccination program expanding our testing capacity and enhance our contact tracing capability but the next few months will be critical we are in a race with a virus the virus will attempt to spread wider and faster and therefore we need to do more and do faster too in vaccination testing and contact tracing minister ong yikang will talk about accelerating vaccination and expanding testing capacity while minister chan chen singh will focus specifically on vaccination for the education sector overall the kovi 19 situation remains extremely fluid malaysia has just announced that they will be implementing a full movement control order phase one for two weeks starting from tomorrow we are working with malaysia to ensure continued flow of essential supplies between our two countries i visited fairprice and ych over the weekend to better understand the measures that have been put in place to ensure that there is sufficient food in essential supplies for all we have been working closely with the relevant agencies and companies to build up our existing stock further diversify our sources of food and essential items while also increasing local production i want to assure everyone that we have ample supply of food and essential items but please remember to only buy what you need our economic agencies are also working with companies especially those dealing with essential goods and services to minimize disruption to their supply lines as the pandemic continues to evolve globally we must remain prepared and vigilant as a nation while staying flexible and adaptable it has been two weeks since phase two heightened alert the overall impact on singapore's gdp is expected to be modest the impact of the measures will differ across different sectors domestic consumer oriented sectors such as food and beverage services retail and land transport will see a greater impact on the other hand the impact of these measures on outward-oriented sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and finance and insurance is likely to be less severe last friday minister lawrence wong announced various support measures for business segments that have been significantly affected by these measures mti and the economic agencies are reaching out to the various companies as well as the trade associations to continue to work with them and to continue to monitor the situation even as we do our best to manage the situation at hand mti will continue to give businesses our full support to help them transform and seize new opportunities when they arise and now let me say a few words in mandarin gangs will talk about vaccination and testing thank you thank you kim yong and hello everybody it's been slightly over two weeks since we started the phase two heightened alert posture on the 16th of may so that is slightly over uh one infection cycle moh has been monitoring the data and the epidemic situation in singapore so let me give some updates on how well we have been doing under this phase so let me share with you some insights by dividing the past 14 days into two halves the first seven days which is um 17th to 23rd may and then the next seven days which is 24th to 30th may top line numbers first seven days we have 182 cases the next seven days we have 136 cases so the number of infections have fallen by some each day's number when we read the papers the daily numbers it can actually be broken out into three subsets the first is those who are linked to a cluster and already quarantined this group we are not very worried because they are quarantined they were in quarantine when they were discovered they were detected which means there was no chance for them to move around and infect others next group is those who are linked to a cluster but not quarantined so for example when we did special ops for westgate and jam we tested many people who visited the malls and then they were infected but they were not quarantined it could be because they didn't come into very close contact with an infected person but it was enough to get infected so this is a group slightly more worried but they are linked finally the third group the unlinked and this is the most worrying group because unlinked cases means they are quietly transmitting the virus in the community and the fewer there are unlinked cases the better so for the first seven days i talked about 57 of all cases are linked and quarantined this is the group we're least worried about 21 percent are linked but not quarantined and 22 are unlinked so 57 21 22 in descending order of worry for the last seven days the breakdown is 57 25 18. so unlinked cases have come down from 22 of all cases to 18 in absolute numbers it has also fallen 39 to 25. so the more we can shift this number away to link cases or better still linked and quarantined cases the lesser will be and the more we can bring the overall number down and suppress this wave of transmission in addition to this there are a few encouraging signs with how we are handling the current wave one is close to seventy percent of all linked new cases every day are due to household transmissions i mean they are transmitted within the households and not out in the community and for those who are transmitted in the community they are not due to dramatic movements like parties or whatever but usually the the movement patterns are quite mundane home work taobao food you know grocery shopping and so on and thirdly other than the gem westgate cluster there were no major transmission settings over the last 10 days so all in all we are nudging in the right direction but just nudging no and controlling the situation and we are constantly improving our contact tracing and quarantine protocols but this wave of infection is not over and we must continue to stay alert and vigilant in order to suppress it further and one major strategy to do so is testing which the prime minister just spoke about uh in his broadcast because the testing is essential for us to quickly detect and isolate those who have been infected when we detect a cluster we carry out mass surveillance testing of persons with possible exposure to the infected cases and in the past month we conducted close to 40 special operations across the island targeting housing blocks supermarkets malls the seaport the airport so on schools as well so in the second half of may we conducted on average 55 000 pcr tests a day or more than pcr and art tests a day let me repeat that so in the second half of may we conducted on average over 55 000 pcr and art tests per day all that translates into more than 76 500 individuals tested per day and we will continue to step up the number of tests and one change that we are implementing is what the prime minister spoke about fast and easy test strategy so moving forward we will extensively roll out fast and easy test and that will complement our current pcr tests and there are different types of fast and easy tests each with their own pros and cons one that we are familiar with is the art antigen rapid tests it takes about half an hour uh involve solving that is not so difficult just around the nose drills uh costs as low as 10 10 per test deployment is very flexible because it's a handheld device and can be on mess with many people swapping at the same time so we have wrote out art to almost all our public health preparedness clinics that is providing the swap and send home service all our polytechnics and we want to expand the capacity shortly and deploy them also to private gps we are also exploring self test art and you can purchase them in pharmacies and perform the tests at home by yourself so it works almost like a pregnancy test kit and you can do so before you go to work and that way it is even more flexible in terms of deployment thirdly is the are the breathalyzer tests now toolkits developed by nus and ntu respectively have received in-principle approval by moh and the health services authority the test takes a minute no sobbing you just blow into a mouthpiece or into a cartridge and so turn around times is fast so it's very fast and easier to test an art but it involves some equipment yeah and so it's not as deployable as the art which is very very agile so depend on the cost the flexibility the throughput the turnaround time we will deploy the most suitable test for the right settings a few pilots are ongoing or about to commence for example art has been deployed at psa and also selected dormitories for foreign workers and over and above the current rostered routine testing the causeway and the airport have adopted breathalyzers so in the coming days or coming couple of weeks we will implement many more pilots using fast and easy test kits for certain group of workers for certain premises for certain events so group of workers they can be cleaners they can be fmb workers front line workers for premises we can look at for example hostels in universities we can look at hospitals we can look at malls and for events we can look at say weddings or conferences or religious gatherings all these will be rolled out and then spread to even more users next i'd like to talk about our vaccination program we have just crossed 4 million doses mark in all over 2.2 million individuals in our population have been vaccinated with at least the first dose of covet 19 vaccine vaccine reduces the chance of being infected and more importantly reduces the chance of being severely ill if you are infected with covet 19. i've given some data earlier about our local experience let me give an update today of all local covet 19 cases since the 11th of april 8 of unvaccinated individuals developed serious disease requiring requiring supplemental oxygen amongst the vaccinated the number is one out of 93 with severe illness requiring supplemental oxygen so that is slightly over one percent and that patient is was ill even before infection so this is not a full-scale empirical study but as more data become available the benefits of vaccination becomes clearer in terms of protection for the individual prime minister outlined how we will boost our vaccination program in the next couple of months uh chun singh will be talking about the exercise for the 400 000 students in a short while beyond that we can now be more inclusive in administering vaccinations since the start of the vaccination exercise a few sub groups have not been included mostly because of medical reasons the expert committee on covet 19 vaccination our ec 19v they have reviewed the global and local data relating to these subgroups and is satisfied that vaccination is safe and efficacious for many of these subgroups who are they number one pregnant women number two breastfeeding women number three cancer patients on treatment but before they receive their vaccinations they ought to consult their doctors and receive the vaccination in a hospital setting number four persons with severe cutaneous adverse reactions the current restrictions for these sub-groups will be lifted from 4th of june 2021 so based on the roll out schedule for the various groups if you belong to this subgroup and your age group has the turn for your age group has started you may register for vaccinations last important point on vaccination very important point is that the expert committee is also examining the data and reviewing the current policy where we restrict individuals with known anaphylaxis to take the vaccine specifically the committee is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mrna vaccine or its components but other substances like seafood painkiller antibiotics the review will take about two weeks with the intention of removing these restrictions and allowing more individuals in this group to be eligible for vaccination and this is quite a sizable group of over 30 000 individuals so the lifting of these restrictions will be a fairly meaningful one director for medical services associate professors kenneth mark will speak more about this in a short while finally i want to talk about the special access route moh has authorized two vaccines as everyone knows the pfizer biotech vaccine and the moderna vaccine and these are these two vaccines are also used in our national vaccination program and they are vaccines used in other countries but either there have been no applications to use those vaccines in singapore or the application is outstanding with data still pending these vaccines can be useful for individuals who are unable to take the pfizer biotech vaccine or the modern vaccine due to medical reasons as i mentioned earlier it's not a small group over 30 000 individuals so the review by the expert committee to allow more people with a history of anaphylaxis to take this two mrna vaccine will address a large part of the current concern nevertheless to provide more flexibility hsa will open up the special access routes under the therapeutic products regulations and this is an existing avenue to import and supply unregistered medicines to address medical needs in unique or special circumstances and this is for limited duration and only during a pandemic under this route hsa will take reference the vaccines that the world health organization approve to include in its eul or emergency use list once a vaccine is included in the eul a private licensed healthcare institution can bring it in to administer to individuals in singapore the vaccines currently under the eul includes pfizer biontech moderna johnson and johnson astrazeneca and sino farm as and when the who approves the sinovac vaccine into its emergency use list the licensed healthcare institute institution can apply to moh to draw on our existing stock of 200 000 doses to administer to those who wish to have it now let me hand over the flow to dms kenneth mark thank you very much minister to now we've had a vaccination program going on quite smoothly and uh ministers announced that we've vaccinated just over 4 million doses being given out and a total number of persons vaccinated being over 2.2 million this is nearly 40 percent of our population our vaccination centers make good progress in vaccinating eligible singaporeans since we started at the end of december 2020 and about 73 percent of the elderly over 60 years of age have booked their appointments or received their vaccinations the majority of frontline workers have also received their vaccinations amongst eligible healthcare workers more than 87 percent have booked or received their vaccinations and the proportion of essential workers in other sectors receiving their vaccinations is also high we've been working closely with the health sciences authority and the expert committee on covet 19 vaccination to review the eligibility criteria for vaccinations and i'm pleased to share that moha is satisfied that the kovit-19 vaccinations are safe and vacations for most people for more people with health needs and we are issuing an updated guidance today which allows vaccinations to be given to the categories that minister ong has mentioned and in particular patients who had previously experienced severe cutaneous adverse reactions or severe skin allergic reactions to medications other than the mrna vaccines or components of those vaccines can now receive vaccination and this will include specific medical conditions like stephen johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis these are very severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications and if you had previously had such a severe allergic reaction to medications like antibiotics you will now be eligible to receive your 19 vaccination secondly women who are pregnant may receive vaccination after they discuss and receive endorsement from their obstetrician and this applies irrespective of the stage of pregnancy also if a woman had become pregnant after receiving her first vaccine dose she may proceed with a second vaccination after discussion with her obstetrician women who are breastfeeding are eligible for vaccination they can continue to breastfeed their baby throughout the period for first and second dose vaccinations and there is no need to stop breastfeeding for patients with active cancer and are undergoing chemotherapy immunotherapy or radiation therapy presently or recently in the past three months we had previously exercised considerable caution and advised that they complete the treatment before getting vaccinated we have since reviewed the data and experience in other countries and will now allow them to get vaccinated after they are assessed by their treating doctors on their suitability for vaccination at this time we prefer for these patients to be vaccinated in a hospital setting where they can be better monitored for their health status and we will review later whether these conditions can be revised patients who are soon to start chemotherapy immunotherapy or radiation therapy in the next two months should similarly consult their oncologist for their suitability for vaccination but patients with a past history of cancer and who are no longer on active treatment can apply for vaccination in any of our vaccination centers we hope that these adjustments or guidance will offer vaccination opportunities for more people and allow them to benefit from the enhanced immune protection that vaccination offers as we see more cases arising the community and with the emergence of more cases due to viral variants of concern at our last media conference we had announced that the health sciences authority had extended the authorization of the pfizer bioentec cov19 vaccine for use in adolescents between the age of 12 and 16 years the vaccination regime for these within this age group is the same as that for adults the approval under hsa's psa approval framework has also been endorsed by mohs expert committee on covit 19 vaccination which also looked very closely at the data for safety and efficacy of the vaccine the data available for review was very similar to that submitted to other regulatory authorities in the u.s and other countries and was based on the ongoing phase 3 studies that involved nearly 2 300 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 16 years of age and there was a very high vaccine efficacy shown in the vaccinated group with no coven-19 infections being reported in this group compared to 16 cases of infection in the unvaccinated control group and this is a result that was consistent with the results reported in the adult vaccinated population as in adults vaccination offers a good protection for children of 12 to 16 years of age protecting them from getting infected but may not prevent all infections but the data provides great confidence that those who are vaccinated will be protected from getting severe infections vaccinating children also carries the secondary benefit of reducing the risk that others within the same household will be exposed and infected with covet-19 infection the safety analysis from the study also showed that within a period of follow-up which was at least two months for many of the adolescents in the study adverse effects were not common and were generally mild in fact the safety profile was very similar to other vaccines that are normally offered to children children generally have a stronger immune system compared to adults and they may experience a slightly higher incidence of minor effects like fever injection site pain tiredness and headaches compared to adults and this is a common phenomenon for children from all types of vaccines that they receive not just the fisa vaccine these reactions will resolve within an average of one to two days in fact these reactions demonstrate that their immune system is functioning well and responding to the vaccines there have been very isolated reports a report of adolescents with a known history of depression who reported their symptoms worsening after their vaccination but there is insufficient data to assess whether this is due to the vaccine or not nonetheless we recommend that children with a history of depression or anxiety should first be assessed by their doctors and assured that the condition is stable and under control before they go for vaccination they have been isolated reports of myocarditis being reported following covet 19 vaccination myocarditis is a condition characterized by an inflammation of the heart muscles it's been reported in patients with head covite 19 infection not just vaccination and it can occur due to a variety of causes unrelated to covate-19 infection or vaccination and so far the number of cases reported does not appear to be more common than what is generally present in the unvaccinated children population we are monitoring this trend closely and we'll see if our vaccination strategies need to be adjusted over time as more data emerges but at this time based on the overwhelming assessed benefit of vaccination over the risks that have been reported hsa the expert committee on covet 19 vaccinations and moh remain confident that the kofi 19 vaccination can be offered to our children between the ages of 12 and 16 years this is the same position adopted by other countries like the us in fact in the u.s since approval had been granted by the fda there have been more than 6 million adolescents vaccinated between the ages of 12 and 18 years so we'll be watching very closely the experience of others in the u.s in israel and they will guide our policy even as we start our own program to offer vaccination to our school children thank you jin singh over to you good afternoon everyone the well-being of our students and educators are foremost to the confidence of our parents in our school moe's intention is to have as many of our eligible students vaccinated as soon as possible when vaccines are available to achieve this we will organize the vaccination program for more than 400 000 students with the following considerations first we will leverage on the network of community vaccination centers across the island for ease of booking during the june holidays second we will have four additional vaccination centers by the 7th of june three of them in our ites and one additional one at reference convention center kindly offered to us by moh to provide greater assurance to our students for the access to the vaccines these four additional vaccine centers are geographically spread out across the island to provide added convenience to our students and parents third for students who require greater support and are unable to get vaccinated through their parents booking our schools will arrange for them to get vaccinated when school reopens we will commence the invitation to vaccinate with the graduating cohorts of o n and a level students tomorrow 1st of june with the earliest slots available from the 3rd of june we will also work with moh and our spat schools to facilitate the vaccination of our spat school students in situ so there's no need for them to go to the vaccination center separately as the three dedicated moe vaccination centers are located on the ite campuses ite will also make arrangements for their students to take their vaccinations on campus the rest of the eligible school cohorts polytechnic students and autonomous university students will be progressively invited to make their bookings in the coming days all medically eligible individuals are encouraged to consider getting vaccinated when the vaccination is offered to them and would like to thank all parents for working closely with our educators at schools to keep our children safe now let me say a couple of words in mandarin [Music] good evening as you can see from the daily cases so far our measures are working and bearing fruit but we are not out of the woods yet if all goes well we should be able to bring down community cases over time and break the transmission chain but meanwhile there are still unlinked cases popping up every day and any one such case can easily be a super spreader and cause a major outbreak to happen i go back to the metaphor that we had used last year of a fire we are taking steps to contain the fire and to minimize its spread but the embers of the fire are still out there and they can easily spark another major flare-up so the situation is highly fluid and our assessments are being updated on a daily basis as much as there is a chance of us relaxing some of the measures after 13th of june if things continue to improve or we must also be mentally prepared that we cannot rule out the possibility of further restrictions down the road if they become necessary for example from the recent cases we are now studying if there is any common pattern of activity or movement that might suggest new areas of risk to watch out for and which would require additional precautions or safeguards at the same time if there are specific venues where we find people gathering or consistent breaches of safe management measures then we will have to take actions to close these venues so that's the overall posture we will be taking over the coming weeks in addition to all the steps that have been highlighted just now which is to ramp up testing speed up comprehensive contact tracing and scale up our national vaccination program meanwhile i want to thank everyone in singapore for doing your part to help curb the spread of the virus all of you have demonstrated tremendous discipline and social responsibility over the past two to three weeks so thank you very much for this tremendous response we've done well so far but this is not the time to relax or to let our guard down in fact it is absolutely critical that we continue to stay home and to work from home wherever possible go out only for essential activities and minimize our daily contacts if you feel unwell see a doctor immediately if we all continue to do that then we will be able to bring down community cases further and bring this current outbreak under control thank you very much thank you i now have i invite questions from the media thank you ministers and dms the time is now 501 pm we have until 5 30 pm for the question and answer session could we have the first question from st salma please thank you ministers dms children remain less severely affected by kobit 19 than most adults if should they get infected so it seems rather unfair to give them priority over people who are in their 20s and 30s possibly with the exception of students during the national level exams this year in fact if anything i would say domestic workers looking after the real elderly should be given a priority because they go out and do the marketing they come back and they possibly could bring the bug back to people who are at the greatest risk okay there are too many ministers that can answer that question i'll go first i i think selma their points are well taken um on the other hand students also live amongst households and often three generation families do they can also come into contact with the elderly and they also go to schools they do mix around with other students and for the older students in ihls they also have a campus life so i think um given the new strain that we are facing and the the priorities that we are then and the fact that we have gone out to vaccinate the most vulnerable groups plus the front line which is most exposed to the virus i think for the rest in terms of public health and i think dms can elaborate on that in terms of public health i think the differentiation are no longer so big and so for students given school life given their proximity to household members including the elderly we felt that it is appropriate to start our next phase of exercise prioritizing students and in any case i think we are looking at beginning of june to middle around middle of june when we extend to the next group of young adults thank you minister could we have the next question from taobao ka yang please thank you ministers at dms okay i'm from sao paulo here um if we come you should block 745 which will start testing tomorrow there are three blocks of flats with all residents tested since this new wave of infection hitlers would any indication of within block transmission for the first two blocks under what circumstances do we mandate all residents from the whole block to be tested and is this what we anticipate as a new normal thank you thank you very much for the question uh with each case that occurs uh in the domestic setting and when we start picking up clusters we do uh identify look to see whether there are obvious chains of transmission modes of transmission they are of concern and when we pick up several cases that occur within a fixed geographic vicinity then we have to be concerned that there may be also chains of transmission that occur to other people that live in that same area and this is the reason why we would then extend and carry out testing operations in this case in a housing precinct involving several blocks of flats we reinforce our testing by looking at other data as well as has previously been explained that we do look at various other testing modalities including wastewater testing and where waste water testing shows signals that may suggest still shedding of virus that comes out in the wastewater it raises concerns that we may still be seeing some additional people who may be asymptomatic but carrying the virus infected and potentially infectious to others and this creates an urgency for us to launch these testing operations including the the example you have mentioned earlier so we look at each cluster on a case-by-case basis looking at the circumstances and making that decision whether we want to organize these testing operations they're not easy to do but it's important for us to do this aggressively in order to get ahead of the curve and to try and make sure we we get control to prevent further infection occurring to others in the community thank you dms could we take the next question from cna sirhuay please yes away from cna i just want to ask about updates to the vaccination program especially on the special excess route there will be open access to other vaccines do we know which vaccines are on it and how would this move allowing other vaccines actually affect the national vaccination exercise thank you sufi um as i mentioned earlier the special access route is is a existing avenue um and what we are thinking reference on is the wh o emergency use list yeah so if a vaccine is approved by who to be in the eul we will allow a private healthcare provider to apply to moh and bring in that vaccine to be given to our to individuals in our population and right now there are only a handful of vaccines in the w h o u u l as i mentioned earlier is a pfizer biontec moderna the two which we are using for national vaccination program in addition there is jnj johnson and johnson cynofarm and then extrazenica yeah so of course there are many other applications before who now one of which is cynote the sinovax vaccine if who approves the synovic vaccine into the eul then a healthcare provider can apply to have access to use the 200 000 doses that we have and then use it to administer to individuals in our population who wants to have it having said that i i was mentioning earlier that a large part of that group that that one's alternate vaccine is because thus far because of their history or anaphylaxis they were restricted from taking the two national vaccination vaccines yeah but the expert committee is reviewing our current position they need another two weeks or so to come to a new position with a view to allow many in this group to have access to our current two national program vaccines pfizer biontech as well as moderna so i hope this move in the coming two weeks will largely address the current concern just to extend on the minister's comments uh the ministry of health as well as the expert committees continue to look out uh for other promising vaccines that we may also bring into singapore uh our approach is to uh provide a portfolio of different vaccines that meet our needs and we do understand that there are individuals who are not able to receive the mrna vaccine even with a relaxation of rules and we look towards procuring some of these vaccines that then can also receive hsa's pisa approval so we hope to present more alternatives to the population that allows a greater confidence in being able to take on vaccination and and to allow them to be protected thank you minister and dms could we get the next question from channel 8 tsungi please you are muted sorry hi ministers and dms this is johnny from channel 8 news uh we would like to clarify currently priority is given to students sitting for n o or a level exam so what about psle students thank you certainly thank you for your question the psle students will be notified together with the sec 1 2 and 3 batch when we next rolled up the program but i must explain that we go by age so only the students in p6 who are 12 years old and older will be eligible to take the pfizer vaccine thank you minister could we get the next question from bbc nicholas please hello everyone um it's very likely we're going to see a scenario even possibly this year where singapore is fully vaccinated where almost everyone has a very high level of protection from the virus but singapore's neighbours countries here in the region are still way behind my question is uh will singapore have to wait for everybody else in the region to catch up with their vaccination programs before opening up or will singaporeans be allowed to travel freely in any case knowing that they're very well protected well we have always taken a risk-based approach towards this so if you look at our border measures we already differentiate countries by risk and based on the infection levels in these countries so if a country is safe we already allow singaporeans to go there and come back without any quarantine in singapore and we even allow travelers from these places to come to singapore without quarantine on the other hand if a country is not so safe there are high incidence rates that's prevalent in these places then we have tighter border control measures where traveler coming in will have to serve a quarantine in a dedicated facility so we will continue with that approach in the coming months and you know if we con as we monitor the situation if more countries become safe infection rates come down vaccination rates are high then potentially we will be able to open up more with these places on the other hand if there are places where the you know incidence rates will remain high and and there are concerns there are high risk areas then the border measures will remain and the quarantine measures will remain can i just add to that i think our our desire is probably similar to yours which is that if we are well vaccinated if singapore is safe individually we are quite well protected of course we hope singaporeans can gain the freedom to travel especially business travel going overseas visit your your relatives they are living overseas or family members living overseas or look after the investments that's been overseas and then be able to return without serving 21 days shn which basically you will forget it nobody will travel that way so of course we hope to resume that normalcy but i think the truth is we don't have enough data to see whether to decide whether lifting all those restrictions is possible as of now but certainly we are heading in the right direction if we can get ourselves substantially vaccinated protected certainly travel restrictions will have to be reviewed with a view to restore our ability to travel and become a business hub thank you ministers could we get the next question from reuters chenlen please uh go evening ministers saw on allowing private sector to supply copyrighting vaccines does that mean that non-residents such as tourists will be able to get a copy 19 vaccine in singapore and is there any pricing guidelines for the copyright investing nations via the private clinics thank you thank you for the first question our priority now is still to vaccinate our own population yeah so it's still for residents even for the sar route is primarily primarily targeted at residents second in terms of pricing you are right because it becomes a private initiative under the sar route pricing will have to be determined by the private health care provider that apply to moh thank you minister could we have the next question from rita haryan attia please hi ministers um i'll just like to get your opinion on what are the risks in having the art testing kids over the counter because you know you might have individuals who already test themselves and probably they do not want to go back to the doctor for a second check or things like that i mean what could be the risk for for for such i mean they are really good but what can be the risk for this thank you thank you very much for your question uh we are actually working out uh a a set of uh instructions and guidance that will accompany these uh test kits once they're made available in in the pharmacy so for example and they will explain not just how the test is to be done how to perform a swap for the for the purpose of administrating the test but also the the circumstances where the test is appropriate so for example if you are sick you actually have symptoms uh you should actually see a doctor get that properly assessed and get the best tests done to diagnose or exclude the presence of a covet-19 infection and the antigen rapid test would not be appropriate for either making that diagnosis or excluding in that particular setting if you are asymptomatic and this was done really for screening purposes as minister had mentioned previously then the antigen rapid test may be suitable however you need to be careful about how you interpret these tests because they are not as accurate as pcr tests and therefore a positive test on an antigen rapid test kit needs to be confirmed and we still recommend that you see a doctor for proper confirmatory tests to be done it will be one negative we would recommend that you not be complacent and you should still adopt the precautions including mask wearing hand hygiene infection control safe distancing which would then protect you because you never know whether you're still in an equation period and the following day you might actually become infected and turn positive and it's important to to appreciate and interpret the results in the correct setting so these uh sort of faqs will be provided when these test kits are purchased and we will provide relevant additional information on our website so as to better educate the public and for them to be able to understand how to use these kits and how to understand the significance of these test results let me just add a few words i think the use case is important i mentioned earlier that we are rolling out many pilots and the pilots really used to nail down the use case and the settings so take for example self test art really we need to find the use case and it could be say an employer could be could be sbh or media corp and you hire journalists who are front line workers who meet many people and therefore you may have a protocol for the company and the employer to say all my employees every week you can purchase a self-test kit test yourself just to make sure that you are safe so it becomes part and parcel of a surveillance program under a controlled use case facilitated by employer for example so the pilots that we are rolling out in the coming days are very important to really nail down the proper use of each of these kits thank you minister ndms could we have the next question from today janice please good evening thanks for taking my question um on the new um requirement for those who are household members of close contact uh to be placed under quarantine um i just want to ask whether um how are authorities going to enforce this will they be left to uh individuals to self-manage because you are mentioned self isolate right or um you know basically how will uh our authorities make sure that people actually abide by this new requirement thank you thank you very much for the question uh we're working through all the processes the intent really is to make sure we get ahead of the game we understand that when close contacts spend quite a considerable amount of time with a person who eventually is found to be positive there's very high chance that these contacts can be positive and in order to be able to get ahead of the game then then we ask that these whole household members also self-isolate as a precaution until we can clear the uh the context and be assured that these contacts are also not themselves infected we will do this in a variety of ways uh once we get information in in terms of who the household members are we may uh send sms's uh contact these household members ourselves uh to inform them that they are identified as context of context and our and they should they should isolate we may follow through subsequently with quarantine orders for this purpose and only when we clear the context from being infected then we rescind the the orders and allow household members then to come out at this point in time the thinking is that they can isolate at home but it would also depend on the household situation to determine whether it is feasible and possible to self-isolate at home we asked the public to cooperate with us this is done with the the best of intent to make sure that we uh control infection quickly decisively and it's not intended as a means of trying to stifle the freedom of household members to move around and this is really for the benefit of all others in the community if i may just add a few words remember these are the second order contacts they are not the closed contacts they are the household members of these closed contacts second order but we have found from experience that because the new variant strain is so infectious that it tends to circulate very quickly amongst household members and that's why as this as an additional precaution we are now asking all household members of closed contacts when your household member is put under quarantine we will notify you immediately to stay at home just as an additional precaution until we confirm the test result of the person under quarantine we again call on everyone just cooperate with this simple but i think it will be a highly effective measure because it will ensure that if you are already infected but you don't you may not know because it's still incubating and or you may not have symptoms but by staying at home you can ensure that the virus does not go out it does not spread to more people so it's a precaution that we are putting in place it's an additional measure we think it will help and we seek everyone's cooperation to comply with the rules let me just come in with one more sentence which is a data point that i mentioned just now today of all the link cases 70 70 uh household transmission so i think this is a worthwhile measure to take thank you ministers and dms we will now take the last question from tamil marasu into please with this new label of endemic uh we understand that this virus is expected to be around for a while uh given that the new virus spreads faster is there a possibility that we may see another spike and how far should the number of cases fall before measures are relaxed and are there any traces of the new virus from vietnam the well we will continue to monitor the situation as as i've highlighted just now it's very fluid if all goes well we already see the reproduction number of this virus in this latest outbreak coming below one which means that day to day week by week there will be a chance of cases coming down further and we will continue to monitor unlinked cases cryptic whether or not there's a sense from our surveillance of the extent of community spread and if all goes to plan there may be a chance as we have highlighted on 13th of june for some adjustment and relaxation of measures it's very unlikely on 13th of june that we will go all the way back to phase three we will have to do this gradually and in a controlled manner so there is some chance of relaxation but in a controlled and calibrated manner on the other hand if we monitor over time and there is a risk of or we see new risk emerging new clusters emerging more unlinked cases which we are not able to track down and pin down then it may suggest that this is continuing a little bit more than we are comfortable with and therefore we may have to take additional restrictions or precautions and safeguards based on the data so it's really uh you know we are updating our assessments on a day-to-day basis and we are continuing to monitor this very carefully recognizing that this new strain is highly infectious and we have to continue to do everything we can to bring down the latest cluster at the latest outbreak you asked also about the recent report about a new viral variant of interest being identified in vietnam to put this into perspective this was uh what the vietnam's national institute of hygiene and epidemiology had uh had uh discovered uh when they were testing four cases uh in vietnam and they described a particular deletion of a particular gene that codes for a particular part of the spike protein uh on the b16172 variant which was also uh reported previously in the b117 variant they have not as yet up to the weekend registered this information with the global registry that we that we use to track all these emerging viral variants so until it's actually registered with a g site uh we we don't have enough information to tell what kind of uh um specific variant of interest this is i should point out that even in the b16172 variant there are in fact sub variants that exist because the the virus does continue to evolve and some mutations will continue to take place and they have been previously described some local mutations that in fact are also seen within the b117 variant who exercise encourage uh has asked us to ask all countries to exercise caution in interpreting these results because at this time it the presence of such a deletion is not it's not known to be associated with any increased virulence increased transmissibility increased infectivity so we wait more information before we can actually tell whether this particular viral variant would become a variant of concern until we get formal information through the global registry we won't be able to tell whether this particular variant is also seen in any of our cases but we've not seen any particular particular deletion in the in the same area which was described by the vietnamese we'll wait for further information before we can be absolutely certain let me just wrap up very quickly we are two weeks into the phase two of a heightened alert next few months are very critical and as we plan and move forward and hope that we can slowly open up and it is very important to bear in mind that it's not just depending on the number of cases and the minister wong has mentioned that you also have to look at whether it's linked or unlinked but beyond that it is also important for us to look at our capability and capacity of testing and contact tracing as well as the level of vaccination as we mentioned spm highlighted these three are very critical for us to push ahead faster and do a lot more and if we are able to do that raise a vaccination level significantly test much faster quarantine much faster and able to contact trace very quickly then this will give us more capacity to open up gradually and safely so we are we have to continue to remain vigilant and continue to exercise caution and observe the safe distancing measures and this will allow us to move gradually towards opening again thank you very much for being with us this afternoon and that was singapore's multi-ministry task force on covet 19 expanding on what prime minister lisien long said earlier and here is a recap of pm lee's speech pmd says that large-scale routine testing will be part of the new normal for singapore as kovit 19 mutates to become more transmissible speaking in a national broadcast pml says that many different types of tests are now available including diy kits that will soon be sold over the counter these will be a big help in slowing down the spread of the virus with faster cheaper tests we can do routine testing at more workplaces like offices restaurants and shopping malls we can also routinely test individuals whose occupations involve close contact with many people and could result in super spreading events like taxi drivers and bus captains physiotherapists and massage stage performers sports and fitness instructors and educators all could be tested regularly this will reassure their customers patients and students and enable them to work safely even with covet 19 in circulation in short we are shifting our approach to testing henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up we will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well in normal work or social or community settings to make them and these places safe extensive testing will give us confidence to resume larger scale events or gatherings for example we can deploy fast and easy tests before a religious service a football game a concert or a wedding reception and participants can be assured that the event is covet 19 safe mr lee adds that contact tracing operations have improved vastly over the past year but they can be further stepped up by casting a wider net our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household therefore in future when we identify a close contact of an infected case we will not only isolate him himself the first degree contact and test him for covet 19. we will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately without waiting to see whether the first degree contact tests positive if later the first degree contact test negative we can safely release his household members from isolation but if later the first degree contact test positive we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier this more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly vaccination will be rolled out for students who will be able to book their slots starting tomorrow now those who are taking major exams this year will get to go first younger adults in singapore will also get their turn from the middle of next month in this latest outbreak we've seen more cases of children getting infected in schools and tuition centers the children were not seriously ill but parents are naturally worried therefore we will take full advantage of the june holidays to vaccinate students bookings will open tomorrow we will give priority to the graduating cohorts for o n and a levels as well as special needs students then the other students 12 years and above will take their turn including students in our institutions of higher learning after the students we will vaccinate the final remaining group young adults 39 years and younger this should start around mid-june this group is quite large therefore we will give the singaporeans among them a two-week priority window to book your appointments first before we open up generally to the rest who want to be vaccinated misali also says that the number of daily cases has come down and singapore should be on track to bring this outbreak under control barring another super spreader or big cluster he adds that the country should be able to relax tighten restrictions after 13th of june if the situation continues to improve but the prime minister urged singaporeans to stay vigilant in the new normal covet 19 will not dominate our lives our people will be mostly vaccinated and possibly taking booster shots every year we will get tested often but it will be fast and easy we'll go to work or school meet friends and family participate in religious services and enjoy entertainment and sports events we will re-open our borders safely and eventually we will even go about without masks again at least outdoors right now we are some ways off from this happy state but we are heading in the right direction in this new normal the countries which are united disciplined and put in place sensible safeguards will be able to reopen their economies reconnect to the rest of the world grow and prosper singapore will be among these countries more confident and resilient than before and toughened by what we have overcome together and experienced together as one nation the impact of the latest heightened measures on the singapore economy is expected to be modest trade and industry minister gan kim yong says that domestic consumer facing sectors will be hit hardest domestic consumer oriented sectors such as food and beverage services retail and land transport will see a greater impact on the other hand the impact of these measures on outward oriented sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and finance and insurance is likely to be less severe more than 400 000 students in singapore will get their job starting this week singapore's education minister chan chun singh says that graduating cohorts can book their jobs as early as tomorrow besides community centers students can also go to four vaccination centers located in institute of technical education campuses and the raffle city convention center he adds that students in special education schools won't have to travel for their shots students will require greater support and are unable to get vaccinated through their parents booking our schools will arrange for them to get vaccinated when school reopens the rest of the eligible school cohorts polytechnic students and autonomous university students will be progressively invited to make their bookings in the coming days we've got your asia business update coming up with eugenia lim including thailand drawing up new plans to keep the economy going as it battles its largest covet 19 wave and businesses in australia feeling the heat as strict border closures shut out skilled migrant workers you ,True,True,False,False

professor Kenneth ma will provide further details later it has been just about a week since the circuit breaker measures have kicked in by and large Singaporeans are taking the measures seriously and are staying at home in the past week public transport ridership and traffic volume have dropped by more than 70% and close to 80 percent of the work force are now working from home crowds have thinned in the public places enforcement offices have also observed greater compliance with safe distancing measures over the past one week we thank everyone who is playing their part to stop the transmission of the virus but we cannot be complacent we still see a few cases of people loitering or gathering in public places the authorities have issued more than 6,200 warnings and over 500 fines since 7th of April these safe distancing measures are put in place to slow the transmission of the virus and more importantly to protect Singaporeans therefore we must take these measures seriously and keep a safe distance from one another we remain in a critical situation the number of cases has been increasing and yesterday we saw our highest daily tally so far at 386 in particular the number of cases among foreign workers especially those in dimitris rose sharply to around 200 cases per day and reaching around 300 cases yesterday this increase is likely to continue as we undertake more testing at Adama trees the outbreak in the foreign worker dama trees has become an important front in our fight against kovat 19 our foreign workers have contributed much to Singapore and we are paying close attention to well to their health and well-being that is why we have set up a joint task force with senior minister Cho ji-hyun as our adviser to address the outbreak in the dormitories our foremost priority is to keep our foreign workers safe we have mobilized our medical resources to support the joint task force efforts at Adama trees our medical plan entails identifying those who have been infected or exposed to infection tests and contact tracing isolation and care for the infected workers all infected foreign workers will have their welfare taken care of overall we expect a number of cases to continue to rise in the short term before it stabilizes because you will take time for the circuit breaker measures to take effect with the rice in a number of infected cases our healthcare resources are stretched but we are still able to cope I would like to take this opportunity to thank our health care workers who have responded quickly to this new situation and made this and may have made the necessary adjustments to further free up precious Hospital resources we have set up community care facilities to take care of those who are clinically well but will still need to be isolated and monitored most of the foreign worker patients are young and few have underlying conditions hence we expect that few would need extensive medical care at a care facility at singapore expo two halls are now operational with a total capacity of about 950 and the third one will be operational shortly we are progressively expanding the capacity at singapore expo we are also exploring additional capacity for such care facilities to give us a greater buffer each of us must take the circuit breaker seriously this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus we must work together to terminate and to disconnect this chain of transmission so that we can come out of this together now I would like to pass on to my that darker medical services to share some details on the medical cases thank you very much minister to expand now on the figures and you have to check this for accuracy against the press release or come out this evening as of 12:00 noon today we've seen an additional three hundred thirty four new cases of these new cases none of them my imported cases 189 of these cases have been linked to named clusters 23 of them are other local linked cases and 122 of these cases remained as yet unlinked further investigations in contact tracing are taking place and we are hopeful that out of this 122 cases a number of them will be recategorize into being linked to cases whether to other individual cases or to the clusters we have seen a number of these patients in fact come from the dama trees both from the purpose-designed and dom trees as well as others and within the dama trees the joint task force remains committed to doing their best to look after the workers who are unwell in the dhamma trees medical teams have been established within the dama trees and we continue to make sure that their medical services available working closely with the joint task force to ensure that that is that is indeed so and within sound of dhamma trees swap testing under an active case finding approach has commenced and as SWAT testing activities continue we fully expect more confirmed cases to emerge as a result of all surveillance activities concurrently we have worked to expand our facilities both in our swap and isolation facilities but also in our committee care facilities and as alluded to this committee care facility that we've recently established in the singapore expo yesterday they had 297 residents in the committee care facility and we expect another 150 more patients to be admitted into the committee care facility today and they come from a variety of different places including from the dormitories they come also from acute hospitals as a result of us being able to transfer the well recovering patients into the stack step-down care setting and a number of them in fact come across these different settings as well as of now the patients were in the compte care facility are well and they are looked after by the medical teams that we have established within the two halls at this compte care facility at the expo thank you very much thank you I'll now invite Minister Joseph into to give an update on the operations at our dormitories good evening everyone our immediate priority is for the workers in the dormitories to stay healthy and to minimize the number that get infected it is a huge responsibility and that is why we are mobilizing resources from across the whole government to make it happen and this is also why the interagency joint task force was set up I think it will be helpful if I provide it first an overview of the dama tree landscape in Singapore we have 43 purpose-built dormitories that together house about 200,000 workers there is a very specific reason we built these dormitories they tend to be quite large they house anywhere between 3,000 to 25,000 workers the specific reason for building these Dhamma trees was have communal living it was designed all these dormitories were designed for communal living meaning that we want the workers to be able to be with their friends prepare the meals that they like and practice their religious beliefs with scale these dormitories are also able to provide common recreational facilities such as TV rooms gyms we were also able to put in other facilities like mini months remittances and Wi-Fi and so when you put it together really the purpose-built dormitories are to provide a supportive environment to the workers the dormitories are professionally managed by a firm or what we normally refer to as the dom operator these dom operators are regulated and they have the responsibility to ensure that standards are met for example making sure that there is modern sanitation and also no overcrowding in terms of sleeping arrangements what does it look like in a typical purpose-built dome well if you imagine a badminton court and then you take half of the battement in court and you put five bunk bits in them that will be able to sleep 10 people and then you add another 20% to that half of the badminton court for circulation space that is essentially what a typical room would look like in the purpose-built dhama trees so that's one group of Dhamma trees we have another type of Dhamma trees we call them factory converted dormitories we have 1200 of them and collectively they house about 95 thousand workers these factory converted domes tend to be smaller they are perhaps between fifty to a hundred but some that are larger can be around 500 now these dormitories are either managed by the employers themselves or professional operators they have the advantage of being closer to the workplaces they are also regulated and must meet standards for hygiene for space and also for example fire safety and based on these regulations they are inspected and if there are findings then the operators will be asked to rectify them so that's the second type of Tama tree then we have a small number of what is known as construction temporary quarters or temporary living quarters they tend to be no more than 40 persons each and we don't have so many of them smaller number so that is what the Dom landscape looks like now what precautions have we taken at all the dormitories since the cove at 19 outbreak I think firstly we tried to limit the inflow of foreign work pass holders so that we could manage the risk of imported cases that's the first thing that we did we reached out to all the Dom operators to remind them to be more vigilant then we also produce materials in the workers native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves subsequently non-essential facilities like gyms and TV rooms were closed mealtimes and recreational hours were also staggered intermixing between the blocks we put a stop to it so those were the precautions that took place the question of course is why then has there been such a spread amongst the workers staying in the dormitories from the epidemiological findings there is evidence to link the workers in the dormitories to common work sites then the workers from the different dormitories on the arrestees may also gather and so they may socialize and shop at popular places like Mustafa now back in the dorms these workers would then socialize with another group of friends they might you know cook together eat together relax together so despite the safe distancing measures that were in place then in these dormitories the virus in the dorms spread through social socialising activities much like it would spread amongst housemates friends and also in the community this may explain why all the way up to middle of March the workers who lived in dorms that tested positive for Kovac 19 were few and far between but then in quick succession in some domitor is not all in some dormitories many popped up so what are we now doing to contain the spread it is a three-pronged strategy first in the dorms where there are already clusters we will actively contain the spread now it means locking down these dormitories no more moving in and out workers have to stay in their room as much as possible minimize the interactions with other workers meals are provided to avoid communal cooking and those that have to use communal toilets have scheduled staggered shower times we are also testing the workers to identify and isolate the infected ones and closely monitoring the health of the other workers so that's the first problem second it's useful to note that not all the doms have clusters in fact 29 of the 43 purpose-built dorms and almost all the factory converted dorms they have no clusters hence for these types of dormitories our aim is to prevent the clusters from forming all those in these dormitories that are tested positive and they're closed contexts would already have been isolated separately while these dorms are not gazetted as isolation areas we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown likewise the workers have to stay in the dorms within the dorms we enforce strictly the safe distancing measures which means no more cooking and freely mixing with friends from other housing units so that's the second problem third across all 43 purpose-built dorms we have moved out or separated the workers in essential services who are still needed by their employers to go to work this is now about 7,000 of them we put them in separate facilities so that they do not have to enter and leave the dorms daily or interact with the other Dom residents to provide a higher level of assurance medical screening was conducted to ensure that the workers did not have symptoms before moving into the alternative accommodation all the workers were screened before they moved to the alternative accommodation in the meantime while at the workplace or traveling to work they are required to also implement strict safety distancing this includes wearing a mask at all times not interacting with other workers and eating meals alone and like all Singaporeans they will be required to remain in their residences after work we hold the employers of these essential workers responsible and we look to them to do their utmost to keep their workers safe even as they go about their duties now what we have done to move out or separate the essential workers in the purpose-built dormitories we will also do for the factory converted dormitories move them out monitor them screen them all of them the moving out of workers from all the dormitories purpose-built or factory converted rooms will help to create more space for isolation facilities within the dorms so that we can house separately the workers who are unwell or are waiting for the results of their shock tests so those are the three prongs of the strategy now to implement this three-pronged strategy effectively there are also three key enablers the first is the fast teams that I've talked about for all 43 purpose-built dorms we have deployed the fast teams and they have been on the ground since last Wednesday working round the clock to implement safe distancing measures I visited some of the dorms comprising an interactive with the fast teams which comprised of SAF SPF as well as emam offices they understand the mission to put the well-being of the workers at the top of their priority they sort out issues with food as well as cleanliness they keep in close with the workers and attend to the feedback from the workers they are a great help to the dom operators and we will soon deploy roving fast teams to also support the employers or the dom operators for the factory converted dormitories so that's the first key enabler the second key enabler are our medical support teams at the dormitories these are also being stepped up progressively these medical outposts at the dormitories are supported by the regional healthcare systems which deploy teams of doctors nurses and technicians to the DAPs they tend to the workers who are unwell sort those who have acute respiratory symptoms they manage the cases that need to be sent to other facilities and then they will also assess if the workers are well enough to be returned to their rooms their presence in the dormitories give great confidence to the workers who are there the medical teams will also work with the fast teams to set up on-site isolation facilities we now have eight medical outposts set up and the gazetted domes and aim to have medical touch points at all 43 purpose-built domes now most of the other factory converted domes they are already well supported by the national network of PHP sees the public health preparedness clinics so the workers in the factory converted roms can also get timely medical attention so that's the second key enabler the third key enabler will be the dormitory operators as well as the employers now the more the dom operators can handle the food and hygiene matters the more the fast teams can focus on effective safe distancing and tackle other issues for example expanding the isolation facilities on site and helping the workers to remit monies home a big part of the workers sense of well-being is to be able to continue to receive their salaries it's important to them and this is where the employers have a duty to ensure that it is done so promptly in a timely manner so to recap we have a three-pronged strategy for the dormitories contain the spread in the dormitories where they are already clusters prevent a spread in the dormitories with know clusters and move out and test all the workers who are still needed for essential work we will also ensure that the three key enablers are properly stepped up the fast teams the medical outposts which implements the medical support plan as well as the dom operators and the employers there will be quite a lot of adjustments required of the workers living in the dormitories they cannot go out to work or meet their friends and we would have to help them to adjust and to keep them safe and healthy in summary we thank the workers for their cooperation we have a responsibility to these workers and we will do everything we can to take care of them thank you I'll now invite Minister Lawrence Wong to give an update on the safe distancing measures good evening it has been one week since the circuit breaker kicked in and we are very happy that many Singaporeans and residents are cooperating and doing their part and complying with these measures as you heard just now people movement all over the island has reduced significantly our safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers are hard at work on the ground and previous hotspots that we had highlighted including the wet markets hawker centres and parks are generally now under control most people are doing the right thing and there are a few who are not and they will be dealt with but just one week into the circuit breaker we know there are some people who are finding it hard to adjust some suffering from cabin fever we receive many appeals to do all sorts of activities and we've had to reject all of them because basically we cannot let up at this stage the these are still early days and we have at least another three more weeks to go so we have to double down on our efforts and just stay at home when we started the circuit breaker we were very mindful not to disrupt certain of our supply chains or to disrupt essential services that are still needed for daily living now about 20% of the workforce or kin are continuing to work under essential services now there have been Appeals at the start of the circuit breaker we have cleared their Appeals so having cleared the appeals we will now proceed to look at the list of companies that are still working classified as essential services and we will tighten this list further we the objective of reducing further people who still need to work so that more can stay at home and we can further minimize people movement all around now we will also continue to be very firm and strict in enforcing and implementing the circuit breaker measures we have gone straight because sufficient warning has been given to everyone so immediately for the first offense it's a fine of three hundred dollars the second offense would be a fine of a thousand or prosecution in court for egregious cases and we've issued more than 500 fines to date for foreign residents who have caught breaching any of the rules then on top of the effect the fines we will not hesitate to revoke their employment or work passes or even their PR status during this circuit-breaker period we will make a further change to our guidance on mask we had already updated our advisory on masks earlier based on the latest medical and scientific advice and that's why we went out to distribute reusable masks to everyone and that exercise has completed over the weekend so we will now take a further step and make it mandatory for everyone to wear masks when they go out there will be some exceptions or exemptions to this rule for example for very young children those below the age of two the medical experts recommend not to wear masks because of child safety so that group would be exempted for those who are engaging in strenuous exercise like running or jogging then you can remove the mask when you are engaging in strenuous exercise but after that you have to put the mask on and when you are engaging in running or jogging there make sure that you are maintaining a safe distance between yourself and others other than these exceptions everyone else go out will have to wear a mask and we will enforce this rule too like all the other safe distancing and circuit breaker measures that we have put in place basically as we have explained we are dealing with two infections in Singapore one in the foreign worker dormitories which Minister Josephine tio has highlighted and elaborated on and second in the general population the infection in our foreign worker dormitories is a very challenging task it requires new organization new protocols for dama trees and workers it requires strict and firm measures but at the same time empathy and understanding for the well-being and needs of the workers who have done so much for Singapore so we are sparing no effort to go doing all we can to ensure the safety and health of these workers for the rest of us in the general population we are continuing with our efforts to do contact tracing each time a new case pops up and we have the circuit breaker in place so all of us should comply with the circuit breaker measures not just to avoid the penalties but to protect ourselves and our family and our loved ones the health of all Singaporeans depends on each one of us and we can beat the virus together let me just say a few words in Mandarin suit what suit once washer shushing equal since Eli I mentioned is yet supported

raise hand function on zoom if you'd like to ask the question maybe now have the first question from Taobao women please thank you why men phone representing southpaw can I can we have more clarity on the dormitory situation how many more essential service foreign workers are not yet dick entered and by the meaning of these of essential services firms tightening by how much how much less workers and in terms of factory converted dama trees right now can Minister provide more details on how many among the clusters right now our factory converted dormitories which one is it and are there more confirmed cases coming from FC DS as mentioned in the advisory that M om distributed yesterday to employers thank you thank you as Lawrence to talk about the essential services then the Josephine tier will answer the questions on Adama trees well on essential services the ones that are continuing to work in the ones from the purpose-built dorms that are continuing to work we have largely already completed the movement of these workers to alternative accommodations so that exercise has already completed and they were they are continuing to work the key is this every time we move them out we will test all of them to make sure they are healthy and then we will provide alternative accommodations for them because they will be continuing to work in our community so that exercise is complete the one the question about whether or not how much more are we going to trim the list of essential workers that is ongoing as I mentioned for now twenty percent of the workforce are deemed essential including foreign workers in that myths right so that group of workforce is about twenty percent and they are continuing to work daily as I said we would like to bring that figure lower and we are looking at ways in which we can trim down and when we are ready we were more details perhaps I should just clarify that the 20% who are working refers to those that are still commuting every day to work there's still substantial workers who are telle community at le commuting so they are actually working from home and the numbers will be a dynamic number depending on whether they continue to be active to be involved in the economic activities but a large proportion of Singaporeans continue to work from home I'm now I pass it over to Josephine thanks my man for the question I mentioned earlier that we have about 1200 factory converted dormitories and as of the last set of data that was available in 37 of them there were some cases most of them have very few cases we are talking about low single digits but we do have one or two of the factory converted dormitories with cluster but they are very small minority of the factory converted domes which is why we are stepping up our inspection by today we would have done an inspection for all the factory converted dormitories over the last two days in fact so when we go out to these factory converted dorms to do our inspection the protocol has also changed whereas in the past our inspectors would look out for hygiene standards being met fire safety standards being met now the protocol also includes looking into the well-being of the workers in these factory converted dormitories we want to know whether the dormitory operator who may be the employer themselves have been keeping track of temperature of the workers for example they are required to perform twice daily temperature taking they are also required to inform us if any one of them is unwell so that we can keep track of how things are shaping up so these things are already carried out and as I also mentioned earlier in my remarks the intention is to also have roving fast teams support the factory converted mitrice because now we do not want them to do any cooking and so food will have to be arranged and provided for and over and above this we also want to make sure that the workers if they are unwell they know where to seek treatment generally it should not be a problem because they will have the network of PHP C's to tap on but where they have difficulties then we want to move in very quickly now on the factory converted dormitories were not working alone apart from the joint task force also having a supervisory view of the factory converted dorm situation we are working with nongovernmental organizations this include the migrant worker center as well as organizations like health serve in order to be able to take care of the workers not only in the purpose-built jobs but also in the factory converted homes next question we will have the next question from BH Atia please I mentioned about being mandatory for everyone to wear masks can you get some clarity on these and what are the penalties for those who do not wear masks what there's a clarity that you're seeking again specifically okay yes for those who do not wear masks and you know any advice all right so on the issue of wearing masks as I said we had updated our guidance earlier and advising people to go up when they go out to wear a mask so that had already been updated the change today is that we are making it mandatory right and in fact we had started earlier by making a mandatory in certain settings in public transport in wet markets and supermarkets but now that we have distributed the masks to everyone and that we have put and generally people have started to adjust to the new requirements or the advisory we are making it mandatory for all the minute you leave your room you leave your house you have to wear a mask when you go out so their world because it's a mandatory requirement now there will be penalties the same penalties for safe distancing and circuit breaker measures will apply first offense $300 beyond that 1000 and possible prosecution so it's the same penalties for failure to comply with any of the safe distancing measures this will be yet another safe distancing safe distancing measure that we are now putting in place next question the next question from ft Stephanie a please hi hello the questions the first one is with regards to testing foreign workers and dormitories are you considering by any chance trying to test essentially everyone or more people in dorms just by virtue of but yeah I know you've already mentioned the fact that you're also testing those that might be asymptomatic or some of them but but just by virtue of how how densely populated these structures are are you considering ramping up testing their further could you also mention how many more foreign workers who are planning on moving out in addition to be about sort of 7,000 that you already have moved out as EMS to talk about the testing strategy and then Joseph Inc and comment on moving out of our workers from the Dhamma tree we working out the testing strategy with our colleagues in the Joint Task Force at this point in time for the majority of the purpose-built Adamo trees we don't we don't have an approach of testing everyone at this stage but it's a much more targeted approach or testing those who step forward who are sick with symptoms and in an active case finding active case surveillance approach in terms of concern the Trend Task Force has also arranged for testing of confirmed cases so as to further identify possible other patients who may as yet not be symptomatic but in fact have already been infected and they would all then with the positive test result be isolated to prevent further spread of infection to other workers within the dormitories in other settings we have tested workers across very specific other settings across the board you no need to give her a surance in those settings these workers are in fact not infected at a point in time that we test them and examples given by minister where we shifted workers who belong to the essential firms essential services and as we were moved out we in fact had also tested them and continued to test them to make sure that they do not have any workers among the mates who are in fact infected and therefore pose a further risk to Adam for workers the worker who live with them and work with them as well so to the question of a moving out and separately housing the workers there are really two objectives that we are trying to meet one is to enable the essential services workers who still need to go to work not to have to have to you know move in and out of the dormitories on a day-to-day basis and therefore have interactions with the residents who are otherwise still remaining in the dormitories so we've already done so for the purpose-built dorms we are going to do this for all the factory converted amah trees we are tabulating the numbers and we can provide an update when that is available but I also want to mention that even for the purpose-built Dom's from which essential services workers have been moved out we do want to be able to create isolation facilities within the dormitories remember we mentioned that there is a medical support plan that has to be implemented part of that medical support plan which you got a full briefing on is to be able to take care of the workers whilst they are being swapped and waiting for the results or if they have been swapped and then we need to find some way to let them serve out their medical certificates say for example the physicians have decided that they should be on MC and not immediately put back into the rooms so to have this isolation facilities we will also have to look at the specific conditions in each of the dormitories they are all configured differently in some cases there is carpark space available that we can free up to serve as the isolation facilities with proper equipment put in as well as making sure that a level of comfort can be achieved in some other cases there may be rooms that are freed up that we can use so we will have to look at the specific conditions in each of those tamo trees to identify areas that can serve as isolation facilities and if it is necessary to move out some of the residents in order to create free up these isolation facilities we will do so next question we will take the next question from channel 8 car you please thank you hi a little chitchat right why there's a sudden change all the math guidance is it because there's now the transmission transmission rate is higher because earlier us which that shows that this foreigner virus might be able to transmit through top T so what's the mo page then again this what's our current our model right now because currently worldwide our noise is 2 to 3 percent what is so powerful in Singapore right now and then the second question is just now a minister ovens won't say that you are targeting to title them this office then sure services so what Taiwan essential services are you Genet Thank You us DMS to talk about our Arnott and then perhaps Lawrence can talk about the mass and the essential services the or not basically is that figure that represents that the extent in which a further transformation takes place from one case and we look predominant at just that are not actually what we discussed the or the effective are looking at this in until the outbreak had taken place within the Dom trees we in fact had or effective or that in fact was well below one we haven't done the complete calculation yet for the workers that come off on the dama trees because he actually need to follow this cluster true and to determine whether or not onward transmission actually takes place but my understanding is the RT it has in fact now crapped up I think it's somewhere closer to the one map but I'll have to check that and then perhaps one said informations available then make that known to all of you so on the question of mask actually the main change had happened earlier when we updated our advice on mask based on the latest findings and medical advice or scientific evidence right and that was there were two reasons for this as we have already explained number one the evidence or the finding that people without symptoms or with very mouth symptoms could be spreading the virus so the early advice was you wear masks to protect others try to keep your droplets to yourself especially when you are sick but if you can spread the virus even if you don't have symptoms then you may not know whether you are sick or not sick but you may inadvertently be spreading the virus so that was one key reason why we change our advisory earlier the second reason was as we said they are already some indicators that indicate that the virus was circulating in our community and there were more undetected cases within our community which was a cause for concern and therefore we had already changed our advisory earlier to recommend the wearing of masks particularly when you go out and you cannot avoid close contacts and indeed over the last weeks or so recent days you are seeing more people wearing masks what we are doing now is a next further step same reason same findings but an extra dose that just to make it mandatory and to take that extra protection and precautions so that anyone going out right in any setting wear a mask and I think that will be an extra precaution worth taking for all of us on the second point on essential services we have been quite as I said when we started out with the circuit breaker quite mindful of one thing to ensure there was no disruption to our own essential services for daily living our supply chains particularly since in Singapore we import so many things that we need for daily living our food daily essentials and then of course there are other areas like health care clearly an essential service you want that to continue you've got things like energy water waste utilities all of these need to continue and then food and beverage we still need to eat so FMB must continue but in each of these categories we kept these categories and we allowed them to continue but now having cleared all the appeals from companies that say they wanted to continue have cleared the appeals we are going through all of the existing categories of work that are deemed essential and we are going through as I said step by step to see which ones can be cut further we are already not doing badly to be able to reduce the work force that's still continuing to work not the telecommuting ones the ones that are still out and about everyday to 20% we want to go further than that so that we can further reduce the number of people who are out and about and minimize movement to as much as we can let me maybe just take this opportunity to remind all of us that in addition to wearing the mask personal hygiene is still very important so I would continue to encourage Singaporeans to wash your hands observe personal hygiene and which is a very critical factor in disrupting the transmission change and this is particularly important during this period of enhance safe distancing and that is why we have also enhanced our advisory on mass and now making it mandatory when you go out because we want to do everything we can to reduce the risk of transmission so as to cap our keep our number of cases to as low as possible and this is up in line with our strategy of this enhanced safe distancing approach over the next few weeks can I can I make one quick point I just made Minister gun said this I remembered something please please do not use this mask wearing requirement now to say okay I can go out right I buy a mask and it's okay to go out because in fact you should not go out as much as possible just stay at home do all the right things practice good hand hygiene and stay at home as much as possible and if you are staying at home you do not need to wear a mask but in the rare occasion that you do need to go out for purchase of your groceries or purchase of essentials then it's only at that time that you wear a mask next question take the next question from Wall Street Lisa please hi Lisa with The Wall Street Journal I just would like an update on trade together because it's been a while since we've been given an idea about race together can you give me can you give us an idea how it's been used by mm and how effective and useful it's been so far thank you we are still in the stage of our ramping up day and we encourage people to switch on these trees together we have a significant number of downloads but the number of people turning on is still quite low for this to be effective we need to have significant significant portion of Singaporeans turning it on so that we are able to trace those who have turned it on if only a small portion of Singaporeans have turn it on and the rest have not then when we wanted to trace and we would not have the significant number of a context so we are still in a process of promoting this app and we want to encourage Singaporeans to turn it on for as long as possible especially when you go out when you need to go out so please leave it on so that we will do.a facilitate contact tracing so it is to early days we are still in a process of encouragement and a promotion of this use of this app can I also add that we have always said that it's a useful app but it's a supplement to all that we are doing on contact tracing and ultimately the ability to do contact tracing well lies with the people we have and the skill of the contact tracers and that's why I'm Minister GaN that we have been all of us explaining that we have been raising building up extra capabilities and capacity in our contact tracing team beefing that up considerably so that that itself will not be a constraint even if we have more cases as we are seeing now contact tracing continues in a very rigorous and thorough manner next question we will not take the next question from CCTV su-mei please hi Isis to me from CCTV I have one questions we know in China we do the treatment with Chinese medicine jeonggi it works how about you think about addressing is a possible because so many case in Singapore now do you think it's a possible we used Chinese medicine also to do the treatment thank you maybe DMS can comment on the professional thing in fact the members of our Chinese medicine physician community have been exploring the possibility of conducting research I had to see whether or not Chinese traditional Chinese medicine has a role to play in the treatment of Kobe 19 patients in Singapore so they have started to engage us and we continue to have discussions with them they are also exploring collaborations with the doctors within our public health institutions and I look forward to seeing a research proposals come up in partnership with the doctors in the hospital and attrition Chinese medicine physicians and it may very well be that some of that research will start in Singapore in the not-too-distant future a question we'll take the next question from bernama meseta please thank you it's regarding newly identified cluster ABC host elsewhere six lesions involved would you able to tell who are they are they a group a focus so previously called me from Jobar ooh they are housed at ABC Hospital - with the mg own Tunisia do you know we don't have the details of these patients we'll see whether we can share some of the details with you after we have checked but we also have to make sure that there's a patient confidentiality we have to respect so we see what we can share with you later on when we check the details next question take the next question from SD UN Singh please hi you beast you have many other workers who are working in session service SMRT or safe distancing ambassadors and security guards but there has been an advisory issued to encourage older Singaporeans to stay at home so you know will this be reviewable some of this other workers be able to stay home instead of going out to work and the second question is that on the DSA has develop its own you know face mask or face cards made out of plastic right so how does this compare in terms of effectiveness to reusable mass or surgical masks and will we be looking at an operated appointment of this DST a face mask as well thank you as a DMS the comment on face masks and the face shields that we you mentioned and perhaps Minister Joseph into can talk about older workers I'm not too familiar with the face fancy referring to from DSD I'm aware that DSC has been in fact working on various personal protective equipment which includes face shields as well so so that's what can progress and as they in fact do this I understand that they've also been in researching what the filtration efficiency is and various other parameters we look at to see whether MRSA in fact are useful and we also have various other organizations in agencies including a star that also have been actively looking in this particular space my understanding is that in fact there's been quite a bit of progress made in terms of modifying mass designs such that even the reusable mass number the realism of mass designs in fact have some benefit also in these areas about I don't have enough information to give you today we look forward perhaps to compiling some information and giving it to you at a later date I think it would be a very good thing if the workers who are older themselves are very concerned about heading out to work and want instead to stay home even if they are performing essential services it is good that they are mindful of the risks to them they would prefer not to go to work now what then is our advisory to the employers our advisory to the employers is to be sympathetic to the concerns of their senior workers if it is at all possible to relieve the individual from having to come to work that would be good the alternative is that if the person really has to come to work then within the work environment can the person be redeployed to a different role where the interactions with the co-workers is kept to a minimum thirdly if that is not also possible then to find some way of ensuring that this workers are given adequate protection as all essential services workers should be given meaning that they should be equipped with suitable masks they should also be provided with the necessary standard operating procedures or processes that have been adjusted to take into account the nature of the work and minimize their interactions with either co-workers or customers or with suppliers now in the event that all of these things are still not possible then to make arrangements for the worker to stay home and the preference would be that the worker can clear their leave so that they continue to receive payment and if after the leave has been exhausted then to find ways to have an arrangement where the workers as well as the employers come to a mutual consensus and in those instances it may be necessary for an au pair leaf arrangement for a period of time so those are the various options that are available to the workers and to the employers I think it is really important for the employers to understand and to attend to the concerns of their workers particularly for the seniors we do want to take good care of them we want to ensure that they not only feel safe if they have to come to work but are actually well protected next question we have time for three more questions you will now take from it a toss if Dini please thank you good evening I just want to clarify about the masks when these requirements takes effect and one more question some cities introduced electronic passes for residents and these passes allow them going shopping or make some sport activity can we expect to introduce such passes here thank you okay all right all right so the wearing of mistakes immediate effect all right so once we have put it out the enforcement agencies will start looking at requiring everyone going out to wear masks as I said many are already doing it if you go out today you already see many wearing a mask we have made it mandatory in many settings anyway whether it's a supermarket or public transport so people are already used to it and now we are stepping up to require the minute you step out of the house when you go out wearing masks will be mandatory on the idea of regulating the flow of people in supermarkets or markets through some form of a pass system it's indeed something that we are we have been looking at for now we have as I say put in place safe distancing ambassadors they are deployed on the ground we have put in place also control access in the control of access into certain places like markets and parks where we were fence up the area and there we are control access into that particular area so if people want to go in then they will have to queue up and that so those sorts of measures the control measures that we have put in place so far as I Manchin have helped to stabilize the situation in some of these areas and if you look at the places that I mentioned they're like parks or markets and Hawker centers the situation today is certainly better than what it was when the circuit breakers started it's generally under control but we are continuing to review and we will see if additional control measures may be necessary to regulate further the flow of people in these areas next question we will not take question from mothership jr. please the mass regulation in place and circuit requirements with all of our measures we will continue to review so it may well continue after the circuit breaker as one additional layer of precaution that would be put in place for all to wear mask so we can't say with certain now when exactly this will end and whether or not it will end of the circuit breaker or it may continue but in any case as I said earlier even without making it mandatory we the good thing is that we already see many people wearing it based on the early advisory right when the early advisory was updated people are doing it and they are conscious and they are aware of why it is useful in order to protect others you know to wear a mask keep your droplets to yourself and you protect others it provides some additional precaution additional protection so more and more Singaporeans and residents are doing it so we made this additional move now to make it mandatory but even without it would say many are already of their own accord wearing a mask of their own I shall also take this opportunity to reinforce ice that that's at the end of the circuit breaker we will need to review whether or not there's a need to extend the circuit breaker period or even if we extend the circuit breaker period whether we need to make adjustments to the various measures that we are put in place and it's also important to bear in mind that even at the end of a circuit breaker with or without extension it's not likely that we will open this entire system all together and then free-for-all everybody do what they like it is going to be a gradual opening we made tighten some measures may relax some measures we may find you in some of the measures so it's not a end period and then that's it and everything else back to normal so we are likely even if we were to begin to open to relax it's going to be a gradual process and it all depends on the risk assessment at the point in time so I think that we should not have the idea that end of a circuit breaker and everything will revert back to normal and we don't have to wear masks anymore we don't have to have safe distancing anymore I think many of these measures even if we were to relax them is going to be a gradual process beyond the circuit breaker period next question do not take the final question from Bloomberg flip please hi good to see you all um couple questions here you know the measures are kind of coming hard and fast now lots of press releases coming each day and you know I wonder to what extent the government might admit that it's taking more of a reactive stance on the virus response as opposed to perhaps over pre-emptive stance that we saw perhaps in the early days when it was a more containment that's one question also I wonder if you can give an idea now what what industries you are considering that could be called fret essentials list and finally given the number of cases what chance do you give the lifting of those circuit breaker circuit breaker measures next month hey you were just talking about thank you so we just to clarify first of all we are still pursuing containment right you you said we were doing containment I think suggesting that we are not doing contain containment anymore we are still continuing with containment we are still continuing with very rigorous contact tracing and quarantine of suspect cases so that approach has not changed basically we are dealing with a situation where all of us know the virus spreads very quickly and it can move the situation can move in unpredictable ways any single day right so we just have to try our best to adapt to be to be agile and to move as fast as we can we've said from the very start of this outbreak that the key to managing the spread of the virus is not just the measures that we have but the pace that we are at which we are able to adjust our strategies and adapt to a situation that is very fluid and changing very rapidly for which the understanding of the virus is also evolving from the beginning till now we have continued to learn new things and scientific advice not just in Singapore but internationally has been continuously been updated and evolved as well so we are in the same situation yesterday and today our posture has not changed our strategies our approach has not changed it is one of constantly looking at the environment internationally and in Singapore and then constantly adjusting and updating our posture in our measure anticipate in a very proactive way and then anticipating also what can happen in the future and given the nature of the virus we just have to be prepared anything can happen in the future that's that's something they've been saying all along and that remains the case that anything can happen and the the way it spreads the new classes that form it can happen in very unpredictable ways because a single case a single weak link can easily lead to new clusters forming on the second question of what could be called from the essential services list I think I must have answered this question at least three times I think all of you are asking me for a specific detail which we are not able to give because as I said the work is happening right now and when we are ready we will update you on what is the which are the ones that we will be removing or reducing or taking out from the list of essential services as I said the aim the key goal is to continue to we started with a list with Delta the appeals and now we've gone back to that original list that we started with the sectors that are key and necessary right and then we are going to trim it down as much as we can in order to reduce a number of people who are still needed to work on a daily basis the third question was respond to that question I think there was a question about whether we are still hopeful that we will be able to lift circuit breaker as scheduled I think it is important for us to remember that we have just implemented the enhancer circuit breaker measures last week and this is the first week into the measures we need to continue to monitor how it goes and at the same time we also have to see cases in a dormitory as quite a separate a challenge that we are facing because the dama trees are now being safeguarded they are quarantine so the there's still some transmission going on within the dama trees which we are addressing through the Joint Task Force efforts but that because they are already quarantine in the Dhamma trees for those with a large clusters I think they are not likely to affect the community outside the dama trees and then we have also removed the essential workers from these Dhamma trees into a separate accommodation so they don't go in and out anymore by the same time we are also monitoring the transmission outside the dhamma tree in the community we are paying close attention to these cases especially the unlink cases as DMS mentioned we are continuing with contact tracing to attempt to link these cases to identify the sources of these cases we are watching and monitoring the development and we think that over the next few days a week or so we will continue to see that number rising because many of these interactions that we are seeing today are seeded before the safety sensing measures have been put in place so we will need time for these measures to take effect and we also need to make sure that we will continue to monitor and adjust our measures as we go along so I think if we are able to work together all Singaporeans observe the rules of a safe distancing I think we will be able to succeed in slowing down this transmission effectively thank you ",True,True,False,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",thank you and good afternoon the kobe 19 situation in singapore has remained stable since the start of a phase three heightened alert although we continue to see a steady stream of community cases as well as a handful of clusters each day this suggests clearly that a certain level of unknown transmission continues to occur within the community the bugit mirror market and food center cluster continues to grow and additional smaller clusters have emerged from that cluster too any of these new clusters can become another big cluster if we are not careful we have intensified our contact tracing and testing efforts and we aim to bring these clusters under control as soon as possible to prevent further transmission into the community due to the further easing of measures that commence this week including dining in we expect cases to rise somewhat in the coming weeks this is inevitable and a situation that we must be prepared for however if all of us can continue to abide strictly by the safe management measures in place and practice good personal hygiene habits i'm confident that we will be able to continue to keep the situation under control at the last press conference we spoke about how higher vaccination rates will allow us to open up more quickly ease border restrictions and allow more community activities as we have managed to bring forward our delivery of vaccine supplies we will be able to accelerate our vaccination program significantly minister aung kang will announce more details shortly we are currently working out the roadmap and the timing to reopening based on vaccination rates and we will share more details when we are ready but we can provide a sense of what we can expect when the time comes we will see we will achieve a 50 full vaccination shortly that means half our people will be protected we expect the risk of infection and emergence of large clusters to be greatly reduced but the other half has not yet been vaccinated so we will still not be able to open up fully nevertheless we hope we are able to allow the easing of some safe management measures in time to come come august we expect about two-thirds would have been vaccinated and protected from serious illnesses but two-thirds will still not be enough we need to continue to press on with vaccination to achieve an even higher rate of coverage then we will be able to resume the higher risk activities which we have suspended over the last one and a half years maybe with some capacity limits imposed with higher risk of vaccination we will also be able to resume traveling those who have been vaccinated will be given some concession when traveling or returning to singapore for example vaccinated travelers including singaporeans who travel overseas and returning to singapore may undergo more frequent testing in lieu of serving shns we will also start allowing more workers in particular our migrant workers and migrant domestic workers to enter singapore this will ease the immense pressures our companies have been under since the start of the pandemic and allow store projects to restart family members to reunite and their migrant domestic workers to join them as singapore moves into a world where covet is endemic we will have to change the way we deal with it we will not be able to eradicate the virus totally and hence we will have to learn to live with it there will be people infected every day but as the vast majority of us have been vaccinated we can keep it under control and the key is to minimize the number of hospitalization and the number of serious cases instead of focusing on daily cases we can focus on patients who are hospitalized or in the icu this is what many other countries are doing right now singaporeans may also have to get used to more cell testing using rapid test kits if tested positive the patient can go to a clinic and confirm the diagnosis with a pcr test and if the patient has mild or no symptoms the patient can isolate and recover at home and only go to hospital if their condition worsens all these are possible only when we have achieved a high level of vaccination it has been a challenging one and a half years for everyone but the progress we are making on our vaccination program is the light at the end of the tunnel barring any unforeseen circumstances will be able to open up quickly and decisively once we have achieved a high level of vaccination to all of those who have signed up and taken your vaccination thank you very much please encourage those around you who have not been vaccinated or have not signed up to consider doing so as soon as possible in particular i want to take this opportunity to once again urge the elderly to go for vaccination if you have not done so already in the recent bukit mirror and red hue clusters we saw that seniors made up almost half of all the cases there the good news was that more than half of those seniors had received at least one dose of the vaccination and many are stable and recovering if not we could be seeing more dire consequences so please take the vaccine to protect yourselves and your loved ones if you have any concerns or any questions do approach a medical professional or call our hotline 1-800-333-9999 1-800-333-9999 if you have any questions and we will address them and help you make a decision so once again thank you very much let me just say a few words in mandarin now i'd like to invite our director medical services professor kenneth to give a quick update thank you very much mr gun as of the 24th of june today the ministry of health has preliminary confirmed 14 new cases of locally transmitted coven-19 infections 12 are linked to previous cases among whom 11 have already been placed on quarantine and one was detected through surveillance the remaining two cases are currently unlinked based on our investigation so far all these cases are in the community and there are no new cases in geometries there are in addition nine imported cases all of whom have already been placed on stay home notice upon arrival in singapore and of these four are returning singaporeans or singapore permanent residents so in total there are 23 new cases of kovi-19 infection in singapore today there are several community classes that we are monitoring and we found that there are some common links or common modes of transmission they've initially spread in the workplace and the workplace could be defined differently depending on the cluster some were fnb outlets others were office settings and we had seen a cluster involving delivery riders from a f b outlet there was then secondary spread that took place through households and involved close contacts in social settings as well tree of 10 large clusters will close by the end of june if there are no more cases are detected within these clusters and this includes the cluster that was found in block 506 aokang revenue 8 as well as chevy's bar and bistro but our concern presently are the clusters in the bukit mirror and tion barrow area and particularly for the 115 bukit mira view market and food center we know that the next case was a sundry store owner in the market but has since spread to involve other stores stall owners and tenants and into several households and included social contacts patrons and visitors to the market and food centre have also been involved so it's off the 23rd of june there are 82 cases involved in this particular cluster of which 36.7 percent of them were fully vaccinated and 51.1 percent not vaccinated 46 of these cases were not household related and 16 of these cases were detected from surveillance or community testing operations that we conducted and 27 cases have been isolated or quarantined before detection the market and food center remain closed until 26th of june of the cases that were detected in relation to this cluster nearly 47 percent were above the age of 60. there are other clusters in the vicinity that we continue to track as well and that includes other clusters in the tiangbharu region but we are waiting follow genetic studies results before we can confirm whether there is linkage to this bucket mirror view cluster our area of concern is identified as a result of these clusters that we have identified but also supported by other tests uh conducted for example waste water testing that allows us to understand whether there might be cryptic chains of transmission occurring within the area and they have allowed us to sharpen our strategies for heightening community surveillance through aggressive testing in the areas and these areas include the enabling village the red hill area and we continue to extend these areas if necessary we have conducted quite a number of tests over the last three weeks involving this aggressive community surveillance and in short at least 219 000 tests have been performed in various areas in dormitories in workplaces and community in order to pick up these cases overall the committee numbers have increased in the past week compared to the week before but the proportion of unlinked cases has dropped from 25 in the week before to 21 in the past week and of those linked 46 percent were already in quarantine while 33 were detected through surveillance in the past week our household transmission appears to be decreasing and those that were detected on entry into quarantine has also further decreased from 18.8 on the 16th of june to 5.5 on 22nd and this uh suggests that we are getting to our cases more quickly as a result of the aggressive testing that we've been doing yesterday we reported 141 cases admitted in our hospitals with five cases in the icu all five cases in the iacu were unvaccinated cases and it reinforces our concern that those who are not vaccinated if infected may get more aggressive cause of disease a more severe cause of disease may require oxygen supplementation or even ico care and certainly in the bucket mirror cluster that we've seen even though there's a high proportion of seniors those who have been vaccinated of which there were 36.7 as i mentioned earlier the majority were either mildly symptomatic or unsymptomatic and this reinforces the call that we've been giving for all who have yet to be vaccinated to step forward and make a use of the opportunities that are coming up to register and be vaccinated our seniors in particular will be hard hit if the clusters increase or if more classes like that we see in bukit mira then break through in our community thank you afternoon everyone my fellow coaches and i we published an article today describing how we can transit to a endemic covet situation so minister ghan has talked about it and and described the salient points i will not go over again but the key uh to this transition is vaccination and that will be my focus today and we have reached a very critical stage of our national vaccination exercise first give me let me give some updates on progress of vaccination as of 23rd of june we have crossed 5 million doses administered and more than 3 million people amongst our population have received at least one dose of the kovit 19 vaccine and so this translates to about 53 percent or over half of our local population having received at least one dose as for those who have been fully vaccinated with two doses that's 36 percent of our population now overwatch for the various segments who have received at least one dose or have booked an appointment for vaccination these are the percentages seniors above 60 years old about 75 percent but it's not enough as uh minister gunn and kenneth have both mentioned it is really important for our seniors to get themselves vaccinated so 75 is not enough we hope more of them will come forward 45 to 59 age group 77 40 to 44 age group 70 12 to 39 age group which were open only recently two weeks ago 39 but many have registered and waiting to make appointments or waiting to book appointments i'll talk about that later students continue to have to see very encouraging response and right now it's 83 percent and rising so as we confirm our supply schedule we are now confident that we can vaccinate more and faster so this is what we are going to do number one 80 000 doses a day we in may we were administering about 40 000 doses a day when we cross into june we push our limit and raise it to 47 000 doses a day for june we will now ramp this up to 80 000 doses every day in the coming weeks starting this weekend second the first trench of half a million slots will open in the coming days in fact starting saturday and then in the coming days i know many people have been waiting uh especially those in the 12 to 39 age group you have been waiting to book your appointments and you have registered your interests i thank you for your patience with this ramp up we will be able to open up many more slots so as i mentioned we'll open up another 500 000 slots this starting this coming saturday 26th of june and you may receive your sms's either today or tomorrow so for eligible individuals who have registered for the first dose of vaccination but yet to receive a booking link you can expect to receive an sms to make an appointment from today or tomorrow third thing will extend the priority for singaporeans by one week we had hoped to implement this ramp up earlier but we were constrained by supply but we are able to do it now so in view of that we will extend priority for singapore citizens aged 12 to 39 years for another week to first july 2021 and so if you are singaporean age 12 to 39 and not vaccinated yet please before first july 2021 quickly register and book your appointment once you receive your sms after first july 2021 we will go on the first come first serve basis for the rest of the population fourth we will start to bring forward second doses soon we hope that supplies will continue to arrive and enable us to sustain this pace of 80 000 doses a day through july and then august then if we can do that it means that sometime towards the second half of july we would have substantively administered most if not all first doses to people who are willing to take it yeah so everyone who are willing and want to take the first dose by second half of july we should have administered them then we would have achieved our target of prioritizing first dose and giving some protection to as many people in our population as possible once we achieve that it will not make sense to have people continue to wait six to eight weeks until august or beyond for their second doses so we should then reduce the waiting time between first and second doses back to four weeks but i always qualify supply willing this means we will at some point be inviting people to rebook your second dose appointment to earlier dates if it's in august we will invite you to rebook and bring it forward to july and this will allow more of our population to complete their vaccination of two doses and then receive maximum protection earlier than previously we are working out the details today we wouldn't announce them but once we are ready we will announce the details now on the m non mrna vaccines front moh has been looking out for vaccines they are of good quality safe and effective to be part of our national vaccination program we have signed an advanced purchase agreement with nova backs in january this year and recently there has been some results of novavex clinical trials encouraging results published in the papers but the shipment will not be ready so soon because the vaccine is still undergoing phase 3 clinical trials and we are working closely with nova backs and awaiting their application for regulatory approval but we hope the vaccine supplies can arrive before the end of the year for those who want to take something that is non-mrna but in the meantime please continue to consider mrna vaccines they work very well please consider them unless you are medically not eligible to take them such as you are allergic to the first dose now that we switched to a higher gear for vaccination we are raising our targets uh higher and realizing them earlier in the prime minister's address on 31st of may pmd announced that our target is to get two-thirds of our population vaccinated with at least the first dose by early july and everyone who is eligible for vaccination should be able to get their first dose of first jab by national day yeah with our accelerated vaccination program we can now raise this target to have two thirds of our people fully vaccinated with two doses around national day and this is an ambitious target but achievable but i also have to qualify while ambitious it is another interim milestone and in fact we need to get more people fully vaccinated than this two third milestone so we need everyone to step up and get vaccinated and then when the time comes get your second dose appointment rebook to an earlier date if it's in august rebook it to july when the time comes of course everything i said depends on supply arriving on time we are operating on the jit method just in time vaccinating as supplies arrive so we hope supplies continue to come consistently then we can vaccinate as fast as we can but it involves some risk but we'll do our best the mtf will be drawing up a road map as we vaccinate faster and more to transit us towards normalcy towards an endemic covet 19 situation but we are very mindful this is a shape-shifting enemy and it will continue to throw us surprises we will continue to throw us surprises and curveballs so while we draw up a roadmap we must be prepared to adapt to move forward but sometime reverse if we need to and before we move forward again but we are determined to see through this end game then we'll be able to put circuit breaker behind us fmb and gym closures behind us be able to have bigger events be able to have bigger wedding receptions and then overseas travel without shn and quarantine let me now just repeat some of what i said in mandarin just a romantician [Music] good afternoon we had earlier mentioned that we could get at least half of our population fully vaccinated by august but as you heard just now from my fellow co-chairs with the bringing forward of vaccine supplies and speeding up of the process we are now able to set a more ambitious target of at least two-thirds of our population fully vaccinated with two doses by national day it's an ambitious target but supplies permitting we will be able to achieve this as we continue to ramp up our vaccination over the next few weeks we will also plan on making several immediate moves first is the next stage of our reopening specifically to move from two persons to five persons for higher risk settings like fmb dining in we had said earlier that we plan to do this sometime around mid-july with the vaccine on track with the regular testing of workers in these higher risk settings proceeding we should be able to get there exactly what when this will be we will work out the dates and we will give some advance notice but this is something we should be able to proceed on second we will revise the public health guidelines for vaccinated persons and this applies in two aspects one within singapore itself where it comes to activities and gatherings or events we could allow gatherings involving just vaccinated persons to have larger group sizes and also relax the social distancing rules in such settings because only vaccinated persons are involved so that's within singapore and this could apply to a whole range of different settings religious services concerts sporting events and so on so that's one area of work that we are working on second would be travel potentially we are working on some new guidelines for people in singapore to be able to travel abroad and then when you come back you either can serve a shortened shn the quarantine time under the stay home notice will be shorter or maybe waived entirely and replaced with some tests and this will depend on the country that you visit right so these are the potentially revised guidelines that would apply to vaccinated persons we are still working through them and we will announce them when we are ready at the end of the day whether it's in whether it is in singapore anywhere in the world this is really a race between the virus and vaccination and so it is of utmost importance as everyone on the panel has already said to for us to get our vaccination rates up we have been making steady progress but we are watching very carefully the vaccination rates for the elderly group as minister ong said just now for those who are above 60 the vaccination rate is 75 but in fact there are two groups the 60 to 69 vaccination rates are nearly 80 not too bad but for the above 70 it is not quite at 70 percent yet it's lower and that is in fact the more vulnerable group because they are older so we still need to get vaccine vaccination rates for our elderly higher than where they are today in fact in some places they have already achieved more than 90 vaccination coverage for the elderly population so we still have some room to go and as you heard just now if you look at what happened recently in bukit mera where there was a super spreader event and many of the people who were infected were elderly persons this can easily happen in any other part of singapore because we know there's still underlying transmission there are still unlinked cases you cannot rule out the possibility that new clusters will emerge in fact this may very well happen and it could happen in an area where there's a high concentration or a high proportion of elderly persons and if many of them are not vaccinated then we will end up with more severe consequences because they will have severe illness hospitalization and icu rates will go up and unfortunately under such a scenario fatalities may rise too so we must do everything we can to avoid such an outcome and the best way to avoid it is once again to appeal to all our elderly persons in singapore all our seniors get yourselves vaccinated we have simplified the process for you to get vaccinated you don't need to book in advance just walk into a center and you can get yourself jabbed and we appeal also this call also goes out to everyone who has an elderly parent right if you have an elderly parent who is not vaccinated yes yet please engage them persuade them to get vaccinated bring them to the center to get them jabbed you will be doing a lot to keep them safe so don't take the view that oh it's okay my elderly parent only stays at home so i'm not going out so much it's all right because you may have people visiting your elderly parent and any visitor may well bring the virus into the home so please engage your parent get them vaccinated as soon as possible finally we will continue to synchronize our reopening plans with our vaccination rates so this applies as you heard just now beyond two thirds of people in singapore fully vaccinated we want to get higher and we are also aiming for a much higher proportion of elderly persons being vaccinated and as we achieve these targets we were progressively we will be able to progressively continue in a confident manner with our reopening plans over the coming weeks and months and in the longer term with our roadmap towards living with covet normally thank you thank you i'll now invite questions from the media thank you ministers and dms dear members of the media please be informed that the press release had been issued and that a final version will be sent later we will now begin the q a segment members of the media please remember to use the raise hand function on zoom if you would like to ask a question and a reminder to keep to one question per media only if you are called upon you will be prompted to unmute yourself so please do so accordingly maybe we have the first question from st hi good afternoon ministers dms thanks for the briefing a few days ago we know that india declared this new delta plus variant a variant of concern in india and it's also been detected in britain so um we'd like to know have such cases been spotted in singapore and how concerned are we about this new variant thank you thank you very much for the question just to clarify the delta variant is what is the viral variant of concern that has been uh acknowledged and categorized by the whole there have been several uh mutations that have been reported uh of this base delta variant uh of which there are at least two versions uh and and one version the a y one uh version uh is associated with one particular mutation k417n mutation that's been reported mainly in europe a second version which is called the ay2 variant has been reported in various places but mainly in the u.s neither of these variants have been reported in singapore we have not seen this so-called delta plus variant and at this point in time there's insufficient information to determine whether it should be categorized as a variant of interest or variant of concern but we will continue to monitor the situation for every case that we diagnose where possible we will be carrying out phylogenetic studies and look out for the specific variant causing these infections and we will certainly be on the lookout for any delta plus variant as it has been reported but so far this has not been seen in singapore next question thank you dms we will now take the next question from super from sao paulo hi afternoon ministers and dms this is children from zaobao so malaysia announced on monday that singapore might recognize their contact tracing app my serger terra as malaysia's vaccination passport so could the minister share some updates on the progress of these discussions and also since thank you tiffany included all right thank you we continue conversations with all countries as we we repeatedly say um i think there's a lot of interest whether it's malaysia each time there is some news of one particular country i can understand and appreciate the interest these conversations continue and and as and when we have any updates we will let people know what the updates are but beyond the specific country sort of updates we as i said are also separately working on guidelines for people in singapore to travel and those guidelines will be in due course issued put out to the public so that then you will know for different categories of countries depending on their risk profiles depending on how you know the infection rates in these countries potentially you will be able to travel there and come back like i said either without shn at all or with a shortened shn so that's something that we are working on and we will be putting out details in due course just at the point when you do something like launch a air travel corridor um whether for everyone or for vaccinated travelers that's like taking an exam so it's a big thing but discussing recognizing each other's digital certificate that's just like doing homework right and just getting the homework done uh while envisioning that someday you may open up some form of air travel arrangement yeah so i think all these homework should be done right now uh to as with as many partners as possible just getting the paperwork and the recognition mutual recognition sorted out thank you ministers we will now take the next question from jin zhang mothership hello thank you all so much for the press conference um so i just want to check whether we have a target potent a target percentage that we are aiming for um for vaccination in order for us to achieve her dignity or to explore um kind of air travel and how we plan on reaching higher vaccination rates other than outreach if there's any other unconventional ideas like some other countries that don't have lottery things are winning winning certain items for us to achieve those higher vaccinations thank you um on the targets we have announced what we can announce for now and i think we have set something quite ambitious around national day two-thirds of our population being fully vaccinated so that it will be the milestone that we are working towards but as i mentioned just now is actually not enough we need to go further than two-thirds especially given the transmissibility of delta virus delta variant and for the elderly go even beyond that so as to what kind of milestone will be attacked to what kind of opening and changes in shifting practices i think it will be part of the road map that we are preparing and working out but i would caution this that this there's still a lot of unknowns and this enemy is full of curveballs always thrown at us so we are really crossing the river one stone at a time yeah so right now i think we know the steps we know some of the milestones that we can achieve through our vaccination exercise and how we now marry the two to come up with a viable roadmap as for whether we should lottery i think i asked my colleagues to talk about it well first let me uh also elaborate on the point that uh for traveling we have to bear in mind that it is not just our own local vaccination rate that matters it is also important to take a look at the countries where we have this traveling arrangement with if they have a very high vaccination rate of course that gives us a greater confidence to open up travel channels with them if their cases are low and they are able to control the infection well it also gives us a greater confidence to open up with them but if their vaccination coverage is low and their cases are still rising very rapidly even if we have a very high vaccination rate we all we need to continue to be careful in our in allowing our travelers from that particular destination so it's a a a multiple uh first faceted uh multifaceted approach it's not just single factor we have to encounter several factors in deciding the level of vaccination that we need in order to open up to other countries and you we will have to take a differentiated approach depending on the different countries just a final point we will continue to do everything we can to ramp up vaccination rates increase the take up i don't think at this stage we want to rule out any option but as minister ong said we do it step by step so as i mentioned the next step first of all we are now having the vaccines available we are offered to everyone as soon as we can second step we will talk about revised guidelines for vaccinated persons we have not put those out yet so we'll eventually quite soon have these revised guidelines what vaccinated persons will be able to do within singapore and how they can travel more freely i think that in itself may encourage more people to be vaccinated we hope and then beyond that we will see who are the remaining groups who still do not want to take the vaccine for whatever reasons even after our persuasion our volunteers calling up and what other ways we can get them to take it up it may not be simply a matter of monetary incentives there could be other barriers that may be you know impeding or causing them not to want to take up the vaccination we need to understand better what their concerns are so we are going to do this step by step sequentially and do our very best to get vaccination rates as high as possible thank you ministers we will now take the next question from chun lin reuters hi ministers um so as communicated earlier there are two destination mouses in singapore the first one two thirds of population fully resonated uh by august night and the second one is everyone by end of this year so we would like to ask what restrictions we will be east after um this august milestone and what will be is further by year end when everyone is fully fascinated for example can we actually expect that um the revised public health guidelines for vaccinated person on social gathering by the august milestone yeah thank you well we are you are really asking us what the road map is which is work in progress and something we will be revealing or sharing in due course you are absolutely right that like we said there is a milestone in national day but even before that as i mentioned we will look at the next stage of opening because we still have to move to five persons potentially by mid-july right and that's something that we are watching and pretend we we will consider whether or not what exactly when is the timeline for us to make that move to five persons for the higher risk activities beyond that as i mentioned we are looking at the guidelines for vaccinated persons what can be done for vaccinated persons both in singapore and for travel and then yet beyond that there will be other easing potentially as we reach two thirds fully vaccinated and provided our elderly population gets a very high level of vaccine coverage but just a clarification clarification uh we have not set any milestone for year end yeah uh we set one around national day two thirds fully vaccinated year end was what we had said before that we won we will have you know the vaccines available to everyone by the end of the year right and as you can see with the bringing forward of supplies we will be able to offer it to everyone well before the end of the year the actual take-up of course depends not just on supplies but on individuals themselves and that's why we will continue to work hard at persuading everyone in singapore to take up the vaccine i should add that uh um we are not also not saying that once we achieve a certain target you know everything will be open and we are free to do everything so it's not likely to be a big bank uh approach to opening it will still be uh uh cautiously and progressively open step by step to ensure that we remain safe bearing in mind particularly that's why we are so concerned about vaccination rate among the seniors because today they are protected because of the safe distancing measures that we have put in place so we have kept the transmission generally low because of these safe distancing measures but once we are vaccinated we have achieved a high level of vaccination some of these uh safe distancing measures will then be east east of so that we are allowed we allow more activities to resume but we have to be aware that once we allow more activities to resume the risks will go up those who are vaccinated will continue to be protected by vaccination but those who are not yet protect not not yet vaccinated especially the seniors actually they will face a higher risk of vaccination and higher risk of severe disease outcome as we remove these safer distancing measures so that is why it is very important for us to encourage our seniors to get vaccinated even as we plan towards opening progressively as our vaccination rate overall vaccination goes up so we need to continue to press on with uh encouraging our seniors to get vaccinated so that they can be protected as we ease off the safe distancing measures thank you ministers may we have the next question from christine bbc hello i just as you look at the reopening timeline i just want to understand whether there were any economic factors or burdens or pressures that you are also looking at for singapore because it's been some time now what benchmarks or factors or sectors are you considering if so in particular yeah i think economic consideration is a key factor uh as well but currently i think our focus is on public health to ensure that we are able to open safely and vaccination is one key strategy towards that objective but economic consideration is always important as you pointed out we have been restricted in many ways for quite a long time particularly a lot of our projects construction projects are not able to proceed because of the lack of skilled workers many of them came from overseas sources and we need to find a way to allow them to return to singapore so that projects can proceed and even our domestic helpers domestic workers we also need sources of these domestic workers to resume so that we can have these migrant workers to help our families and there are a lot of export-oriented industries they also have orders to fulfill and many of these sectors are also under stress because they have limited access to a manpower and this is an area that we will need to look at how we can help them to resume their activities even domestically uh with the safe distancing measures some of the economic activities are still not able to resume fully uh fmb sector is one hotel and tourism related industries sector is another one some of these sectors will not be able to open until we are able to reach a high level of vaccination so that we are able to resume these activities safely fmb we probably will be able to resume to some extent when we allow a cap of five persons to dine in but of course i i know the fmp operators really hope that we can resume to at least eight packs like what we had before in a phase three or eventually allow 10 packs per table or remove the limit if we can so i think we have to move in that direction but it all depends on the pace at which we can achieve a high level of vaccination so vaccination is still the key to our opening of our economy thank you minister we will take the next question from hui min china news asia digital thanks for taking my question so as we look towards preparing singapore to you know like live with endemic of it has mlh men monitoring what's been called long covered in other countries so you know like monitoring earliest cases from 2020 and have there been any cases in singapore and are they of concern to mrh thank you very much thank you very much for the question long covet syndrome has been described in several different countries and we still don't have a good uh firm grip in terms of what causes long-covert syndrome how it manifests and and and how we can address the degree of disability that some recovered cases have as a result of long conv syndrome ncid has been looking at this and has been following up all recovered cases in our public hospitals and have also been trying to study this particular issue i think that they may be ready soon to provide further information on on what the prevalence of long-covet syndrome is in in in singapore i don't have any specific information today that i can share with you but when we have that available we will let you know this is one of the consequences of covet-19 infection and reinforces the concern that covet-19 infection is not something just like a common seasonal flu there are some patients who have severe outcomes a long uh permanent uh disabilities to some extent and and um and these uh adverse secretly lasting for long periods of time it's not something to to to to underplay there are also uh ending dota reports have suggested that vaccination interestingly enough uh also provides some uh remedy from long cove syndrome some long-standing sufferers of of a long-coveted syndrome have reported improvement in their uh in the symptoms they they experience after vaccination and this may potentially be another reason to encourage even recovered cases to seek vaccination but as more clinical information becomes available we will try to bring this out to the media thank you dms we will take the next question from polling channel 8. ministers and dms pulling from canada in syria we see that the vaccination rate for most of the groups actually increases the last update except for the elderly group which remains around 75 why is this so i mean despite us allowing seniors to actually walk in and actually just now uh mr wong mentioned that those above 70s are below 70 percent of rates so why is this so and how are you guys planning to reach out to them we appreciate if we can get an answer in chinese because a lot of our elders actually are chinese speaking thank you in chinese um um thank you ministers we will have the next question from atiyah verita haryan hi ministers ndms um earlier minister ghan mentioned about um allowing migrant workers um coming back to singapore will there be extra precautions uh or measures um that will be taken to ensure that they'll be there won't be like you know a certain uh spike um um or things like that and and and how will this also change when you know when we go go on the enjoyment path thank you i think you're right that in fact mom ministry of manpower ministry of trade industry and the various ministries are working together to continue to strengthen our precautionary measures with regard to migrant workers both at the entry point as they enter singapore the process of the stay home notice that they serve as well as safety precautions at the dormitory as well as the workplaces we continue to enhance these measures to ensure they are able to arrive safely stay in the dormitory safely even in the community some of them stay in the community do so safely and they are able to go back to work in a safe way so these are measures they will continue to enhance improve over time and as other countries the source countries vaccination also goes up and if they are able to continue to control and manage their infection in these countries i think we will also be able to increase the number of migrant workers that are allowed to come in so we are also working with a source country to introduce measures at the source country level to prevent the importation of kobe 19 cases so i think we need to take a multi-pronged approach to ensure that we are able to open uh the border for more migrant workers to arrive safely and this is very critical for our economic activities to resume thank you minister we will now take the next question from waitia dh ministers dms i wanted to simply ask that uh we have some anadoctol stories for the younger group of people going for the pfizer vaccine instead of the modena vaccine because of the side effects i would like to ask uh have the mtf actually seen uh any of this trends and uh what and now any measures does it intend to convince people that you know it is actually still the same uh thank you very much for your question uh you're asking about more people opting for the pfizer vaccine compared to the modern vaccine and whether or not we've actually tracked adverse effect rates determine whether or not they are any different we have been looking at adverse events for all the vaccines that we've been administering and that would be both sufficer as well as moderna vaccines and at this point in time we've not picked up any signal that suggests there's a higher overall adverse event rate associated with the modern vaccines compared to the fisa vaccine so effectively they're both the same as far as efficacy is concerned as well as the adverse effect or side effect profile and we have therefore been encouraging all to get vaccinated with whatever vaccine is available given that our vaccines were coming in in different batches at different points in time we previously had either the fisa vaccine being in more readily available and at other times the moderna vaccine is more readily available and our message has always been that whatever vaccine is available please feel free to register and take up these vaccines neither vaccine is necessarily better than the other there are specific indications and contraindications that are different for example now as we extend vaccinations to the younger people we're using exclusively the pfizer vaccine simply because the fisa vaccine has been approved for use in younger in children between the ages of 12 and and and 18 whereas the modern vaccine currently is still registered for use in individuals above the age of 18. so other than these regulatory restrictions there is no significant difference between the fisa and modern vaccines and whatever vaccine is available i would encourage uh all who are able to register then to register for either vaccine thank you dms we'll take the 10th question of this afternoon from sure me cctv hi minister i just checked because during the two past two weeks hong kong's case is very low even though zero do you think it's a possible to do you think it's impossible to to allowed the hong kong travelers to singapore no need to parenting even reach out to the bubble travel thank you so we have a framework today already as you know that allows that you know categorizes countries according to their risk their infection rates and for the countries where the infections rates are very low lower comparable or even lower than where singapore is and the situation is well under control we do allow the travelers from these places to come to singapore without shn that framework is in place we continue to review um update the countries based because the situation is so fluid and dynamic sometimes countries that are in this category may drop down and then you will impose sh n sometimes countries that are of places that are not in this category the situation improves and as it improves over time we were so-called upgraded to this uh the the low risk category where then they will be allowed to travel into singapore without shn so we will provide updates in due course thank you minister we will now take the last two questions of this afternoon maybe take the penultimate question from songlin smdn oh hi ministers okay so um i understand that a booky mara cluster has also led to a lot of like secondary infections so um is it possible to maybe comment on the rate of how you guys are actually containing it right now um i'm not quite sure what you mean by rate but certainly uh we've been uh working very hard to limit the further spread of uh kofi-19 infection within the area of bukit mira extending on into the tango barrow area on the east side and the radio area on the west side our testing has been guided by where the cases are and when we map up where the areas of where people move to movement tracing and activity mapping we've also extended very strategically the boundaries of our testing to include these areas in order to ensure that we've not also missed out various nexus of activity that may be contributing towards cryptic spread we've been using wastewater testing as a sentinel surveillance to pick up where possibly further cryptic transmission may lie and have been directing some of our testing operations accordingly and this has allowed us then to extend our testing envelope to include areas for example uh in the uh the greater bukit area extending to the red hill area as well and we will continue to to look at all these signals to determine whether there are areas where we have missed and where we need to continue to be very vigilant on not only are we testing close contacts but in these areas where we want to exclude cryptic spread we've also made it available to all well worried in these areas to step forward and where the signal is much stronger supported by multiple cases or even the wastewater test signals we've made it mandatory for residents in specific blocks within these areas to step forward for testing and we made testing very available we are studying further strategies how we can make testing more accessible for all in this area and when our plans mature we'll make these announcements in due course thank you dms can we have the final question from you tin today all right so right now it seems like our demand for vaccines exceeds supply but does the task force anticipate that the rate of vaccination might plateau at some point and also will households with unvaccinated members live how they would live in a new normal were these unvaccinated individuals be at a disadvantage so for instance they won't be able to attend certain events or they had to undergo for more routine testing and the last question is thank you i i think the laws of demand and supply must mean that as we vaccinate 80 000 doses at which administer 80 000 doses a day from this weekend onwards there will come a point in time that the supply keep increasing the demand keep being met and then at some point uh instead of demand more than supply the situation will flip right and that is something that we are working towards and at that point of course you will have something that's asymptotical and you find that and we are seeing that amongst the elderly where after 75 you find the last 25 is harder to get to and i think this will happen uh at some level once we reach a certain level for the rest of the population and as minister lawrence wong mentioned we will have to work out some form of norms where certain activities if you are vaccinated you can take part if you are not maybe you need a test and other travel as travel benefits as well if you are vaccinated we know that more likely you are promote you are protected you are not likely to be infected and pass an infection to others and likewise then therefore from public health point of view it will make sense to start to have some differentiation uh and as as we reach an endemic state which is what minister wong talked about just now i think as we press ahead with our vaccination program at some point the vaccination rate will plateau off we hope that we will plateau off at a very high level so that the bulk of singaporeans would have been vaccinated and protected rather than to plateau off at a lower level again as i said our particular concern is among the seniors we hope that it will continue to climb and so far since the last we have announced a walk-in vaccination without having to register register we have seen an increase in the number of seniors stepping forward to get fascinated i think we hope to continue to do so and we also plan for additional outreach programs and efforts to reach out to these seniors to encourage them to come forward to be tested and i urge our fellow singaporeans to also especially our family members encourage our senior family members to also get vaccinated and this way we will able to ensure a high vaccination rate among our senior population this will provide them with the necessary protection especially especially as we progress to gradually open up our economy and our community this will ensure that they will continue to be safe even as we move into endemic situation ,True,True,False,False

The move coincides with plans to resume more activities in the coming months. Up to 80,000 doses will be given out daily, 70 per cent more than the current number. The COVID-19 multi-ministry task force said that is possible because delivery of vaccines has been brought forward.

Launched on July 15, 1845, its comprehensive coverage of world news, East Asian news, Southeast Asian news, home news, sports news, financial news and lifestyle updates makes The Straits Times the most-read newspaper in Singapore.",i graduated just thrusted into like the working world as quick as possible and you just keep fixating on something that you can't solve not knowing how secure your job is at this point in time is very scary waking up on days just feeling like there are too many problems to tackle and that was not something that i had ever felt before in my life [Music] even with all the stipends that's been being given by the government you're being told by your parents that it's not enough and that like eventually your savings might run out everywhere else is telling you that like oh yeah stay calm like it's a pandemic you shouldn't be too hard on yourself but the reality is is that there's that pressure that you need to get a job as quick as possible like get back that stability that has been taken away from you sort of start feeling like you're caged and trapped and the feeling can often be that there are very little options for you to take and very little control that you have over your own life there were a couple of days where i had a few breakdowns and that's when i realized hey maybe this is something that needs to be addressed and i actually went and reached out to a counselor i would not be able to like do my work properly like i would get tired whilst doing my work halfway so i think that's when i decided okay i need to get help so when you talk about mental disorder we're talking about the scenario where the individual is having difficulties functioning he or she will need some professional help to get back on track so without that help right he cannot snap out of it by himself of course then there will be those who are not to the point of a disorder so what that signifies is that the brain has not gone into a fixed state in those circumstances sometimes they may be able to self-help in order to get their anxiety better [Music] i think once i was able to spot these things happening i knew what i had to do i knew what steps i had to take it's definitely not easy even it's the second time around but just slowly getting out of bed brushing your teeth making yourself a nice meal like that's the small things you do to really get through the day you just feel worried all the time like it's constantly at the back of your head thankfully for me i have close friends and families who i can just go to them and tell them what i'm feeling or what i'm going through i usually just take it in take a deep breath and just try to put things into perspective certain things are just beyond our control and what we can do is to just move forward [Music] i think the more i'm open about it the more i can try to normalize these kind of conversations and i'd rather that people feel safe approaching me because i would love to help them i try to talk about it as much as i can because it's perfectly normal for you to go to visit and i want people to know that they're not alone in this [Music] of course the older generation they would tell their younger folks to just you know snap above it and many times the younger folks do feel quite frustrated with that approach best way to go forward really is to have a very open conversation to try to educate their parents or their seniors in the family mental health is really a lot like physical health one is being able to be comfortable opening up to someone but the second is also recognize that hey i need help [Music] [Music] you ,True,True,False,False

almost like wargames to get the public as well as the professionals prepared in an enema state of constant readiness I think that all of these have pretty helped us as we as we try to deal with the cover 19 outbreak and I understand contact tracing is also very sophisticated in Singapore the public are provided updates very regularly I know I would say that the contact tracing there is some element of really technological sophistication but a lot of it is really down to just fairness and applying enough sources and here I think Singapore has done very well it has mobilized not just Health Ministry officials but we have also mobilized the police force and other resources to help with the contact tracing and almost an an hour-by-hour basis on the 24/7 we have managed to get hold of every case and trace the close contacts and do the necessary contact tracing so I would say that we have been helped by the technology but it's really around the particular lessness and being very very thorough about it and simple as yet to close schools what's the reasoning behind this well we have decided to knock law schools really because there is limited evidence so far that this will help given the law infection amongst children locally and closing schools it's very disruptive from a societal point of view and is really striking that right balance of what up the public health benefits versus the societal dis well disruptions but that's it Singapore has been preparing for this possibility schools are all fully prepared to move into online learning and students and parents are constantly being cautioned that that that we might close schools and hence the disruption would then be minimized at what point will Singapore close schools well I would say that we would seriously look at it when we have wide spread with the community transmission that is unlinked to any of the current cases then to break this cycle the option to close schools would then become very very real and very seriously looked at now the island state has managed to avoid covered 19 related deaths so far what would you put this down to is it the health care system is it educating the public on how to mitigate risks is it a combination of these well it's it's it's likely this a combination of all of these and a healthy dose of just plain old luck we've been aggressive right from the early stages in all the measures that we had discussed but if we look at Singapore's rates of admission into the intense of care units we're not very different from other countries and hence it does signal to us that the severity of the cases that we have been seeing are not different from many other countries and I then I think that nationally everyone from our prime minister down has been cautioning Singaporeans that that that some fatalities are probably in a visible and we should be mentally and emotionally prepared for this Singapore has a much smaller population than many European countries and the US can it's covered 19 policies be applied and be effective in areas with much larger populations well I would say that every country is is unique it's got its own geography its own political and health infrastructure but some lessons would be fairly universal and I think that what the Singapore experience really signals is that speed the effectiveness of the implementation trusted government trust between government and the people between government and business and the ability to make really dynamic changes in real time as the situation develops these are some of the critical ingredients that have helped Singapore so far and which other countries would you be most concerned about in terms of the handling of the pandemic well if we look at what the countries where the government has has exercised travel advisories these are the countries that we are probably most concerned about and we probably look at it from really - really domains one just how comprehensive the countries control measures have been and it's and the amount of Trade and people flow between Singapore and and ready these countries and hence yesterday evening the government announced a set of travel of border controls form for all of these Southeast Asian Nations so that's really a major concern to us around possible second waves dr.

However, because of a recent rise in infections in the community, there will be tighter safeguards in place and there is a staggered approach to the easing of some restrictions. Authorities said this will minimise the economic impact and buy time for more people to get vaccinated.

in february the health ministry says more will be progressively added at the same time singapore is to review vaccine data from chinese drug firm synovac before any possible rollout researchers in brazil are already reporting that cylovac is only 50 effective and for more professor dale fisher from the young lulin school of medicine joins us for more on this discussion professor the vaccination centers are they adequate in terms of numbers of location to vaccinate the population hi steve and orteli thanks for having me back um i i think you should uh it's also the uh the minister mentioned that it'd be poly clinics and and some gps would also be part of the program so so i think uh it's more about the target to vaccinate all singaporeans uh this year and i do think it's very uh realistic um singapore is very accessible uh there's no real geographic challenges we've got the technology to to manage the cold chain and and the data and and all the various steps along the vaccination uh pathway so so i think i think we can be confident that uh we're on a very uh realistic pathway so professor we know that uh you know more than six thousand people have already been uh vaccinated but in terms of hitting our target vaccinating everyone by the end of 2021 you see that uh see us being on target for that so again we're in a different situation in singapore we we obviously have control of the of the pandemic within our borders uh you really see countries like uk and u.s talking of targets because they've got that health emergency if you like so so there's good reasons that singapore's going forward uh with vaccination but i'm not so obsessed by targets of how many today how many this week it's more about ramping up the situation and gradually opening up more centers later the polyclinics and the gps it'll be incremental but as i just said i think the goal to vaccinate everyone this year is is uh is very realistic you do seem very confident in uh singapore's rollout uh researchers in brazil though are saying that china's sinovac vaccine's overall efficacy rate is much lower than earlier reported around 50 what does that imply and should we be concerned steve i'm actually more concerned about this drip feeding of information i think it's um it's quite ridiculous we've seen it going on for for so long um companies wanting to to give out good information phase one data phase two data but this uh different countries giving out different interpretations with no consolidation of the information no no verification my view of all this is let's just wait for the phase 3 data to run its course be published and then let's uh let's have a look at it um i i really don't care so much for for all these interim uh they're almost rumors sometimes um maybe it is less effective uh it's certainly uh made in a different way but uh perhaps it's got a specific role in a in a sub-population for for for instance so i'm really just waiting for publications in medically scrutinized journals and and then we have a thorough review of the uh of the data by authorizing bodies around the world and who and actually see uh what the role of of of these uh these vaccines are well in the meantime uh our minister lawrence wong has urged singaporeans to be vaccinated with uh an approved vaccine rather than you know hold out and wait for another brand what do you read into this message that he's trying to send listen i understand that people um are a little bit nervous they feel that it's been rushed out and there's plenty of opportunities for for bad press uh bad rumors anti-vaccination campaigns but really all the boxes for uh developing this vaccine have been checked um it's gone through the animal studies the phase one the phase two the phase three studies and authorization and scrutinization of data um normally when vaccines take longer it's because there's a lot of pauses along the way while companies go for more funding and things like that so i completely agree with what minister wong is saying it's hard to imagine getting a lot better than the than a vaccine with with a a very good safety profile uh 95 efficacy and and there's really no rational reason not to vaccinate and especially in singapore we're going to be conservative and not do it in the the groups we haven't seen the data on yet that's children pregnant women we're going to monitor people for 30 minutes afterwards to to look out for allergic reactions so really if if people want their old lives back and people want to travel we're not going to get there without hurt immunity so so i urge people to take the vaccine when when your turn comes um and uh and let's get on with this and just quickly you'll be doing likewise professor i'm scheduled for

71,I9oMTkBzzV8,CNA,Singapore recommends masks with better filtration capability as new COVID-19 variants spread,2021-05-18T10:44:24Z,"Singapore on Tuesday (May 18) updated its guidance on using masks, recommending that members of the public wear masks with better filtration capability amid an increase in local cases of COVID-19, likely due to new variants of the coronavirus. https://cna.asia/33ThwO0

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",um i would like to find out um what is wrong with the current masks being used and are they part of the reason behind the spread that we are seeing now karma's masks being used thank you well the there is nothing wrong with the current mask being used but what we are saying is based on the latest evidence of the new strains being more transmissible and the possibilities of aerosolized transmission that simply means that the mask that you wear for protection ought to be of higher filtration capabilities and that would mean wearing either a surgical mask or a reusable mask that is made of at least two layers of fabric this would include masks that have been issued by the people's association and thomasic foundation they have good filtration efficiency but if you were just to take a simple piece of cloth and cover your mouth that kind of a cloth mask may not have the same filtration capability and protective effect as a mask that has a higher level of filtration capability like a surgical mask or one of these higher quality reusable mask and so that is the updated mask advisory that we are putting out today dms can you elaborate further let's just add a few words before i hand over to dms i think it's probably useful to remind ourselves that the transmission of the infection is very often multi-factorial it's not just a particular reason a particular factor it's not just because the mass the quality of the mass is also because of the exposure because of the safe distancing that were put in place that we may be able to prevent the transmission so i think we have to take a look consider all the factors together as one basket of measures and not any particular measure so we are doing what we can to strengthen each of these factors whether it's through vaccination through strengthen safety sensing measures uh whether it's to us using a better mask and so on and contact tracing and so on i think this uh collection of measures that we have to put in place to strengthen our resilience against the infection dms indeed minister we've been looking very carefully at all the measures we put in place and all the exaltation and guidance we've given the public and at this time when we see additional community cases starting to come out and given that the public have been having to deal with covet 19 for the better part of 15 16 months there will come a time when we start getting fatigue complacent and we may not be necessarily as rigorous and disciplined in the protective measures we adopt for ourselves so it's timely at this point in time for us to do several things first of all to continue to remind members of the public to adhere to safe distancing the prevailing safe management measures wherever they go even though the current community restrictions are in place and to be meticulous about wearing their mask to be very disciplined and only to remove it if they are consuming food and drink but even then out of doors given the current restrictions to continually wear their mask that's important and since we are continuing to emphasize this it actually is timely for us also to relook at the mass advisories we give and we want to affirm and and emphasize that it is important to use good quality mass good quality mass one well and properly provide an excellent form of protection for all of us against how the virus spreads irrespective of whether it spreads by droplet or some form of aerosolized transmission wearing the good mask wearing it properly makes sense and is is the right thing to do so we're sharpening the guidance and advisories we're giving to make this clearer we encourage members of the public to use masks that are have adequate and decent filtration efficiency these would normally be printed on the side of the packaging or box that the masks have to give you assurance that the masks that you purchase or procure have that adequate and reasonable quality the masks that have been distributed in public and committee programs most if not all of them do fit that that standard but it's important that if you use disposal masks be aware that the must have a certain lifespan and after you've used them and washed them beyond the recommended number it's advisable then to change and replace those masks but you can use either the reusable uh mask or the single use disposable mask like a surgical mask and they do have adequate uh efficiency filtration effectiveness that is desirable we continue to discourage the use of masks that have exhalation vents these are masks that may make it more comfortable to use they may be more appropriate at times when there is haze and using the mask for those purposes but they would not be adequate from the public health and infection control perspective preventing infection spread if an infected person wears such a mass and there still continues to be a risk of droplet and aerosol transmission if a person sneezes or coughs from within those masks so we want you to wear a good quality mask a good quality mask worn badly it's not good it doesn't give you or the community any protection so wear that mask properly and use a proper mask ,True,True,False,False

74,KWmO8sTjuwU,CNA Insider,Singapore’s 3 COVID-19 Vaccines – And Is One Better Than The Others?,2021-01-08T08:08:35Z,"Singapore has ordered the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac vaccines as the first three of its portfolio in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

ALSO WATCH: Is the vaccine safe? Your questions answered https://youtu.be/QhKiopuZbtg

Both the Pfizer-BioNTech (also in use in Britain and the US) and Moderna (used in the US) vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology that involves injecting snippets of the COVID-19 genetic code, triggering an immune response without actually exposing the patient to the virus. Both vaccines are said to have an efficacy rate of about 95%. 

The China-made Sinovac vaccine uses an inactivated COVID-19 virus to trigger an immune response. There is a lack of specific results on its efficacy at the moment. As of January 7, 2020, the Sinovac vaccine has not been used in any country. 

Co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong tells #TalkingPoint why the Singapore Government convened an expert panel as early as April 2020 to look into early purchases of COVID-19 vaccines based on early-stage clinical information.

Director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH) Vernon Lee said “all the vaccines approved in Singapore are safe and efficacious”, but that some may be more suited to certain subpopulations. The Pfizer vaccine for instance - the only one in use in Singapore as of Jan 8 - is not for use in those with severe allergic reactions.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] singapore has bought three types of vaccines physio biotech moderna and cyanovac both the pfizer biontec and moderna vaccines use what is described as messenger rna technology this involves injecting snippets of the corvette 19 genetic code into a patient put simply it's a recipe to direct the production of a specific part of the virus the spike protein to trigger an immune response without actually exposing the patient to the virus both vaccines are said to have an efficacy rate of about 95 percent china-made cyanobac vaccine on the other hand uses an inactivated corvid 19 virus to trigger an immune response when injected into a patient but there is a lack of specific results on its efficacy the pfizer biotech vaccine is already being used in britain and the u.s modernist vaccine only in the u.s as of 7th january cynovac is yet to be used by any country so the cylovac vaccine from china hasn't been as widely used and as we just heard there's no conclusive study on it yet so minister why did we pick that as one of the vaccines to be used in singapore well you have to understand that we started this process very early on as early as april we convened an expert panel chaired by our head of civil service to look at how we can make early purchases of vaccines for singapore we have to make early bets in order for singapore to be near the front of the queue for vaccines and at that time there is no clinical data available from any vaccine company in terms of full-fledged information only very early stage clinical information was available from all the many vaccine candidates they narrowed down to 35 and then they drilled down even more to look at safety effectiveness based on whatever preliminary data that was available then and eventually they decided on the tree and that's a tree that we have made advanced purchases for with the aim of building a diversified portfolio of vaccines that will be safe and effective for use in singapore and we have three now but that's not the end of it but which is safer injecting an inactivated virus or using the genetic code of the virus i think we must understand that all the vaccines that are approved in singapore are safe and efficacious so we're not looking at is one you know in a way safer than the other and and so on but right now the only vaccine that's available is the divisor by one tech vaccine at the same time you will see that once additional vaccines come on board there will be some vaccines that can be used in certain sub-populations for example divisor vaccine cannot be used in people who have severe allergic reaction it cannot be used at this point in children below 16 in pregnant women in severely immunocompromised individuals other vaccines might be able to be used in different populations so we need to wait for more information and it is which vaccine is more sort of applicable or relevant to that particular population if it's offered we would encourage people to get that [Music] vaccine you ,True,True,True,True

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",i wanted to ask the uh panel about uh the scenovac vaccines um uh essentially could you please tell us why uh singapore received shipments of the cenovak black sea before the hsa's authorization for for use especially given for the other vaccines that singapore did receive shipments arrived at least a week after hsa's authorization was is part of the issue the fact that singapore potentially was unable to turn down perhaps the sinovac vaccine because it uh wanted to avoid potentially upsetting beijing well uh us dms provides some more greater detail but essentially we have a supply contract with a supplier for synovic vaccine and when as part of the contract the delivery was made to deliver i think 200 000 doses to singapore and we take the delivery uh we allow that delivery to to arrive but we do not yet allow the vaccine to be used because we haven't approved the use hsa hasn't approved the usage and hsa continues to discuss with a supplier to get more detailed data to allow them to make a adequate full assessment so i think that's a situation the key is because we do have a supply contract and when the contract under the contract the delivery is made so we take the delivery but we do not allow it to be used for the time being pending approval from hsa and hsa is in the process of reviewing it but they are still pending additional data from the suppliers just before dms clarified i just wanted to perhaps clarify the timeline that you talked about and the comparisons made with the other vaccines because in fact it's not quite what you just described was not exactly accurate because we made advanced purchases for all three even before any approvals were made that we said that i think well uh late last year right before approvals were made there was a committee looking at the whole range of vaccines that were available and we said that we were making advanced purchases in a way and putting some bets in some vaccines recognizing that some of these vaccines may not turn out to be effective but we wanted to be able to do so early so that we would you know be relatively early in the queue and would be able to get some vaccines in for singapore so that was the basis in which we went about making these advanced purchases it was only after the purchases were made that the companies started completing their trials submitting data and then they were then subject to hsa's approval so that's actually the timeline and the process and as far as the hsa timeline is concerned or the hsa process i think dms can elaborate further yeah and also uh just before dms uh the fact that we take delivery also allow us to roll it up faster once approval is uh is a given rather than to have to wait for delivery again so i think that's the reason why we also took delivery for the first lot indeed to extend the comments made by both co-chairs we did make advance purchasing agreements with these three vaccine manufacturers sometime last year and this was in fact before the completion of all phase 3 studies associated with these vaccines and before other regulatory authorities had given their approval for these vaccines the advanced purchasing agreements included a timeline for when these vaccines will be provided and based on that time frame these vaccines would be delivered to singapore by the manufacturers in order to shorten the process by which approval would be done and to allow vaccines then to be administered to the population starting a vaccination campaign the health sciences authority uh designed a pandemic specific uh approval framework that allowed for data to be submitted to the authority as it was available there was no need to wait until all the data was in and to then submit that as one complete package and they could submit this in tranches to allow for work to be done to start that evaluation process early there's no compromise in the process of evaluation but these little tweaks to the system allow for evaluation to start early and then allow for the full process of assessment to be done before approval then is granted and it so happened for both the pfizer and modern vaccines that the data had been submitted in a timely fashion and it allowed the health sciences authority then to grant approval soon after uh or in it and just before these vaccines arrived on our shores and therefore there's a perception then that that the approval came and the vaccines then were delivered in short order but in fact this was based on a time frame that already had been planned for and committed to under the advanced purchasing agreements with the sinovac vaccine the delivery of the vaccines again was based on the purchasing agreement there was no coercion there's no influence by other bodies and and this has been a commercial uh contractual contractual agreement with the manufacturers themselves unfortunately in the data that had been submitted and the manufacturer had endeavoured also to to adhere to health sciences authorities approval framework and tried to give data in a timely fashion into the authority they hadn't submitted a complete package of all the data that was necessary to complete that evaluation process so the health sciences authority has gone back asked the manufacturer for more information and in the meantime continues to evaluate and process the data that's been submitted today but until uh that additional data is submitted the health sciences authority will not be able to complete its evaluation process and therefore would not be able to give it its provisional approval and until that approval from the regulatory authority is obtained we will not be using the cyanovac vaccine even though it's arrived in our shores because we want to assure all singaporeans that the vaccines have been fully evaluated deemed to be both effective and safe for use before we actually use it in our vaccination campaign

ado let me hand over to elena today elena over to you thank you very much christina really nice of you to kick start this important event and i'll welcome everyone disability is high on the diversity agenda and um it's for many companies health is one of the highest causes of disability in the world today and it causes companies billions of losses each year due to employee absenteeism lack of productivity and innovation the world health organization estimates that 10 of the global population suffers from some form of mental illness which means it's one of four of us is affected unfortunately stigma and taboo surrounds in mental health making it a poorly understood topic across the world and asia is not an exception fear and traditional beliefs prevail preventing many that are impacted by mental health issues from reaching out and receiving help that they need not seeing the apparent demand and not knowing how best to approach the sensitive subject unfortunately few companies today are addressing this critical aspect of employee well-being in their organization so to get us started and to set up the scene i would like to ask professor funk to share with us the landscape of the mental uh health sector in singapore and some of the common mental health conditions but particularly those that are increased over the recent years thank you elena i hope everyone can hear me um and i my slides are up okay i'm just gonna start off give us some background to what's happening and perhaps uh then we could leverage uh and speak on mental health and mental illness now the impact of this pandemic on mental health firstly has caused a lot of concerns because there's ex expression of the increased prevalence of illnesses and problems associated with economic recession job loss even family violence and abusive behaviors in lockdowns where people are kept at home at the same time there's concern that people because of that isolation may uh if they were emotionally unstable resorts to three sides this actually is data that uh we have in our institute looking at patients that we take care for at this point i don't think suicides are on the rise but suddenly we are monitoring the numbers and that's of concern at the same time uh the very providers of healthcare that are looking after our population are under tremendous amount of stress because this is a new virus we do not know how it works and what are the implications on life in general and there are risks and fears that people have so in fact in the study between singapore and india we compared the groups interestingly in india um you know depression and anxiety is slightly higher than uh in singapore where post-traumatic stress disorder was significant and i know it's a busy slide just just take my word for it it's quite significant and it's it's of concern uh certainly for us because workers if they are not able to manage themselves and uh suffering from some degree of stress would not be able to function and and truly in this study they actually showed that there's a higher um complaints of things like headaches throat pain apart from the the usual emotional aspects of insomnia tightness and lethargy and even anxiety alongside this process is what's happening in the world uh i had a quick scan of the literature this is a couple of studies one is in china where it looked at people returning to work well 10.8 percent of respondents suffered from ptsd or post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to work but returning to work did not actually cause an increase in psychiatric symptoms that means illness itself or mental illness didn't arise i'll talk to this a little bit later more executives are practicing hand hygiene and more workers avoided sharing utensils which is a good thing infection control measures were in place in fact another study this one looked at what's the real stress behind all of this it's actually financial stress this is the primary mediator for emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes so these are important points so what has happened since the pandemic the old normal this is what's happening in our hospitals number of admissions the hospital has been moderated the outpatient clinics the specialist uh outpatient clinics people were not coming forward as much emergencies were coming down because there was fear in the air this was in healthcare outside of healthcare i mean what our old normal was really meeting up and and um getting together in meetings and having collaborative face-to-face meetings had to change in fact digitalization working from home home-based learning for children and telly everything i mean we're having a webinar right which we would have been unheard of but we have a meeting in a room with lots of people it's changed it's changed the way we provided healthcare it's changed the way we've worked in our offices and and zoom is very well known i've used zoom so many times in the last i'm kind of over zoomed actually and it's a it's it's not a good thing so what is the mental health approach we have to take in this context first i want to talk a little bit about mental health because it's an area that is quite important and sometimes poorly understood now in the population and providers like myself as doctors and clinicians we are one end of what i call a pyramid the other are patients people who already have mental illnesses now mental health affects the general population what is mental health mental health is not merely an absence of illness it's actually a very overarching well-being concern now very often we are well we'd like to think that majority of us don't have much stress but some of us do and when stress increases we start to have this stress and we start to have problems these are mental health related issues on the other hand mental illness is slightly different this is a biological problem it's not a reaction to stress this very often have genetic um and and brain related abnormalities and they have to be treated by professionals that is about i think christina said or is it elena who said one and four i think in singapore the data is about less than one in one in five but um but it depends on where you do the prevalence studies and of course in mental illness there's mild illness and moderate illness and severe illness here in the institute of mental health we deal with mostly the moderate to severe illness so the percentage is much lower now what this slide actually shows is that there is you can have mental illness and you can have mental health issues they are not necessarily on the same dimension but they're in the same pyramid and severe mental health problems doesn't necessarily translate into mental illness the other piece of course is you can have a mental illness and be still in good mental health that means you are happy with your life your illness is under control very much like someone with diabetes or hypertension you're on treatment you're fine so it's important to understand the role of stress in this this is just a singapore mental health study looking at figures so one in seven is a lot lower than the one in four but that's our local data in singapore now what can we do what are the kind of services that are needed for our patients people with mental illness i think now because of infection control measures we need technology to enable the management uh and for um in the hospitals i think trying to manage trauma is important because post-traumatic stress disorder is very much associated with what's going on in and everyone's scared and frightened and fearful um and then of course there is the possible mental illnesses that may result from covet what we know of covet 19 is that we think it's a respiratory disorder actually it's an autoimmune it's a immune response disorder that causes an inflammatory process that can occur in the brain as well you're not sure on the mental health side of things there is need to provide firstly some guidance on health and how to seek help i think some of the other speakers on the panel will speak more on this but i just you know broadly say there needs to be both live support which is synchronous and asynchronous information needs to be available for the public so they know where to get help and what to do when they are in distress at the same time in the longer term i think there is importance to first train mental health professionals and even general health professionals to manage mental illnesses in general and reduce the stigma for the population at large psychological first aid and mental health literacy to understand mental health concerns do not necessarily translate the mental illness and what are mental illnesses in the first place to really manage issues like anxiety and depression as a whole in the workplace most of the issues are not around mental illness it is around mental health how do you manage stress because now there's a lot of changes in work processes working from home economic recession job loss social distancing and isolation is not a good thing if you don't meet your co-workers how would you feel as a team so you need to be able to manage emotions have coping strategies social support and social linkages within the workplace that's important how can you do that can you respect the safety dignity and rights of individuals but adapt and consider cultural aspects particularly in this part of the world be aware of infection control how to look after yourself and when to seek help when that is needed i went a little fast because i want to complete within the 10 minutes and i'm kind of done uh as an introduction to how we can support the workforce thank you very much i'm gonna stop the sharing thank you very much professor thank you um so what i'm recollecting is that um public and organizational education um has created an awareness around mental health and uh we can indeed uh go and find lots of information online and that's good because more understanding will facilitate our empathy and open-mindedness furthermore compassionate and compassionate communication could help those affected by mental health and bring them closer to those that can help so with that i'm turning to leanne a question to you are you seeing more people seeking help for mental health conditions and especially during circuit breaker how have the npos and charities been supporting its clients and beneficiaries uh especially during this period over to you hello everybody good afternoon i'm leanne from singapore association for mental health uh i'm happy to be with you here today to share a little bit uh on what we observe on the ground as a social service uh provider uh for mental health services um during this uh whole period of covic and circuit breaker we like many corporates um from the social service side actually do seek a lot of happenings in that sense to people uh and about their everyday uh daily life and their work life uh the experience they go mental health issues that come up as a result um simple association for mental health actually uh we have 10 services we started operation in 1968 and we have always been focusing on promoting mental wellness for all and our services range from community engagement education raising awareness about mental health issues to providing creative services to help people to manage their anxiety promote mental wellness and more importantly we also have rehabilitation services where we support people in recovery of mental illness so uh just uh to contextualize um some of the things that um daniel had shared um we all know that from the last 2016 survey one in seven um singaporean here would actually experience a mental health condition in their lifetime and um from a psychosocial perspective um we look at mental health as a continuum and um daniel has said that um being uh men having a mental illness does not necessarily mean that people have poor mental health and actually uh not having a mental illness does not also mean that we have uh good mental well-being so uh when we look at it uh from uh continuum uh at different point we could be experiencing a different kind of um feelings and emotional well-being on the green side on the healthy side we could be happy uh generally very satisfied with life and um meeting our aspiration and emotionally more balanced but sometimes when trouble takes place or stresses come in we could be in the yellow and the amber zone where we actually um our life can be a bit disturbed and there's more anxiety and we may not sleep well uh i'm sure you you can actually some of you may identify may be able to identify some of the symptoms that come about and uh it really depends on our coping strategies and uh how can we build our own resilience towards uh managing ourselves back to the green state yeah and if if um we move along and we don't take care of ourselves well and um do not know where are the resources to support us uh we can go into the raid state where we actually can become sick physically we can have very destructive lifestyle we cannot be functioning very well in our activity of daily living so that is a time of concern so uh in in this whole continuum um there are scales for us to actually uh look at where we are and often time um from our social service experience um we we we don't have a medical treatment so we we do a lot of psychosocial intervention uh to support people uh so this this are some of the ways we we help people understand um that um we need to take care of our mental well-being right um during this whole period um before we actually went into circuit breaker um we are already in dos corn orange in late february and um all the social service agencies uh in fact uh have to come up with our business continuity plan and uh we were already planning and uh to go into split team uh and in fact for singapore association for mental health we started uh going on trial speed team just before um circuit breaker kicks in on 7th of uh april and what happened was um it although we have plans we have preparation uh we had a lot of meetings discussion and preparation with staff uh actually we were quite affected by this uh circuit breaker the first phase because um the instruction is all services have to close except for um very very frontline services like uh residential homes so out of our tent service we only have one service that can fully remain open 24 7. that is our group home in bukit batu where we run a residential service for people in recovery so all the other nice services we have to immediately plan how to provide continually provide our service to our beneficiaries and community through remote means so it was very challenging for us because um we do not have all the hardware support at those in the initial juncture and uh when we acquire the hardware we may we do not have all the apps and software and it took us a while to get out the subscription of all this zoom and way backs up so and what happened was uh the instruction was very clear that due to the protective measure and uh uh safe distancing measures uh there's no way we could see clients and uh we have to actually uh refer services to uh other frontline that are allowed to or considered um white listed agencies uh that can actually visit cases so it was very tough and um what what happened was uh subsequently there was a reverse i would say not maybe not a reverse decision but uh moh has taken into consideration the feedback and um there was a um a new um advisory that allowed with exemption uh some exemption to some services so we managed to uh get some exemption and some of our services are listed as whitelisted agency and uh we could provide minimum on on-site support to our service recipient so our counseling services we could actually let some of our staff with minimum staffing go back to the center and we are able to see some high risk cases during those period yeah so during clear spirit uh even as we as a service provider try to adapt and change to using virtual means to provide consultations as well as sessions and activities with our service recipients um not all our service user could actually benefit from the remote services mainly we take it for granted that uh while we are ready you know people at the other end should be able to actually um enjoy what they usually enjoy during the on-site support uh but many of our clients actually do not have the hardware and they can't afford to do subscription um so we actually also face that challenge with with our clients who we want to support and also there are clients and beneficiaries who prefer not to do all this virtual um link up with us because their home environment is not suitable they are home condition and home buyer environment is not super and some of them are not used to this kind of arrangements where they felt that their privacy can be compromised especially if they have to do it in their house and there's not enough space and private space for them to do so so um so there is quite a lot of adjustment that we have to do um so we resort a lot to telephonic support and declines right okay just just a bit on what is seen on the ground which actually could be mirrored in in the survey national survey that uh carried out um one of the market survey company actually uh can show their survey results uh and i think it was published in the press and that uh actually a quarter one in four uh respondents actually expressed their that they are their mental health is not so good and uh one of our our partners uh silver ribbon they also carried out a survey of 500 over respondents and anxiety and mood issues also surface as a concern um uh i think everybody is also aware there's this national care hotline that was um launched uh on 10th of um april uh so shortly after the launch uh towards the end of the month uh in early may they have released this report to show that uh actually within a short span of time there is 6600 calls and out of this 6600 calls 40 percent actually uh need more support and uh these calls are diverted to uh social service agencies and other um community support agencies that provide more dedicated support to people with mental health worries and concerns um scss also have a chat board called bell the chat and they also see an increase during this period circuit breaker period of people assessing the web to to actually ask questions and seek help so i think it is also consistent that mutually people raise concern and have said that they are stressed and anxious and they need emotional support just coming back to our own uh singapore association for mental health our own service uh our counseling service has a toll-free helpline where our counselors um pick up calls from anybody in the community during this period between april to june uh compared to the same period in 2019 we have a 50 percent increase in callers and uh among the the callers that uh new callers uh we actually see almost 40 of um callers in the age band of 21 to 40 years old um this is pretty telling about the situation on the ground in that this would be the group of people who possibly are working adults and uh because of having to work from home uh because of the movement restriction um they have actually suffered more mental health concerns and um what surface is also 25 about 25 of them actually express or they are depressed they have an anxiety and mood issues uh very stressed during this period um and also they have also raised issues about relationship for example uh one of the caller actually said that during this period is very stressful and she wants to break up with her boyfriend and also family issues came up we have callers who call that they they um having a lot of conflict because of everybody being at home uh and um they are also those callers who are worried about their family members or friends who are expressing depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation and um the callers who are caregivers caregivers who are during this period is very stressed because um they are unable to send their children to child care nor are they able to send their seniors to day care centers for their rehab so it's elena i need to a little bit cut you um someone asked is there a phone number that you could share where um you know where people can call and probably we need another 20 seconds to close your section sure all right i will uh show some numbers and resources at the last slide okay so so i i think we are all aware that we all play uh wear many hats and now we are at the same time uh stressed with having to adapt to the challenges and move towards a a more um adaptive new normal uh so i'm just sharing i have two more slides just sharing some resources for employees uh and as well as for employers um tafette has some some guidelines on how we can actually uh be more mindful of our mental health concerns and issues and support employees throughout this period and there's also a workplace well-being work group comprising national bodies as well as uh corporates and uh jeffrey myset is also one of the company who is a part of this work group they have come up with an e-guide on managing the organizations and working with employees throughout this period smh has also partnered a corporate chancellor and we come up with a infographic and we have posted in our social media uh to share with people how actually this whole period of stress actually actually is a very good learning experience and we can turn it to very positive development for our own um mental well-being and we can become more resilient over time and um my last like is really to show um this is not exhaustive but these are some of the possible places where you can contact or your employee can contact uh if they need support yeah thank you very much it's really it's really pleasant to hear that many progressive organizations took the chance of corvette which is unfortunate chance yes uh they showed their resilience and uh showed a really good ways to advocate for those uh who need help and dispelling of the of their um issues around the topic and you've mentioned jeffrey which brings me amazingly well to uh to our next speaker jeffrey i know that you devote yourself patiently to supporting this big course and i know that you have a daytime job and uh sort of a another job of working for with the charity mindset that jardine set up please share with us how you've been supporting the mental health community and what what advices can you give to smes great uh can you hear me and hopefully you can be able to see my screen as well okay now not yet not yet i'm not sure why it's not coming through uh but it's okay let me try and see if i can share that once again there you go and is that coming true yes okay great thank you very much for your time and for inviting um mindset and myself to this i think you've heard from uh from daniel and from lian maybe just a little bit of background on mindset before i jump to the last couple of slides so mindset is the charity that the judy madison group has established about nine years ago and you're probably wondering why mental health when we started in 2011 this was a totally un interesting underserved area you would find a lot of charities focus on health on physical health on disabilities on children on education but nobody wanted to talk about mental wellness or mental health because it was a very taboo area to be a part of but not talking about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and so one of the things that group has started out over the last nine ten years is to be able to try and raise awareness about mental health mental wellness and to be able to talk about it for those of you who are not familiar with mindset well these are the constituent businesses of the group in singapore and i'm sure some of them would be quite familiar with you you know from the genki sushis to the starbucks the cold storage hong kong land and mandarin oriental this is all part of the group that is behind mindset in the jardins group itself we've been recognized for our efforts over the years and we've been encouraged by this what's our focus our focus really is trying to do good and to be able to recognize that this is a journey we don't do it alone obviously we do it with our partners and co-collaborators um two of them are with me today dr daniel fong of course and and lee yen from samh and you'll find that there has been a growing awareness and a environment where more people are aware of this and are willing to come alongside and be a part of it so we don't do this alone we do this with all our social service agency partners and if you think about mindset as an organization it's actually only made up of two full-time employees everyone else who is involved in this effort is actually a volunteer or has got a daytime job doing something else like myself um how do we do this we do this by way of what we call jardine ambassadors so every year we've got 40 individuals who come alongside spend two years of their life to be a part of this venture and to be able to walk alongside with the activities that they have what are the activities awareness outreach getting people back into the workforce and this is important because part of this inclusiveness is to be able to get and accept people who may be suffering from mental health issues to be accepted within the workplace and that i think just adds to this whole thing about how do we have an inclusive community as a whole social enterprise and fundraising um again this chart shows apart from the numbers that have been contributed to our effort are the other partners you know from digital mindset to singapore association mental health institute of mental health i just wanted to highlight two particular flagship projects that we have launched in the last nine years the first is with the singapore citizen mental health called mindset learning hub happens about raising the importance of the workplace environment and how if you're a mental health person in recovery how important it is to be in a work environment because that gives you a sense of attachment belonging to be part of a local community and it adds towards your self-worth in terms of building that environment for for persons in recovery the other one which we embarked on last year is kind of interesting uh it's with touch community services and this focus is on pathological gaming but it also talks about addiction to the internet and all things internet and it's kind of interesting because if you think about the last couple of months um i for one have been totally addicted to the internet i i am walking through that addiction right now and participating on a daily basis whether it's a webex or a zoom or some form of video conference that i'm on um and and i think this is going to be in my in our view a growing area that we'll have to address as we go back into that new normal of how to be able to regulate between the internet virtual world and the real physical world itself um i i think it would be an interesting challenge for us as we make that transition this is the one chart that i i think if you forget about all the other charts that i've talked about hopefully it will stay with you and what i would call the four is um as employers i i think it's important for us to be able to set the tone of awareness if you are an employee you would not think twice about saying physical safety in the workplace is important and you need to be able to have a place where your employees come in and will not leave injured because you have got poor processes but i think the fundamental shift needs to be not just a physical safe workplace but also a supportive workplace that accepts and supports good mental health practices and mental wellness and and as lien and says there's a group of employers have come together in the last couple of years called work well uh there is a e-guide that you know helps with steps is how you can be able to do this at the workplace and again one thing that i like to highlight is that it is not as daunting as it looks to be able to take that first step because i i think today we do have that support structure that's out there and and well this is one the second a that i would like to highlight is what i call acceptance because when you talk about mental health issues oftentimes people tend to light up their eyes when you talk to somebody about mental health challenge that you have but it's not lighting up to help it's lighting up to step away because immediately you have got that stigma that comes around and say oh maybe you're not quite that okay and if you're not quite that okay maybe i should not be associating with you or if i leave a label with you then i look at you in a very different perspective altogether and i think in hopefully over the last uh a couple of months of this corporate pandemic you know it's been able to show that none of us are immune from the stresses and none of us are immune from some of this mental health challenges that we may have whether it's stress at work for working from home over the last couple of months on not being able to separate our personal lives from our work lives um activities i think it's important as employers in the employment and environment to be able to talk about this to promote this and to be able to address uh stress management um i like to particularly highlight self-care here and i put down there especially for leaders why do i say that because oftentimes as managers and leaders in the work environment we don't tend to take a like a superhero persona and say of course i can manage this of course i can deal with this but i think it's also important for us as leaders of the groups that we manage in the workplace to recognize that we've had to first take care of ourselves before we can take off somebody else and and it reminds me that you know not that long ago we used to have this activity called flying on an airplane if you recall that before kovit came around and and and one of the things that they'll tell you is that you know if we have a decompression and the air mass were to fall down help yourself first as the adult before you can be able to help your children or somebody else and i think that's a good reminder that we have to take care of our own mental health wealth being as well and and then finally the last a would be assistance i i think that as it's not just the social service agencies have recognized the government has recognized and so there is formal support mechanisms that's out there that we as in the work environment can be able to point out colleagues and team members too lien has shared some of that mind line is one that was just introduced not that long ago by the government and i think they are certainly tools and help that's available so from from that perspective i would just encourage everybody to think about the workplace in in this perspective and with this mindset of the four ways of awareness of acceptance of activities and of assistance uh yeah so those are the points that i i wanted to highlight and uh happy to take any questions thank oh you thank you jeffrey you can mute yourself um really very interesting i didn't realize we have so many things in common like addiction to internet and um so as a small question small follower question for you that came so um for a while we have been imagining what technologies could do for our future and today we are bombarded with information and a new term that we are hearing is digizofrenia and it's said to be linked very heavily with mental health could you comment on uh probably the biggest influencer of the modern day mental health issues i i think it's a it's a question of trying to segregate work life balance and and daniel and bm can be able to talk to that technology is supposed to serve us and to be able to give us a lot more time to serve our own personal needs i think there's been a conflating and the bleeding of our personal lives in our work life and the technology that's supposed to help us i think is also starting if i can use that a strong word starting to hurt us and harm us and i think the only way that we should respond to it is to respond with a a a discipline as it were in terms of trying to define time that we would have for ourselves as opposed to things just circle on i don't have a commute now from the office from the home to the office which used to be about 15 minutes where i could have a down time listen to music and clear my head whether it's going to the office or coming back now my commute is from my bedroom to my study which is less than 30 seconds so how do i replace that to be able to get myself re-centered i i think it's important so those are some of my thoughts lovely thank you and thank you for highlighting the importance of creating environment and organization that promotes awareness of mental health and again that again brings very well to um rebecca and before i ask you a question can i just remind everyone to please uh continue populating q and a's uh we will try to address them as after after rebecca spoke and rebecca turning to you so if you could share how your company pwc has helped employees to navigate through this unprecedented times in fact i think the word unprecedent has been reported by google as the most uh searched word for the last half a year thanks elena um just checking so can you see my can here can see okay perfect i just put it on the screen okay great so um i was given the room of two slides so i've tried to pack it all into two but so forgive me um so i think just to understand how companies in general but pwc specifically have dealt with what's going on in the last six months um it was usual to look at kind of our well-being journey over the last year or so and where we were pre-covered um because that's also when we look at this it's important to look at you know where we're going to be when we emerge out of this as well so um i think for us really first of all looking at you know what is the state of mental health in the workplace in singapore the the business case is very well established for investing in employee mental health um in singapore the ncss study showed 5.6 times return on investment for investing in employment health in the workplace so but i think that's something that's not really been internalized necessarily by the business community here um as much as it could be um the message that it's not just a nice thing to do it actually makes business sense um so when we talk about mental health in the workplace um you know the 2019 study in singapore showed 92 of the workforce in singapore are stressed um but more importantly 12 percent said that they had an unmanageable level of stress so there's about risk of burnout and and this 92 is above the oecd average so in general not so singapore workforce were more stressed before you came in jacob than than the average and so that's kind of the backdrop that you start on but um as we were saying it's not just there's kind of the mental health um whether you have distress or a problem but there's also the clinical side so with one in seven people experiencing a clinical mental health condition uh not just distress during their lifetime and actually most most studies show it's about three quarters um have an onset by your mid-20s so that means that by the time you're in the workforce the likelihood you know that that a significant number of us are living with either mental health distress or actual full-blown mental illness it's actually very commonplace in the workforce and we just don't talk about it so it's not an other people's problem it's actually it's an everybody's problem um so what does that mean for pwc well uh so globally we have what's called be well work well which is kind of our framework for for well-being in the workplace which really focuses on four aspects of personal well-being so your physical health your mental health and then emotional and spiritual aspects but we looked about a year ago and said how do we really uh localize this and make this relevant in terms of the maturity of you know in singapore and we really wanted to acknowledge that workplace mental health is a two-way street so you have your obviously individual mental health affects the business right because um it affects engagement performance absenteeism presenteeism retention you know all of those things um but also work is a huge part of our lives particularly here i mean people work extremely long hours um and there's often a huge link between uh a huge amount of kind of um your identity and sense of purpose and sense of um of yourself that's very linked to to work and so uh what you do at work doesn't stay at work it also affects you at home and so it's a hugely important factor you're kind of what we call professional well-being is a huge factor in your overall mental health and well-being so that's why we have them kind of interplay of the two together so yeah so we look at it as both you're as as a as an organization but also as an individual you're responsible for your professional and your personal well-being and they're intrinsically linked so i think many of you may have heard before the daniel pink framework where he would talk about you know autonomy mastery and purpose well when we talk about professional well-being it's sort of similar we talk about you know your growth journey so for us that's is what you're doing um do you do you feel that what you're doing is is part of a longer career does it fit into your goals and aspirations and that's that kind of sense of purpose in what you're doing and are you getting kind of progression then really um the learning and skills so are you getting skills to get better at what you're doing are you really mastering something and feel that you are you know an expert in a topic and then the the huge part about you know the work culture and environment that has a huge um effect in terms of belonging so do you feel heard and valued but also do you have the tools that sort of enable you to do your work so all of those aspects really um on a pre-code on a normal situation or very uh have a very big link to your your mental health and the the employees responsibility to that so for us well being really um including managing your mental health it's not just a soft skill and a nice to have the the clear message from us is like it's a critical business skill to maintain your performance and engagement so that's also why we're part of that as i mentioned earlier the work world leaders work group and we hosted in last year the first ceo dialogue on mental health to really make sure that um you know this is a strategic priority that's been dealt with at a c-suite level so um you know in terms of the challenges we already touched on them before so stigma is a huge issue so we did the you know the beyond the label campaign internally um and we had an internal campaign last year where we had our leaders uh do a video where they were really saying why mental health is important to them and role modeling and saying and making a pledge and explaining like this is personally what i do to invest in my mental health um which was great but then we sort of realized realized that having asked everyone to pledge to talk about mental health the actual level of mental health literacy was too low to do that people don't have the basic uh understanding and language to be able to talk about mental health or mental illness so since then we really worked on increasing that mental health literacy um through trainings awareness and things like that um including doing a training for all of our uh front sort of front end um hr staff and some of our leadership so it was a full full day training on mental health mental illness and what that means in the workplace so that they're equipped to be able to actually deal with situations when they come up but then the other thing i think is around culture so [Music] the the type of organization we are and i think also in singapore in general there's really a kind of stress as a badge of honor kind of culture that means that um working unsustainably is kind of rewarded um and that's really seen as a you know that's a success that's a a great thing if you're sort of working yourself until you can you can barely function so how do we get around that um that aspect of it so you know places to start as an organization so you know as i said we started with a lot of awareness stuff but then it's really about leadership setting it as a priority so you'll hear a lot i hear a lot you know i don't have time i don't have time to invest in my own mental health and well-being but what that's really saying is i haven't made it a priority because we all have the same amount of time it's just that you're allocating your time based on the priorities and if it's not set as a priority you're not going to give time to it um so that's one thing where leadership's really important to set it as as a as a priority and then role model that so um yeah as i said we also did you know full day training for our leadership in our hr frontline staff um but then really you have to support it with policies so make it official so we've got you know flexible medical leave we've got which you can take a sort of mental health phase we've got insurance coverage that covers mental health and we have our employee assistance program and things like that but also practical tools so i was involved as i said the wellness guide from the work work world that um lee jan mentioned but also we have a mental health manager's tool kit and things like that so but fundamentally if you don't embed it embed mental health and well-being into how you recognize performance it's never going to be a priority so we've now just launched a revised professional development framework which builds um into our whole leadership portion we've really built how you manage your own well-being and how for more senior grades how you manage the well-being of your team um is actually one of the attributes that's measured in terms of your performance um and your yeah and so that's and your progression so that's that's um that was sort of where it was at pre-covered uh and then obviously uh covered 19 happened um and we've already touched you know the others have already touched on how this um affects your affects individuals and the workplace in different ways but i think many of you might have seen that meme that came out which was like what has advanced the digital transformation agenda in your organization more your ceo your chief digital officer or kobit um and the answers obviously covered 19 as we all went digital but i think that that also stands for mental health um because having been um it's really pushing the agenda to talk about mental health in the workplace um it's a for a long time suddenly there is a conversation that's happening um kind of naturally sort of opened up pandora's box really and even small things like on call you know ending calls with people and they'll say you know stay safe stay sane and you know for all that you know it's it's trite but it does mean that people are really acknowledging that there are physical impacts but also mental and emotional impacts of what's going on right now um and that they're that's something that's coming into the into the workplace sorry this alarm going off oh rebecca that fits really well with your timing and i need to kind of we're coming close to kind of an hour so do you want to close in with the next sort of a 20 seconds sort of on the key message and i think you're actually there's a question from cara sort of anything you're answering just nicely and uh if you could help me to round up your your slide sorry what was the question um i will read the question i think you did answer that but um i love the term step in not step away but a lot of managers don't know how to step in and know what to say when an employee opens up do you have any practical tips on how best to respond so actually that's something um that yeah so i was gonna get you so obviously the individual part of this in terms of you know resilience but really the critical part is getting managers and leaders it's that middle part because if you don't bridge what you're doing as an organization to through managers to the actual people it's it's there's a real gap there so that's one thing that we have had a lot of questions on so we're already working on it but essentially now instead of me going to people they come to me to ask so we've had some sessions on how to approach these conversations um where with someone who is showing signs of distress or who's actually come to you to disclose that they're really struggling or have a mental uh or facing mental illness as a coach or a manager so the the key message there is really on listening to understand not listening to reply or to give advice um and that you know and empathy is really key and also acknowledging you know we're equipping managers to have a conversation where they're listening with empathy and then can refer people to the right to the right sources of help you you're not expecting all of don't expect your managers or don't expect an individual to be able to counsel someone you're not you know beware you're not a psychologist you're not a counselor you're not a you're not a trained doctor um but what you can do is make sure that they it's around that psychological safety aspect that they really feel comfortable to voice their concerns and feel that you're listening to them and want to get to a better outcome and then you can on their behalf find find where to go next but really um the key there is really just listening to understand thank you so much rebecca i really appreciate and um um i know we're running out of time i wanted to address one of the questions and uh i know jeffrey you wanted to uh to to answer it we have a question from yvonne that would like to know how one can participate in the mindset jardin ambassador program thank you very much um the program right now is within the group itself and we've been talking amongst the x-com as to how we can be able to extend that outside of the group but i think i've sent a response to whoever was asking that question i think was nora my email please feel free to reach out and i think we can continue that conversation as to how we could get you involved thank you there is one question before i pass to uh to andrew and this question also from ewan and if possible uh dr fung would you like to take this question i'm thankful for the panelists sharing while what is the percentage of the employers in singapore that really care of aware of the importance of the mental health at workplace where most company hr hardly mention about it from my understanding that's a difficult question like i'm not aware of how companies look at this um but my own point is uh i think it's important to have not just engage employees and and workers in the in the companies but um employees uh and uh um workers who feel that um they are being um they are doing something that they enjoy you know it's almost like uh in healthcare we started this movement called joy in work and the reason was that uh in in at least in healthcare organizations there was an over emphasis on getting things done uh and not remembering the people the providers of the service that that needed support for themselves so i think trying to find joy in work is probably quite uh critical for overall well-being and that's that's something that i i hope that every employer would think about you well that concludes our event and i really would like to thank all the presenters and we could hear all the passion uh in the room and before we close off um if i may go to andrew um for to close off the event andrew uh chairs the dni committee of uh british chamber elena thank you and thank you to all the panelists i thought that was a fantastic and really fascinating discussion so thank you to all um for for taking the time to talk to our members about this very important topic um for me some of the takeaways i took from the discussion um i think the difference between mental health mental illness is very interesting and very important for us all to be aware of and i think we've all got a role as as business operators in the singapore community um we all have a role in protecting our employees in in in really looking after employees um but it's also interesting that the healthcare industry is is highly involved and charities are also very involved and there's clearly some some very good resources out there that we can use um to to really support our employees during this period and also i thought it was fascinating to hear some of the best practice initiatives um that the companies operating here in singapore are following and doing to support their employees and mental health was an area that has been highlighted by our members um as an area people would like more help in addressing and raising awareness so i think hearing from from companies on practical tips how to how to support your employees during this time is is really important so thank you both to to draw dean and pwc for for really giving us that overview of what you're doing um this is an area that the the diversity and inclusion committee are very focused on um it is an area that has got a lot of um interest from our members and we feel is important to to carry on this journey really to to improve the um the understanding and the awareness um of this issue uh going forward so you will see more um more initiatives from the dni committee going forward um but on that note i'd like to say a huge thank you thank you first to all our expert panelists um it really came across that you serious you are experts in your field and very good tangible advice that you gave to our members so so thank you to our panelists uh elena you're one of the the the members of britt trump you support us a lot in in a lot of our dna events so thank you as well for managing this discussion so well um and really helping us to deliver a great uh webinar today so thank you alina for moderating um and then behind the scenes um the diversity and inclusion committee christina and joey from the committee have both worked really hard to put this event on um with the brit team so thank you to all the team who organized this event and put this on i think it's a really useful um topic to discuss with our members um just looking forward we we do have a a number of events uh in brit champ um over the next couple of weeks that we wanted to highlight um there's an energy um in the in the circular economy event on the 21st of july um there's the health care industry in south east asia on the 22nd of july and there's optimizing social media webinar on the 28th of july so please do um do log in and register for those events if they are of interest i'd also like to highlight the diversity and inclusion events we will be holding more related to both this topic and and others in our pillars of dna going forward so please sign up for those um as as you see them being advertised but on that note once again thank you to all the panelists thank you to all the the members um for for registering and and dialing in and we'll close the call thank you very much ,True,True,False,False
77,sWqhciK5tww,CNA,Ministerial statement: Gan Kim Yong on COVID-19 vaccination exercise in Singapore,2021-01-04T13:03:22Z,"A national effort to vaccinate the Singapore population will need “considerable resources” to implement and will be one of the Government’s key focus areas in 2021, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament on Monday (Jan 4). https://cna.asia/2MuQS8C

Mr Gan added that while the B.1.1.7 strain that was first reported in the UK ""does appear to be more transmissible, there is currently no evidence current COVID-19 vaccines are less effective against this strain"". https://cna.asia/35o2UHB

situation and specifically on our plan to vaccinate our population minister lawrence wong and i will address quite earlier parliamentary questions 2 to 14 and written questions 15 to 18 from today's order paper as well as questions filed by mps for futures tests future settings without permission i may also call upon my other colleagues to address supplementary questions that may follow as we work as a team under the multi-ministry task force so it has been almost a year since we had our first case we have come a long way we strengthened our health care system enhanced our contact tracing capability expanded our testing capacity and introduced safe distancing measures all these efforts work together as a multi-layered defense system to keep us safe from kovite 19. with the continued support and sacrifices of everyone in singapore we have brought the situation under control and kept community transmissions low we have now moved into phase three and are making steady progress towards a new normal however this is not the moment to be complacent globally daily infection numbers and deaths continue to rise in many countries constantly setting new records including countries that have been successful in containing their outbreaks previously we have also seen the emergence of new variants that appear to be more transmissible and have had to tighten some of our border restrictions as a precaution we must therefore be prepared that despite best efforts new infections will still occur here from time to time we face the continuing task risk of new clusters and outbreaks and the danger of a new way for an infection getting out of control this will be the new normal for a long time to come that is why we still need to keep up our multi-layered defense and in fact we must further strengthen it as we continue our journey through phase three and vaccination is a new line of defense we must put in place vaccination is a critical shield to protect us and our loved ones against kovit-19 even as the global situation remains volatile it will also be a key in the enabler allowing us to return to normalcy the expert committee on cov19 vaccination comprising professionals in infectious diseases immunology and other relevant fields has studied the available data on the vaccine reviewed the reports from the health sciences authority deliberated at length and considered carefully safety and efficacy aspects of the pfizer biotech vaccine the committee has concluded that the vaccine meets the safety and efficacy requirements of the world health organization and other international regulatory authorities as well as that of our own hsa it recommended that everyone who is medically eligible should be vaccinated so that singapore can achieve as high a level of vaccination coverage as possible vaccinations should however be voluntary the government has accepted these recommendations in full a high level of vaccination coverage will maximize protection for the population and minimize the proportion of persons still susceptible to covet 19. this will in turn reduce the risk of large outbreaks and continue to keep community cases low and allow us to further reopen the economy and resume more normal social activities we received our first shipment of vaccines from pfizer biontech at the end of last year our first vaccinations were conducted at the national center of infectious diseases last week this is an important milestone and we are beginning to see the light at the end of this very long tunnel dr lim wig yak and mr louis straw asked about the number of vaccines that we have secured i'm not at liberty to disclose a specific quantity ordered due to commercial sensitivities and confidentiality undertakings in our advanced purchase agreements with the vaccine manufacturers however i can assure members that we have secured enough vaccines for all singaporeans and long-term residents in singapore a team headed by head of civil service led the efforts and undertook this very urgent complex and difficult task the vaccines will arrive in singapore in batches given high global demand especially from countries with high rates of infection pharmaceutical companies will also need time to scale up vaccine production and distribution following the first shipment of the pfizer biontech vaccine at the end of last year we are expecting more deliveries in the next few months including from banana moderna and sanofec if all goes according to schedule we will have enough vaccines for everyone by the third quarter this year as recommended by the expert committee we will prioritize vaccinations of groups that are most at risk this is also consistent with the world health organization's guidance and similar to what other countries are doing we will therefore begin with the healthcare workers and staff working in the healthcare sector as they work in direct care of patients or in supporting roles we will also prioritize kobe 19 frontline and other essential personnel including schwabbers hired by health promotion board staff working at the government quarantine facilities community community care facilities and dedicated stay home notice facilities we plan to start vaccinating our elderly and those at greater risk of severe disease from covid19 infection starting from february 2021 beginning with seniors age 70 and above we will also prioritize others who are in jobs or settings where risk of super spreading event is high such as the construction marine and process sector including migrant workers thereafter we will progressively broaden our vaccinations to include other singaporeans and long-term residents who are medically eligible as more vaccines are approved for use we will adjust our vaccination program depending on the vaccine supply as well as the disease epidemiology at that point in time the national effort to vaccinate the population will require considerable resources to implement this is one of our key focus area this year the last time we did a vaccination of this scale was in 1959 in response to an outbreak of smallpox where slightly over 1 million people were vaccinated the scale of the current effort is larger but we are also much better prepared we started planning for this very early on we have put in place end-to-end processes to meet the cold chain logistics requirements from delivery and receipt at the airport through to storage and then transport to vaccination sites so that the quality and efficacy of the vaccines are not compromised while our healthcare workers are receiving their vaccinations within their healthcare institutions we are concurrently raiding clinics and vaccination centers for others to be vaccinated when it is their turn prior bookings will be necessary given the cold chain requirements at the vaccination sites and multi-dose vials of the vaccines it will also ensure operational efficiency and minimize individual wait times more information on how to make the booking will be provided later we encourage everyone to come forward for a vaccination when the turn comes so that we can increase our coverage as soon as possible we should also bear in mind that some vaccines such as the physical biotech will require two doses 21 days apart and will take up to another 14 days after the second dose to achieve maximum protection against the virus at the same time we will test our systems thoroughly before ramping up to ensure that vaccination operations proceed smoothly and patient safety is not compromised there were several questions from members including miss fumiha and mr william on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines these concerns are understandable given the extraordinary speed at which the kovit-19 vaccine have been developed and brought to the market the speed achieved is the result of a strong and concerted global response to a major pandemic rather than a compromise of safety standards let me assure you that the safety and well-being of singaporeans is top priority in our vaccination efforts first of all the vaccine must be approved by hsa under hsa's pandemic special access route or pisa hsa's scientific and clinical experts apply strict international standards to assess cov19 vaccines to ensure that they meet the stipulated high standards of quality safety and efficacy these standards are the same as those used for full vaccine evaluations except the long-term data from clinical trials will only be evaluated later as the data becomes available the data that has been reviewed includes those from pre-clinical studies done in laboratories clinical trials on human volunteers manufacturing and quality controls as well as the ongoing experience with the actual use of the vaccines the assessment and recommendations for vaccines are also reviewed by hsa's medicine advisory committee and panel of infectious disease experts hsa will only allow a covid19 vaccine to be used if it is assessed to be sufficiently efficacious and safe for use and only if the benefits of the vaccine are assessed to outweigh the risk of any potential adverse effects from the vaccination hsa has put the pfizer biotech vaccine through this rigorous review process and has authorized its use the modena and sanovac vaccines are also currently undergoing the review process following hsa's approval the independent expert committee appointed by moh has also reviewed the clinical data on safety and efficacy of pfizer biontech vaccine and has been briefed by hsa on the full range of considerations in granting interim authorization the expert committee concurs with hsa that the vaccine is suitable for use in singapore for persons aged 16 years and above for the prevention of covid19 in assessing the suitability of vaccine candidates for specific population groups the expert committee took into consideration four key criteria vaccine safety vaccine efficacy vaccine tolerability and data adequacy of clinical trials the expert committee has assessed that pfizer biontech vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 95 percent in reducing symptomatic kovid19 disease among persons age 16 and older and its safety profile is consistent with that of other established and registered vaccines used in immunization against other diseases mr melvin young asked whether there is any data to show that the current covenanting vaccines are effective against the new strains seen in the uk and europe mutations occur in viruses naturally and different strains can emerge from time to time especially in the long drawn pandemic while this b117 strain from uk does appear to be more transmissible there is currently no evidence that current cov19 vaccines are less effective against this strain experts have said that it is unlikely that these mutations would impact effectiveness of current vaccines vaccine producers such as pfizer biontec and modana have also come forward to reassure that their vaccines should protect against this b117 variant and are undertaking studies to formally miss and others have asked about potential side effects both hsa and the expert committee have studied the data from clinical trials as well as actual experience from vaccinations carried out in other countries they have factored this into their evaluation before granting authorization or making a recommendation on the use of kovit-19 vaccines based on data available today people who receive the pfizer biotech vaccine may experience side effects such as pain in the injection site fatigue fever muscle aches or headaches these are similar to the side effects for other established vaccines and they usually resolve on their own in a few days as with all medications and established vaccines there is a small risk of very rare but serious adverse events that may occur post-vaccination including allergic reactions hsa and expert committee have therefore recommended that those with known severe allergies should not be vaccinated all vaccine recipients should also be observed on site for 30 minutes post vaccination so that any severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis can be detected and treated promptly moh will also introduce a vaccine injury financial assistance program to provide support for persons who suffer a serious adverse event that is assessed to be related to covet-19 vaccines administered in singapore while we expect fuel to need this the program will give peace of mind to those taking the vaccination further details on the program will be provided in due course in addition hsa requires vaccine manufacturers to submit new information continually for active review hsa and the expert committee will continue to monitor and review the efficacy and safety of cov19 vaccines in the local population and internationally this includes data on specific population subgroups such as those below age of 16 persons with immunosuppression or pregnant women who were excluded from initial clinical trials hsa and expert committee will also look at long-term safety data to detect rare and severe adverse events and study the durability of the protection provided by the vaccines this ongoing monitoring is the norm expected for any vaccines that first come into use mr dennis turn asked whether there will be a need to separate blood collected from donors who have or have not received covenant vaccinations there is no need to do so the covid19 vaccine does not cause infection while the kovi19 vaccination will be voluntary we strongly encourage everyone who is medically eligible to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you this will not only protect yourself but also indirectly protect others who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons this collective protection will be more effective the more people are vaccinated in case of a fresh outbreak with more people vaccinated we can keep the number of cases low minimize the stress on a healthcare system ensure that those who are ill get the treatment that they need and allow us to return to normalcy sooner some may feel that there is no urgency to get vaccinated given the current low number of community cases and the local situation is well under control we must not be complacent or wait till an outbreak and then rush to be vaccinated we have seen a few community cases in the last few days which shows clearly that there are hidden cases among us we are also seeing new variants that are more contagious any of these cases has a risk of sparking a major outbreak as we have seen in other countries the best time to vaccinate is now if people wait till until an outbreak has happened to get themselves fascinated it will be too late both to protect themselves and to prevent the outbreak in the first place as prime minister has said we have every confidence in our experts and the process that has been put in place pm and our cabinet colleagues including myself will lead on this we'll be getting ourselves fascinated as early as possible when our turn comes to ensure access to the vaccine kovit-19 vaccination will be free for all singaporeans permanent residents and long-term residents in singapore which will include employment pass s-pass work permit holders foreign domestic workers independent past long-term visit pass and student pass holders totaling about 5.7 million people this excludes short-term visit pass holders such as tourists i understand mr hong wing would like to know whether those who are not vaccinated will have their job scopes reviewed in order to reduce exposure to the virus in most instances redeployment of non-vaccinated employees will not be necessary unless there is a resurgence of local cases but all workers will continue to take the necessary precautions such as mask wearing and where required zoning of personal protective equipment and undergoing roasted routine testing or rrt that said there may be specific cases such as researchers or laboratory staff working directly on the covid virus or those who face very high risk of exposure to infected individuals moh and mom are reviewing the issue of vaccination of workers in such workplace settings and will provide advice later ms fumiha asked if individuals will be issued vaccination cards after receiving the kovi 19 fascination every person who is vaccinated will receive a physical vaccination card and this will remind them of their appointment to return for their second dose indicate indicate clearly with which vaccine was administered and provide brief post-vaccination advice in addition any person who is vaccinated will have their record updated in the national immunization registry and individuals will be able to check their vaccination status digitally mr luis choi asks if individuals will be given a choice of vaccines when more than one has been approved for use the allocation of vaccines will largely based on be based on medical indications of the different vaccines and the suitability of the vaccine for the different population groups such as availability of the vaccines any cov19 vaccine that is approved for use will have to meet the stringent safety and efficacy requirements allowing individuals to have choice of vaccines will unnecessarily complicate this already complex vaccination program anyway in the immediate term only the pfizer biotech vaccine has been approved for use so there is no choice mr alex young and ms hurtingru asked about our public communications strategy government agencies have been using various channels to understand public sentiments on the kovit 19 vaccines including ground outreach and surveys our findings show that more than half close to 60 percent say they would get vaccinated if a vaccine becomes available in singapore about a third were more cautious saying they would prefer to wait for more data before deciding we will continue our efforts to reach out to our population to explain the importance of vaccination and to assure them of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines we are using i hope parliamentary colleagues will help to share this information with your constituents i would also urge everyone to refer to official or credible sources of information and not to forward unconfirmed or false information for example there were claims that six people had died due to pfizer biotech vaccine during clinical trials however the facts are that only two of the individuals two of the six individuals were given the vaccine and the other four were given the placebo investigations revealed that there was no causal relationship between the vaccine and the two individuals deaths spreading such misinformation undermines our efforts to protect singapore and singaporeans against kovite 19. sir let me conclude we have come a long way in the past year we have been through the circuit breaker many have missed their vacations for the whole year and we have had to learn to manage the safe distancing measures when we are out and about it is only through everyone's concerted efforts that local transmission is now low in singapore however the global situation is still far from under control vaccinations will be a key enabler for us to return to normalcy we have secured enough vaccines for the whole population and every vaccine approved for use will meet all our safety and efficacy requirements i strongly encourage all singaporeans and long-term residents to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you to protect yourselves and your loved ones this will be the key focus of the multi-ministry task force over the next few months let's all do our part so that we can overcome and emerge stronger thank you ,True,True,False,False
78,QhKiopuZbtg,CNA Insider,Is The COVID-19 Vaccine Safe For Me? Your Questions Answered,2021-01-08T12:14:56Z,"Singapore has made early purchases of three vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on January 8, 2021, the first member of Singapore's Cabinet to do so.

In this #TalkingPoint episode, co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong, director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH) Vernon Lee and senior vice president (Health Education & Resources) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Benjamin Ong answer questions on the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination programme in Singapore. 

00:00 Why did someone test positive for COVID-19 after taking the vaccine?
01:32 Can the vaccine cause cancer?
02:13 Will someone with health conditions like high blood pressure suffer worse side effects?
03:33 Could there be long-term health effects – like the ability to conceive?
04:12 Does the fast-tracking of vaccines mean that they are less safe?
05:05 The virus is mutating. Is there any point in getting vaccinated?
05:52 If I get severe side effects, will the Government help with my medical bills?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",we understand a nurse in california after taking the first vaccination shot was then tested positive for the virus it's the timing it's too short what do you mean by that that means your body needs some time to develop an immune response right after the first dose only so soon after she actually had the dose she picked up the infection and she may have actually been incubating at the time that she had the vaccination done so one shouldn't read this as though it's a vaccine failure you have to wait for the vaccine to work and it takes time that's the other point that's important for the public to understand for example the fisa vaccine specifically you need to take two doses three weeks apart and after the second dose it takes about one to two weeks for the full you know immune reaction to develop so that means a total of about four to five weeks okay after the first dose is given now in between that time that individual is still susceptible to of course exposure and and that's why it is important for us now in singapore for us to roll out this vaccination program okay because when you roll it out in you know a situation where you have you have an epidemic you have a lot of cases then the situation that you had mentioned in this person in the u.s may occur because you are trying to vaccinate while the virus is circulating it's much better to vaccinate when you have very little virus circulating such that if a virus should you know be introduced in the future you have a population that is immune and then you know um right sort of prevent any outbreak from occurring there are studies showing that the vaccine can cause cancer and also effects on our health so at this point there's no evidence that this vaccine will result in such a side effect i mean most of the side effects that we have seen from the studies of our mild side effects and also the one that is known which is the severe allergic reaction in people the mrna component itself does not incorporate into our human dna it uh in fact after about 48 hours just sort of you know dissipates in in the body and disintegrates so um there's no evidence at this point that there's any such concern i'm 73 i have high blood pressure i have diabetes and i have poor kidney function my concern is that i will get worse side effects than a healthier person i think annie has raised a very important point but it's precisely that particular group of individuals who are older that have the co-mobilities that she mentioned that tend to get more ill and tend to have a higher mortality and it's specifically this group that we hope will take it up and get vaccinated over in the uk after the vaccination is given the doctors a monitoring patients they have them stick around for a period of time 15 minutes they'll monitor them i mean is that something we plan to do as well minister for sure we will be monitoring very closely everyone who is vaccinated in fact the authorities are looking at data not just from singapore but they are monitoring data from the vaccination program everywhere in the world clinical trials when it did devise a vaccine quite a number of those individuals were in fact individuals with comorbid medical conditions because this are the target crew for the vaccines because of the complications and of the many millions of people who are vaccinated now you know in the uk the u.s and elsewhere there's a huge diversity in terms of you know age medical conditions etc so there is a wealth of data showing that you know the vaccine is safe it's impossible for us to know what are the three to five to ten year long term effects that it'll have like for example if and when i want to have kids will it be harder to conceive like any other drug vaccine we will have to of course monitor over the longer term to see if there are any rare side effects that might occur but at this point there's no evidence that for example ability to conceive would be an issue how concerned should i be about long-term side effects likelihood that there'll be long-term issues i think is very remote the place safe per se we have not recommended that if you are pregnant at present you will take the vaccine wait until after you deliver before you take the vaccine i guess one of the concerns is also because things have happened so fast there is concern that the vaccines may not be as safe as what was traditionally the actual clinical trials process all right the reason the companies have been able to shorten the process are twofold number one we are in a pandemic there's no shortage of volunteers wanting to come forward perhaps not in a country like singapore where the virus is you know not raging but in uk us there are no shortage of volunteers coming forward they all won the vaccine right now right and number two they have been able to get these trials going on a concurrent basis not trimming back not compromising but in parallel and therefore shortening the time so the entire process of validation testing trialling looking at the data has not been compromised a single bit but as we are talking about this a new strain came about what's the point of taking the vaccine yeah well mutations occur all the time so far as we can tell it seems like it probably would still work it's being actively tested and we'll know very soon because more than two three million people now in the uk and the us have received the vaccine one of our bioinformatics expert doctor sebastian morvis wrote he likens mutations to like the different number plate or color of a car the same make same model different license plate we see many of them all around the time and sometimes you know you might have a car with new tires it might you know be a bit more efficient move faster and so on but it's still the same make at this point there's no evidence that it has changed to another make another model another brand i'd like to know if the government would help to copy my medical bills should i get any severe side effects from it well that's a it's a very relevant concern in fact not just for a covet vaccine but for any vaccination program after we've authorized we've verified that safe and effective one can never rule out the possibilities of a very rare and serious side effect effect occurring it will be very rare but it may happen so we've been looking at this and we think that there is a possibility of putting in place a vaccination injury assistance program where the government comes in for such instances to help pay for the medical cost associated with it you ,True,True,False,False

The Straits Times, the English flagship daily of SPH, has been serving readers for more than a century. Launched on July 15, 1845, its comprehensive coverage of world news, East Asian news, Southeast Asian news, home news, sports news, financial news and lifestyle updates makes The Straits Times the most-read newspaper in Singapore.",[Music] a day after this woman appeared outside the state courts without wearing a mask she has been arrested and handed more charges more than 6 000 new hdb flats are up for sale including bto and for the first time this year balance flats and actor terence chao gets a fine for hosting 12 people at his home during the kovite 19 outbreak good evening you're watching the big story coming to you live from the straits times newsroom i'm harviyan to diman now you can subscribe to the straight signs channel so you never miss a single episode now the woman seen a viral video not wearing a mask at marina bay sands has been arrested and handed multiple charges for breaching kovit 19 rules poon chu yoke had allegedly failed to wear a mask on at least four occasions the latest incident being just yesterday when she was arriving at the state courts for her trial pune was also handed one charge under the infectious diseases act while serving a 14-day stay home notice here last year after returning from the uk investigations showed that she had allegedly left a hotel room on several occasions she also did not wear a mask while outside her hotel room poon will be reminded at the institute of mental health for psychiatric observation her case has been adjourned to june the 8th meanwhile singapore reported 30 new coveted 19 cases today including three in the migrant workers dormitories and 18 in the community 15 of these cases are linked to previous infections with eight detected during quarantine and seven identified through surveillance the health ministry added that there are currently six unlinked community cases the other nine cases were imported three being returning singaporeans or prs meanwhile pizza hut has deep cleaned three of its outlets after six coffee 19 cases were reported the three outlets will remain closed for two weeks with the number of covet 19 cases linked to jam and westgate increasing to 50 cases as at monday night it has emerged that a hotel cleaner may be the source of that cluster based on mohs investigations into the second largest active cluster here the cleaner is a 53 year old woman who works at park avenue rochester a stay home notice dedicated facility on may 6 she may have been the source of infection when she visited westgate and on may 7th she was confirmed to have the virus according to moh whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have shown that some of these visitors to jam and westgate have similar sequences to the cleaner for a closer look i'm joined by professor dale fisher an infectious diseases expert from the national university of singapore's yong lu lin school of medicine he also chairs the national infection prevention and control committee welcome back professor in light of this discovery by moh that a hotel cleaner may be the source of the gem westgate cluster and the measure to extend a free testing to those who visited the malls between may 10th and last saturday professor what are the likely scenarios for transmission to happen in malls uh thanks harry anto the we in infection control we talk about three modes of transmission really one is contact two is droplet and three is airborne uh so droplet is perhaps the one people feel most comfortable with because that's where uh it's from a respiratory secretion it generally travels about one to two meters and and people exposed to to those sort of secretions whether it's through coughing sneezing or you know as as we now know even talking and yelling singing this sort of thing uh could well be exposed to to covert and develop disease now with these more transmissible variants uh particularly the b1617 uh that that is so much more infectious that the other modes of transmission may come up and be more of an issue such as contact and airborne we do believe airborne can happen but we we don't believe it's common and we think it's more common in settings of aerosol generating procedures in hospitals uh especially um but you know it's possible in the community as well although although low in number the the contact transmission is when you might actually touch someone with covert or or more subtly you might touch a surface that's been contaminated by someone with covert uh and and catch it that way so that's why we're always telling people to wash their hands and not touch their face so the point i'm trying to make is those other two the airborne and the um and the contact you may not have been close or have a profound contact with the actual person that's transmitting the disease because uh airborne can travel a distance and obviously the um the contact uh the person may have already left and then you go and have that exposure right what about duration professor you know in terms of brief exposure is there a possibility then for a person to get infected uh through brief exposure you know versus prolonged exposure for example well i think this is right we we have had we we know that the more exposure the more chance you've got of getting it and that's why household clusters are are so prominent because you're you're living with that person and obviously there's a big exposure and your chance of getting covert is much higher if it's a brief exposure like just passing someone in the supermarket then it's very unlikely however now that we know these variants are more transmissible that you actually need less virus to cause disease then yeah one could easily argue that a lower exposure can lead to infection right professor now i want to talk about the daily figures now looking at the daily figures the number of locally transmitted covit 19 cases has harvard between 20 and 30 while unlinked cases is maintained in the single digits but of course the number of clusters are increasing with some clusters growing bigger by the day based on all this professor what's your take on our current situation i think we would have been happy with this situation uh if we were offered it two weeks ago the the most important thing that we're seeing or not seeing should i say is is that we don't have that exponential increase uh and when you've seen it happen overseas particularly and obviously in singapore this time last year that the numbers really climbed every every couple of days there were twice as many so the fact that we're flat tells me that the the interventions are working uh it's still early days we're only in i think the second week since all the uh the new restrictions were brought in and obviously we'd like to see it come down we we think we're seeing the unlinked cases come down so so maybe the the number of clusters is is becoming more finite if you like but you know we don't need to get back to zero um if it rumbles along like this i think we'd be we'd be okay we we just need to have a situation where the numbers aren't climbing to the point where hospitals are going to get overwhelmed uh and lots of people are going to die and with our high vaccination rate of 35 percent of people having their first jab and and and in fact seventy percent of over sixties sixty-year-olds having their first job this tells me that the uh likelihood of severe disease is actually much less so so what was a case a year ago doesn't have the same implications as as a case now so so i think we would tolerate um an ongoing rumbling of cases while people are getting vaccinated so that in a few months when we are all vaccinated then really cases in the community hardly matters right well that's all this thank you for your insights professor there was infectious diseases expert from the nus's young lulin school of medicine professor dale fisher in malcova 19 news the health sciences authority has approved new storage conditions for the fisa vaccine to be stored at a standard refrigerator temperature of 2 to 8 degrees celsius for 31 days this is a significant improvement from the current storage conditions of minus 20 degrees celsius for up to two weeks hsa said the change will greatly facilitate its transportation and distribution to vaccination centers as well as their storage and use at these centers [Music] singapore's fully economic forecasts will not be getting an upgrade despite stronger than expected gdp growth in the first quarter according to the trade and industry ministry it's due to the larger than usual degree of uncertainty over the pandemic both globally and domestically so for now its growth outlook for 2021 will remain at four to six percent the numbers will be reviewed again in august when there's more data and greater clarity over the covet 19 situation uob economist barnabas gan is here to weigh in welcome barnabas with first quarter growth coming in at 1.3 percent what do you expect the figures to be like for this quarter now given that singapore is currently under title restrictions during this phase two heightened alert period thank you for having me on the show um i think importantly what we have seen at least in the first quarter of 2021 uh has been the good quarter uh this is uh really an upgrade from the previous advanced estimates by mti and and really in the first quarter alone we have also seen the positive and more so uh high frequency data has been constructed you know for overall growth and this includes nordecs as well as the manufacturing the manufacturing purchasing uh managers index but i think going forward if uh really accounting for the the phase two heightened alert restrictions i think the first order negative impacts would likely be on the singapore's retail sector and this is especially uh on the food and beverage industry uh we have uh we we do note that the capacity for retail stores have been further reduced to 10 percent per square meter and and die ins will be disallowed during phase two you know uh but i think overall uh what we do note is that phase two heightened alert should last to until the uh the 13th of june and and and and the short period of time uh really about a month uh would unlikely dent uh singapore's recovery for for the whole year so we are still keeping to our full year growth outlook at 5.5 for 2021 right uh on that barnabas uh looking at mti's full year forecast of four to six percent do you expect that to change and what's your outlook because you mentioned earlier for uob it's 5.5.5 well um the mti has kept its official growth outlook at a range of between four to six percent you know but we do know that this is uh a a minor shift away from the previous rhetoric made by the monetary authority of singapore in this previous uh also in its latest monthly policy statement whereby they did say and state that gdp growth in 2021 would likely exceed the upper end of the official for the six percent forecast range um and as as i mentioned earlier you know we are keeping to our growth outlook a full year group outlook at 5.5 percent and but this is uh really uh not withstanding uh uh the the the phase two heightened alert you know uh what we do also expect really is that the the social restriction or the social uh discussing measures will likely impact singapore's construction as well as services sectors you know and and and we do note that the labor intensive clusters will likely remain the doldrums given the ban of all non-residents with recent travel to uh to india bangladesh pakistan and sri lanka and and and i think really uh bearing and exacerbation of copyrighted restrictions in singapore you know we do we we do hope you know that the manufacturing sector especially uh will be one of the key drivers of growth uh and similarly uh once uh once covered nineteen risk starts to mitigate further into the second half of this year we also do hope that and look for positive growth for both construction and services for the second half of 2021 thank you barnabas for setting aside time to come on to the show i've been speaking with banabas ghana economist at uob meanwhile singapore drew 2.8 billion dollars in fixed asset investments in the first quarter of this year and this is expected to create more than 3 700 jobs in the coming years the largest contributor is the info communications and media cluster which garnered 1.1 billion dollars of investments in other local headlines the housing board has launched over 3 800 bto flats across four housing projects in the second sales exercise for the year the flats are in the bukit mira gelang tanga and woodlands area separately about 2500 plants are also on offer in the first sale of balanced flats exercise hdb also said today that they will release site locations of upcoming bto projects three months before their launch instead of the current six months from next month passengers booking a ride on grab will have to pay an additional one dollar this a bid from the right healing firm to improve driver earnings amid rising fuel and maintenance costs and to help commuters adjust to the new fest the firm is offering one dollar vouchers for peak hour rides between june 1st and june 14th the hike will apply to all transport services except the standard taxi web page and grab coach options separately actor terence chao has been fined 3500 after he pleaded guilty today to illegally hosting a gathering at his home during phase two last year chao had 12 guests over at his home in daisy road including several celebrities beyond a five-person limit at that time the incident drew flag on social media after pictures of the unmasked group went viral across the causeway preliminary investigations into the collision between two lrt trains last night that left over 200 people injured six in critical condition showed it was due to human error malaysia's transport minister wika siong said it was due to the person driving the train in the wrong direction a special task force has been formed to give a full report expected in the next two weeks according to singapore's foreign affairs ministry there are currently no reports of singaporeans injured now over in india an investigation is underway on a couple who chartered a plane to hold a mid-air wedding that broke coronavirus restrictions video footage showed the couple and their over 160 guests taking selfies in the packed spice jet plane at a time when most states limit wedding guests to 50. hardly any of them were wearing masks and social distancing rules were blatantly ignored india's india's civil aviation authority has suspended the jets crew and all the guests annually wets could be banned from taking passenger flights now four months since u.s president joe biden took office his administration is still in the process of formulating its china strategy in our latest st connect webinar professor tomiko singapore's former ambassador to the u.s looks at whether stormier days lie ahead for washington and beijing many people expected that biden will bring u.s china relationship to what it was during the obama administration but in the last four years a lot of things have changed american public opinion to china has become very negative and for the first time in the last 30 years american perceived china as a threat to american prosperity and security so it's no longer possible for biden to have the kind of china policy that obama had in his eight years now you can watch the full discussion on the straits times's youtube channel and you can also drop in on a clubhouse chat later today between 8 pm and 8 45 pm and those are our top stories for today now from everyone on

While we respect everyone's views and opinions, we hope you respect ours too. We are entertainers after all! So if you're going to be butt-hurt by our videos, simply click X :/ But for those who share our sense of humour, enjoy and watch on! Comment below with what you want to see next! :) Thank you!",there's a book that i read called why zebras don't get ulcers you know why you guys don't get houses because zebras don't worry [Music] hi guys it's sylvia and this is another episode on team noc and today is going to be something really relatable because i think be it the circuit breaker or be it the lockdown i think humankind for the first time we've been forced to stay at home and i think within noc itself i would just like to out my friend again he texted me the other day and said i cried for four hours straight and aiken is the most positive person that i know so i think for a lot of us we're facing very strange feelings right some of us are feeling anxiety some of us may have panic attacks sad don't know what to do lost restless so today i'll have a interview with professor daniel fong the chairman of imh institute of mental health in singapore and i will be asking him a lot of these common questions that people have about mental health mental illness especially during these times and hopefully he can give us good answers and hopefully we can all be happy after this hi professor nice having you tell us a little bit about yourself hi i'm daniel fung i'm 54 years old this year and i'm the father of five grown-up kids and i work at the institute of mental health part-time because i'm a full-time father wow that is a very fun introduction so the first statement is people who have mental health issues they're just in other words psycho true or false when most questions that you ask it's not just a simple true and false answer but i like to first of all talk about the concept of mental health mental health is actually a very holistic concept that covers um how we are dealing with life how we're coping how we're relating to others but from time to time when the stress and life situations become very difficult we may get into what i call a mental health distress and we're feeling a little um not quite ourselves because something has happened to our lives mental illness and psycho or psychosis are referring actually to a specific disease or disorder this actually requires professional health and you need probably see someone because there's evidence based treatment treatments that have been proven to work sometimes it's medication sometimes it's a specific type of talking therapy or taking cure so it's very different of course you can have both a mental illness and poor mental health as a result of what's happening in your life but at the same time if you have a mental illness like depression you can also be in good mental health because you have a good support network and you're coping relatively well but you have an illness right i think it has taught me something i think when we always talk about mental health we associate it very tightly with mental illness but i think whatever you just mentioned they're actually two separate entities so i think that is the first step in all of us the awareness of what is associated with mental health what is associated with mental illness yes absolutely so it's it's in fact quite critical that we understand this so that uh you know uh when you go around thinking that if i'm under a lot of stress and i'm hoping very poorly does it lead to mental illness in me i mean not depends on all the reserves and resilience that you have and this is why we think it's so important to teach people to cope in adversity right now that you mentioned adversity right i think we're all stuck in the circuit breaker situation one of the biggest statements and one of the questions when i asked online is that i am feeling sad i'm feeling anxiety i have panic attacks or i'm just feeling really low and i have no motivation right a mix of emotions that people are feeling right should i see a doctor well like i said uh depression is a clinical condition so there are specific symptoms that you have to watch out for either the low mood and sadness that is extremely extreme or you've lost interest in what you used to enjoy you know you don't have energy you can't concentrate you feel really hopeless you may even have sense of guilt like something is wrong with you and you won't be able to eat or sleep well and you start to think of dying a certain level of suicidality that's the syndrome but that syndrome must occur in all situations it cannot be that when i'm with my parents i'm down on zoom with my friends i'm feeling pretty good it's pervasive it's also fairly persistent more than two weeks at least but if on the other hand you feel like you're trapped that's different that's more like the cabin fever than we talk about because we are now unable to travel we can't go out we can't do the things we used to enjoy and i think it's important then to address that you know how to deal with that feeling that you're trapped so with professors answers i now know that okay sometimes i feel low sometimes i'm okay so that is definitely not depression right but obviously it shows that he is facing some mental health distress so what can this person do at this stage i think the most important thing uh is relationships most of us are social creatures we need that relationship um process so the good thing is and the good news is in this comic 19 pandemic we are in a technologically advanced way i mean you can still connect now apart from your friends your family is important so it's an opportunity to connect with them it's just that as a teenager and young person sometimes we don't use our families enough to give us the support that we need so if you see your mom in the kitchen make use of her don't just eat her food right tell her your problems uh the third half is a fun you have to think of some fun things to do if you didn't enjoy fun then that's one of the symptoms of depression so that's be careful what do you hope to do one of the things you like to do when the second breaker is over make some plans because planning gives you hope you know think about that future planning uh f the last f is faith and if you have a belief system this is the time to pray about it you know if you don't well what are the values that are important to you think about who you are as a person what's important to you what would you like to become so that level of meditating and thinking about things sometimes helps us to calm down and the other piece of course is the fact that um we are worried humans are the only creatures who worry a lot okay and because we worry so much we actually without all kinds of symptoms there's a book that i read called why zebras don't zebras don't get ulcers because zebras don't worry they live day by day they eat the grass and when the natural predator comes the lion either eats them up so the stress is really short or it escapes right there is no more stress right so i think professor just mentioned that we are not really alone we have a lot of f's we have our family with our friends we have to think of fun things to do we have to think of our faith and we have to you know spend the time to think of our future and do some planning and also the last advice he has is be a zebra maybe you don't worry so much you are essentially telling us a lot of advice that we can do uh for ourselves right is singapore so busy dealing with the covet that they are not focusing on the citizens on the mental health side what is imh doing for our patients with mental illness at this time uh we have cut downs on some of our so-called essential services like the regular follow-ups of stable patients we need to also open up to people who are suffering a potential relapse and how to support them for example we're starting to see patients uh through video conferencing telling consults you'll be surprised healthcare workers front liners 15 of them actually have a great deal of stress related mental health distress and even mental health problems largely because there's the stress of working in the circumstance and trying to keep themselves protected and also treat patients who are quite positive and so those kind of stresses add on to the other worries like will i bring this illness back to my family and so forth so that group also needs uh additional support we try to use technology i mean the basic technology is called the telephone there's a national care hotline you can call if you need help image of course you can still come and we'll be happy to give you the necessary support so moving on how effective are these non-face-to-face video conferencing sessions for mental illness patients that's a hard question to answer because i don't think there's enough research yeah but uh because of the circumstance because of what the the urgent need changed the model of care so i think it's it's effective to a certain degree let's imagine now if you were to come to a clinic and i want to see you you'd be facing each other off on a face mask now i can see you and your face and your reactions so i have a better sense of things so is it effective i think it can be for me and my friends right i think we we do realize and we have discussed this little topic among ourselves a little bit and we think that it is strangely effective because she has a friend who doesn't share that much of herself to a therapist but now that she's not in the same room she told us that she feels a lot more comfortable to share with her psychiatrist exactly and because you're in your own comfortable space isn't it correct yeah well the jury is still out in a scientific sense i think this is something that we can see mental health possibly moving into for imh i think they are reacting very well in a sense that they are still trying to help as many people as possible and if the way to do it is digitally then we must cope and we must adapt which brings me to the next question that i've received online right should somebody seek professional medical help now are they going to be obliged to declare their medical condition when they have to do job search are there any way for people to seek help anonymously if it is a mild symptom because he is worried that seeking help might leave a permanent medical record it's like if you go to see a cardiologist or you see a neurologist there is a medical record it's official but it's confidential so people don't have the right to go and access that what employers can of course do is that when you're joining them as part of the agreement you must declare that you have a medical record i think now they don't try to split they used to have like you know medical problems and do you have a psychiatric problem it should be just one it's a medical issue if you don't declare it they have no right to go and check either just break your thought a little bit right to be very honest i think for my company right we have never asked for anyone's psychiatric records my question is why do people think this way it's the stigma of mental illness you see people think that if i declare this illness people will have a different viewpoint and unfortunately this is really driven by the media and the common misconception really of of what mental illness is mental illness is like any other illness it's a brain dysfunction it's diagnosable there is a specific treatment unfortunately everything is lumped together and seen as a bad thing because if you watch the movies mental illness can be dangerous but majority of patients with mental illness are perfectly harmless if anything they are vulnerable they can be harmed and they are sometimes taken advantage of so i think that's that's the reality but the stigma mental illness is so real people are afraid of being associated so can we confidently say to uh this jt for instance if he's seeking professional help should he declare or should he not he has the right to like what is the best way moving forward my usual advice is really to be honest and tell people because you are fighting stigma and if that employer is open-minded and understands it they should employ you too because people with mental illness are just like anyone else and some of them are very creative and they can be great assets to organizations so for his second part of the question right if some people still want to choose to seek professional help anonymously are there such resources or not at all it's impossible to do that uh some people will say oh you know we're going to see well i can only see a private psychiatrist but the reality is that the laws today does allow all of medical records to be shared across both the public and the private sector but that record is kept confidential so people shouldn't be afraid of course if you want anonymous help what you are suggesting is actually self-help there are self-help tools apps websites where you can do the first line and if you have a mild illness or you have a mental health distress or problem that might be good enough and you shouldn't just go to a psychiatrist many mental illnesses and disorders are mild so depression can be diagnosed by any doctor so it doesn't mean that you have to always see a psychiatrist ah in fact the psychiatrist is probably more stigmatizing right so yeah today we train all our doctors to deal with mental uh illnesses right and to summarize i think what professor mentioned is great because if the idea of going to a psychiatrist or idea of going to an imh is very intimidating to you every doctor knows some basic level of psychiatry you're able to just go to your normal family doctor and he can help you if you have a mild mental illnesses like mild depression women are more emotional creatures so you see more women going crazy at home these days true or false well you're trying to ask the gender question then it's certainly not true because that depends on the illness that we're talking about oh yep so the reality is they tend to end up with more emotional issues so depression is more common women than in men but men may have more schizophrenia attack disorders so um i would think that there is um it's fair your life is fair and the illnesses are really well distributed right does it mean that as long as i'm mentally strong as long as i'm a strong person right i will never face mental illness so mental illness like i said is an illness like any other disease for example cancer you can't really predict you can do some things that will help you reduce the risk but you can't really sort of say okay as long as you are strong you will not have mental illness having said that it's important to have a good lifestyle a balanced lifestyle don't smoke don't take excess of alcohol and certainly not drugs and making sure that you sleep and eat well all of this protect you against the onset of some of those mental illnesses that may be related to stress-induced kind of problems so i think there are some things you can do but it's for example schizophrenia there's no evidence that suggests that you you're gonna you know prevent schizophrenia by exercising regularly it's not like that and then there are some disorders which are developmental in nature that means that you're born with those are unlikely to be preventable per se but what you probably want to do with many of those illnesses to learn to cope with it better provide a good educational system that will support rather than stress and the next one is quite a fun question okay flo asked what advice do you have on young couples fighting a lot at home because they are stuck at home together now and they cannot stand each other anymore well what they need is space relationships doesn't always have to be nurtured by interaction relationships can also be nurtured by the silence of being around each other without speaking and just knowing that the other is there but giving yourself some space to do your own quiet time to do your own thing that you like you know when you click as a couple doesn't mean that you're exactly the same interest in all the things that you do together uh you need to develop yourself you know one can develop your own interest and i think you need that space if you keep doing everything as a couple you are going to face a couple of problems right so i was reading an article and it says right you know if you're if you're stuck in such a small space you can just share your 3 to 4 p.m nobody talks to anyone in the house and then you can have you know some alone time you think that works professor yep i certainly think so i think it's important to have that quiet time if somebody is really feeling very down right now watching this video right what are three things that he should do right after he watches this video well i think you should um talk to someone on your trust tell them about how you feel a burden shared has a burden half so i think that's the first thing if you think you should try and look for a possible help i mean online is one way but you can look for your doctor someone you you regularly see sometimes just talking about it will help and i suppose the third piece is reflect a little bit on how why you're feeling this way try to understand what's going on behind the feeling thinking through uh why you're feeling this way and asking yourself some questions internally will be helpful i don't know whether in those three or that's the right order to put the three things but um i think talking to someone you trust talking to a professional and talking to yourself are probably the things that i would suggest okay and i see that you have a lot of books behind you right what are the books i should read what are there any movies i should be reading any podcasts i should be listening to to find out more about this topic okay w h o world health organization has lots of resources their resources are largely for professionals so if you you feel like you want to read something that professionals read that's that's one source there are also specific websites um like the singapore psychiatric association or uh the singapore medical association website where there's a sort of links to uh helpful information specifically because i'm a child psychiatrist we have some resources in our website um the international association for child adolescent psychiatry i-a-c-a-p-a-p um nothing to do with the um the political party but there's uh there's a lot of resources about mental health in young people i mean today we don't read books as much i know i have a lot of books here i actually haven't bought a book in the last uh five years i think all my books are electronic i have a kindle somewhere and wow and before we go we just want professor to share your most positive quote for everybody watching uh the most positive quote yeah you read a lot you will have a lot of quotes i can't remember the quote uh of hand but the quote that i i particularly liked was by archbishop desmond tutu he said something about you know trying to stop saving people from drowning by finding out why they fall into the river in the first place um i like that quote because it kind of talks about how we need to move upstream you know instead of saying drowning people people in trouble we should try and prevent problems from happening in the first place right that is a great quote and i think that is an attitude that we need to take as well you know for this topic of mental health right we need more knowledge we need more awareness so that less of us fall into the river exactly okay and with that thank you so much for your time professor phong do you have any last things that you want to tell the audience watching today well i think i want everybody to stay safe stay smiling and uh stay happy okay thank you professor okay and that's it thank you so much for watching this episode and i want to thank professor for coming in as a special guest to really talk about these problems in that i hope to learn something i've learned a lot and i think with every difficult times we want to be somebody who can help you so let us know you know in the comments below if you learned something if there's anything else you want to learn any special guest you want to come on board we would try our best to give you the answers because we also want

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Applause] i didn't really know what is actually mental illnesses when i was growing up because it was always taught that like if you go to uh beach hospital you go to imh it means that you are just someone who is on the street talking to themselves so when i tell people that i have mental disorders they will always tell me say oh you don't like it you look so like okay then i'm like what do you think mental health suffers looks like like they just look like everybody come on i do appear confident mostly but not because i totally am confident okay that's like a misconception people like oh you look like so put together we are cool whatever it is i hate it everybody's like don't put me in a part whereby i'm so invincible i'm not like i'm just a human being who is like probably going to break down at any time [Music] hi my name is jazz and i suffer from various mental disorders my motive here is to shine some light in mental health awareness as you may or may not know i suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder disassociative identity disorder borderline personality disorder anxiety depression mult bipolar and mild psychosis i think currently my ptsd is the one that i struggle with the most because the ptsd is actually the one that caused me to have depression to cause me to have other forms of like [Music] disorder it kind of rooted all the way back to like when i was a kid i guess i can remember things that are from 3 years old 11 years old 5 years old it imprinted in my mind very very badly sometimes i feel that i'm trapped there and i couldn't run out of it my mental health issues were the worst when i'm around like i say 19 all the way to like 24 year by year of accumulation of all the traumatic experience that i've had with my family my peers with schools with workplace it was just one thing after another and then just parked through like a whole chunk of like a load they have to carry so we are going through the first track right yeah what's the idea behind the song the idea for the first track is about like the past like a bad dream when i can't differentiate what is real and surreal so yeah i tried many ways to do it but then it's like it's not going anywhere so i was really like depressed and stuff so dino kind of like encouraged me to write songs and stuff to sort of like divert my anger and fear and sadness to something else then give me courage to write songs like with my broken grammar [Applause] is actually she's not like a trained professional singer but i i guess she she she loves music yeah just like me she she loved music from young like from the start so i guess that's her inspiration to want to do music now it's like and a creative outlet for her so bedroom is about the past like okay i see my life as a dream i don't think that like my assistant in this world is like a real thing it might be just a long dream that i cannot wake up from just another disappointment i really feel that like back then life was pretty pointless and meaningless and i wouldn't mind just at ending it kind of thing everything just so green it's just so so green and like you just couldn't get out of this black it's hole just a dream [Music] i work better with a lot of my suicidal thoughts so my suicidal thoughts will talk to me like a friend but suicidal is my toxic friend it's like an imaginary someone it just creeps in like you're not good you're not good that's where the bloodline of the um surreal and real thing like you sometimes you cannot tell i hope [Music] suffering for all these things uh it's like your mind is so tired and so busy and drained because your mind can work like point a to point b you have to go through like this whole part of mesa for you to dissect everything first to understand that this is actually what it is then you push through to it and say like oh okay don't get panic because that's not real yeah but it takes a lot please [Music] jess's condition has improved since more than one year ago but her depression ptsd and anxiety is still affecting her like sometimes during the day she still feels like a wave of depression anxiety so it can be a few days but then in the daytime she has to go and work so she has to sort of suppress or bury her feelings in order to do her work properly i own two basic studio so it's like a creative agency where i help brands to do their brand's content and also branding can you help me do like one shot right with three bottles together three bottles just plain with pink background here also can you know yeah for me it's like if the project is small i will do everything myself i will actually take charge of all the executing i like to have like my freedom my creative freedom to actually sit down and think what i can actually produce the best for the client i don't see that lamented illnesses is something that makes a person non-functional i have a very strong desire to get better because i always feel that my mental state is sort of like a blockage in whatever things i want to do when i feel depressed right i feel like not motivated and then i would be very sort of just self-deprecating kind of like mentality he's like oh i can't do anything i'm not good at suck and every and all these feelings it just like harvests me and bury me inside i just want to break through this whole blockage of mine which i actually since last year i saw a breakthrough that a lot more and then like now it's like i really can do a lot of things and i don't have all these things that's holding me back [Music] joy helps me to sort of like take my mind off things and then like helps me come down and also like solve like an escape so i will draw whatever i want and then nobody really can like say that what i'm drawing is wrong because when it comes to art it's like you can be expressive and stuff and it's something that like there's no judgement to it i'm actually drawing a nose with like bubbles blowing out of the nose so why is there a noose blowing up bubbles because like i always look at the new shrine it looks like the the thing that you put from the bubble up so i better with a lot of suicidal thoughts and it sometimes made me feel so pain inside to the point that i just hope i just really hope that like um i could just disappear from the face of the earth and so-called like dying is kind of like a fantasizing way of like sort of a release of myself so when you blow a bubble it's like you are like blowing your soul away going to my family in my childhood looking back it was pretty dysfunctional the punishment wasn't very lenient sometimes i feel that i don't even do anything wrong and then like the punishment was just like not good i guess it kind of gave me stresses and caused more disorder like a lot of things that even today i also have the anxiety when like there's a loud bang or like when i was like at my friend's house i would like scared that like you know their parents to school or whatever like i couldn't do this couldn't do that but actually like their house is actually okay so it kind of like still have this like sort of ptsd feel in my back of my head yeah i guess my family makes me feel that like i'm not good enough mentally i feel that like whatever i do is wrong i feel very like drained mostly because i feel that i always have to keep up to this standard it kind of makes me really feel like i'm just not loved where i wanted like the loneliness is like i guess it was like a big hole um when i first got diagnosed uh my parents think that it's like a taboo so they just feel that like i shouldn't talk about it i shouldn't um display elsewhere or whatever that is i shouldn't even go to a doctor i shouldn't even take my mess i should just like deal with it you know don't think too much okay i think back then i was pissed off there why didn't they support me and stuff but now when i look back it's like yeah they can't because they don't know and it's not their fault they don't know because my parents come from a generation that don't use internet i would say that the only reason why they sort of accept mental universes more was because the tv actually like sort of deep some awareness about mental illnesses and then that's where my parents sort of chanced by and washed it and then that's where they first realized that like what i'm going through wasn't a joke yeah and then they realized that it was actually a real thing so that's where they started to accept it more okay you know [Laughter] currently the relationship with my family is better than last time i think after i moved out things just like sort of get better it because they miss me also so i guess like that's how things just slowly changed for the better [Music] i love drawing a lot when i was a kid as i draw i feel like very relaxed very free very like like i escaped so a few years back i kind of like want to reconnect back to that part of me so that's why i started drawing again what that doing is like sort of the best way to go because i can actually earn money out of it while doing the things that i love and people are buying my art forever permanently on their speed so that kind of makes me feel happier okay just so how have you been lately great i think so far so good i mean i don't really have any much breakdown anymore but you if i have i will call you what that's true so sandra knew about my issues i realized that like the whole relationship was like a lot of times it's me telling her a lot of things then she's very patient to listen yeah i've seen like actually nowadays you're more significantly like better like more stable have lesser like outbreaks it's been like two years already yeah actually if you think about like how you've been since last like the first time i know you it's like a vast mass like vast difference before i met jess no i didn't have much of a knowledge about how severe mental illness could be i always just thought that people were you know it could be sad it's just emotions right it's like you just said for like a while then you can get better i didn't really think that it was a perpetual thing so when i met her i think it kind of educated me about the stigma of mental health and how important it is to destigmatize it what a lot of people with mental illness i feel that they lack something in their life that they are craving for i think it's important to just be there for them that would really help a lot in their um journey to recover there sandra you killed a bit more to the front of yourself oh you're closer yeah yeah i think that everybody has their own issues and it's not like they choose to have this mental illness jessa's mental health journey has definitely contributed in a very positive way to her work because i mean she's an artist right okay looking into the camera one two three did not remember to open your eyes for art it's never like something that is like a plain and simple by the book kind of thing every artist has their story that they want to tell so this is definitely her story and she wants to help other people like in similar situations as well to tell them that you know you're not alone you will get through this you just need to like find your way and find the right people to be around [Music] it's a baby stress i feel like tearing everything down i feel i don't want to do it i felt so troubled [Music] okay i want to bring awareness to mental health issues because going through mental disorders i feel very discriminated it's just that the hole is judging you like work place like you just judge me then i have like a family feel very judged by their friends that who doesn't know any better to feel that you are judged by them insurance also judge me in a sense that i can't get insurance also discrimination comes from every angle a baby stress i feel like tearing everything down actually i feel i don't know what to do i don't know i just feel everything very pretentious yeah i feel very like like like judgey and i it's like putting out a show everything just don't feel like me and then like i don't know i just felt this whole very overwhelm feeling because of i want to bring this awareness right then i have to actually put myself here to do this it's like yeah i feel like crap also i'm just like oh anxiety is like oh my god i'm so nervous and everything i'm anxious but then i have to do it because i think people need a voice to change the mindset of people so that is like so-called i have to actually put up with myself let's talk about discrimination many forms of discrimination can come like directly and indirectly so when it comes to the direct discrimination was getting rejection from insurance with um like from plans like hospitalization and as well as life insurance i think that is very uncaught for because personal thoughts and dreams right now is to get insurance like i really hope that my work here can really create enough noise to sort of alter the law a bit to solve no more discrimination from the insurance side [Music] hey what do you want give me a hug no schedule skip we met on a dating app and after that we we started hanging out as friends so we actually became friends first like recently we started seeing each other as like more than friends uh yeah it's been going slowly so as of now we're not really in a relationship but we're like friends but we're seeing each other i open my heart get crushed again i would say that i wouldn't mind being in a relationship with him but i think that he on his end he's not ready i think there's a lot of fear within him that like i have mental issues so like yeah i think he's scared that he's not up for it i dated myself but it boils down to loneliness so sometimes i do feel that like i shouldn't even tell the person that i'm dating that i have issues and then maybe i'll be accepted better but then it's wrong to think that way also so of course i try to be more honest i try to be more honest and be vulnerable since i get rejected a lot so of course that kind of makes me feel a bit like feel i mean you know try his best in a lot of things you try to take care of me be caring and stuff by scared that is a lot to us this is so [Music] surreal please just wake me i'm not gonna lie it can be tough like being in a relationship with someone with depression anxiety or mental disorders like in general so it's a lot for me to do i have to watch what i say i have to do the right things like i have to be extra careful and mindful not to trigger any of her traumas and and anxieties and all that so sometimes it can get very draining because i'm not a therapist i'm just a human i hope dream in certain sense i feel like i'm less of a human being i feel like i feel upset of course i don't think i'm rejected first time because of this so i feel that like generally i'm not good enough for anybody sometimes i feel that spring alone is better to be discharged means that you don't need to go back for follow-up it just doesn't mean that you're like fully recovered or anything it's just like you discharge from the hospital that's all when my psychiatrist wanted to discharge me i was happy but a bit worried i very scared that like i would relapse again and then i can't help i don't want to have an emergency and panic again but i feel very relieved that i'm much better now i guess i could let go a lot of things that i used to hold on with a lot of crutch so it's like a lot of things are let go and i guess i feel lighter [Music] whatever i've been through with the mental health journey actually got me to be a stronger person so i don't think i will be fully recovered but i feel that like that is actually made me a stronger person and i think that that should be something that we should celebrate instead of discriminating that you can never be better you will always be sick you will always relapse you know we should celebrate the fact that we have come so far and we have reached upon a stage where we can be contented with ourselves sometimes when people tell me to say i inspired them to give them like a hope or certain things to even help them speak up i feel very happy that like i can be an inspiration for someone else to help someone in their journey in recovery [Music] [Music] what's up ,False,False,False,False

https://youtube.com/yeolo",what's up guys welcome back to my channel the new here welcome grab a seat and strap in because we're bout to have some fun now we're almost halfway through this quarantine and honestly time is a construct and Canada's unreal I'm just vibing out until this is all over so I did a video about Tech Talk quarantines nearing the start of this circuit breaker and now that they're we're almost halfway through I figured why not do a progress report to see how these guys are really doing and whether they're coping or has already lost their minds now you're reading on the drill so let's dive right in I don't know who needs to hear this but if there's something you always wanted to do like learn a new language are we a boat and by the ELSA Kirika you have not accomplished it or even what you have not even stat that you never liked time you like discipline time for you to get your [ __ ] together and start accomplishing your goals wow I feel personally attacked right now I mean telling me to get my [ __ ] together I'm not about to take advice I'm a dick talker you know I have a lot of problems with this because we are in the middle of a pandemic nice we're not expected to be productive 24/7 and that's all of us are just trying to just cope with the day-to-day situation and really just make it through in one piece so I mean telling people to be productive that shouldn't be the top priority right now also her final call to action for us to start accomplishing our goals with those crazy eyes it's just gonna be not gonna feel for the next few days anyway guys listen up try our best but if you're not being productive this girl's gonna come after you it's Jamie schwa [Music] wait so she had a nightmare about her bags coming to life and then coming after her that's not the nightmare I thought she was worried about where the migrant workers rush into a house Bardo waterway okay I really hope you didn't put that hot dog back into the pen like everything about the tech dog was just chaotic like the way he held the hot dogs the way he dumped it in and then stirring a pen like there is so much fire something's not right I guess everyone is now at home trying to be a chef and cook their own meals but I've never seen anyone prepare hot dogs like that if you do please comment down below because master chef wants to know their location okay he's really brave for showing his face at the end because that was not right it's fine that he was exercising on its own because we're not supposed to be going outdoors exercising in big groups but running past a construction barrier why I mean he really just monkey-see monkey-do and follow his neighbors but what was he thinking really he wasn't thinking at all no thoughts hit empty like this is the kind of person that would test the system and flout the rules were just some cloud on tick-tock like that's why we kind of nice things actually come to think of it this guy is like a textbook example of a Cove idiot maybe I should make a video on Cove idiots of Singapore let me know in the comments if you want to see that I don't know if you guys heard but we recreate the external quarantine for like one more month I have all levels yeah come to think of it I'm really glad I'm out of the education system because I cannot imagine studying in the middle of a pandemic especially if it's for a national exam like it just doesn't pass the bike check it's cable toilet free well well thank you miss yeah so clearly home based learning is not going so well because this guy could lead the online class so easily I mean I cannot imagine how teachers are dealing with it right now because it's already difficult enough to do with a bunch of horny teenagers in a classroom in real life and now they have to do it all of that on an online class it's really crazy because back when there was sauce all I had was just some physical homework and the bck rep and now is a whole different ballgame and that pilot okay this entire tech tour is just unsanitary on all levels I mean if there was a health code for home based learning this one would have violated all of it I get that you're trying to cope with the new home based learning situation but maybe put you and I set up some place where it's cleaner and not at the same place where you [ __ ] I mean have you heard the saying don't study by your [ __ ] I don't know if that's a thing but I'm gonna make that thing I'm gonna put it up here it's a saying now please don't study by [ __ ] clearly these guys are not dealing with a second breaker so well okay I'm just going to stop there because I have many questions one why is a minister on tick tock - why is he dressed like it's national day and three why am I having wartime flashbacks of learning the recorder in primary school it's just a lot to process and yes everyone is dealing with a circuit breaker in their own way and this is the time where you're compelled to learn the recorder again I don't know I can't explain this I've no idea where I put my recorder I've probably disposed of it a long time ago and rightfully so because I've never needed to learn the recorder in any of my adult life maybe if I were involved in a fight with someone with a potted plant yes but other than that I've never had to touch a recorder in any of my adulthood so case closed okay so this ticked off has the caption when the government extend the circuit breaker for four more weeks hello what object afridi hey no okay this cat is really a whole mood because it's basically all of us stuck indoors doing circuit breaker and trying to escape and it's just iconic why is the middle guy's butt twitching [Music] okay that was a lot I mean I wish I didn't see that but now I have and so have you so I'm sorry and I apologize like what would these guys doing in the middle of the corridor without their tops for one and not maintaining a safe distance between each other and doing a very uncomfortable dance that has assaulted my eyes I don't think I want to talk about this anymore let's just pretend this didn't happen and move on hey guys so this is a very simple exercise that anybody can do no matter how old you are then you don't even equiptment okay I just showered but I'm just gonna show it to enemy school take minutes very simple exercise is gonna give resourced anyone okay so all you're doing is very simple all you need to do is come over right here I think I was supposed to laugh but I didn't and I hope you didn't as well because that wasn't funny yeah so I guess now that the stickers were safe distancing everywhere it's also a great time to play the floor is lava which is fine as long as you're not blocking the cue or being a public nuisance sure go ahead I guess it's some form of fitness as well but honestly you asked me I just want to get through the cue to get the food or groceries I need because it's already tedious enough to be stuck in a queue let alone one that's spaced out this long and sure you do you like what so she picks up a husband drops him by her bedside and makes him as such her feet I think this we have been fine but like the dude is clearly known to it like look at his face yeah the poor guy he looks so done like this was the fifth tick-tock he probably had to film with his wife and it's probably so ready for the sake breaker to be over at least put on a smile or something because this guy looks like me how hostage like behind the camera this is Bobby what he's seeing okay put the perfume not massage it no don't smile this is not for you to enjoy this is for me so something I noticed during this lucky break up here it this girl again is that the laundry services in my house has been vastly more efficient like the clothes that I wore last night can be washed dried and further on my bed I do not wanted to say what I think she's going to say by today's afternoon good job mom oh that was not it I mean that should have been the end of the tick tock I want to see the man throw hands because her daughter was clearly out pocket I mean what is she trying to do here so she talks about being productive doing miss circuit breaker and accomplishing your goals why not try accomplishing a laundry for style mm-hmm much to think about [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm honestly speechless like let's take a pause right here first off right on the bat suicide is not a joke like when I saw this the first time I was also shocked that the guy kept on his account because he's a family tick tock account he features his wife and his kids and then in the middle of all this he puts up a tick tock that makes fun of suicide now I didn't expect to talk about something so serious in this video because we already have plenty of problems right now and I'm just here to bring some labs but I feel like it's important to talk about mental health and I'm including some useful resources in the description below in case you need it during this period now let's move on to the final tick tock okay I'm very concerned because firstly I've seen this trend going around with the pillow being the only clothing you wear and I don't want to see what's behind okay give me a minute I need to recover okay I'm ready that was a near-death experience I'm really glad like there was some clothing on the back because I don't think I will recovered if there wasn't I mean we already had the guy dropping his towel in my previous video this is next level I'll give the dancing a 10 out of 10 but the outfit I don't want to rate it yeah I don't think I want to all right guys that's it I'm down to my last brain cell and I'm done with these tic TOCs like some of them are real crazy but I hope you had some lasts and enjoyed this video remember to like and subscribe and comment down below what I should react to next I'll see you guys in the next episode bye [Music] you only live once

#YEOLO #LocalFlavour
https://youtube.com/yeolo",[Music] what's up guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here welcome grab a seat and strap in because you're about to have some fun today we're going to talk about singapore cairns now this is not the first time i've talked about them on my channel in fact i've done a couple of videos of them before harassing people in the food court and even in the lift but today the caring that we're going to talk about is perhaps the ultimate karen in singapore like i'm talking boss level but before we go any further if you like my videos so far why not subscribe to my channel i mean it's real simple just press the big red button and best of all it's free i mean you don't have to but we'll be a lot cooler if you did some of you out there might already know who i'm talking about but in case you don't here's a quick refresher on the main character of the week so recently a lady was caught on camera harassing a bunch of people on board a train and using racist remarks against them now this video went viral for all the wrong reasons so let's just take a look all right you guys want to tell me when miss jc or you should see okay right off the bat i can't get over the fact that she's dressed in the same color as the seat like i don't know if that was all planned out but it's way too similar to be a coincidence like maybe she was out here trying to do some stand-up stacey cosplay i don't know do what you will with the information also i don't get why she's interrogating people about their education background on public transport don't know where she's going with this excuse me ma'am what is this behavior no one should be going around asking people for their race like that that's wrong no i mean i just don't know whether you know together no wonder whoa so this video goes on for quite a bit basically the people who she was harassing were recording it from their point of view it doesn't really get anywhere because she just keeps bringing up more of her credentials for whatever reason i just can't wrap my head around it it was insane the first time i saw it so this entire clip went viral and it was truly the beginning of the end for this karen like i don't even need to call sg secure because the internet moves so fast on this story that there was nothing much left for me to do like i don't know her or her story but the thing is she's left so many chapters of it online that it was not really hard to find out somehow the internet snooped around and found out that she had a youtube channel where she was uploading those videos she recorded of people in public and let me tell you you're probably not gonna like some of these videos on the channel if you glance over all of the titles you'll start to see a pattern racism in singapore racism indian harassing chinese racism malay harassing chinese merely harassing chinese malays arresting chinese malay harassing chinese malay harassing chinese malay harassing chinese indians harassing chinese malay harassing chinese you kind of get the point here there's quite a bit of variety as you can tell and it's basically other races harassing this chinese woman someone explained to me what is happening so at the time my channel was actually pretty active with her latest upload being two weeks ago and it was titled malay men attempted to molest chinese woman waking up in the morning thinking about so many things what is going on so clearly her video titles are making some really bold claims but i want to check out the video description of her most recent upload april 11 5 27 pm bunley to jurong east mrt stations let me say it again i'm not a social worker i can get along with people like bala from njc and nus are creative director my brother-in-law a ceo or my nephew a lawyer okay i was from parchment junior college i'm a university graduate and you muslims stop sexually harassing me the islam teach you to go and touch chinese girls i'm speechless because this is next level and she goes on mr shamugam staff if you're reading this please bring this to the notice of the minister you can go and check the cctv at buni station now i'm curious to see if the video she uploaded backs up these claims because those are some serious accusations let's just take a look please okay well i need to hang out with you guys as i said all right why don't you tell me are you a director like bala okay who's bala because nobody asked i mean over here this guy looks like he's just sitting in the reserve seat and minding his own business the entire time he's not even looking at her to make eye contact so i don't know why she's still filming him but funny enough right behind his head is the sign show you care with stand-up stacey seems like she didn't read it and she woke up today to choose violence were you from anywhere said bala then i'm not interested i can't get along with you you might be so stupid bullet station has a lot of cctv okay okay i'm just going to stop by there because it's going downhill really fast but it seems like from what she's recorded so far there's no evidence to back up the accusations she's made against him in the description so i don't know what's up with that so let's just take a look at another video of hers typed up malays harassing chinese and the video description says people ask why i'm always filming malaise that's because they are always trying to come near me does she not normally people exist welcome to singapore i've said it so many times before and i'm going to say it again here i was a student from huachong junior college and i'm a university graduate from a canadian university the same thing she mentioned on the train so naturally the guy i'm looking to marry has to be of higher educational or professional level i started getting physically assaulted by malaise after i approached mp fatima lati for help because my malay then neighbor from block 19 marine terrace was trying to force me to marry their son go and verify with my mp cedric foo if you don't believe me [Music] what the hell is happening here on this day i have no brain cells to process this entire paragraph so let's just look at the clip i don't know what was going on but it looked like she was just recording it selfie mode and then pointing it at the people behind her who are just doing their shopping in what looks like the supermarket and that is supposedly evidence of malay people harassing her so as more people found out about her youtube channel the family that was featured in the last video clip actually took to twitter to clarify their point of view my family and i have been receiving multiple texts alerting us of this viral video which was released by the viral horchong educator lady on her youtube channel we just wanted to put on record that we were very engrossed by our selection of peanut butter that we didn't notice it till towards the end we were stunned when we realized she was videotaping us but we brushed it off and didn't think too much about it many have texted us with concerns and some of my chinese friends were apologizing on her behalf so i don't know if this singapore karen realizes it but whatever she's doing here is causing real harm to innocent bystanders who are just trying to do their grocery shopping like i mentioned earlier there are several videos that are just titled malays harassing chinese and if you're going by the content of this video alone i'm guessing that she might be crying wolf over here because if there are so many people trying to harass you but the videos are just of them minding their own business maybe it's not a damn problem it's a you problem you know what i'm just as confused as you are and at this point it's a no-go don't pass go don't collect 200 just go straight to jail speaking of jail since this entire story blew up she's now being investigated by the police she's been terminated from a job in real estate i'm not even gonna go there and finally her youtube channel has been taken down i mean her youtube channel has been up for many years and it's only because of the recent video of her on the train that brought attention to it so i'm glad it's finally taken down because there were so many other clips of other innocent people and bystanders who were just recorded by her for no reason at all and then uploaded with those outlandish claims in the video title so by now you're probably thinking that's the end of the story and we've just gotta wait for the outcome of the investigation you're wrong believe it or not there's more apparently this lady also runs a twitter account and at the time of making this video it is still active so in some of her tweet replies she's actually shed documents that was given to her from the police as a stern warning for her disorderly behavior some years back now the crazy part is that all these documents were shed in full and none of the personal information was blacked out and if you thought that was wild hold on to your seeds because you would never guess the people that she tweeted these documents to joe biden and the ceo of starbucks so in one of the tweets she actually said tangling police it's been more than four months you still have not replied to my mp patrick day's request to release the cctv body cam footages her george floyd's demand transparency so here she is comparing herself to george floyd i have no words and because of this statement she's been in a couple of arguments and she still stands by what she said me racist cny 2020 i bought 46 dollars and 67 cents of chocolates for all 40 million indian staff at jerome point ntuc i didn't buy for the chinese even though it's cny june 2020 i donated 50 to indian staff's niece and nephew who became orphaned i don't even know him so really at this point i don't know what's going on anymore we thought that all of it was over with the police investigation underway but now she's here trying to have twitter beef with everyone but guess what the story is not over there's still one more thing about this singapore karen that you would have never guessed she's a kpop stan more specifically she's a fan of shinee and how do i know this well on a youtube channel she had plenty of playlists dedicated to shiny and she was also tweeting about them quite a number of times so there's this tweet from superm back in 2019 and right under it is a reply i would like to support taemin by sponsoring 10 copies of his cover edition i'm 56 years old too old to stand this entire story has been quite a journey and it's been a wild roller coaster ride i mean i wish i could have hopped off sooner but you and i are strapped in and stuck here right now so we're in it to the end so when this came on the news there was one camp that was quick to call out her alleged racism and there was another camp that was also quick to attribute their behavior to perhaps some sort of mental health issue now both sides of the debate were really intense and i'm no mental health expert so i'm going to refrain from passing any quick judgment over here but you know what all i have to say is we live in a society and we still like the vocabulary to actually discuss issues like race and mental health with the appropriate amount of nuance that it needs and in this case i do think that both issues of race and mental health are not necessarily mutually exclusive but you know what at the end of the day it's still an investigation that's ongoing and by the time this video goes out there probably some new updates that would have appeared as well i'm just hoping that we can all learn something from this and perhaps in the future if we do see someone getting harassed in public we would be more proactive about it and perhaps do something to de-escalate the situation i mean if there's anything we've learned from this story here no more carrots society has progressed past the need for carrots i've truly never encountered anyone like this before but if i ever run into a carrot like that next time it's gonna be on site i'm gonna whip out my camera press record and you know i'm gonna title the video chinese harassing chinese plot twist so i guess that's the end of the video this was kind of different from my usual reaction videos so i wanna hear what you guys think in the comments below about this story don't forget to like and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next episode bye [Music] yolo you only live once ,False,False,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",combat 90 has been a challenging time for food security it's a real wake-up call as to how vulnerable power situation is the singapore hospitality industry we are survivors we are fighters that they are really taking action and not doing nothing we want to increase the connectedness between teacher and learners and teachers really need to embrace this changing role the migrant workers they are at higher risk for public health issues like how we want to improve the living environments for our workers [Music] i think covert 19 was a real wake-up call as to how vulnerable our food security situation is i think people became very aware of our vulnerability and as a result there was panic in early days panic buying [Music] there are disruptions that's where the concept of resilience comes in i think covert 19 has made us more aware actually that we need to be resilient and to be able to deal with the short-term disruptions and temporary you know shortages of food [Music] [Music] items [Music] what the pandemic has shown us you know is that there's a need for us to accelerate the 30 by 30 goal and hence we introduce the 30 by 30 express grant and this is where we co-fund companies that have the capability and the technology to ramp up commonly consumed products such as eggs fish and vegetables sodium will be the jtc building this whole area is going to be the the farm itself and then thanks to the co-funding we are able to set up our first mega indoor farm in this area this area stands at 38 000 square feet and we target to complete the whole setup by end of this year and it will be able to churn out more than 1 000 kgs of vegetables daily [Music] i first started off as a system integrator we design build manage indoor farm and provide farming solutions to our clients [Music] so one of the new technologies that we'll be deploying in this mega farm will be the robotics arm so these robotic arms will help us in terms of the processes like seeding potting as well as harvesting so this robot arms is able to perform 24 7 and help us to reduce manpower when kovitz sets in we decided to go for the 30 30 express grand call and plan to set up our own mega indoor farm to help singapore address the kovitz situation and at the same time address the food security issue behind me is where we'll build our five new chicken houses we will go from our current 26 houses to 31 houses in future originally we planned for this increase to be over the next five to six years but with the 2030 express grant we will be able to do this over the next two [Music] years in our new k3 houses we have automatic feed delivery system and behind this orange flaps we have a nesting system with automatic egg collection the houses equipped with climate control so all the temperature the wind speed humidity and everything is controlled automatically by a centralized computer in our case the grant will be helping us to expedite our production timeline the grant will be used for building five more chicken houses and increasing our production capability by 300 000 eggs a day being a local farm in singapore with manpower issues we spend a lot of money and investment on technology so with this guan we are very happy to continue leveraging on the latest technology that the market can offer i think in the mid long term we have asked ourselves the questions to you know what other way of food production can there be can food not come from agriculture or farms and that's where the future food and novel food comes in can we in fact supplement complement some of our food by having so-called labs or factories or bioreactors produce that food [Music] well done i would not have been able to tell the texture is so yummy [Music] each just as a food company we focus on sustainability especially cellular agriculture which is growing and developing chicken in a lab instead of conventional forms of growing meat we use bioreactors to grow chicken which is a lot more sustainable for the environment we don't need to have the land mass we don't need to have the millions of gallons of water we have no waste product with this it also is grown in a sterile environment so we don't have to worry about antibiotics hormones things like that because we don't have to worry about our chickens getting sick it's real chicken meat so from a nutrition standpoint it's really really great production happens here in singapore hopefully within the next few years we can scale up our production we can see this in grocery stores so that everybody can can purchase it it'll be right next to you know conventional chicken it's particularly important for small countries like singapore because we have very limited resources we have to go for space limited farming most of which are the novels protein farms so by investing in those we have the potential to certainly replace proteins that come from outside protein demand will grow in singapore as people grow richer they want to eat more protein so it's also good to diversify the types of protein that are eaten the 30 by 30 is ambitious but it is a realistic and pragmatic plan i think what we've seen in singapore is that a lot of resources and a lot of political will in fact and goodwill are being invested in this 30 by 30. so because of that i'm very optimistic and especially the private sector has responded very well so this is where we store our surplus food that we get from food importers this food are typically like overstock or like cosmetically filtered products so we take this perfectly edible products that we sell them to households and businesses at discounted pricing [Music] so tree dot started three years ago trying to redistribute and so inventory to reduce food loss in singapore and around the region we start off by taking unsold inventory from suppliers who have them they can be overstocked close to expiry or just ugly products and we redistribute them physically to the businesses or households that can use them covering change our business model quite a bit when kovit happens we see businesses starting to slow down in their demand especially f b businesses we realize we have to shift to direct to consumers right so we sell direct to consumers [Music] so some friend of mine introduced me to this three dots platform and i thought it was very convenient that you can actually order all your food and then you just come and pick it up a lot of suppliers they actually stock up on food and then when they can't sell they just throw it away so if we can do our part to help them to you know lessen this kind of wastage i don't see why not and at the same time they also benefit from the cost savings it won't make a difference so instead of going to waste if this food can be reprocessed repackaged that will say yeah a very big help you know to reduce the demand on the imports coming in the migrant workers have always lived under crowded and congested conditions [Music] the migrant workers who live in the purpose-built dormitories have always lived under crowded and congested conditions who have always known that they are at higher risk for public health issues like outbreaks of various communicable diseases take care brothers okay they will take care of you no one could have foreseen the magnitude and the velocity of the outbreak that happened with kovite 19. savannah jurong will involve as the master plan consultant for the bullying square and the voting district we've come out with 950 baits worker geometry that to address the needs of housing the worker safely the intention was to make sure that this dollar tree is built fast and up at the fastest possible time we choose the container is because that allow us to build this structure at the fastest possible time during the outbreak way back in april late march a lot of people were trying to figure out how things need to be done to cope with this pandemic everybody was just trying to figure it out along the way so when we built the quick build dorms the whole idea was that when we first moved out the workers we want to quickly build a bit more permanent places for them to live in today i would say that the quick do dorms give us an opportunity to learn because we don't have all the answers at the get-go [Music] i would say that the intent behind many of these specifications i would say there are two aspects the first we want to improve the living environments for our workers the second is that we want to make sure that our future dorms are more resilient to pandemics so currently we are operating at three and a half square meters per resident in the room in the quick build dorms we are trialling six square meters per resident in the room so currently there is no limit in terms of the number of bits it's all based on the number of square meters per resident i would say on average is about 16 to 20 individuals per room there are double deck bids but for the quick build dorms we are looking at no more than 10 bits per room with one meter spacing in between the bits for sanitary fittings the current requirement is that every male dormitory must have at least one set of toilet bathroom and sink for every 15 bid spaces the quick build dorms the rooms are on suite and therefore the ratio then becomes one set of toilet bathroom as well as sink for five bit spaces and finally it's really about the isolation facilities in the past it was one sig bay for 1000 bit spaces in the quick build dorms we are looking at 15 isolation bits per 1000 bit spaces this particular quick build dom pilot the proposed accommodation standards that government came up with so it actually built up with the six square meter of living space for every worker having ensuite toilets in there however the kitchen is terminal in addition they also have this communal facilities including gyms and outdoor courts [Music] so for those actually came from factory converted dorms whereby they do not even have a kitchen or even onset toilets when they come over here is a really big change so the feedback is very very positive but of course the workers comes from some purpose build dormitory has all the onset kitchen and also onset toilets so when they come over here while the size of the living unit is bigger per worker however they have a communication obviously they would need to adapt it is very much a consultative approach we consult the dom operators we consult the employers and we talk to the ngos we even talked to the workers and many of these ideas also helped to shape the way in which we are going to design our 11 new permanent purpose built dorms they're going to add another 100 000 bid spaces to the dom environment [Music] [Applause] [Music] i think in terms of the new dawn specifications there are two aspects to it one is the practicalities the other one is time the straightforward one is time and that is that we will definitely give the dorm operators enough time to adjust to meet the new dawn specifications the second one is for practicalities what we want to do is to make sure that if they are unable to meet certain infrastructure constraints we can work more closely to design mitigating measures to meet the intent of the regulations rather than the regulation itself this is one of our dollar tree out of the six that we operating in singapore the units are all with ensuite kitchens and also with on-site toilets i think the easiest standard is actually just to remove bed stuff then you provide more space to comply with the six square meter requirement of the global standards currently in our purpose-built rooms there is also a living hole for the workers to use for a talk or discuss and all that within the room but because of the new requirements we may have to use those space for bids as well in addition that our dormitories has onset kitchen of course the requirements do not require us to have an on-site kitchen the decision is also whether to bring out this kitchen and convert it into a communal kitchen in an ideal world workers would be in single or in twin rooms with ensuite bathrooms and with little kitchenettes that allow them to cook their own meals but the practical reality is that the space and financial impact would just be too onerous what would be a target to move forward to i would suggest would be something similar to really university hostels some military camps where we agree that maybe not more than 20 workers will share a kitchen and not more than x number of workers would share a common toilet and shower facility and if we push this a little bit further there should be within a purpose-built dormitory of 30 000 residents it should be functionally divided into maybe eight to ten areas that are self-contained [Music] the strategies are implemented across three overlapping phases three phases the first phase would awareness we want to make sure that all our stakeholders especially our employers dorm operators and our workers they are much more aware of mental health issues then comes access access is really access to counselling facilities we are training our forward assurance and support teams on psychological first aid and we are also trying to create peer networks where we have peer leaders who are going to be trained in para counseling and the last one is about case management we want to have a system where we can quickly try out quickly isolate workers who need mental health help to facilities like imh at the same time for workers who already discharged we want to have a case management system that continues to track their progress to make sure that they continue to be well i think the mere fact that there is a project dawn is half the battle one that the government recognizes that this is a significant problem that it wants to do something about this is really uncharted territory for everybody we almost have to adopt tang xiaoping's metaphor of crossing the river by feeling these stones and what we want to do is to feel the stones quickly and to cross quickly because we do recognize the needs they are great and they are escalating as this crisis prolongs because all of us all struggle with how our lives have irrevocably changed kovit19 acts as a catalyst to start thinking about using technology in [Music] education [Music] finish the operation okay i want to focus on the key steps of patient safety the curriculum faced a major disruption during the kovit 19 period because certain clinical areas are considered high risk during the pandemic for example the operating theatre so these areas were out of bounds for medical students is actually the virtual reality game that we've created to teach our students on patient safety in the operating theater this is a virtual environment now you're ready to cut the skin and kill up the effort for digital transformation in medical education started in 2015. so it come quite timely that we have this gamification training virtual reality game made available to fill in this gap we're going to close the abdomen as well after the operation is done i think kovit19 also acts as a catalyst to encourage many of our faculty members in the school to start thinking about using technology in education check make sure no gauze is left in the abdomen yeah good so you have started to work on the exercises so you can see over here my students face from the facial features we can actually find out for example whether the student brow is raised or whether he's actually closing his eyes over here from there we can actually infer the students emotion whether he's frustrated or he's bought i think the need for the two came about because i'm just one lecturer facing a class of 20 or 25 students not all of them would actually ask questions so the more vocal ones would get actually more attention from the lecturer so as a result i think the more passive students they suffer if the software detects that the student is frustrated it automatically then turns out hints for the student to help the student to resolve the errors or the bugs that they face within the exercise itself in a pandemic situation a lot of the students will actually be learning from home so the tool is actually deployed onto the web and students can access it 24x7 in the convenience of their home when i first found out that the system was taking my facial expressions i initially thought it would be a little bit sketchy at first but eventually after a while of using it it was quite intuitive we can use this particular system at home to self-study on our own and that makes us more independent as well i think teachers need to bear in mind that whatever strategies we use the tool must suit the situation yes very good look at the eyes of the patient so you need to bring out the maximum benefit of learning through the use of those resources not just for technology when circuit breaker first happened some of the immediate issues of course were the fact that we were transiting into a situation that we never really faced before [Music] the very important building block we really leaned on doing full home-based learning was actually the singapore student learning space very good so this is the left-hand side is equals to five times the area of triangle adc so how do i find the area of triangle adc very good our online learning platform that was launched in 2018 it is a repository for a whole host of curriculum aligned materials resources that actually produced by moe [Music] so teachers would actually post their lessons to the sls's community gallery and other teachers can actually download that same lesson adapt it and then use it for their own students all right now i'm going to go through the ta on gradient and length of line segment when we went into a period of four homes learning i think the digital divide became really quite obvious very quickly x2 minus x1 squared so to address that one of the ways is now everybody on the device so that we can roll that into a new mode of learning so that would include tablets laptops okay first can we input our answers in the tablet in front of you the personal learning device is just a tool so if i liken the pld to a car then how you drive the car how safe you drive and how comfortable is the ride would be likened to the soft skills right use your fingers to pan zoom interact with the mat okay we have all this for been training students to think critically think creatively teachers must see themselves as learning continuously as well teachers are no longer the sage on this stage where you can claim that you know all i think we have to take a role of being a good facilitator to facilitate learning we becomes what we call the guide by the side so i think teachers really need to embrace this changing role when they first told us that we were supposed to have online lessons i was worried about the sudden change i actually realized that there's so much for me to learn my colleagues actually sat me down and introduced me to many tools and overnight i had to learn right how to use to deliver online lessons so what happens is that this breakout room icon actually appears as one of the symbols at the bottom of the screen the circuit breaker period really threw us into a mode whereby there was an exponential uptake of tech tools to ensure continuity of learning for our students teachers who exhibit a stronger digital competencies work alongside fellow educators who be maybe a bit more hesitant to explore tech for learning i try my hardest in school but i am always just passing by the skin of my teeth i feel like i am dumber than the other kids teachers in the english department they do use technology in the form of getting students to record video monologues as responses sometimes i stay after school for extra help some of the students especially those who have been a bit reserved in the classroom because they're doing this on their own and they can actually see how they are in front of the camera and how they sound they are able to actually come out better you know and feel more confident to be able to edit their own work and put it out as well i stay after school for extra help i always do extra credit i particularly like the fact that you added stress and emphasis on some of your words i think learning cannot go completely online or virtual and therefore coming back in a blended way where some of those parts really have to be done face to face where the teacher is beside the student and is giving that feedback is important keep it up right and try to improve yourself the next time you record [Music] okay so today we are going to work on unseen poetry have you all read the poem before this yeah great what our teachers did was to conduct their lessons live and to make them interactive they asked questions we were able to give quizzes and we were able to introduce platforms like youtube videos as well as game based learning platforms like uh neoport and cahoot to ensure that their interest is engaged okay so this is something that we have done before so pay attention to the words in bold very good it's an unusual word when you're online learning you are a lot more isolated so these platforms allow for collaboration and it makes the classroom environment a little bit it allows for real-time interaction with students that includes quizzes polls and collaborative boards okay well done joel you got first traditional lessons tend to be very linear where one by one you answer questions but because there is a game element to it it makes it exciting it makes them want to compete but at the same time students are at the comforts of their home so it's not so intense and they're able to do it at their own pace and there is less judgment as well the psychology of young adults is that they want things fast and they want things their own way so e-learning offers them some advantages but what is important is as teachers designing the learning experience we must then bear this in mind did you enjoy the poem okay and bunyan was a no could you share why you didn't enjoy it so we got to get their attention we got to maintain that energy level and then finally we got to extend their learning where they then come maybe in small groups to discuss it's always a mix of online and offline for discussion for thinking creatively problem solving is better than in small groups the first thing that you'll notice about this classroom are the two projectors up there the one in front of me projects all the students learning from home and their faces so this is actually an important add-on in that uh while we've got a classroom learning experience with a microphone picking up the classroom chatter as well as a camera over there that picks up the activity in the classroom everyone learning from home and within the classroom are learning as one audience can you join and this helps the teacher to be able to deliver a more effective lesson we want to increase the connectedness connectedness between teacher and learner between learners whether they are learning in the physical classroom or learning virtually from home around three to four levels i think it kind of reflects maybe how people will live work and play uh in future so in that sense the way that people learn has got to mirror that [Music] blended learning is a mixed of home-based learning and as well as in-school learning embracing both online and offline learning approaches it will allow the student to still develop their independence their self-directedness because they are away from the teachers but at the same time there will still be that very close guidance and a very close support from the school [Music] also known as the entire piece of class while technology is important it is a complementary tool in no way can substitute the in-school experience so what we're hoping to do is really find the right balance the in-school experience continues to be central it's probably key because education is a social experience so i think the next few years will be us sort of settling in and finding that right balance and figuring out how each of these can actually enrich the other side it will take some time before mass travel will resume [Music] again [Music] with the introduction of circuit breaker we have seen tourism and hospitality activities coming to a standstill it was zero with the introduction of phase two activities were progressively being introduced we saw little bit of foreign visitors but that number is not a large number we introduced the singapore rediscovers voucher where every singaporean is given a hundred dollars voucher to rediscover singapore [Music] with the introduction of phase 3 that is a very positive step towards increasing the number of visitorship it will take some time before mass travel will resume again but looking forward it is quite clear to us that we need to focus on sustaining key capabilities in enterprises supporting quality tourism enterprises and mice is one such a key strategic error for singapore mine's visitors spend almost double that of leisure travellers to singapore but you also know that beyond all these tangible economic benefits there's a lot of other spillover effects it also help us in terms of attracting investments into singapore and help support our position as a business hub business events we cannot totally do away with that i mean the likes of for example air shows food and beverage shows the dealers the suppliers the wholesalers would like to meet in person face-to-face meetings are still necessary [Music] and i think that creates variance [Music] in the room itself you can feel the fight you can see how people are glad to be able to come face to face again and of course in a socially distanced manner so thank you very much ambassador pcma is an association for the business event sector we would like to inspire all our audience wherever they are on what's the next step laura thank you very much for your time hopefully you've had your team this morning we recognized that slowly our pockets where hybrid events comes along so we want to create this model to inspire laptops to desktops we are very very encouraged actually we have close to 300 people attending each person and virtually we have more than 3 300 virtual attendees joining us live oh it is liberating meeting people in person which creates that warmth and comfort you realize now how important that is i was quite impressed with the logistics set up because i think it's no mean feat to organize 350 people with safe distancing measures there's ever-changing technology which actually makes you very inspired to see what else can we do in the future [Music] well the singapore aviation sector was painfully suffering when the pandemic first broke out prior to the pandemic about 9 out of 10 business travelers coming into singapore would stay about up to five days all that stopped overnight over time we became also quite apparent that the virus was going to have quite a long tail and possibly lasting for years it was a problem looking for a solution [Music] so the idea came up and that is what about turning the singapore expo into a safe meeting place for business travelers from around the world to meet countries around the world have been struggling to open up safely when you open it's not so safe if you want to safe you're not so open but singapore must open safely and kane changi is an example of an innovation or how can we help fortify singapore into a safe and open city for business here what's positive about singapore industry stakeholders is that they are really taking action and not doing nothing [Music] they are deciding either to leave the industry to pivot to another business model to do something else leveraging on their strengths and i think this is a reflection of pragmatic singapore industry stakeholders [Music] one example is singapore airlines while they cannot fly in the air but they actually introduced meals on board in a plane i think what is very creative about this idea is passengers were able to have a taste of business class and first-class meals as well the other example is cruise to nowhere many people like to kind of have the feeling of traveling so they like the feeling of packing a luggage and going on board of be it a plane or a cruise [Music] so while doing that the businesses are actually trying their level best to earn that extra dollar that they can find in order to [Music] survive i would say with covet things have changed a lot in the hotel how do we do things how we run things because we stay in singapore so what attracts us what would make us come to stay in a hotel and we looked at the different segments that is available right now in singapore so we decided to target certain areas or certain markets we didn't want to do a project or produce a run-of-the-mill kind of promotions so therefore we came up with this mummication we targeted the mums [Music] i think the mom kitchen gives the moms a time to take a break to be away from the family i would say and also to recharge you can book a spa as well as comfortable pajamas some bath bombs and high tea we are also working on other packages one is called a medication it will have a steak dinner they will have opportunity to try out uh alcohol i think this is also a first in singapore where we also want to treat the men [Music] we were working on a mobile check-in with the covet situation that arose it so approached us further to quickly start this up we started working on a qr code this qr code is placed in the guest room can be used to order in-room dining or request for items let's say an extra pillow or extra towels we can only allow certain number of guests at the pool so we have come up with an appointment system or a reservation system where the guests can book their timings at the pool [Music] prior to covet 19 we used to have plenty of international travelers but due to copper 19 we pivoted to local business sources we have seen a number of guests who have very key institution experiences paired with unique activities this is going to be your diy cocktail first day guests can opt for a cocktail making workshop in the privacy of the guest room families can choose our family glamping package and keep their little ones happy with a clamping experience we are dedicated to showcase the rich heritage of our properties as well as heritage tools for our guests two things was done to the building which was then for the building during these tours our tour guide shares interesting facts and stories which even local residents may not know about so during that period of time this floor here where we are standing is part of the general post office for the gpo then i have been the tourist guide for about 14 years and one interesting thing is that in the past occasionally we do have the singaporeans coming in for the tour but during this period of time i find that the numbers has been growing some of the singaporeans who claim they don't even realize that before this fullerton building was actually the singapore general post office and you found that they designed in such a way that we recognize that we are in this together and we are taking every little steps to revive the economy and to stay in business so it is really the spirit of resilience and survival to let us stay afloat with the government is farsighted enough to want to invest in future food alternative food in the process we all have the potential to grow more food for their own country if there are disruptions maybe with outside supplies the pandemic really enhanced a lot of this a new pedagogy i think that's what it has taught us never rest on our laurels and stick to one way we always have got to try different ways adapting to different new environments [Music] none of us are truly safe from kovite 19 unless all of us are and i think the realization and the acceptance of this fundamental truth that we're all in this together has been one of the biggest learning [Music] points [Music] you

#mindfulness #brahmcentre #askadoctor #healthyliving #freewebinar #healthtalk #mentalhealth  #anxiety #depression #fear #globalpandemic #emotionalhealth",actually uh let me just say um i have you can see the slide here in fact it just tells you i have just three things to say uh to add for this whole talk and it's gonna i'm gonna repeat them because i think they are very important and i think that everyone can actually do this um and so um it's not complicated and the three things are so this is why i call beginning with the end in mind at the end of this talk i hope that everyone can be a little bit more aware about mental health issues and how it can affect ourselves and the people around us people that we care about people in our family and our work the second one is the need to do a mental health check self-check once in a while you know and uh you know just now when we did the body scanning and and angie asked us how do you can you feel your breath can you are you aware of your feet and your hands where they are can you are you so that's that's doing a check and she asked what is your mind what is going through your mind but how are you feeling and i think it's useful for sometimes for us to do a mental well-being check of ourselves so that's the number two the third thing of course maybe many of you came to this talk because you want to do something to improve your mental well-being so take action there are many many things that can be done i'm going to talk about quite a few of them and some of them you may already have done been doing some of them you may learn something new from this so really i hope that everyone can take a little bit away from this session so these three things actually this is what my talk is about uh be aware of your mental health issues be aware of mental health issues and it can affect you do a mental health self-check from time to time and if you think you're not doing as well as you should be do something about it take some action okay now um angie introduced me just now and i am a psychiatrist i've been working in mental health care i think 24 25 years now and it's been a very enriching and rewarding experience for me uh because i've been able to journey with many people who struggle with mental health issues and help them along their journey of recovery um she talked about experience and really it's i just thought i'd tell you that it's not really about the the research that i've done or the journals that i read or the textbooks it's some of that but a lot of it is really learning from my colleagues learning from other practitioners in mental health care and really learning a lot from the patients and the people that i come into contact with because each and every one of them has something to teach me and to teach themselves and that's that's one of the points i wanted to bring across everyone who has gone through a mental health experience actually and have come out of it has got has gained something that you can you can it's a skill that you have you can take away for the rest of your life and you can actually impart that skill to someone else so each of you and i'm sure every one of us has gone through some mental health difficulties emotional difficulties you can help you've helped yourself you may not realize it and you can also help someone else the next thing i want to talk about really was about imh a little bit you know people ask about what do we do and uh what's how image has been affected by covet 19. so i thought just spend just a few minutes talking a bit about the work that we do um so this is a one snapshot with some numbers about imh so we are singapore's only tertiary psychiatric institution and we focus on three main pillars clinical services education as well as mental health research okay now we are very large hospital you start seeing numbers below and i'll try to explain some of that to you later but really we're designed to look after people with quite severe and serious mental health conditions uh we provide hospital services uh for both uh acute as well as what we call recovery care so maybe i just wanted to just let you know that there's a numb that's a number that's in green uh actually we have 2 000 beds in this hospital that means we can have 2 000 people staying in this hospital every night on average this is 2019 figures we had 1700 people every night staying overnight with us now and you can see if you took on the right the of the 1700 people actually about 600 to 700 of them are what we call acute care they've come in for a short in-patient stay we work closely with them to monitor them and help them to get well enough so they can continue their recovery at home uh but there's some thousands over patients who stay with us on a longer basis and we call that recovery care because they take a longer time to get well uh some of them have stayed with us for many years and our responsibilities to provide care for them as if they're part of the family now i just wanted to let you know that there's a bigger number the biggest number of all so sometimes people associate image with just the hospital and that we look after inpatients actually we have 47 and a half thousand out patients this is a much much larger number than the people who sleep in the hospital at night uh 47 and a half thousand people who just last year visited us at least once and many of them more than once in the year and they have come to us because of various mental health problems and our work really is to support them help them uh give them the right treatment and and and journey along that of their with them on their road to recovery uh of this forty seven and a half thousand actually about five to six hundred of them visit us in our various clinics every day so you know so that's the number on the left and uh of that 47 000 again uh 24 on average 24 of them have to be hospitalized every day and then they get discharged again so i you know i thought i just wanted to let you know that we are quite a large enterprise uh and we have an important role to play in singapore so therefore how did covet 19 image i think i have many friends and people who do ask me oh what's happening in your hospital how has covert 19 affected you and i thought i wanted to just share with you how what we have gone through as a hospital my team and i all my colleagues during this period now we have decided very early on that imh must continue to function and play its role in singapore as that national mental health center you must remember we just cannot stop and say we all work from home and then we also close down 47 and a half thousand people our patients and our clients and we need to continue providing for them also the 1700 who need to stay with us on a nightly basis so these are the three things i want to make it simple for everyone it is for you to know as well really i think the number one thing that we must continue to do is to continue providing our services so our hospital has never closed down during this period of covert 19 we've continued to keep our inpatients open our clinics have still been open and our emergency services happen as well right we had to scale down some of it but really we had to make sure that people who needed care will continue to get care the number two thing of course in order to make sure that number one can continue we must make everyone in the hospital our patients and our staff and our partners and our vendors who come and work here with us everyone must be safe from infection so that means a lot of additional infection control measures so you know you would know that you've got children going to school or you're going to work place everything and you've gone to a mall in singapore so many checks uh social safe distancing lots of checks going on and we've had to do all that as well here in imh uh and then the third item really is to make sure that all the changes that we are making we can continue for as long as kobe is around and is a threat to singapore and to our hospital and our people now just these three things that we've had to change has made us do things quite differently and you can imagine has brought about quite a lot of stress to everyone in the hospital how many colleagues do i have i have two and a half two and a half thousand uh 2 500 colleagues staff working in this hospital and we together collectively have to change the hospital to make us ready for covet 19. and you can imagine trying to keep us open our services and essential services on keeping ourselves safe as well adhering to infection control practices and making sure we have enough resources to go on for the last few months and next few months if we need to it's quite an effort and it's been quite stressful and then on top of that we just came out of circuit breaker uh we have to make sure that our staff and our partners and our patients also can participate in the circuit breaker measures so that is basically if we don't want them to travel and public transport and come to us we need to find a way of delivering care to them maybe by a teleconsult maybe by telephone maybe we can deliver medicines to them instead of making them come and queue up in the clinic so that additionally and the last one really is mental health obviously became an issue and a concern for many people who had to go through the stress of cobit 19 and circuit breaker and many of our doctors and psychologists participated at allied health professionals also volunteered their time to work in the national care hotline to pick up the call for people who called in who had difficulty or emotional problems and needed some help so really look at these things really a lot of additional things that we had to do at institute or mental health why am i telling you this i guess i wanted to let you know that we as a hospital are just like you and your workplaces we've had to go through lots of changes as well and really what does that mean um two things one is it can be stressful and back to my first point we need to know that it can be stressful and we need to look after ourselves as we go through this period and the number two thing that we have learned is that collectively when we work together and help each other we can get things done that's the second thing i've learned so we had to do all these new things we had to do teleconsults uh psychotherapy providing therapy to zoom like this aha we had to make sure medicines were delivered we had to go through patients who couldn't come calling them to make sure that they're all right at home and we still had to do home visits for patients who were in crisis so these are all the things that we have to do right so back to this point so i wanted to just tell you a little bit about imh because we have learned a lot about ourselves and that these three things too actually we have to be aware about the mental health of our staff and of course patients what's going to happen to them during this period we need to check ourselves from time to time how are we doing and the third thing is we need to take action to make sure that we are doing all right and this is the third thing i want to the third thing i want to talk about you see so our psychologists and many of our clinicians came together to say that's how let's see how we can look after ourselves better during this stressful period and they came up with a whole series of tips and help uh tip sheets you know and a little self-help tools which is going to be what i'm going to share with all of you because it works for us and i'm sure it will work for many of you as well and so some of the little things i'm going to tell all of us that we can all do came from our psychologist designing little self-help skills that we can all apply in image and i think they will apply to you too okay so now let's talk about how covet 19 and the changes that we're going through in singapore is going to affect is affecting all of us um i'm going to talk about different groups of people and i think many of you in this audience probably fall into this category you're adults and you're part of singapore's community right and uh you know i think you've gone through a difficult time all of us have and some of us have struggled through this period more than others um i've had people who told me how difficult it is because they were very outgoing they had many social contacts they had many activities that kept them out of the house almost every day and suddenly they were confined at home and they couldn't even go to work and they were asked to work from home it's a loss of their sense of freedom um the the need to have face-to-face contact with other people and you know some people just find that the phone or a zoom meeting is not the same and actually even more is to worry about how long this is going to last now these are certainly things that can cause quite a lot of stress now so what how does that translate into your emotions so i think this is the part about knowing about the mental the feelings that you can experience yes talk about you experience frustration anger you might be irritable you might snap at someone or you might feel an overwhelming sense of worry anxiety wake up feeling very anxious some people cannot sleep because they are feeling very anxious and some people feel alone and very lonely or they feel very bored it can rise bring bring about strange relationships i mean of if you're feeling very stressed and you become irritable then you're not very good company and then you may cause a lot of stress to the people around you right and so i think that's the first point you must be aware that the feelings that you're going through are a result of the changes in your life now i bring this up because the imh has done several studies and one of the studies we did was what we call mental health literacy and we realized that we as singaporeans are sometimes not very good at identifying emotions or being aware of mental health problems we ask singaporeans to tell us whether they can recognize different mental health conditions and only 60 6 out of 10 people could you know say oh this is you know some someone like this is going through depression or or anxiety four out of ten couldn't figure out uh how to how to understand the person who's going through a mental health problem so i think that's very important so the awareness that's that first point uh and um so the next thing is that of course what do you do right if you have some of these emotions um so you know again we have seen actually some of these mental health issues exploding into the public anger management people being unable to adjust you know comply with the need to have safe distancing or even to wear a mask in public because if you so frustrate the anxiety and depression i think we put these clips because i wanted to let you know that it's not a silent or a hidden problem i think as a country we have uh a much more aware than we were before about mental health problems and today there's a lot of public debates there's a lot of newspaper articles and social media comments about mental well-being and that's a good thing because we all need to be aware that first point be aware of mental health issues and how it can affect us so that's great i think it's good that we acknowledge that these things can happen we need to be aware whether it's happening to us or not and that's the main thing we'll talk about next now we'll do a little bit of self uh self check later but let's talk a lot about tips that you can do if you are experiencing some of the things i just talked about just now the frustration the worry anxiety depression uh irritability etc uh and i talked about the tips that uh my colleagues in imh have come up to help us continue working well in our image and so these are two little posters that came up in our hospital uh and let's look at which one first i mean the third the one on the left-hand side really is about you know exercising i know many of us think they know this but i don't know how many of us actually do it um so these things are not rocket science they're not going to tell you something that you don't already know in fact some of the things many of the things you already know it's just whether or not you are actually doing them hopefully after this little session that we have together you may take some resolve to actually do one of two of those things exercise regularly to get you some time for kindness a simple kind act um look out for good news i mean uh many people who have told us my patients as well as my colleagues have told us it's endless news about covet and gloom and bloom and terrible things are going to happen to us and really it's sometimes you feel that i need to know more because just in case i need to do something about it um my advice is if it's affecting your mental well-being too much information is not helpful look for some good news uh that we have one of these tips that says go and look for those youtube kittens and funny puppies it does work just helps to relieve the tension for that moment um we have to socialize creativity creatively you know video calls phone calls whatsapp uh videos and things like they do work uh the little picture at the bottom there you can see is what ng was just doing really it's censoring ourselves relax doing a bit of a relaxation exercise slow breathing counting your breath being mindful of the fact that there's breasts going in and out of you and everything else is actually all right for the time being at the moment so these are things that you can do um the the the the poster on the right are more ideas really it's about self-care they talk about writing a journal i'm not sure how many of you do that um exercise again playing games with people and actually there are some online games that you know some people have told me are quite fun actually um and on the the right-hand side of that house says trust and gratitude now this is something that i think we talk a lot about but i don't know whether we actually do it um and it's really about reflecting having some quiet time to talk about think about the things that we are grateful for that could have gone wrong but didn't go wrong we unfortunately um you know i've noticed that people tend to focus a lot on all the bad things that happened and they don't praise or celebrate or commend or acknowledge the good things that happened or in fact the bad things that never happened despite all the worry that they did and in fact if you prevented something bad from happening well done you know so that's great uh prepping yourself you know making sure that you're going to be working from home uh you need to make sure that and i i think under phase two many of us will still be working from home you still need to um perfect that art or working from home to make sure that uh things are okay uh and that you have a workspace and that your you don't mix up everything so that basically you find that you're working from from day to night and there's no end and no boundary difference between work and home life recharging everyone has a different way to recharge whether it's exercising whether it's connecting having a good meal having a warm shower and um and the last point really in this slide i thought is something that we don't do enough it's connecting just texting someone to ask how you are and telling them how you feel i think these are very simple things but i don't know how many of us actually do it all the time more tips that came up from my own colleagues really i thought i'd share with you um if you are starting to feel down there are a lot of things that you can do to help yourself you can pick yourself up on a little on a daily basis to give yourself a bit of encouragement it might not work all the time and you may need additional help but you can certainly do some of this even if other people are helping you you can still help yourself uh simple tips if you're going to be feeling down and out and you're feeling you're you're moving around in your pajamas the whole day and you don't feel like getting out of bed get out of bed get dressed and and try and stick to a daily routine it may be difficult for some but for other people just the act of doing that and self-care tells you that i do care for myself i'm going to get help it's a tough time but i'm doing the best i can for myself a little treat for yourself um you can have bubble tea now so i know that seems to be a big favorite here uh so you know a lot of pictures there are the same along the same vein actually of trying to be kind to yourself treat yourself kind you know kindly do something fun even if things are difficult it's all right for us to take a short break and be kind to ourselves watch our funny idea this is the one about cute animal videos take short walks um you know um um said you know where your favorite skincare makeup for the guys we should shave yo i've seen people who didn't shave because they're working from home i don't know if that makes them feel better or worse actually so um yeah so the impact of this really is uh you know i think people feel stuck and trapped and so you should realize that you are starting to feel that way let's do some of these things okay so you know i'm leaving the rest of the slide for you to read and i'm sure you've had a good look at them and i'm sure you're starting to realize that hey i couldn't do some of these things you know i didn't try or you you may have said oh yeah i've tried some of these it doesn't work then try some of the others okay now i thought i talked a little bit about kids because many of you are home with your kids now shouldn't that be very nice unfortunately sometimes it's quite stressful and we've seen articles about this in the papers and in social media but all tracked together and sometimes they call this cabin fever right and people who are not used to being together are now together and for the kids it can be a frightening or un anxious time for them because suddenly they cannot see their friends in school they have to adapt to technology at home and and have home lessons and then you know they've got their parents with them all the time and it's a different feeling um let me just share a tip with you my colleagues who work with children have told me that actually children are actually more adaptable than adults in many ways children need just a few things actually they need to have a sense of security they need to feel safe they usually feel safe when the people who they trust and they love are around them so actually just being the parents being at home with them is half the battle one and the parents mustn't be anxious or feeling very angry or very you know distressed though i mean if your the parents are in distress then if the kids can feel it but if the parents are calm and they are able to explain the situation and the kid knows that there's not much danger to him or herself that's half the better one kids also uh just like to have someone to follow they model so if the parents are doing something that is rare mask they practice social distancing the kids will pick it up quite quickly without questioning too much um and um you know so it's it's it can be challenging but it's also not impossible um so you know some of the points here really are the kids can feel overwhelmed if the parents are feeling very upset and emotional and keep talking to them about commitment changes and they can't do this they can't do that focus on what they can do and what are the fun things that have happened instead of having to go to school and they can do some things together right at the bottom is again being aware so when kids are feeling stressed they get angry anxious or depressed too and they can throw tensions so this is not again um your kid being bad or being naughty they're just expressing the emotional distress that they've been being aware that's the first point i talked about so many of my colleagues have kids uh and uh and we came up with a lot of tips as well uh to help uh the kids uh of uh our staff i mentioned i'm sure they apply to all of you as well right so right on the top right hand side it says parents can make a big difference and i mentioned just now we as parents need to stay calm if we're panicking the kids are going to pay you need to find out or you can observe uh you know i talked about the number two do a mental health check see how your kid is feeling if you're you know if your if your child is is fretful and anxious you know that there is something that you need to do something about um what you can do is provide them security and safety that this is all right it's okay that we are together at home now it's okay that we stop going out to our usual playgrounds or or fast food place it's all right because we have we will be fine and safe as a family and we'll do new things together uh and that's that is the that whole little squares at the bottom about having a new routine for the family you know um and it starts off by saying have you had regular check-ins with your children on their feelings towards what's going on give them a special space for them to do some studying uh remain calm uh let the children stay in touch with their friends if you can right give them a lot of encouragement actually some of these apply to ourselves as well when we do something well we don't pat ourselves on the back and then our kids uh do something they completed a school assignment and they managed to do state you know they managed to to to go out and wear a mask throughout the period and there was no we need to congratulate them and give them a pat on the back as well routines are important for children uh have meals together as a family in fact many people who said that actually this one of the good things about uh well good things one of the things that were not so bad uh that came out of the world from home was they spend a lot more time with their family and their children and um with adolescence it's sometimes a little bit more stressful but actually it works too um adolescents do like to be with their parents too uh and they it's a it's a changing time for their relationship but being together allows them to understand their parents in a new light and for you to understand your kid as well who is uh transitioning into a young adult right so i think we talk about helping adults helping children um so it's the same female we'll keep talking about being aware of mental health issues do a mental health check and then take action so i'm actually going to ask us to do something together now which is i'm going to ask you to tell me how are you doing uh chiang san from uh brahm is going to help us to start a poll uh qing sun are you on ah yeah okay so i think okay based on what we're doing you can start doing this now you should be able to uh yeah you're supposed to be able to vote yeah that's right it will come so i think there's a 360 of us in the room and uh let's see how it's doing um okay i don't think you can see the results now we will show you the results when it's all done uh and i'm telling you now that 130 out of 360 have have voted very good uh let's see how far we can go um ng how are you doing tell me how you're doing i'm good thanks prof and uh yeah i'm seeing the results most people are actually feeling fine so that's really good now i recall you mentioning about the parents and kids um somehow i think a lot of parents think that you know their kids would just know what to do but i think as parents we need to guide them like help them plan their day because they've never spent every day at home and this is a usual unusual uh way for them to be spending their time so it's actually very helpful if parents would sit down with them and plan out each of their hours uh even when they don't have any classes on yeah indeed so that that part about routine right it's a simple word but actually it's a very big thing to do because i think the whole routine kids love routines not they love it they sometimes struggle you don't want to go to bed but actually having regular bad times eating times going to school times is actually very good for your children so basically when they all get get disrupted it's very important for parents to understand that they need to build that structure around the advocates again they're right ng yeah okay so it looks like we have stopped a number of posts almost 300 out of 360. i think it's fine well done thank you very much for participating let's let's show the result can we show the results to everyone can okay you can see this right okay sharing poll results so i think there are 360 people in this room and almost 300 participated and you know the numbers are actually there so 157 of you 53 of you say you're fine well done i must say uh i don't feel fine all the time and i'm i i think how are you feeling now and i'm very very happy to know that okay feeling a little stressed up to 30 percent you know 90 of us i feel and honestly before this thing start this this webinar started ng and i were going to a little bit of stress because we had some technical difficulties and i couldn't get on my point is um feeling a little stressed from time to time is more than normal every one of us should feel that we should know that we are stressed oh and and angie told me uh we were preparing this don't worry there's time you see and that really helps to diffuse the tension and i say okay we'll try again and log in again right ng and so it's recognizing it and taking a quick action to calm each other down so that's not feeling a little you know of course feeling stressed sometimes i think all of you know is actually quite helpful huh because if uh sometimes we don't feel a little bit stressed we do doing things a bit too slowly having a little bit of stress to make sure that the meal is is is ready on time or the or the kid gets to bid on time really it's useful because it helps us to get things done or get assignments um 15 of you 43 said uh it's quite stressful uh but i'm hanging in there thank you for acknowledging that feeling i hope you can pick up a tip or two uh from this seminar and uh you need to practice more self-care and some of two or six of you say is really very stressful uh and yes it can get very stressful and that's why there are people and organizations and uh that can help you and i will talk a little bit about that next so can we stop sharing the slides uh the the poll results uh okay i can do that yeah okay i'm gonna go to the next slide really and uh summarize really you know uh the findings that the the results that we had from the survey if you're feeling fine that's 50 of you well done uh that's great keep it up and in fact i'm going to ask you at the end of this webinar to share your secrets because if you can do that other people possibly can learn a tip or two from you feeling a little stressed as i said that's quite normal stress can sometimes actually help us to achieve more stressful but hanging in there let's pick up a tip or two from each other today really stressful maybe you should get some help uh try helping yourself if it doesn't work and in all those things you try uh and you cannot manage get some help and the last one no one today put that category but i've done a talk before and people have picked that category and you really really shouldn't reach out for help and we put on this slide here but this this information was available quite readily that uh you should call for help if you know someone who is in that situation you know the help i can't cope um these are the numbers to call take a screenshot if you want uh because you can help someone to help themselves uh to reach out the national care hotline is the number we put right at the top and that is the uh the hotline set up by the ministry of social and family development msf really to serve singaporeans and all of us at this time of crisis uh during covet 19. okay i'm going to finish up the talk by talking about some special groups i won't spend too much time because we have a little we can have a little bit of a dialogue at the end of q a if we have some time but really it's about trying to recognize that not everyone is just uh you know an adult or a child here i think we need to recognize in singapore there are some vulnerable groups who are maybe experiencing additional stress and how we helping uh usually in the talk i'd ask my audience how many of you are healthcare workers uh and um and i mentioned right so a lot of this work comes from the fact that we learned from our own experience which we got stressed too and i i i'm my my thoughts and uh uh reach out to my colleagues in other health care uh organizations in singapore whether it's ncid or all the other public hospitals uh who are out there uh dealing with patients with cobit and also setting up a medical post in the community and serving uh many people who are affected by this condition so really it can be questioned and you all have all seen pictures of the healthcare workers in full ppe right they call that thing where they wear the whole gown and gloves and and goggles and masks um so if you're a healthcare worker uh it can be exceptionally stressful i know many other healthcare organizations have put in place various things to help their employees to work more comfortably and more safely and to feel more secure about their work and um you know all of you who meet a healthcare worker really please show some appreciation because it can be very tough for us so dealing with anxiety changes in work routines and of course there's always this fear if you are dealing with you're working in a hospital that you may come into contact with someone with a virus and then there's always this fear of bringing it home to your family members so i think this is important uh healthcare workers are really stepping up now to do a lot more and they are at risk for burnout and fatigue as well so in fact we do have quite a lot of uh this one is the imh one uh staff wellness support framework so i think we we do need to make sure that you know if you're a healthcare worker uh you need to do that self-check as well and you're not feeling so good emotionally uh reach out put your hand up and tell someone in in your team uh your manager your nurse manager your your head of department i need some help and say i went to this talk and the doctor said that it's normal for me to feel stressed and i need some help so these are the things that we can do um so healthcare workers um there are some other vulnerable groups and i'm talking about persons who already have mental health struggles and mental health issues um and so this is part of our work we need to be aware that many of our patients and their caregivers may experience even more stress um some of my patients uh and i'll tell you different stories because you know of course in the last two months or so three months i've still been seeing some of my patients and they've gone through different experiences some yes have struggled through and felt even worse than they already were feeling uh and felt that really you know the the cutting off of social ties and helplines and their regular routines made them feel even more anxious uh or even more depressed and we were helping them to overcome some of these difficulties um interestingly um what i wanted to bring across this point that what happens today doesn't necessarily mean it's going to continue for the next week or the next month i've had patients who have initially had a tough time with the circuit breaker measures because they just found that was such a disruption in their lives and they couldn't do all the things including work uh and and then they were left by themselves and they were overwhelmed by their emotions but you know interestingly over time uh they allow themselves to adapt and just accept the changes and some of them actually felt better after a while in fact some of them who have been experiencing a lot of stress from work said that now actually working from home and the boss not being there or looking over my shoulder and asking why is that not done actually was a bit more uh uh less stressful than before so after the initial change of having to adapt to working at home and couldn't check with other colleagues they found that she was quite okay um so uh for people who do have mental problems it it can cause a change it has not necessarily becomes worse it can actually get better for some people um and um some patients have relapsed and again we have asked reached out to our patients to contact us if it's affecting them badly and they are having worse symptoms and they may need to come back for urgent care right and so if any of you know someone who is struggling with mental problems you know this is additionally special difficult time for them so ask them how they're doing same principles apply you know they can also help themselves or they may need to get additional help for their problems um this is a group that's often talked about individuals who are in difficult situations at home uh with already broken down or difficult relationships to handle with abusive relationships uh and uh the circuit breaker which is over now you know spending time at home uh in a confined space with people who there's a lot of tension can cause problems and uh more frequent uh or abuse and in this group really we ask individuals who know of such people or if you feel you're affected you must reach out uh you must call one of those hotlines or make your way to uh well i'm not saying to imh but necessarily you need to go to get help whether it's one of the family service centers a community center make a call go and see a gp a family physician you need to just let them know that you are in a state of distress and um you need some help okay so we need to recognize that this is a group that is vulnerable um there are also persons with special needs um these are individuals with uh maybe uh physical disabilities or intellectual disabilities um and um circuit breaker as well as all the changes in uh covert 19 can cause some distress to such individuals you know i listed them down there really confusion also disrupting disruptions to routines um lack of sensory stimulation and again so the last three points is really recognizing that this is a mental health tissue that we can do something about because you get tech tantrums uh the behavior changes uh and so you need to recognize that this is not normal and that we can do something about it uh try some of the techniques we talked about earlier you know putting back that routine asking them how they feel try to give some explanation uh and see if it works if it doesn't reach out for help um there you are so supporting individuals with special needs in fact some of my colleagues together with colleagues in nuh as well as singh health nuhs and singh health actually had come up with a little care kit for people who are caring for individuals with special needs i think if you go to the imh website you can get a link a copy of this resource which is a which is uh online which is a soft copy uh book that you can have little tips that you can help if you are dealing with someone with special needs um one last group i wanted to talk about really uh you know people who have been going through a particularly difficult time in singapore and you know it's our uh migrant workers who've come to work and built singapore do many many essential jobs for us um so of course we know it's been an extremely stressful time for them from fear to being infected uh and the uncertainty over their future um just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten about this particular vulnerable image has got doctors and nurses who work with a leading ngo health serve that's that supports uh the migrant worker population uh during this difficult time right and uh so we mentioned that as well last group to mention really is uh the elderly amongst us um all of us have uh older friends or relatives that we care about and we mustn't forget that this can be a difficult time you know many of us are doing okay today check in on someone that you know who's older it can be an auntie uncle that you know or a parent grandparent uh your neighbor just checking with them to find out how they're doing we read a lot about how some of them get disconnected from their children especially during the circuit breaker period and they don't know how to access them using technology and they they feel very isolated and they don't know what's happening around them um so reach out to them the same one two three be aware that they can go through a mental health challenge because of the current period ask them don't assume that they're doing okay do a mental health check on them and say i know uncle how are you feeling you know what's happening with you can i help you which is the third point uh you know can i give you some you know can we do something together that you know i can i can help you with so that you can feel better help them and try and get them to help themselves or help them to get help if it's necessary okay now um i'd like to really end on uh two points really that you know um that as a country uh i think we have recognized that this is a difficult period many people have come to ask me so are we going to have more mental problems in singapore and the answer is i think we have to be prepared for mental health issues because it's going to be a difficult period over the next few months or even in the coming years not everything is what a psychiatrist calls a mental illness we have mental health problems because of the things that have changed around us the circumstances about whether our work will be the same whether our families will be affected whether our children's schooling will be affected if whether we can we can travel to visit people overseas and our business our work involves traveling there's so many uncertainties uh and we also know that we may be facing uh economic issues in the recession so all these issues are going to contribute to our mental well-being now just this slide shows you that as a country we are coming together to we recognize this that first step we have to recognize that there can be mental health issues and so these things which are all about budgets and supporting us through this difficult time all of us in singapore is actually one way to help to prevent mental health problems from overwhelming us right so it's it's something that we're doing together um these pictures of course are what i think our government is doing for us but can you do something for your friends and your community can you step up and do something for yourself and your family too i think everyone can do some of that and that helps prevent too many mental health issues from becoming a problem um there will be some people who still need help and again uh in anticipation that is going to be a difficult time that are help lines available so early on that was that slide that had the helplines and i hope maybe you needed information it is all available on the internet anyway but this was one i wanted to talk about the national care hotline that number there 1800 202 6868 uh when it's set up by msf uh my friend vivian who's uh helping chief psychologist there and really it involves many professionals from many agencies many from imh uh participating in the hotline and um it's a good resource if you need help or you know someone who needs help give them this number ask them to call because they get someone on the other line to talk to them it's a real person who listens to them finds out what that problem is and if it's a mental health related issue they are they are channeled to a mental health profession to speak often times though it's about uh you know financial issues or economic problems about work issues i've lost my job what do i do and the helpline is also able to help direct them to the right resource okay now um we have come to 12 o'clock i mean you've been i see you you guys are still there 360 of you amazing thank you for listening i hope you picked up a tip or two and uh actually i thought now we can do something together um just reminding us actually i wanted to summarize because basically this are the three things i wanted to say angie uh and i wanted all of our participants to to and i'll say them again a bit a bit boring but actually really important please be aware of mental issues two is do an occasional mental health check the way we scanned our bodies just now do a check and then take an action to improve things okay so now i'm going to ask all of us again to participate um can you go use the um stop the share right so maybe you can stop the share oh can you use the q and a section there um um okay we'll go back up later to see about answering questions but i thought maybe at this point in time let me i thought it's useful for all of us to help each other um by sharing each other's tips angie what do you think should we answer some of these questions first or get everyone to help each other yeah i think it would be good to have some of these questions answered but i just wanted to chime in that it's so important right now that we focus on what we are able to do rather than lamenting on the things that we can't do uh including just checking in on your neighbors and if you are cooking something cook something extra and give it to your neighbors it's a shame that uh in the work that we do supporting the elderly in some of the communities we found um one of them had died and the body had to be taken away by the police because the the neighbors were not even aware another man had a heart attack and was lying in his urine fortune was found by one of our staff we called the police and he was then transported to the hospital he died a few days later but that's much better than dying lying on his uh urine and feces and and being in you know starving and and feeling thirsty so i would really urge all of you to show some concern and care to the people who are just living next door to you and do an act of kindness by even just saying hello or sharing something that you have if you're going to the market buy something extra and give it to the uncle auntie next door at workplace as well uh i've seen uh you know we okay image are very fierce it's guys it's very strict now we cannot we cannot close each other but it doesn't stop us from delivering cookies uh and giving someone something that you may made at home uh and i think we can all do a little bit more so i think this is the time let's look at the q a um i'm not sure how how because shall i read it to you yeah you may i can wait which one should we answer pick one or two how does any patients who don't want for common appointments and do you want to take medicines um it's a tough one i think really it's about having a relationship with them so they they feel that they are unsafe about coming to us and they are maybe they don't even recognize that they have an illness that needs help really i think we we have many partners uh in the community uh that you let us know who they are and we will reach out to our partners brahms is a partner for example when they will do a home visit try and make friends try and get them to come help us if there's a crisis there's actually a helpline that you can call to imh and basically then we will if it's a crisis we do send help immediately um and um i'm just picking some other questions anxiety from unable getting support and resources easy and fast i.t support oh yeah this is about the work from home and don't we all know it um first of all can i just say that anxiety when things change uh when circumstances change and the way you work and the way you you live your life suddenly has to change is anxiety provoking so first of all i think applying some of the mindfulness uh principles accepted there's nobody there's nothing wrong about feeling anxious because things have changed uh so like just now i'm trying to log on and i couldn't and we i said oh what are we going to do and we just accept that okay this is going to be a bit of a glitch we have some time and slowly we'll fix this so uh be kind to yourself be kind to the situation i think angie and wrote an article a couple weeks ago about not judging and not you know judging or blaming and saying all this work from home is it them you know nuisance and i blame my boss i blame the i.t support um actually i think they're trying their best as well so i think the answer to that question is stay calm i'm sure your boss will understand that you cannot get things done as fast as you normally could uh explain why uh ask for help wait uh for the i.t support to come and get those uh things that you need to get done um prof do you have some tips on how we can establish work from home boundaries stop the earth to check email uh okay sometimes uh i'm a bit guilty of that so i tell you what um you should try really to to silence your phone or or stop checking at a certain time i'm not gonna tell you what time i have to do that i have to stop doing it um but it's a bit of discipline you know and i think the anxiety of course is i might miss something something urgent might happen and i i i won't i won't hear about it um but i think you need to give yourself that break time so i think the boundary is important uh yes my colleagues have told me sometimes working from home it's actually stressful because there's no boundary between work and personal life um set your office hours uh if you're if you're starting later and you end later but there's still an end time if it's six o'clock or seven o'clock that's the time you break off and spend time with your family and log off and maybe you can tell your colleagues that i'm not going to be checking my my emails anything just call the phone so if the phone rings then it's an emergency everything else by message or whatever you're going to check later um i know it's it's easier said than done but i think sometimes we don't even bring this subject up because we are so pricey and shy to be the first one to say that in the office so i think i'm giving you permission to do that and any of my colleagues out there please do that as well tell me i'm not picking your call after a certain time ceo okay angie any any things to mention there well i think this is where we have to set our own boundaries right in terms of self-care so we say eight o'clock is the time then we have to make sure we observe it because it's not like our boss sometimes is the one who insisted yeah indeed um someone wrote about caring for seniors and then serious misconception and i image about i image that person is that that someone goes to image that person is no is lost and no more functioning is like a dead yeah it's very sad um i i'd like to think that you know imh together with many of our partners including brahms and and many of uh ncss uh many i would like to list some of them here but there's so many partners the singapore american community services singapore association of mental health silver ribbon i don't know if you're out there listening uphill uh resilience collective um family service center so many of our partners agency for integrated there are many many partners today they're really trying to change people's perception of mental health and mental well-being and seeking help is not okay i think if you if you don't get help and you don't do anything until it's really late and it's bad of course then if you go to a place and and it's so much harder to get better than the idea really is my three points again recognize that mental health issues can happen to anyone and it can really happen to you or someone you love do a check don't be shy to ask how are they feeling and they're not feeling good try to help they can help themselves you can help them and if they need help bring them to a professional image i mentioned we have recovery we do a lot of work with people who have acute crisis they get well they improve they recover they get back to on their life what they were doing before and you know we support them and even if it takes a long time we we i'd like to think we never give up uh we always work with our patients as long as they continue to stay with us and i think maybe that's the message you can share with people who have concerns about mental health care um so many questions uh how to manage it just got very how to manage it just got very upset and worked easily and bp spiked up to feel busy ah i think this is uh right up ng's path so this is something that happened and we get really worked up and and you get you lose emotional control and you find your whole head is going to burst what do we do well i'll put in the plug i will be running the next mindfulness based stress reduction course starting tuesday so if you'd like to learn how to manage your stress or relieve your stress uh it's important to have the right techniques and skills to do it because we can't just leave it to our own coping skills if we don't even have them right now indeed well done so are you doing this next week or there's the course right that you're helping us that little thing we did at the beginning that mindfulness that relaxation exercise really i wanted to just say you know that practice makes perfect oh don't worry we got time to do one more round of that near the end okay there's so many questions i wish we can answer of them but i really wanted to hear from you um i i just one last question how do you think we can reduce the stigma of seeking mental health for those who do not have severe mental issues i think you can be an ambassador tell them what you heard today that mental health can affect anyone and that then you if you check and you find that there's an issue you the earlier you find and do something about it the better and not everyone has to go and see a professional or psychiatrist we can help each other there's a lot of resources available online and so you know if we all talk about mental health in a very positive way that we can improve and help each other it doesn't have that stigma of oh people who have mental illness must be really you know in a bad state and nobody can help them that kind of thing is the talk that that brings about the stigma okay okay maybe i really wanted to do this you know i really want all of you as many as you can in the q a section please share with me and share with each other the things that have kept you going during this difficult covet months uh so that other people can learn from you i've been i've been talking to you and i'd like to hear from you what have you been doing uh just type in uh under the question right and q and a right yeah well ching can you turn on the chat so that people can use the chat it might be easier okay we'll turn on the chat function uh ng uh unfortunately the meeting have to restart if we turn on the check no worries okay all right yeah coming in uh cherishing family time i'm going to read them up uh family time really yeah signing up for webinars okay i think it stopped raining though i think you need to go out for some fresh air we'll keep swallowing them yeah exercise every day at 6 00 pm 20 minutes to one hour well done john i think um you know i think i don't know i mean a lot of people say they do but when you actually ask them do you actually exercise or not then they'll say oh yeah already once a week or maybe once or twice uh so i think really the discipline of doing it every day really helpful well done john baking is such a common thing that we've got a crisis in singapore over flower now right now enough i'll tell you a funny story one of my patients tried baking and it was very stressful for her because she couldn't get the flash she lined up then later on she made the thing and the family didn't like it so fast but you know what there was a happy story to that see i'm not gonna do baking it's horrible and she ended up doing uh um knitting instead and she said that one no one was competing with her she could get the wool and she could do it and everyone was appreciative taking masks i've seen many people have been making masks and i think that's one thing to use uh well you can fry noodles and uh make way spirituality meditation uh uh and i guess you're plugging the mindfulness concept pet therapy works wonders yes indeed uh if you don't have a pet you can see other people's pets on youtube or adopt a pet from spca thank you for reminding us to be positive there's many many things to be thankful and grateful for sometimes we don't look at it and it's just looking at all the negatives that we have spirituality and religion thank you for sharing that um art spending time with your parents that's nice for sharing desiree yeah exercise go for work in nature captain choi i think i know who you are i think he's just regular jogging yes i know um and uh it's for and for someone for any age can do running as well or jogging yeah uh hi nice to see you in this chat i know some of you uh mindfulness from manhattan uh tip that helps me from frank do periodic checks on how well i and my loved ones are satisfying our basic needs yeah so that periodic check is really what i was talking about isn't it because sometimes we just assume that everyone is fine uh and we don't ask and um just ask how are you doing uh and you're not listen listen carefully and let people express how they're feeling uh so a check that's very helpful for my family cooking for my parents i told you a funny story because i went to the hawker center and i i asked the guy that usually buys food from and he said this is no good huh and uh i said oh why but uh you know people can tap out right he said no but people nowadays they learn to cook themselves you know so i think that cooks my business you want me in trouble i won't say it's a funny story because on the one hand yes people have learned to become better cooks worry about the livelihoods because things are going to change so this is where again uh if he needs help uh you know he may need to have some help uh coming his way zoom breakfast well done i hope you guys are all looking at the q and a and check and scrolling that up and down as well like i am yeah i would say sign up for courses like i don't have much time because i sign up for courses offered by oxford and brown university and so on now you can attend courses from all over the world people have become more uh savvy online yeah indeed are you looking at are you scrolling down uh ng it's really i mean i hope we can collect all this and maybe we can put all this up on uh the brahm website uh so that people can remember all these other things that have contributed by all you people who have really uh uh are doing well and are sharing what you do looking up at the sky and reflecting i like that one really yeah and i think to the parents out there please learn how to play some video games so that you can actually play with your kids instead of complaining about your kids playing video games engagements yeah why not uh looking at flowers singing songs even though it's out of tune i love that one really yeah why not yeah dancing dancing uh gloria says show gratitude uh i that's another one like looking for positive things that we really really don't do enough uh i'm guilty also uh and really you need to do that much more uh yoga mindfulness painting and art and craft work so many people talk about being mindful looking for a day of fulfillment yeah someone's talked about coffee listen a reading someone talked about reading and listening to audiobooks actually uh um it is actually many people who have told me and my patients too actually they spend time reading and it's been a very good comfort to many of them yeah uh gardening photography yeah the funny cat video definitely funny cat is a uh it's cute cat videos it just just breaks you up for a short moment and it's really fun someone suggested storytelling tell your story um and uh and uh how you've been doing and ask them to tell their story too indeed uh fantastic i think you guys should just scroll down uh i cannot we will never end with this uh but it's wonderful i think um thank you all very much for for coming and listening and spending this time with us and me and angie we really appreciate this uh keep looking down and uh and looking up the list of the various things you've mentioned all wonderful thank you all very much angie uh how shall we end this you want to just do a quick censoring ourselves in fact look at the list gets you back and sometimes you know i think we should come i was excited sure i'll be glad to uh let's do a three-step breathing space which is uh taught by oxford mindfulness center as part of the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course and uh this might be very helpful in terms of centering ourselves and just kind of regain that little extra calmness uh for our mind to have more space uh in order to see things in more in clearer form as well to make better decisions so um three-step breathing space starts with being aware of our body which is slightly similar to what i brought you through earlier on and then centering on the breath and then back to just um being aware of the entire body again so those of you who may be signing off thank you for joining i'd like to acknowledge turbo1 for sponsoring this talk in particular mr alberto and those of you who are staying please join me in this mindfulness practice of three-step breathing space so find yourself in a comfort position nice posture supporting your lower back closing your eyes and let's start with three deep breaths and just be aware of how you feel in this moment right now if there's any presence of emotions feelings and what's the weather like up in the mind and noticing body sensations that may be present so we do all this without any judgments it's just be aware and if there are sounds that you can hear take note of what the sounds are it could be dropping of the rain doors opening closing and just to take note without any judgments now let's become more aware of our body starting with our feet knowing where they are and just feeling into your toes other feet happy where they are if not adjust the position move them flex them and then noticing your bum in the chair adjust your upper body if you feel that one side of the bum is carrying more weight than the other side and just slide up your back into your shoulders and your shoulders tense so relax and move your shoulders gently slightly release any tension that may be present notice where your hands are and move your hands to a position that your hands are going to be happier and are your fingers open and relaxed and sensing into your abdomen your chest and be aware of your facial expression any muscles that are tight the cheeks or the jaws the forehead so this is the first step of the awareness whatever is in the present moment and the second step is focusing on the breath wherever you feel it the most just observe this beautiful breath going through your body keeping this body alive and feeling a sense of gratitude for the presence of the breath without this breath nothing in life matters so feeling a sense of gratitude that this breath is still here every moment giving us time time that we can use to be useful to value add and to serve others now step three expanding our awareness back into our body noticing our feet again and the length of our legs our torso our head and from our right hand spanning across our shoulders to the left hand and really sensing into the entire body that we live in a sense of gratitude for everything that's working in this body even if it's not perfect it's good enough and now just sensing three more beautiful breaths and opening your eyes with a new sense of gratitude for this body and the breath so i hope that helps to relax you a little bit more thank you right so with that uh like to thank professor cho hong chun for giving his time and sharing his uh experience and knowledge and in this guidance uh to how we can maintain better mental health and not to take our mental health for granted and we can certainly help each other maintain good mental health by uh being cheerful being kind of being grateful and not indulged in being angry and volcanic in nature because that actually causes a lot of stress to other people so tomorrow we will be having a mindful parenting webinar at uh four o'clock so please do join us if you

89,wuCUkm9kFbQ,Our Grandfather Story,Caring For People with Mental Health Conditions | Can Ask Meh?,2019-10-28T11:00:12Z,"Have you ever thought about walking away? Can they survive without you? Can you snap out of it? These are some of the questions that people with mental health conditions and their caregivers answer on this episode of Can Ask Meh? Season 3. 

The 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health found that 1 in 7 persons in Singapore has experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime. Despite this high prevalence, stigma and misconceptions remain. The Study on Public Attitudes towards Persons with Mental Health Conditions in Singapore conducted by the National Council of Social Service found that more than 5 in 10 respondents were not willing to live with, live nearby, or work with a person with a mental health condition.

For business enquiries: limkopi@ourgrandfatherstory.com","I'm a wife and also caregiver to my husband Daren who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I found out when he was in his early thirties and we all know what they say right? About artists, you know, having their mood swings and stuff like that. But yeah it wasn't a shock. It was more of a gradual awakening. I was a caregiver to my sister-in-law, Faith who has bipolar disorder. When I first started dating her sister her sister briefly informed me of her condition. So over the course (of our relationship), Faith herself told me more about what bipolar disorder was. It's not something you tell someone and immediately they have a good grasp on. I just saw someone who was obviously feeling very down. It was quite obvious from the outside. I'm a caregiver to my brother who has schizophrenia. Initially when he started to paint and draw everybody was very happy and excited for his talents. But he started to talk to himself. So at first they thought some spirit went into his body until one fine day there was a group of mediums that came to our house and started him on this spiritual cleansing and the temple owner told my parents that he actually needed to see a doctor. I was quite frightened then because he was about 13 and I was only 12. He felt so much pain which I couldn't fathom. I would be hearing him knocking his head against the wall as if he was screaming for help. So those were symptoms or points that we took note of and that we had to make that decision to get help. Well, they are my family now so it's part of the deal. Her primary caregiver would be her mother. She's got a huge well of emotional strength you know, to be there day in day out, providing support, is not easy. (Faith) has what we call, rapid-cycling bipolar. So that means her mood switches at the frequency of a couple of weeks or even every week. So you can imagine that's very disruptive. She's highly intelligent, much smarter than I am you see. So it's like God has given you a pair of wings but at the same time you're shackled to the ground and you can't fly you see, so I thought that was such a, such a cruel irony. Why did I want to continue caring for him? Because he's my brother! [Laughs] Right? In my family, I think I'm the only one who's close to him we grew up together and I think I'll still be able to care for him. The word ""caregiver"", I have a little bit of uneasiness about because I really feel that as a partnership in a marriage or a family we are each caregivers to each other. You naturally step up step up to hold the helm. I wear the pants and he wears the apron. So my stepping up would be how we can then work around to survive. Of course, who doesn't, right? I mean when the pressure gets so, so, so deep, right? I mean such thoughts like, ""Hey, I'm not your therapist"", you know? So those hard moments can be very draining and I have walked away. But somehow I came back and we tried to work things out. I never thought of walking away.  Kah Lim, to me, just has some character problems. He can be very caring and he can be very nasty too. Sometimes he tries to irritate me by saying something bad. Yeah, but I think that's fine. I am assigned with this responsibility. I have to carry on. As long as I'm around I think I still can take care of everybody. Basically, because I think she sees me as a brother so if I were to leave that would be like your brother leaving the family. I mean when she was having a really bad episode it was hard, I mean, even for me to see that there was any light at the end of the tunnel. All of us have external triggers, right? Things that happen to us and we feel angry or sad or happy. So for a person like Faith who has bipolar disorder at least for her I've seen that external triggers have triggered an amplified emotional response. We had a family vacation in Japan and the kids were in the car and you know how kids are like, right? There's very little peace and quiet, very little sleep it was cold and we didn't eat on time. Basically, I think this was primarily my fault I assembled the perfect storm for her. There was certainly a fallout. You just do what you can do or you can try to get better at what you do. I mean, how much time does it take to ask someone how he or she is doing, right? What made me turn back? Okay, the fact that I care? I just had this conversation with him two days ago. I think I said, ""You know what? Love. To say 'I love you', 'I really love you' It doesn't justify (my feelings enough) because 'care' it encompasses all those feelings, 'I care'."" I mean surely, if you have seen the best of someone you you just can't walk away. Definitely, he can. He can make friends with many people. Financially, if he can continue painting beautiful paintings I believe he can continue to support himself. I have reserved some of his paintings for his retirement, future retirement use. Career-wise, she's a peer support specialist. She wants specifically to help people  who are suffering from mental health conditions. She's actually studied, prepared for, and applied for a medical degree and that to me is pretty amazing. I've seen some of her notes. It makes no sense to me you know? So that's an example of her of her intellect, and why I have such a great respect for her brain. For sure. He can survive. I guess as we grow older you are just going to take it one day at a time. So when Daren talks about suicide if it were really to happen it's a preparation on my part to believe that I have as a caregiver, I've done my best and that, I cannot control the situation. So if it does happen that I am not responsible for it. Oh gosh. Iyta: I don't think I can remember.
Daren: Okay, I know this one. I: You know?
D: I know this one. Faith: Okay. Hi. Producer: Hello Kah Lim! Hello, I'm fine. Producer: What do you do in IMH (Institute of Mental Health)? I do a lot of artwork, but these few weeks I haven't done any because I rested for a while, for one week and went back home to paint. Sometimes I can paint a lot, sometimes a little bit. There's an arrangement for him to reintegrate back into society. He'll be home for three weeks and back to IMH for one week. Luckily, he has some work to do there. So, so not too bad. My art is from my inspiration. I drew one dragon and one phoenix on the old IMH building, like a marriage between both. He's also very capable. They allowed him to draw on the whole compound. I was already seeing a doctor there. So basically it was a voluntary admission. 15 years ago. Generally, I think that Singaporeans think that it's like [In Mandarin] Woodbridge Hospital I mean now that I'm working there sometimes when we get a taxi in or Grab in the taxi driver will ask me  ""Oh, are you working there?"" ""Is it scary inside?"" That kind of thing. I don't know, like people just think that we shouldn't get help there. Even a lot of people go to private care because of that as well. But that's where the best doctors are. The last (time I was in IMH) was towards the end of 2010 at Sayang Wellness. I knew I was going to self-destruct. That's why I had to make that conscious decision (to enter IMH). At least if you don't heal completely you'd (still) have some peace. Cannot. Cannot snap out of it, anyhow. Can you? KL: Cannot.
C: Ah, cannot. He knows. You might be in that state of manic depression for a month. You know so the last thing anybody needs is judgment. ""Eh, come on man, you've got a good life. You're so rich, you've got money. Why are you (like this)?"" The moment you lose your mind it doesn't matter whether you're a billionaire it doesn't matter if you have everything in the world you lose everything. It is a medical condition. If you can snap out of cancer if you can snap out of your diabetes I can probably do that too. But it's not something like that. Like what Adrian said, it is like an amplifier. I think there was one time I needed to go to work and I by the time I got on the train I started like regretting because the panic attack symptoms were coming I can't breathe. You have people like right in your face, that kind of thing. It can be challenging for the best of us. Yeah, so I just got out. I just sat there and cried for about 45 minutes. Nobody came over to ask me what was going on or offered me anything. I just sat on the floor, crying. The thing about MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) or any public spaces, right? If you cry right, most of the time you'd definitely I never actually got any help but if I started vomiting, people would help me. So if there's a physical symptom I get more help. I just need to wait for it to like, go back to normal. You just have to let it run its course. I mean there's a category of people to whom you can't say ""Snap out of it, you've got a weak will."" It's not the case in this example. Sadly, some give up the fight. You cannot blame them you know, you cannot judge them even for suicide because everybody has a threshold. So I consider myself like a veteran of the mind-field. A survivor. If I make it through today that's a small victory for me. So how do I maintain my mental health? I think about the days' events as if I'm a person observing myself and if I need to change, I will change. If I need to apologise, I'll apologise. I have no regrets because every day I will say the things that I need to say. With the medication, their condition can be controlled. He used to hear voices saying that he's not capable in certain things. (Saying) he's lousy he's bad, but he told me recently that when he stayed with me there were no such voices talking to him. Well, I think he's recovering, that's about all. Yeah. My sister has a lot of power. Her brain is very clever. She's freaking number one. Oh, he said I'm I'm powerful! Consistently for many, many years, I've felt like a burden. I'm not earning a salary. I'm not able to do household chores very well because I'm always very unwell. In some sense, I feel that they can be better without me. The thing about feeling like a burden is it's also a driving force as well. Because I've always thought since back then I said that one day I'm going to pay it all back to them. I don't know whether that will happen but She bought me ice cream. I love ice cream. So I think it's a driving motivation that I will be a productive member of the family. I never thought that I would be an overseas scholar. I never thought that I would come to a point where I could be so secure. I have had people who you know, who told me that they were in denial of their condition. After knowing me they decided that ""Okay, I can accept my diagnosis. I can be like Faith."" They said, ""I want to be like Faith"" and I'm glad to be that someone. I wish he's more normal, but I think with his kind of weird character, that's why he can paint. He said he wants to get the [in Mandarin] Nobel Prize. Whoa. [Laughs] He's quite fine, just a bit weird and he's talkative. Cannot speak like a chicken's backside (always open). [Laughs] He said he cannot speak like a chicken's backside. [Laughs] My friend taught me, he said There's this four-letter word that gets me through which is hope. This condition makes you feel like you're alone. But actually I had my moments where I reflected and I realised you know what, I was never alone. I had my two boys and my wife fighting alongside me. We self-published a book called ""The Boy Who Hated The Sun"". There's a synopsis inside it in which I clearly mentioned that I have bipolar (disorder). And the reason I did that was because I wanted people who bought the book to know that this was written by somebody with bipolar (disorder) So don't, like I said earlier on, don't let the label define you. You're more than that. (I hope that society will) protect me, change my behaviour to be a new kid in a new world. Harmony Majulah Singapura (Onward Singapore) People with mental illness we only need to be patient with them and speak to them slowly and we should try to understand them. I think everybody can heal if they are given a more caring and loving environment. We didn't have anything back then. We had nothing back then. And now, we have almost everything! If you want to have job rehabilitation, you have somewhere to go. Psychologists are easily accessible. I think the only thing that I hope  to see is you know, (less of) the discrimination against people with mental health conditions when it comes to looking for jobs. A lot of people are scared to look for jobs not because the job is scary but because there is a line that you have to declare (in forms). It's like a Catch-22. Like if I write down (my condition) they will reject me for the interview. If I don't write down (my condition) and I get the job and if I get caught, I would be caught for lying. Humanity has too much mindlessness and too little mindfulness. Perceptions have to change. It will take you a while to reach that point where you can say ""You know what? Damn, I embrace it all. I embrace my imperfections. So what? I don't care what people think of me."" I do. I love my sister because she’s my only meimei (affectionate term - sister) Nobody can take care of me if she can take care of me. Producer: Have you ever told her that you love her? Never said it before. Producer: Why, are you shy? No, I cannot say that. [Laughs] Yeah, he's shy. So many guys here. [Inaudible] She took care of the whole family whole Singapore people. No, what ""whole of Singapore"" no no no. They all admire all admire my sister. His way of showing love is different. He likes to go out and buy food and certainly he will buy food that he likes so in case I don't want to eat it, he can eat it. [Laughs] KL: Where got?
C: He's very clever, right? He's very clever, right? [Laughs] I think, in some sense my family always has this very conservative kind of view like they don't talk that much. My sister never really asked ""How are you"". Adrian has always asked ""How're you doing?"" ""How's your new job?"" ""How's everything?"" and I think I love him for that because I appreciate conversations and he became like someone who actually started all this conversation. I mean, they're us. They just have an additional card dealt to them. In the face of those challenges, she has come out on top. I mean my challenges pale in comparison to what she has faced so I am proud to be associated with her, you know. Associated. This is my sister-in-law, the genius. Hey, I'm the brother-in-law. [Laughs] She's my Dark Phoenix. [Laughs] No. She's my Jean Grey. I wouldn't say she's just a caregiver. She's more, beyond that. Beyond even being a wife. You know? I think most importantly she's been my my friend. You know, for all these years.  That's all you need, right? I appreciate Not the big things that you do but all the little things that you do. You care for me. She does. I can be a b**** too. [Laughs] I mean that goes without saying. [Laughs] But you know what? I am the luckiest guy. ",False,True,False,False

was looking at me because i was the newbie   they didn't allow me to walk in they had to push 
me in on a wheelchair yeah so they pushed me   in and because i was on suicide watch i couldn't 
even go to the toilet by myself when i went to pee   the nurse had to stay outside with the door 
slightly ajar it was very awkward and do   you know that even the toilets they don't have 
mirrors because they're afraid that people might   Nicole:break it 
Belle: break it and cut themselves and if there is it's actually made out of metal yeah and   you have to keep all your belongings even your 
skin care soap you have to keep it with them and   you have to request for it every time you want 
to shower they're very very strict about them   Nicole: in her words it's a sub-series from something 
private featuring lesser-known stories of women   who've survived unspeakable pains and triumphed 
women who succeed despite and against all odds   this is their story so october 10th is world 
mental health day and it's really important to   us at something private we've done a couple of 
episodes previously on mental health awareness   one with a lovely psychiatrist named dr kamini at 
the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic this year   and dr kamini wisely told us that self-care is 
really important and it is whatever you define   it to be today we speak with a young woman 
named belle who shares her experience living   in a psychiatric ward for two weeks the kicker she 
voluntarily admitted herself in hopes of getting   better something belle said that really resonated 
with me in this particular episode is that you   don't have to wait until your mental health 
deteriorates before you seek help it's good to   have good mental health all the time and i think 
i'm i feel very guilty of this because i often   overwork myself and i harbor a lot of guilt around 
seeking help because you know i think i'm this   strong independent thing who can handle everything 
on her own but i think listening to belle's story   was a really good reminder for me and i hope that 
when you guys listen to this episode that it will   be a good reminder for you as well here's belle's story Belle: hi everyone i'm belle i'm 24 this year so i just came back from australia not too long 
ago i studied there for four years so i was   studying occupational therapy and i'm currently 
working in a hospital as an occupational therapist   or an ot so i think everyone might be wondering 
what an ot does so an ot usually helps people with   an injury and illness or those who have a 
disability to become independent in their   daily activities again so be it by using equipment 
by adapting their activity or their environment   Nicole: okay so like i mentioned just now we are doing 
this episode in awareness of mental health world mental   health day which is in 10 days and you have a 
very unique experience that you'll be sharing   on the podcast so um i think maybe what 
you can do is to first tell me like   um like to briefly sum up like uh what was 
the experience that you went through Belle: so after struggling with anxiety and depression for a while 
as a new grad occupational therapist i was um   admitted to a hospital to stay in a psychiatric 
work for two weeks just to be safe so yeah just   like anybody who started off their new job 
i was very nervous i had difficulty sleeping   but everyone told me it'll go away 
because you know it's normal to feel anxious   about being in a new environment meeting new 
people and especially for a foreign grad it would   normally be a culture shock at first so i thought 
it would go away but it didn't instead the symptoms   just became worse so other than just having 
difficulty sleeping i was also quite breathless   i started to have gastric issues as well gastric 
cramps i felt very nauseous in the morning and   afterwards i started to even have panic 
attacks so it could be no reason at all i'd   just be lying in bed and then i was feeling very 
uncontrollably fearful and just felt i was gonna   die can't breathe trembling shaking perspiring 
crying so yeah just became worse after that   Nicole: and how how do you i mean like when these these 
symptoms like manifested like what was like your   response to it like did you just like oh this 
is normal i mean there must have been some point   where you were like i i don't think this is 
okay like i'm not in a good state like i need   like did you seek help from like your immediate 
like family members or like people around you   yeah so initially i thought that anxiety was 
normal so feeling breathless or you know just   feeling fearful about the day in general but i 
think i started to realize that it was becoming   more and more unhealthy when i started to become a 
lot more depressed so i was a lot more withdrawn   i didn't want to see my friends anymore i didn't 
want to do the things i like to do anymore   yeah and so i started to rely on more 
of i guess my immediate family because i   didn't want to go out so then my sister and i 
started to rely a lot on my boyfriend as well   so he had to come over every day after work just 
to make sure i feel more comforted after a long   day at work i was very avoidant about work 
at first so the moment i stepped out of the   hospital and i went back home i wouldn't want 
to talk about work at all i just wanted their   company to maybe have dinner to watch tv but that 
meant that i wasn't facing the problems at all   so i just wanted to come home see my boyfriend 
sitting there waiting for me he didn't even have   to say anything yeah but I gradually realised that 
it was quite unhealthy after a while because then   it was that over reliance on him as well he 
has to be there otherwise i'll feel very very   anxious and very very depressed um and later on i 
think that this the doctor described it to be like   sort of an enmeshed relationship 
which is sort of like a co-dependence where   um we can't i guess the most the easiest way to 
say it would be like we can't live without each   other we don't we cannot give each other the 
space and time apart um i really need him to   be here and he feels like he needs to be 
here as well otherwise he'll feel guilty   because if he leaves if he goes home if he 
meets his friends then i'll be crying and feeling suicidal Nicole: i'm interested to know because 
like it seems as if like it started out as uh like symptoms of anxiety depression but like 
it seems as if like along the way it started   to fester and then into something yeah it 
took a wrong turn yeah yeah yeah i mean   you you acknowledge that like um 
there is a situation where you   didn't want to face a problem right so i mean i'm 
assuming that would have contributed to i guess like a decline Belle: yeah i guess you're right um for 
me i'm not really sure when it took a wrong turn   i think it was just very overwhelming the whole 
thing um and it started doing circuit breaker   as well and with circuit breaker comes with a 
lot of changes not being able to go out at all   and then i even had him live with me for a while 
during that whole period so then i became very   very reliant yeah and because i was feeling more 
and more unwell i took a lot of mc's as well   so then it felt like i should be 
at home and i shouldn't go to work   so that's how i started to max out my mcs and 
my leaves yeah and it became very unhealthy   because then the only thing i can think 
of is just spending time with him and not   thinking about work at all so just escaping 
the problem altogether even the thought of   him going home for dinner wasn't an option the 
moment he stepped out the door i'll be crying   i'd be texting him non-stop i'll be calling him 
crying on the phone saying you know i feel like   dying i feel very depressed i can't function 
without you can you can you please come back   Nicole: and i'm guessing that took quite a 
bit of a that put an emotional like toll yeah on him  Belle: definitely it's very very 
draining um i started to see how it impacted   him negatively as well so you know i break down 
so often but then to see him break down and   be a lot more teary emotional crying as well 
um then i realized that you know i really   need to do something because otherwise we'll 
just i'll just be dragging him down as well   Nicole: was there like like did he have that 
conversation with you or like how did it pan out Belle: because i was feeling very very suicidal 
and i can get quite specific in detail as   to what i want to do so i think that's quite 
can be very scary for the person listening   it's very overwhelming for the person as well yeah i think my sister overheard our 
conversation and she said she said you   really need to stop look what you're doing 
to him so then i really reflected on it   Nicole: and from that like what was the what's the 
takeaway so with that i think we knew that   i needed to speak to someone who's more trained i 
think the easiest way to go about it would be just   to contact a family service center point of time 
i was very fearful and very very tired of speaking   to people and explaining so again i was very 
lucky that my sister and my boyfriend were both   very supportive and they were the ones that did 
their googling and they were the ones that called   the fsc and my boyfriend was the one that had to 
describe the whole situation to the person with me   just sitting next to him yeah because i i was very 
fearful i didn't want to share at all so i went to   speak to the counselor at the fsc and because he 
was a circuit breaker it was more of a phone call   and she taught me techniques like deep 
breathing or like trying to distance yourself   from your thoughts but it didn't change 
the fact that i was still having a lot of   panic attacks yeah so i felt then it was 
a lot more biological physiological than   than just my thoughts yeah and i think she noticed 
that as well because i told her like i really   can't you know think straight when i'm in that 
state like i'm just so overwhelmed that i can't   start doing my deep breathing and counting 
you know just like rolling the floor crying   so she then recommended me to uh see a doctor get 
a referral to see a psychiatrist and that's what i   did they managed to push the appointment forward i 
think by month because it was getting quite urgent   i was really getting worse so they called them 
up and then i went to see the psychiatrist there   and um i was crying while i was talking to 
her yeah so i think that shows that i was   really really distressed yeah and she asked me 
then if i wanted to be admitted but i said no   because she said if you admitted then you have 
no phones and we are not sure if your family   can visit or your boyfriend can visit because 
it's covid so i said no i don't want and at   that appointment she diagnosed me with anxiety 
and depression and she gave me some medications   and then she advised my counselor and my family 
members to just watch out and if i were to   have any uh worsening symptoms or if i became very 
suicidal then to bring me to the A&E  Nicole: is it like normal for them to like immediately prescribe like 
a stay in the hospital once you're diagnosed with   Belle: i don't think it's all the time 
that you'll do that i think it's   when they ask you do you have any thoughts 
of killing yourself um do you have a plan   then that's when they decide that you know maybe 
hospital admission is a safer option because then   you're in a safe space you don't have access to 
any forms of killing yourself whatsoever so that's   when they will offer it to you and i think my 
behavior then was already quite evident that i was   very very depressed and i think for her to 
diagnose me it has to take a while and it has been   my symptoms have been there for a long time that's 
how she diagnosed me and that's why she offered   hospital admission because she thought then i 
would get a lot more aggressive treatment i'll   get psychologists and ots to see me there more 
regularly yes compared to if i were to be waiting   um outpatient which might take like months Nicole: okay so you mentioned that you didn't you didn't   decide that you wanted to you want to stay yeah 
it wasn't an immediate thing so but i knew that   it was option and option then okay so yeah what 
what led up to the actual stay or like a rather   like what happened after that after that you 
went home so i went home i took my medications   every day but i was still very anxious yeah 
i think there's a limit to how effective the   medications can be especially towards because if 
i took it every night then towards the evening   evening then the symptoms will come back and 
when you first take the medications actually   there are a lot of side effects as well so 
the first few days of taking my medications   um i was very very dizzy and i was very drowsy 
i couldn't even get out of bed and did you know that   actually sometimes taking antidepressants 
can make you feel more depressed first before   feeling better i didn't know that i didn't 
know yeah so until i experienced it for   myself and my friend who works in the mental 
health industry she told me that yeah as well   so i was actually a lot more depressed 
afterwards and that was when i really didn't   want to get out of bed i needed my boyfriend 
to physically pull me up to get some breakfast   yeah because i had no appetite yeah so 
after that i tried to go back to work but um the symptoms were still there and i think 
another major change was that because at first   initially my boyfriend was still looking for 
a job so he was there most of the time but uh   then he had to move out to start his new job 
so that was a yeah so that was another major   change for me to adapt to which is that your 
boyfriend yeah he had to move out yet to leave   and you know i was still so overly reliant 
on him so that was a very very big change   for me that i couldn't handle yeah i went to 
work the very first day of his his first day   of work and then i broke down so even walking 
towards the hospital i was already crying   and then i walked straight into 
the toilet and i stayed there for   an hour even after work started yeah so i i texted 
my colleague and i think she told my supervisor so   she had to physically go to the toilet and 
get me out and i was still crying non-stop   so my when my supervisor came to find me and she 
got me out of the toilet and she sat me down and   tried to comfort me i didn't stop crying because 
i was still feeling yeah i was i was still crying   because i didn't feel better crying didn't make 
me feel better so as i was crying she asked me   so was i feeling very suicidal and i thought 
i was and that's when i think she said that she   didn't feel safe for me to go home myself i had to 
call my sister to come down pick me up to go home   yeah and the next day i was still very 
depressed didn't want to get out of the bed and then i think because i 
maxed out my mc's and my leaves my workplace supervisor told my sister to 
bring me to A&E so that's how i ended up in A&E and the doctors there and asked me if i 
wanted hospital admission again and i said yes   i was very fearful at the clinic they got 
the psychiatrist to come down to see me   and she then offered me again the option 
of staying inside in a psychiatric ward i only said yes because they said that 
they will allow my sister to sleep over   and when i went in i was very fearful 
because you know i watch a lot of   movies and then they paint a very bad 
picture of how psychiatric words are   um like people banging their heads on the 
wall or screaming but it wasn't like that   but you could tell that that look that people give 
you when you when you tell them you're in ward 33   because that was the one i was in um was it in it 
was in NUH yeah so i live in the east everyone   was asking me why i went all the way 
to NUH for my treatment but i think my   boyfriend my sister did some googling and they 
had a lot of good reviews from NUH so i went there   so when i went in i was very fearful everyone 
was looking at me because i was the newbie   they didn't allow me to walk in they 
had to push me in on a wheelchair   so they pushed me in and because i was on suicide 
watch i couldn't even go to the toilet by myself   when i went to pee the nurse had to stay outside 
with the door slightly ajar it was very awkward   interesting yeah um it's quite annoying but 
yeah i understood why they had to do that   and being in a ward means following their rules so 
apart from not having access to my phone um even   having your family members like pass you their 
phone for video calls or what it's not allowed   and you're not allowed to leave the ward as well 
so because i think also because of the Covid situation you don't allow patients to go out yeah 
um and of course the usual rules like lights out by   9 30. so you can only use the ward phones 
from nine to nine yeah and then because um my boyfriend was only available after nine 
even that i couldn't speak to him at all   yeah i could only speak to him if he had 
very very short break times during the day for me i think the main thing was being in patient   pajamas it was a very new experience because 
you know i've been a healthcare professional   i've been working with patients but i think being 
a patient myself was a very different experience   i think wearing the uniform the pajamas everyday 
constantly reminded me that i was there for   treatment and the fact that the nurses were so 
strict with the phone rule so i they constantly   came in and like kind of like reprimanded me for 
using my family's phone to video call my boyfriend   i was very very irritated and then after staying 
there for a while i also felt like sort of like a   cabin fever like you know i come and leave i can't 
even go down for a meal to get some fresh air and   do you know that even the toilets they don't have 
mirrors because they're afraid that people might   break it break it and cut themselves and if 
there is it's actually made out of metal yeah and   you have to keep all your belongings even your 
skin care soap you have to keep it with them and   you have to request for it every time you want 
to shower they're very very strict about it yeah and there's no soap 
Nicole: so if the circumstances 
i mean it's not actually they didn't tell you from   the start that like like they laid out the terms 
from the stuff for you right and they don't seem   like entirely like favorable in that exactly you 
say it's like camping fever right like industrious   if you are trapped in that space
Belle: it does but i guess um it was a good it was a good thing   that i admitted myself um it can be a very safe 
respite for you so having that space away from   everyone not having to go to work sometimes 
going home can be a source of stress for you   so actually i think that the hospital walk 
can also be a really safe space for you away   from all your stresses yeah so having 
the help of the multi-disciplinary team   within the ward is very helpful like the nurses 
the doctors and the therapists the psychologists   so always having easy access to 
them is a very very good thing   rather than waiting for months outside 
Nicole: so i guess like you kind of traded like a bit of freedom for   access to like healthcare 
Belle: yeah i mean at first it 
felt like i was surrendering my autonomy to them   which was true yeah but if you really focus 
on getting better that's why i said you know   the whole idea of even wearing the patient 
pajamas reminded me why i was there my purpose   which was to get better so then i felt a lot 
more motivated to participate in the treatments so as the psychiatrist the doctors they were 
trying to figure out what was the cause of my   behaviors and my symptoms the psychologist was 
also working with me to kind of challenge my   negative thoughts people don't really understand 
what happens in there and that's why i want to be   here to share where when you're in there you 
are supposed to be safe seeking treatment so i said that i didn't want any medications to make 
me so drowsy that i can't even think straight   yeah and i didn't want to be tied down and 
i told them that right at start and they   can only do that when you start being very 
aggressive to the staff and other patients   because that's to keep them safe as well yeah 
but otherwise they wouldn't do that to you   and you mentioned just now that like 
i didn't know that i assumed that   where you would have been admitted to 
is like IMH Belle: yeah i think a lot of   people think that only IMH would be able 
to help mental health patients but there are   other hospitals that also offer a psychiatric 
ward like the one i went is a lot smaller   but um they also have a team of doctors who are 
specialized in psychiatry and i think the other   hospital would be CGH i'm not so sure about the others
Belle: so two weeks does seem a bit like a   short time what were some of like the 
biggest challenges and takeaways for you   yeah i guess the idea that i'm stuck there 
became very apparent after a week there   because i guess you're stuck in the same 
space doing the same things over and over that's when i felt like it was safe 
because i couldn't kill myself so i could only become stronger like when my friend asked me about 
how my experience was in there   i said that it was so difficult and i really 
wanted to kill myself but because i couldn't   i could only become more resilient and also 
realizing who will be there for you i think   knowing i really kind of realized who are my 
stronger forms of support when i was in there   my sister acted like my pa because i 
couldn't have my phone she was the one   organizing who would be visiting me because of 
their strict visiting policy so only two people   can be in the ward at a time and the whole 
day you can only have up to five visitors   and before they took away my phone i sneakily 
texted all my closest friends and i said hey i'm   here like come and some of them didn't even know 
that i had this diagnosis so they're very shocked   and they later on my sister had to explain to them 
Nicole: it sounds a bit as if like they were helping you   it's not only like to get better but to have like 
measured steps towards like getting well    Belle: yes so only when i was admitted to the hospital what then 
they kind of revised my diagnosis to adjustment   adjustment disorder and that's actually just so 
from anxiety and depression they kind of like   made it more specific to adjustment disorder and 
i haven't heard of that before and i think it's   just like uh it's supposed to only last for about 
six months usually after a major change in your   life like there's this very abnormal excessive 
response to it and it can come in a form of   symptoms that are like anxiety depression yeah 
so that's what i understand of adjustment disorder   yeah and they kind of use the addiction model 
to describe my behavior it was very strange at   first so i told the doctor that i really need his 
physical presence and suddenly he had this like   eureka moment so i said you know i can't it 
doesn't make me feel better when i speak to him on   the phone or when i see him over video call i need 
him to be here i just need his physical presence   when he talks to me i don't feel better and he 
was like let's all start using the addiction model   then he started telling all the other doctors they 
was like what is going on it was like oh like it   so happens i'm the addiction specialist and um i'm 
gonna be very blunt it seems that as though you're   addicted to him like he's a substance drug or a 
drink that you can go to when you feel stressed   so when i start feeling very anxious i'll cling 
onto him like a koala so you know then he sort of   becomes more of a physical entity than a person 
i was like oh my gosh that sounds terrible but   now it makes a lot of sense so when he leaves 
i start to have withdrawal symptoms and   then that's why you can see me crying shaking 
all this it really looks as though i'm a drug   addict you know not getting my drug and that's 
why the whole no phone thing started to make a   lot more sense because if you think about seeing 
or like seeing him that's like my family giving   me access to drugs so that's not gonna help 
me yeah so what would help me to get better   is to kind of have a more cold turkey approach 
where i have a lot more stricter boundaries and um yeah boundaries as to when i can speak to him 
and when i can see him yeah i guess because i was   sort of pushing my limits over and over again so 
just before i was admitted i told him like what   can i do before you can see me should i should 
i hurt myself should i attempt to kill myself so   because it was almost his 
first day of working then   he was apart from me so i said that i was very 
desperate i said what can i do before you can come   should i be at the edge of a building 
should i cut myself what should i do   and what did he say yeah and that's when he 
became a lot more emotional and said just   please stop this yeah i think knowing when 
to stop when your limit is is very important   yeah so that's why i admitted myself 
because i wanted to give him that space   yeah so it's not just for myself but i 
feel like it's also for his well-being   and the doctors also recognized that so during 
my stay they also contacted him quite frequently   sharing with him the plan saying hey can you 
stop calling belle so often she needs to get   better because i guess you're not helping me 
there's that co-dependence as well so he feels   like he's quite concerned so he every time he 
has a time or a break he would try to call me   but it's actually not advisable so 
Nicole: okay i mean you mentioned that um   you guys started to in your psychiatric stay 
there like the doctor decided that oh we   applied the addiction model right so like how did 
things turn up after that yeah after you i guess   like this the eureka moment he realized that 
this is what's going on yeah so knowing that   um it has somehow turned into an 
addiction um being in the ward   really helps because cold turkey treatment 
is actually very effective for drug addicts   so i guess um i was very motivated because 
and i was also very desperate so yeah so   at the one week mark i became very very frustrated 
at my own situation because i didn't feel i was   getting better i was still breaking down 
some nights and i called my boyfriend   i called my boyfriend one night and i said like 
i'm already here i'm already subjecting myself to   this like what else do you want me to do so 
that was what happened like halfway through   somehow the days there felt very long so even 
though two weeks might seem like a very short   time but after a while yeah each day 
because it becomes quite repetitive felt quite wrong    Nicole: so how did the rest of the stay 
go about
Belle: i was following the plan religiously so   um when they left i started writing yeah so 
the first few days was very difficult because   as usual i was very very anxious the woman i was 
left alone i was crying and i called my sister   and said get me out of here this is a prison and 
then the nurses tried to calm me down and say girl   this is not a prison i'm like this is worse than a 
prison i have to pay to be treated like a prisoner yeah so they're like oh can i give you 
some medications to calm you down and then   if you want to leave you can because 
this is a voluntary admission   you can speak to the doctors tomorrow i said no 
i want to speak to the on-call doctor because i   work in a hospital i know that they have on-call 
doctors but they're still trying to calm me down   until the next day yeah it was very difficult 
but then i started to see some progress   and when i spoke to my counselor so my counselor 
actually came all the way from the fsc to NUH to   speak to me as well she said you know that 
it's okay to still break down sometimes   you have to be kinder to yourself and see actually 
see the progress that you have been making so then   i realized actually yeah it's true there's some 
progress i started having lesser panic attacks   i didn't feel so breathless anymore um so she 
said you was like taking two steps forward   one step back you're still making progress 
at the end of the day and you have to praise yourself for that and be kinder to 
yourself in that sense yeah so acknowledge   any progress that you're making 
Nicole: so i guess like with that mantra i helped you through the rest of   the remaining days there yeah you i realized after 
that that you really just you only have yourself   to rely on at the end of the day to become more 
resilient you have to be more self-sufficient   so i guess not allowing my family or my friends 
to stay over the night really forced me to become   more independent again so then i realized you 
know i was studying alone in australia and i   didn't have any issues and yeah so the doctors 
actually asked me in their very first interview   so how would you describe yourself then 
i was like what kind of question is that   um then i said before this all started i would 
say that i'm quite independent person because   you know i chose to go to perth because i knew 
that lesser singaporeans were going there for   the occupational therapy course i wanted to be 
away from singapore and really be immersed in a   new culture and do things by myself so i would 
say that i'm actually quite independent person   and my sister also said you know you just 
forgot how you were but we we know how you are   and you know that you can go back to that 
person that we know yeah so then i started   think when i was in australia i also had 
to manage stress on my own so what did i do   then i realized i really like writing typing or 
writing doesn't matter so that was what i started   doing so that day when i broke down and then the 
nurses tried to calm me down with medications and   i was still like like sobbing right i went to 
the content i said can you give me some paper   in my teary state then then the nurses handed 
me like a thick set of paper and i started just   writing non-stop and i wrote until i was tired 
and i realized that that was the only time i was   comfortable with being alone and then i felt like 
hey that's actually a familiar feeling you know   feeling better after writing down all my thoughts 
yeah and that's what i did for the remaining time   i was there yeah i said i guess everyone 
has their own ways of coping with stress   and what i did when i was in australia was that 
i wrote and typed a lot when i was feeling lonely   or feeling stressed and the very night when 
i was left alone after my family left at nine   after sniffing and crying what not then yeah 
i got to the counter and asked for a stack of   paper and i started writing and i kept writing 
until the medications made me feel drowsy and i   started to feel like hey actually writing is the 
only way i can feel comfortable with being alone and it really helped so and writing really 
clears your mind puts you into perspective   so that was what i did for the rest of my stay i 
think the main takeaway from that would be that   then i could set clearer boundaries for myself 
and for for my boyfriend as well because i think   the boundaries became very blur after a while 
especially when he started to move in with me   um that's when i sort of expected that hey 
like since he's really moved moved in like   actually he's my boyfriend he should be able 
to drop everything for me that kind of thing   yeah um yeah you know what that was 
when i realized that you really need to   know what you can and cannot control so i 
really wrote down things that you can control   like your you can be prepared for the week 
to come so you can you know make sure that   whatever you can prepare for you do so like 
you know for my work then make sure that i prepare my clothes and i make sure that i 
try not to use my phone too much before i sleep   um you can prepare for a week that you can 
look forward to so you know insert days where   you're gonna meet your friends for dinner or 
go for a movie things that you look forward to   and acknowledge things that you cannot control 
so i guess the source of my anxiety was because   i felt so out of control all the time i was so 
scared of the things that i cannot be certain   about so i really wrote down things that i cannot 
control which is external circumstances like   covid the culture the environment the 
rules even the medication side effects um   things that you cannot control would be also like   i guess other people's reactions and 
expectations but what you can control   is your own expectations and your own behavior 
so i told myself you know you can be patient   you can be understanding you can be supportive 
and i even wrote down examples because you know   sometimes when you feel so overwhelmed you can't 
even think straight and i also wrote down things   what people can tell me when i'm 
feeling very overwhelmed so i wrote down   and i actually gave it to my boyfriend and 
one day when i was feeling very distressed i   actually handed him the paper and i say can 
you just read this and read it back to me   it felt very awkward at first but i wrote things 
like um please don't offer me solutions like   can you show me some empathy can you name and 
acknowledge my emotions can you say something   like you know i know it has been very difficult 
for you you must be feeling very anxious or angry   because of so and so and then you insert the 
reason to show that you have been paying attention   so i think that really makes the person feel 
hurt and feel like you know their experiences   are valid i actually wrote down what my boyfriend 
should say to me when i'm upset because you know   he struggled to find what to say to me so 
i wrote like can you please not offer me   solutions when i'm upset because more 
often than not i really thought about   it and doesn't work for me or at least 
i'm not willing to accept any form of   suggestions or solutions at that point 
of time i'm just very overwhelmed so like i said can you please 
name and acknowledge my emotions   can you show me empathy can you say things that i 
know it has been very very difficult for you and   i know that i can see that you're feeling very 
anxious because of so and so insert the reason   because the reasons might change every time and 
to show that you're really listening to the person you have to sort of figure out why they 
are feeling the way they do as well   and i also kind of analyzed why 
i was feeling what i was feeling   so you know anxiety is usually because 
you feel like you're not in control   um yeah same for anger yeah so that's 
why i thought that writing down what i   can and cannot control was very helpful 
for me 
Nicole: let's talk a bit about after you   were completed your psychiatric stay and 
then you reintegrate them back into your   life how's the transition like for you and i 
guess like how are you hoping now actually the   medical team suggested at least two weeks so it 
can be up to a month it can be up to three months   usually for addiction you need at least three 
months to get better um but i think by the   end of two weeks i was like i have had enough here 
i'm gonna leave gonna spread my wings and fly away   because i i guess i started to really understand 
the plan and i felt that there wasn't a need for   me to be in the ward anymore i could just do that 
outside with the help of my friends and family   i told myself that two weeks is 
enough so after writing down my plans and how i'm gonna you know prepare for the 
week to come i showed the doctor the list   of all the things that i wrote for myself 
and then i said i want to go home today   yeah and he said yes okay yeah i think 
you've shown me that you are ready to go home   i think because i also had sort of some 
knowledge in school um previously on how   the importance of having a recovery plan so 
i think they call it like a rep plan so it's   like a wellness recovery action plan so before 
a patient can be discharged from the psychiatric   walk they have to show that they have a plan as to 
how they're gonna manage if they experience their   triggers and their symptoms again and if they can 
prove that they have a safe and healthier plan   then they can go what was your plan so i 
wrote down the things that i'll do when i'm   out that's why i said you know it's important 
to be prepared for the week to come so and i already know what my triggers are and 
i already told my family and my boyfriend   how to react to me when when i'm feeling 
distressed so i thought that i was ready to go Nicole: i want to know like so from then on after 
let's stay until now how has like the journey been like for you  Belle: i guess i want to emphasize that like 
recovery is definitely not a one-way street like   it's definitely gonna be a very long and arduous 
journey i think even now i'll tell people that   i don't think i'm 100 recovered yet there's still
days where i break down and i feel very suicidal   um it's definitely not going gonna be easy for 
me or for people around me so yeah even though i   tell people that i don't think i'm 100 recovered 
yet yesterdays where i feel uncontrollably sad   fearful or angry and even my doctors 
said that you know medications only form   30 of the equation and the rest of the 
70 is actually just you so i guess you   really need to pace yourself and have more 
realistic expectations of yourself like for me   i think they describe me to have like a very 
anxious and rigid personality i can be quite a   perfectionist and i don't allow room for mistakes 
and that can really create a lot of unnecessary   stress from for myself so um i have gone back 
to work but i've only gone back part time   so i guess really slowly easing yourself back to 
a more a healthier routine would be very helpful   and keep yourself busy with things that you like 
to do of course don't tire yourself out by what   i did while still on leave so even after i was 
discharged i was still on leave for about two weeks   yeah and during that two weeks i kept myself busy 
because my boyfriend was away for work so i just   met up with friends i joined a gym membership 
i went for f45 like every day um i even tried   painting with my mom so i guess like reconnecting 
with the things that i like to do and reconnecting   my friends and family because i guess while i 
was so overwhelmed with my anxiety and depression   previously um i only thought of sticking to my 
boyfriend and i kind of forgot about everything   and everyone else so i guess that was a good 
time for me to sort of go back to the things that   i used to do and i was very hesitant to start 
part-time work because then i'll be thinking   oh no my pay is gonna be sliced in half you know 
then what about my plans for you know getting a   house or this savings are gonna take a toll 
and even the thoughts of you know going for   um medical visits they're also gonna cost money but yeah i realized that these are 
just important steps that i need to take to   become better and i went when i do become 
better again then all this will be worth   Nicole: i want to ask like i think for love 
like everything that you have experienced right   i think as a member of like our generation 
i think that we are quite self-aware of like   mental health as a whole right and like it's 
important but i think sometimes the there's quite   a big barrier to like seeking help or like taking 
that step taking that first step out of i guess   like a bad state or whatever state that you're 
in to want to improve right or like i think one   i once spoke the psychiatrist who said um quite 
accurately that you know people are willing to pay   like 200 for like a retail session but like they 
aren't willing to pay the same amount of money to   seek help for like their mental health right so i 
want to know like what first of all like what is   your take on that second of all like how would you 
encourage i guess like somebody in the same shoes   to maybe spend 200 a bit more wisely you know 
Belle: okay mental health is definitely a spectrum that   you can have good mental 
health and you can be mentally ill and that's i   would say at the extreme end the moment if you're 
struggling with something and you feel anxious   it's really okay to seek help then yeah you 
don't have to go straight to a psychiatrist   if you think that that's too much i guess some 
people are more hesitant because they think   the idea of seeking help means that you 
have to be very ill or very unwell to go to   go to someone for help but if you think 
that you know speaking to your friends   and family aren't very helpful to make you 
cope with your stress or your hardship then   yeah it's always an option for you to 
reach out to other forms of support   actually there are a lot of other supports 
available just that i don't think people are   that aware of it give me an example just like you 
know that there's a help bot called belle as well that   actually you can just type too you don't have 
to call so some people find that they don't like   calls they don't like speaking to somebody yeah 
you can even just type yeah you just go google   belle the help bot and then you can actually 
type and share and then they will offer you um   services that you can access based on what you 
need um and if you don't mind calling somebody   because some people feel more comfortable speaking 
speaking to a stranger because then they won't   feel judged then i guess there are helplines 
out there as well that you can reach out to   and for me like what i did was that my family and 
my boyfriend helped me to speak to a counselor   from fsc i think some people find that it's 
gentler when they start off by speaking to   a counselor rather than having the idea that 
they're going to speak to a psychologist or   psychiatrist because that makes them feel 
like am i mentally ill or something yeah um   yeah so i guess you can always take baby 
steps if you think that the moment you   feel like whatever you're doing is not enough 
then you just have to try something different   sometimes speaking to a friend is good 
enough sometimes trying something new   is good enough yeah you just have to try and 
try until if you find that you're in a better   state so i guess what i wanted to share was also 
not just in a perspective of a person that is   struggling with anxiety and depression and wants 
to seek help but also to reach out to people who   who may know people who are struggling with some 
hardships or struggling with their mental health   and i just really wanna like have a shout out to 
them and say like you know thank you so much for   for being there um it's very very important that 
there's someone like you who cares for them and   it's not going to be easy but if you know and care 
for someone like that please don't give up on them   yeah it will be very draining and tiring 
for sure but it is very helpful to know   that there will be someone who will be there 
regardless of what happens so for me i know that   yeah i know that my sister my boyfriend are 
my rocks like you know they'll always be there   and if you are struggling to know what to say 
to a person and to get them to seek help i think   one good way would be to say that you know as a 
person who generally cares for you like i'm really   concerned about your well-being um if you think 
that you know what you're currently doing is not   enough then maybe you should try something 
different so i guess you just have to be very   you have to be very caring very gentle yet 
inquisitive and persistent yeah yeah because   sometimes even i was very stubborn at first 
about speaking to a counselor like i was like   oh why should i speak to a counselor i really 
learned about things in school i know strategies   to help myself and my anxiety so i don't have 
to go to someone and pay them to tell me things   i already know but i think what's different is 
that obviously what you're doing is not enough   because i know i realized that obviously 
what i was doing was not enough because i   still experience so much anxiety yeah so having 
someone like someone that will you know bring   you for your appointments make your phone calls 
arrange appointments for you it's very important   yeah sometimes you're just so overwhelmed that 
you just don't even have that capacity to reach   out for help and you just need that person there 
to guide you and say hey you know don't worry i'll   accompany you and if you are struggling to find 
words to see i'll help you yeah i think that's   very comforting and that's very important yeah so 
having that strong network is very important and   if you feel like you know i don't have any 
friends and family that i can rely on then   know that there are other outlets that you can 
options that you can go to as well like the   hotlines yeah you can go straight to them they're usually very helpful
Nicole: so i think maybe to sum it   up like i want to talk about like this episode is 
intended to come up in in conjunction with world   mental health day right is there like a something 
special that you like to say in light of this   day of commemoration
Belle: in commemoration of mental 
health day i think uh what i want to share is that   you don't have to be mentally unwell to seek help 
yeah as long as you're struggling with something   i think we have to really normalize 
the idea of speaking to someone   speaking to a therapist yeah sometimes that can 
be a weekly thing if you can afford to actually   just organize your thoughts and to kind of have 
a third person perspective as to what happened   and to have a better relationship with 
yourself in general so the idea of maintaining   mental health and well-being should be more of a 
focus yeah rather than having the idea that you   have to be unwell before you seek help i guess 
like everyone has the idea that you can only   feel unwell before you go to someone but i 
think the idea of really maintaining your   mental health and wellbeing is also very important 
so everyone no matter like whether you're facing   hardships or not is i think it's very important 
to be kind to yourself and to spend some time   to reflect and to give yourself a pat on 
the back and to celebrate the small wins   because i mean this year is not easy for a lot 
of people so really treat yourself and reward   yourself at the end of a long day of work or 
long work week and do something that you like   go for staycations because people are doing that 
a lot now yeah just do things that you like and   remember that you can only be healthy before 
you can work yeah so if you are constantly   working to the point of burnout you're gonna 
spend a lot more time and money then to get back   to your good health so just remember remember 
to take care of yourself even while you're   working and studying right now

#thebigstory #coronavirus #covid19","[Music] good evening you're watching the big story with Haryana to demand I'm Olivia Quay we begin with the latest local coffee 19 updates the Health Ministry confirmed a 632 new cases as of noon today nine of them are Singaporeans and permanent residents migrant workers living in dormitories continued to make up the bulk of the remaining cases and the full breakdown of the new cases will be released later today Singapore now has a total of 19 thousand four hundred and ten cases in other news those of us who usually buy fresh produce from wet markets can now do it in the comfort of our own homes there's no need to jostle with the crowds especially doing this circuit breaker period earlier today for the first time six stalls from Attica market in Little India hooked their fresh produce for over a livestream on Facebook called tikka online marker the live stream which went on from noon until about 4:00 p.m. allows customers to interact with the sellers and buy the items by leaving a comment in the comment section and the groceries will be then delivered correspondent Eunice quake traded out have a look wow this is the first set hand honest anyone once then bonus before let's go [Music] my goodness definitely looks very joins the buying and selling process like how is your experience uh it was very entertaining actually as you can tell I was genuinely like really excited because the reaction that you saw just now it was actually after I wasn't able to buy quite a couple of other produce before so it got really exciting after a while and really it's all about fastest fingers first because the sellers as you can see they were just put out the produce right there then you just talk about you know there's mention the name what it is the way the price and then you leave a comment in the comment section and pretty much just hope and pray that you got what you beep oh and if you are successful then what happens is they will you drop a message to them directly in private messaging and then they will follow up the back end so I will follow up on your order as seamless as the process can seem it doesn't completely replace the actual experience of shopping at a wet market so here is what kind of gaps did you experience this afternoon well so I mean nothing to me nothing we place us going to the wet market really because there's nothing like picking your fresh produce speaking to the vendors directly I mean here you can there is some form of interaction they do reply you verbally during the live stream but you can only speak to them with your comments so and so that's one thing that I think is missing and the other thing is that bottom line is you do not know how many people you are competing against for the produce and at one point to the point that were like a thousand of our viewers for the live stream and even just a small fraction of that that's it you won't get your products because I think maybe because it is the first time so they have kind of limited the amount that is available so there were maybe like twenty thirty sets of say vegetables of fish and then that's it and then it's out its out and some people buy more than one set so if you buy two three everybody does that there's nothing left like yeah and so there's a very high chance that after watching for hours like this whole thing kind of ran for almost four hours right you may not get a single item so you had to be mentally prepared for that but do you do you manage to get anything do yes I scored a vegetable box from jaws vegetable supply and I also got a snapper from 81 shown you yeah and what I like about it is that I mean I don't got my produce yet it's a probably on the way now because it's supposed to be same-day delivery why is that I mean without this I would have never probably bought from them ever I wouldn't even have known that this stall is around because I would just go to the market that's near me so so yeah so so it helps that now you know I have another place to go to in the future right and and do this you know wet markets are usually frequented by the older generation who may not be a thanks Evie a dis platform would then wouldn't then capture the usual wet market demographic but in the same vein this novel way of taking wet market shopping online may attract other group so with this new way reshape the wet market shopping experience for consumers you think oh yeah for sure I think so because you definitely get a younger more tech-savvy crowd and these are the people that you know already buy a lot of stuff online right and also probably the same crowd that would typically go to a supermarket maybe over wet market so you know to see what really goes on in the wet market without actually being there there's a good taste lot of what you might you might get in the future and I think the style you know the auction makes it a lot more fun Adobe stressful I must admit but more fun and entertaining I know people who just go on on on live streams like this just for the entertainment value like they're not actually buying anything but because the sound of vendors can be really funny can be really entertaining and they just want to see what is out there and then you know say hey I miss maybe the new way of kind of window shopping in a sense yeah and on the on the other hand this could also see you know maybe the older generation wanted to be more tech savvy as well so say maybe I could you know next time maybe brought my mom in to kind of watch it together with me and then she can decide you know whether she wants something yeah and and and then I could be quite fun actually mmm well you know the online experience may also be challenging for the sellers who are tech savvy and language can also be a barrier as well as the line face-to-face communication so do you think these barriers of entry deters sellers from adopting this new way of business yeah I think it will take a while for them to maybe get used to it but I think with what take out online market is doing when people you know see what is going on the vendors even just normal consumers when you see what's going on how successful it can be then yes I think they would be keen to adopt it and when you see that you know a sales actually pick up you know that actually is our people you know wanting to buy their produce then it could work I think pretty well because it helps a lot that as a young if there's a younger generation helping with the tech stuff right so actually all they need to do is just sell their produce and if that's what they have to do they don't worry about administration you don't worry about the type what was going on in the back end and all that I think that could really help a lot and gain a lot of visibility for them as well I think what is important is that it is not easy to talk on the livestream for hours and to also sustain the viewership so there have been some like Facebook like streaming sessions that I've seen before as the live scene goes on the longer it goes on you know the other just widows down and how much that actually translates to sales as well it's a bit kind of up in the air but I think for a situation like this with the thicker online market you know these are established vendors that you can trust and that's really our most important so you need to know that the quality is there you're not going to get something very different when you know your delivery arrives I'll see that I'll see later how my delivery come yeah but to host it can be it could be quite challenging I guess with the hosting part so I think that's why when you have another host online together with you the co-host that could help you know say any did air or whatever you know helps a lot well thank you so much Eunice we were speaking to correspondent Eunice quick on what market stalls going online to who shoppers during the circuit breaker [Music] in Parliament today Parliament will soon be able to meet in multiple location if necessary a new bill will allow members of parliament to take part in the proceedings across two or more places

Pompeo had said on Sunday that there was enormous evidence that the virus had originated in a lab in Wuhan this I think further fuel to the theory it has been heavily pushed by the Trump administration CCTVs harshly were the comment recited the executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program who claimed that the virus is natural in origin that's it for our global updates back to you thanks Dylan moving on most venues in Hong Kong will be allowed to reopen from Friday sights allowed to open their doors when the closure or the expires include fitness centers Beauty Palace and cinemas bars will also be able to get back to business as long as they operate at half capacity with each table sitting no more than four people but nightclubs and karaoke lounge will remain shut under the new measures chief executive Carol arm also said schools will start reopening from May 27 now the range of new infections has stabilized in Hong Kong with 1041 cases and no new ones reported on ten of the past 16 days so let's bring in the Straits Times Hong Kong correspondent Claire Wong Claire in Singapore Health Minister Hyun Kim Jung said the lifting of our circuit breaker would be determined by three factors the number of cases had to remain low the global situation as well as whether there is a system to allow the country to open up safely so what factors hinged on mrs. alarms decision to relaxed restrictions well in her own words it's not an exact science so basically she's saying that it's a balancing act how so for instance she said that scientists are still trying to understand the virus more but in the mean time border controls and social distancing measures affect the economy so people are cooped up at home now and they want to be able to go out was what she said so she said it is very difficult to wait until there is no case at all before the rules are relaxed so essentially it's a give-and-take approach for example bars and pubs need to stay afloat right and they've complained after being after forced closures so they now can reopen for business but there cannot be any live music no dancing and the number of patrons will be capped okay and these measures are basically you know to impose to restrict basically to to adhere to social distancing mm-hmm no we know mrs. Lance the press conference was only a couple of hours ago but what has the immediate reaction been okay I'm going to break this down to three parts first of all easing of venues and businesses so pressure has been mounting for some time right on the government to relax the rules and the false closures had created some unhappiness among certain sectors particularly the bars and pubs right so this would be welcomed by them I think they're quite a blare that the government is taking in feedback and it's the second point about reopening schools that the secretary for education kept in Yong was asked if this was a premature move but he said that the government is not resuming classes immediately okay he's saying that you know the governor is giving advance notice about three weeks for all stakeholders to prepare for school resumption and he said that the government will obviously monitor the situation right and adjust the plans accordingly and also the classes some right now meant to be half-day and they're they're going to allow the old secondaries the higher secondary school students to go back first and obviously then it will be faced in June as well the lower pupils will be able to attend school the third point I think is giving up mosques to the needy and to all residents so the supply of mosques will come from various avenues including government produced ones they event that production those donated by conglomerates and businesses those government secured so and the briefing mrs. lamb was asked if she would apologize because this is too late a gesture so they'll be giving out reusable masks masks that can be reused up to sixty times it's locally produced that's developed and when she was asked this question at the briefing she said and I thought you know what she said was some quite quite sure like up front right basically that it's not like she's late in handing masks out it's that I didn't have any to give at that time so I guess this explains I mean this this is not this is not uncommon I think a lot of fun governments around the world do not have the ability to hand out masks you know because of a face mask ranch right but I think things in Hong Kong have eased you have a lot of um people contributing to the supply now so I can actually get them in shops what clip before the the pandemic hits you know hit the world that were of course you know pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong which rocked the city for several months so do you think the easing of restrictions has given these protests and opening to come back well this was briefly touched on by mrs. LOM who said that easing of rules do not have any political considerations what I will say is this with or without a rule the the number of people in public gatherings you know will not want to come out but I think we need to consider this as well in the Labor Day long weekend is any indication at all the turnout may likely be smaller than what we have seen um last year because definitely on because of the pandemic and because people are you know more aware and they they want to you know avoid crowds for that matter so what we need to look up for in the coming days and months will be dates like June 4th June 12 July 1st and things like that these are considered big dates to watch out for and that will give a better indication of whether protesters will take to the streets again the last time you were on the show Claire was about three weeks ago since then Hong Kong circuses rose by around thirty you know Singapore on the other hand well we had 3,000 plus cases when we last spoke and that number has ballooned exponentially as you know the majority of the cases that here have been linked to foreign worker dormitories how did Hong Kong manage to avoid a similar crisis within its migrant worker population if you look at Singapore you have both domestic helped helpers and you know the geometry workers the workers living in dormitories basically in construction sector in Hong Kong construction secretary relies on locals and means and is that said I need to flesh out this particular point is that you know it Hong Kong has other problems for example if you you have things like coughing homes and subdivided flats but many people are squeezed into one tiny space correct so that's the same consonants dama trees right where you've got many people in one living area so if the dicey bit then comes if somebody in the space gets infected so that is something that could happen that obviously no one wants you know it to happen obviously but this is where go into the part about how people here have a higher level of awareness they have a little precautions so because of that I think that helps and it sort of eases the situation in essence right well thank you so much Claire for giving us the latest in Hong Kong as all these that do stays safe we've been speaking to a Hong Kong correspondent clay Huang adilyn it's over to you now in perhaps the first case of its kind Boaz Ling could be the first baby born in Singapore whose debut to cook at 19 his parents Polly and Natasha had flown to Singapore from London just two hours before Natasha entered her 36th week of pregnancy three days after their arrival they both tested positive for the corona virus after month of fear and anxiety they were cleared of the virus and baby Boaz was born on April 26 here's a look at their story [Music] right there is a Singaporean noodle dish that I loved on Singapore Airlines but I couldn't eat it because I felt sick and I think this because I was I lost my sense of taste and smell so just tasted awful so I I didn't eat it at all [Music] [Music] [Music] you we are very pleased to be joined by none other than the happy parents themselves Billy and Natasha Ling welcome guys now congratulations on the birth of baby boys most important question how is he doing yeah he's doing really well he's sleepy at the moment so we apologize if he suddenly wakes up and he's got to got to be fed but I'm sure if you say you want some more milk well I guess we have to talk about the moment that you both tested positive for the coronavirus pili I understand you got the bad news first what was that like and do you have any idea how you got infected well what was it like I we just arrived back from the UK and so I was jet-lagged I was in a deep slumber at o'clock in the middle of the day and the phone rang Natasha picked it up and woke me up and said all hey it's n CID your results are through and I spoke to the person and initially I was so when they said I was positive I was panicking thinking oh my world what's going to happen what does this mean for Natasha what does this mean to the baby this is but in some ways it was a bit bittersweet because in the UK at that point they were testing anyone so I'm just kind of thinking actually now we're in Singapore if I've got it and he said get me my medical attention and the health care to get over it as quickly as possible so in that way I was kind of like oh this is ok how did I get it in a way we've got no idea and I work for a big church in central London called All Souls and I'm part of a great team that puts on free English classes so we get a hundred over a hundred people every week coming to our friend classes so maybe someone brought it internationally there but I think I was probably just very unlucky and in the wrong place at the wrong time maybe on a bus touching a bus who knows and oh no no no Tasha you had to be in isolation for three days at a new age meanwhile Malaya was initially awarded at NTID so you two spend several days apart on top of that at a time you were the only Koba 19 patient in Singapore who was that far along in in her pregnancy how terrifying was the whole experience and how did you get to it I thought I'd be with pillion in CID so when I found it wasn't the case that really stressed me out that I was gonna be on my own and I think as a first-time mother you worry a lot anyway worried you know is the baby kicking enough is it moving is it gonna be okay worried about birth and labor to have run a virus on top of that was was quite stressful I found that quite stressful yeah it's just to add on to the stress already know now tell us about the moment that you guys you know both tested negative Natasha why don't you go first so testing negative while you're in there it's like winning the lottery like you don't know who's gonna test negative you don't know on what the-- so we were really well I was really excited when I found out I got two negatives but at the same time I I was anxious and sad because I felt like I was leaving pele behind and I didn't know when she was gonna get out and I worried about him not being there when when I had the baby I think that was the big thing for me mmm no how about you pili what was your side of the story I think one Natasha missed out is when we were in the hospital and there was this thing that we sort of nicknamed called a false negative and so many people are Ward would get a negative then the next day would be a positive so it was a false negative and so when Natasha's first negative came through and all the doctors and the other patients they were all saying to us or don't get our hopes up everyone gets the negative and you know there were people in the ward that they were that were there much longer than we were Josh was only there for ten days so I really you know I think it must be the power of prayer with so many people around the world praying for us that Natasha rotten and straight away I got a double negative and so that I was a day behind Natasha actually so when we when I found out it was actually late at night at that point there were so many more cases coming through so the results were taking a lot longer in the lab so we were expecting to find out about three or four o'clock in the afternoon it was ten o'clock I was playing cards with some of the other inmates as we used to joke calling each other and I got I was alerted by one of our wonderful doctors dr. shobun he messaged me hey bro you're getting out of here and I was over the moon and we had this great culture of when somebody got discharged everyone would start applauding across oh wow so so we got a little around applause you know it was it was wonderful you know all of us you know we didn't have it too badly but there were others who've got a much worse and you know we think about all the people in the ICU now but everyone was really supportive and really happy when you got discharged we were really sort of you know hoping and fighting for each other we've got a whatsapp group now all be through the kerbin survivors wow there's amazing now guys what have the you know let's shift our attention to voice for a minute what have the doctors said about him you know possibly being the first baby born here to have our natural antibodies against Kobe 19 I mean the doctors have been really excited I think about Boaz and all the other doctors have been wonderful and supportive to work person and they've really helped us get through the process actually they've been wanting us to when we were in there they were wanting for us to recover before we had the baby as badly as we did so what they told us is that it is likely that Boaz has antibodies for coronavirus because I had the virus while he was in my belly so the antibody that passed from me to hearing through the blood so that's what we've been told and I think it's really exciting really because you know all three of us and like the many of the other coded patients we're all able to contribute to the research that's going on in Singapore and along the whole process it was really interesting because everyone was learning together if the doctors including nobody quite knew what was going to happen or would respond and you know they can't confirm with us that he is completely immune and how long the immunity would last well they're pretty confident it would but they think it just follows the pattern of most viruses I think they what they want to do is try and get a few other results from babies and babies food we haven't had it in Manila or they give us that that final yes he's clear but it's been a really exciting journey and I think we're we're thrilled that Boas here is the youngest person in Singapore to come into research in Singapore against coronavirus and so yeah he's he's sleeping at the moment but he's doing very well he's a little a little superhero with super powers and everything Times article I said that he was oblivious to it all and I'm sure you have a lot of good stories to tell him with he's a bit older and understand a bit more yeah yeah now guys what are your you know what are your plans is a family now that does says said somewhat settled you know although I wouldn't quite say that considering you have to care for a newborn now so we it's been quite nice actually over the circuit breaker to have quiet time to spend with the family and to you know football s to get to know two of his grandparents and one of it so that's been quite nice but obviously we're we're really excited for him to meet the rest of his family and our friends in person yeah it's it's been exciting because we never planned to have the baby here we were planning to have it in in the UK and it was bit exciting trying to set up a baby shop here as well as in the UK but I think we've just got to wait until things become clear we're waiting like everyone else in Singapore and in and when it's safe to do so as I said you know we're staying with family here at the moment so it's nice that we've got them but Boas has seven great-grandparents and he's met them on a video but we can't wait for family and friends to meet him and and I think although we're being told we're most probably all three of us immune to the virus it doesn't mean we can't carry the virus so we've got to be full and only when it's clearly safe to do so we were trying to interest in to his great grandparents both in Singapore and in London well pillion Natasha thank you so

So if you're going to be butt-hurt by our videos, simply click X :/ But for those who share our sense of humour, enjoy and watch on! Comment below with what you want to see next! :) Thank you!",[Music] hi guys welcome to another episode on team nlc i am sylvia and today we have a very special guest to talk about a topic that is very close to my heart mental health mr eric choi hi everyone just an introduction for those of you who don't know who is mrs erich tell us what do you really do i am championing youth matters especially you who are in not so privileged situations so disadvantages youth with issues like mental health issues so recently i spoke in parliament about youth mental health and also young people from disadvantaged families right so what do you do also as co-chair right of the youth um mental well-being network yeah actually very simple we started this uh youth methodology network in february last year oh no was it response to coveted 19. well you already wanted to do it we want to do it all along anyway okay so uh we actually said oh who wants to help out in this piece of work so we had a lot of parents young people professionals practitioners coming forth and to date we actually have 1 500 of them wow both individuals and group organizations who have come forward to say hey i want to help so now we have done quite a few sessions and we have organized ourselves along eight areas and they have as of now thought about at least 30 projects oh wow so hopefully this year we should see some of the projects bearing fruit why this passion in mental health do you know someone who has gone through it or one day you just woke up and be like yeah they need help i think it's a very prevalent thing actually in fact all of us contend with some form of mental health even if not mental health inventor well-being issues you know in a recent survey it was actually found that one in seven singaporeans actually contend with some mental health disorders at some point our lives and then how do we cope with it how do we reach out where do we go to for help i mean these are all questions that maybe a lot of people have but we don't have really answers for so i think coming from that and coming from a personal point of view that's something close to my heart in that sense and i'm sure all of us grapple with our own you know demons every day so i think uh online right there's been a rise of memes also that's concerning mental health so we'll be looking at seven okay and then we will be talking about how relatable this is to you okay and what you can tell us about it sure okay number one so going straight means actual therapy turning right makes oversharing on twitter and you see the smoke behind the car the views of the car so like suddenly right turn yeah over sharing so oral examination tell me about this photo i think if it's uh memes are meant for mostly young folks right yeah so young folks tend to be digital native so people like me digital migrant right so i think we want to express ourselves and we do a lot of sharing on our socials i think in a way that is also kind of like a reflex just to try to communicate with the world about hey what are my emotions at this point in time and i think that's good but i think also the online world is also a place where you can have resources so for instance you know beyond the labor movement they actually have a chat bot her name is bell yes so you can chat with bell and bell can point you to resources that are good for mental health that can possibly be of help to you both in the online world and in the real world and also there are websites like mineline.sg that you can go to so after you post that go to the line to sg all right chat with belle you know but let me just question you one thing also okay do you think people out rightly will tell people they are in therapy well i hardly think so actually because there's still stigma associated with mental health conditions right so even though we mentioned one in seven have some brush with mental health conditions at some point in their life but i think it's also a fact that one in three still think that mental health conditions are oh it comes from weak willpower right but i think that's not a good position to start with okay but the fact that one in three persons thinks that let's fix volumes of what we as a society think about mental health and how we react to it so i think there's a lot of room for us to reshape the way we think about mental health conditions as well as the people with mental health conditions in one sentence it's just about reducing the stigma so what is the youth mental well-being network right doing to you know help people say it's okay to tell people you're in therapy it bears repeating the phrase or the sentence it's okay to be not okay right right so i think we just need to remind ourselves as one people that you can seek help you love your value you are worth it and we just have to get this into our psyche and it's not easy because it means fundamentally changing some engine parts are yes in ourselves right yeah and just all got to keep at it well and i think that's a very practical uh word of advice that it is you know a habit we have to get into we have to constantly remind ourselves it's okay not to be okay one time is not enough you viewing this video one time is really gonna not gonna help your mental health condition is when you take away from this video is really okay not to be okay you telling yourself you telling the people around you and all of you saying the same thing then it will work keep nagging the next beam all right okay what i think yeah this is quite interesting quite cool yeah you do you know who's that i have no idea actually oh my goodness you oh okay so i think what um this meme tells us is that people always think that mental uh not wellness okay has a faith but the fact is a lot of these people are actually high-functioning adults walking around us and i think that's that's very true because um how then do we really identify who amongst us need help and i think here's where uh i'll throw in three letters you know government mama said acronyms right so we have look listen and link right so look just look out for a person's behavior right do i look like i'm a little listless do i look like i have lost interest in usually the things i'm passionate about right not looking at their physical appearance but looking at yeah behavior yeah right so second l is listen listen to what the person is saying is he or she saying something that hey usually you don't sound so pessimistic and these are all signs and symptoms so look listen and then you talk to that person in the process of listening and then if you realize that hey this person possibly has a problem then we link link to what link to the resources linking to persons around him or her who loves him or her because all of us have you know at least a few persons that loves us in our life right and and we go to them for comfort we go to them to re-center and refocus ourselves to recharge our inner core during this pandemic right i think a lot of people who are also like business leaders or you know you know like owners co-founders right they face a lot of stress like they will see like you know their colleagues having lower morale and that is look we see a problem yes right and then we listen they will tell us oh i'm i'm overworked right i feel very lost i'm very upset right and then the problem where we struggle is the link like as a boss i personally feel like it's too personal for me to say hey you should be doing this because i feel like we don't have that relationship but what can i possibly do simple you take out your company's organizational chat it's quite a big group right and then you look at that employee they're concerned about who are the friends the good friends around that person so have that person reach out and get a rough sense of hey what's going on is there anything going on at work in family life or things like that so it's a little bit of detective role in finding out hey what's the angle we can come in to help and our intention really is because we love that person right and we really want to be somebody useful and somebody constructive in that person's life to help him or her and the moment that that person realizes that hey there's somebody who cares about me i think that makes a world of difference so if you are like you know you know also you know running a company and you're facing the same problem as me i think um what eric just said i think it really helps okay next one when somebody asks me how i'm doing but i also want them to feel sorry for me oh my gosh ah this one oh again it goes back to it's okay not to be okay and i think forwards we are worth it so we are worth it because people around us love us even if it's just one person even if it's just your cat or your dog oh my god no ryan my best friend is my daughter yeah so so long as somebody loves you you are worth it so so don't ever ever say oh okay let's not impinge on others correct correct i think i think as singaporeans or like asians you know or in our society right we just don't want to be a burden and i think that is so real because you know everybody is facing the pandemic everybody also stressed like who am i to tell people i i'm very stressed can you take care of me you give me a bit of attention yeah okay me for a while i think that is hard for every one of us but it's okay just three words right don't buy stuff yeah just go because they love you they will hug you oh my gosh it's quite funny because like we've gotten to the stage like don't pass it just ask for it yeah like we are all burns anyway so we might as well just acknowledge it next one right this one's philosophical so you have a hand then you have another hand and then you do a high five and then the hand sinks into the water yes i think like you know i've been advocating for mental health for maybe two three years yeah right and i realized at the start there was a really a lot less awareness but i think now we're getting really into gradually yeah into the conversations and we are really looking at the nuances and the layers of what constitute mental health right it's really not just depression it also means you know your daily things you know how you look inwards and reflect and all that so i think this pose talks about hey now we are aware but still there is this gap between awareness and action that's where i go back to my triple else okay listen link and i think the link part is the critical part because you look you listen and probably you already know but you don't know how to react you don't know how to respond that's why you give a high five and then the person sings deeper yes absolutely but i think we we ought to be able to know where the help is so there's so many hot lines uh because of the pandemic we set up the national care hotline that's 1 800 202 needs to call this hotline if you think that you need some emotional psychological support go ahead there will be volunteers will be behind the line if need be they can actually make referrals for you the professionals they operate from 8 am to midnight every day but if you think that you're in a crisis that means you're in an emergency you have suicidal thoughts there are also emergency hotlines out there so for instance the sos hotline which is 1-800-221-4444 and there's also the imh hotline which is uh 6389-2222 these are good hotlines to call for emergencies they're on 24 7. so if you think or if you know somebody who is in need of help urgently in crisis mode go for these hotlines so i think a lot of us watching you be like oh this hotline is not for me no i think even i i think that we're like oh it's not for me i'm not that serious yet i think i can deal with it without calling some government hotline because that would make it so official that i'm in trouble but you know let us know who who are these people who actually really call this hotline and you know are there any examples that you know people have actually gotten better after calling these hotlines well it's all anonymized that's why i won't be able to tell you um of uh maybe auntie who and who or student who and who not really but actually if you are really really worried there's also another service which is a community health assessment team chat so they offer a range right can actually make an appointment to go down to skate they actually offer services for youth between 16 to 30. you can make an appointment there'll be actually practitioners there who help you walk you through some services and if they can also make referrals for you if need be and the best thing is this whole process is all anonymized right right yes so the bottom line is you know help yourself and help people around you right so well uh if you're a little bit stressed and you don't get a call hotline i tell you what just call first and then see how later yeah i mean it's there right it's free right it's free yes okay i mean like they're really steady that might as well just try like huh okay next one [Applause] [Music] okay so you know there are even a lot of tick-tock now right yeah like i said you know you really just bring into awareness all these kind of things what do you think you know of this kind of content i think it just points to the fact that hey understanding is not there yet i go back to the surveys that i talked about earlier actually one in five which is like 20 right think that people with mental health conditions should not hold any responsibility at all then what others do yeah so they expect people with mental conditions to just lie down corner i don't know so that speaks to the amount of understanding they have in our society and also about whether you are willing to work with or live near somebody with mental health conditions well it's only a little over five in ten persons in singapore who thinks that yes i can do that so it's only one in two who thinks that what about the other half do you know what's their primary uh primary fear i think it goes back to lack of understanding i think it goes back to the fact that people don't really know that it's actually so prevalent so i know we talked a lot about our downstream uh help right maybe the hotlines or where you can go right but let's talk a little bit about upstream what do you think are certain things every singaporean especially youth can really start adopting so that we are taking care of our health so we don't really get too too serious i think it's just about vocalizing how you feel on a day-to-day basis if you just reach home you just uh i see my wife how was your day and then just say like a lot of us would just say okay laughs yeah like that law yes but beneath like that law is what oh i had a few not so pleasant experiences at work today what are they what makes you feel that way and then decompress some of those thoughts and feelings right we are sometimes so detached from our inner feelings right yes that we think that hey very much yeah okay so for example right i live with my brother and i always ask him how is he uh yeah no like it's quite pisces to continue the conversation but what do you suggest well again what does he like to eat you know does he enjoy coffee does he enjoy a good cup of ice milo dinosaur or whatever it is yeah and then slowly make people comfortable get it out of the chat about their shelves yeah and it's hard to do so for guys i think so that is something that you do um with your family members any other upstream things that we can do non-verbals right just before going out for the day give a hug and show appreciation at work if your staff or your colleagues has done something right say hey that's a great thing that you're done thanks very much when you say you know say thanks i visualize me going out to the person and say thanks and i need so formal yeah and i don't think i can do that you need to organize world ceremony what thank you yeah right so just like simple things even a text would do if that is where you need to get started i think so long as it's heartfelt people get it the next one do you have friends or family that are going through mental struggles such as depression because i do and this is the biggest mistake i make as a friend see my friend suffers from mild depression and every time he gets depressed he falls into this dark hole and seeing him in a dark hole i will always try to give advice to help him get out of the hole but that's wrong that's very wrong we have to realize that when someone has a mental breakdown all they want is for someone to be there for them they don't need no advice they don't need anything logical they just need some emotional support so affirm them let them know that you are there and just be around them advise us they can wait they can wait until they feel better but for now all you have to do is to just be there for them do you agree you know they're so funny you know this reminds me of something at home actually you know typically when men talk to women about problems right okay so typically men are like okay let's go for the solutions yes how do we solve this and when women talk to men about problems and usually it's like okay like empathize with you i just want a heart kind of thing right so there are a couple of times which i i talked to my wife what today at work this and this and this isn't and then my objective was just to get a heart right and then she would tell me oh why don't you try this solution oh wow so she's trying to speak in the way that she thinks she gave me a 10-year series that's it actually yeah all i'm looking for is just some empathy and a heart class most of the times the the men and women dynamics you know the mars and venus thing is like that lah but sometimes it gets reversed and we often go back to one uh one joke about myself you know always all these personality tests right yes yeah and a lot one of these tests was uh let's find out how man or how woman you are okay so my wife said take the test i think i was like 80 women oh wow i mean for family right i think it's easier to say hey what i'm i'm looking for is just listening here and you just sit there there but let's say in a work context okay how how do we help somebody who's telling us their problems he think really is before you say anything just make sure that you're listening very hard trying to make sense of what the person is saying right and trying to empathize trying to be in her or in his shoes to try to understand from his or her point of view hey what's going on before you offer solutions this is the last one okay imagine what a perfect life might look like i'm not sure what i even want but it made me realize that some things i would keep i think the understanding for this one right is i guess for every singaporean every year out there we do have a life that is ideal for us a life that we used to be sick but at the end of the day halfway through seeking it will realize is this what i even want right have you ever felt this way and how did you deal with it actually a lot of us a lot of us just go through life without giving much thought as to hey where are we trying to get to right so i think it's good once in a while to really just sit down go to the gardens slide on the grass look at the sky really deep breaths you don't have to take a very long time 15 minutes to do right and then just take deep breaths i think deep breaths for me really work because it helps you re-center refocus and gets that blood bumping in the right way again and then really think about hey what is life about for you it's going to be different for all of us but we need to spend that time to really give some thought to it and get in touch really with your inner self right and they're deep breaths yeah and it's freela and you can just do it like right now when you're watching this video exactly so the final question okay i know you already mentioned you know since the start of last year you have already like a thousand over participants and volunteers so let's say if somebody who is watching yes they're taking that deep breath and they already feel better good very sad right yeah yes and they want to join right what what can we do very simple go to reach.golf.sg

#YEOLO #SGCovidiots
https://youtube.com/yeolo",what's up guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here welcome grab the students rapid because you're about to have some fun now lately I've been feeling like my content has become a bit stale and repetitive so I figured today why not try something different and you know change up the structure a little bit so bear with me as you try something new and let's dive right in just kidding this is not that kind of channel almost got you there right anyway let's get back to business today we're going to be reviewing a couple of Cove idiots in Singapore and if you don't know what copy dates are just keep watching and you'll figure out really quickly so we're going to take a look at some of the more iconic Cove idiots doing the circuit breaker and I'm gonna rate them on a scale of one to hundred on how much of a copy that they are now the points don't matter and this is all for fun so please don't take this seriously and don't come after me now without further ado let's dive right in for real this time right at the bed the Texas how to spread hot so you know this is already not gonna go well I know he did not just open up the drink and drink straight out of it that ain't right pull back pull it back some more very good very good kinda clap for you he's going in for another drink no that was really chaotic like those guys probably thought it would the coolest [ __ ] I'm gonna trying to pull a prank like that in the supermarket and guess what they got charged for it who's the Buddha now I would rate these guys a level 85 for video because they clearly got an a-plus on being a public nuisance she's a sovereign pooja what is this behavior nothing to do with the police no contract with the police what is even going on anymore this guy said exactly what's on my mind like this woman try to shop without a mask on which is clearly against the circuit breaker rules and this wasn't the first time she's been caught doing this on three separate occasions in total like fool me once shame on me fool me thrice go to I'm hitch which is exactly what happened she got remanded I'm hitch I would rate her a level 99 covariant because clearly she lives on a different plane of existence where the rusia don't apply to her and no one has come close to breaking her record of committing the same mistake three times in a row and still not feeling any guilt or remorse like ladies and gentlemen the final boss of all con vidiots right here this woman great right off the bat her voice is just nails on a blackboard and not really feeling good about this one I will see there is not a situation that we can really visualize it why not just try to live your best excuse me miss this is not the time to live love love we are in the middle of a pandemic if I really get it in okay low like just wow wow are you hearing this just get it then recover so easy okay excuse me Karen the health care system is not just looking after you and they're not indebted to take care of you because you try to be irresponsible yeah no this ain't it I'm gonna give Karen a level 25 phobia like she doesn't know better and this was like an interview she might have been edited out to make it seem like she was more of a coveted than she really is but I highly doubt it so yeah level 25 and he took off his mask waitwhat now he's doing like a TSA scan what's going on I'm giving these guys like a level 60 Cove idiot because they're not as crazy as the ones who drank straight from the drinks along the aisle these are like a different here I would say a little lower they think they're trying to be funny like security officers outside and then literally pranking other customers who just want to get their grocery shopping done so yeah level 60 no no no no no no no no this is a hate crime I'm gonna call the police better yet SG secure yeah it's me oh no no no this is real this is real yeah yeah so someone uploaded this IG story of you know pressing the live button but he was using his feet instead of his hand like a normal person with some brain cells sorry I mean okay I'll calm down calm down yeah okay it was in the live yeah if he use his feet instead of his hands yeah Kimmy can we do something about it are you gonna arrest that guy no not details not the right platform to call or report oh okay sure don't call this again okay bye so that didn't work out I'm just gonna rate this guy level 44 video let's move on okay this next one is a still image you know to change things up a bit and it's a photo of a very iconic lady who was doing some stretches before crossing the road and just so happen to press the stop light button with her feet I don't know if she's genetically related to the guy who used his feet in the lift but I choose to believe it so I will give a level 45 right now watch the metal here explain that accident those first few words already tell me everything I need to know not why did you tear this off oh I'm extremely drunk that explains a lot I want you to listen to me okay how should I tell the Ministry I want them to listen to me you can write an email in this guy behind the camera is just super patient I mean of course the drunk guy wants to talk to a minister after tearing out all the tape meant to mark out areas where we can't gather in groups it's just a hot mess really I'm gonna give him a level 30 because he's like a harmless Cove idiot he's drunk but here's someone which is the guy who's filming him over there so it's not going crazy so yeah level 30 Wow okay this guy is already coming out real strong and he's already at a hundred and I don't like the energy is giving off especially with the weeds wearing his mouth like that that's just some chaotic evil why does he talk like he's from Texas what's going on what's going on people in the accents really [Music] okay I think we get the gist like clearly this guy is really in love with the circuit breaker and still doesn't know how to wear masks I'm gonna say he's a level 32 Kofi dear what's the people and red tape like candy just leave the tape alone I don't know why she thinks that's fun also what are you trying to prove or accomplish by leaping under it is it some parkour [ __ ] what are you trying to prove I don't want to know keep it to yourself you are level 40 Cove idiot okay these things to our photos because sadly we don't have videos of this really funny encounter so as you can see clearly these two guys on the bus and they were seated on those seats they've been mocked out for people not to sit on you see you don't read you get a stick on your back now apart from these view Cove idiots there were also plenty of disputes that happen on the food delivery friend you have everything from root customers to root delivery drivers to root staff it was just a lot to process now in some of these food delivery disputes I feel like it's not so clear-cut whether it's the driver or the stars fault because sometimes circumstances are just shitty on both sides take for example when people are rushing out to get bubble tea and all these orders just kept coming in so of course the staff and the riders would be overwhelmed so I'm not gonna rate these guys but if you're talking about customers being rude to the staff at food outlets these people automatically level 80 core videos like these stuff are just trying to do their job so just be patient you know chill out so we've covered quite a number of cone videos already but this is really just the tip of the iceberg we still have a couple more to go through and I'm just gonna give them honorable mentions real quick now our first honorable mention goes to this man who was arrested for public nuisance after stripping down - it's underway in Kalumburu I mean gotta give it to this guy for championing body positivity but time and place Lahore I'm gonna say he's a level 60 why not our next honorable mention goes to this guy who hit her cleaning lady's arm after she tried to stop him from ripping the plastic off the seats at Chinatown food center so all of the seeds have been covered in cling wrap so people wouldn't sit down and dine in but this guy thought you know what I'm gonna pay the reverse car I think these guys are level 49 confit do it because he's harmless but also a bit destructive so he's just somewhere down the middle now our next honorable mention goes to this aunty who insisted on eating her ketchup at Hakka Center she not only ripped off the clear plastic of the seats she sat down and had a food I would say she's a level 75 next up we have this woman who refused to stop eating at the Chum yep what for COD level 14 ko video business guide yessir honorable mention because he gave a racist rant after he was caught not wearing a mask just to forget to bring get to buy one thing hey you Chinese out Herman that was a lot I mean Chinese people do some stupid [ __ ] I have to agree but that was a bit out of pocket I would see is a level idiot Winkle idiot because ain't nobody got time for racism over here we have seven people who are fined after gathering for overnight eating and drinking on a cordon off bench in Woodlands I mean this headline is just chefs kiss and the fact that in the video they were all chilling out before the police came is just amazing these guys level 69 Cove idiots now we have another special honorable mention for group of nine people who are caught feeding or watching wild boars I mean 20 20 just keeps getting crazier these guys I would think a level 59 courgettes because they went all out there way to feed the wall boys when nobody asked now this NYX honorable mention is one my favorites is a two-part love story and pictures now here you see the two of them enjoying each other's company in a cordon off area and in the next photo the police have joined in its just love in a time of corona I think both of them are level 71 comedians because it's just obsessed ray can you imagine if you just got your solidarity payout and you immediately have to give it that because get fined not a smart move now I know what you must be thinking with all these bad news of Cove idiots in Singapore we really have lost we as a nation but you know what there's still one last glimmer of hope and I've good news to share that's right the PM DS have written to CTE nature is healing we have the virus alright guys that's it I'm pretty sure there's gonna be plenty more videos down the line but for now please miss ma don't be a con video I hope you guys enjoyed this video remember to like and subscribe and comment down below what I should react to the next I'll see you guys in the next episode bye [Music] you only live once ,True,True,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider","[Music] around the world the mysterious killer is on the loose there are long uncertainty if this arc overnight here it's a new and unknown enemy we have to be prepared for the worst [Music] Singapore is ready for battle the best way to deal with an outbreak is to act the entity to act early when crisis hits unity means strength there's every reason to be positive no virus is stronger than the nation unity [Music] January 2020 in the lead up to Chinese New Year festivities authorities in Hong Kong Taiwan and Singapore are setting up prevention measures at borders and hospitals in light of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan China within days what's now known as kovat 19 formally the 2019 novel coronavirus hits Singapore's shows we have confirmed the first case of one novel coronavirus patient in Singapore it's February 20 20 month since Singapore's first case was reported at the city's hospitals like Tan Tock Seng it's all hands on deck Mostafa on an enhanced pace since the outbreak started their dedication is contagious are you here for visiting a patient how do you have dr. Fineman okay I am deploy together with other stuff from other departments to conduct travel and health decorations at entrances of the hospital thank you Kabang so you need to support me Shonda enjoy the party tube okay thank you my fear or not to be here but together in our fellow colleagues to keep everybody safe my family is supportive especially my husband he say go for it it's part of you you should just go ahead and do it you have my support I'm proud of you hospitals are at the front line for testing more recently a network of almost 900 public clinics has also been activated they're called public health preparedness clinics or PHP C's and they act as a strengthened line of defense during public health situations ESPC clinics are ready to deal with this crisis we have been taught how to deal with pandemics we know how to take care of the safety of patients as well as our own safety and being having peacetime training is useful during these emergencies as we get activated as a PHP C we were given a priority over southern protects protective equipment such as masks gowns as well as gloves we set up separate triage areas to discern the patient's the high-risk patients from the low response and besides the history we look for signs for example that they have respiratory distress or they could have a signs of pneumonia we then decide where their patient is a high-risk patient that require further examination and then we sent to the hospital if they need for the investigation it allows us a better way to maintain surveillance over patients for presenting with the symptoms of flu or cough so that we have better data and statistics to monitor the situation having PHP C clinics in the community really helps because in terms of accessibility of services and then also preventing patients from going to hospital unnecessarily and having PHP sick Phoenix to do this job is better than to have patients for example mingle in the hospital and catching unnecessary infections meanwhile at Tan Tock Seng Hospital security guards are one has new responsibilities patients have tested positive at the hospital are transferred to the nearby National Center for infectious diseases SAR wants job is to supervise these transfers some patient talk to me about their problems some patient in front of us of Christ what I can do is give them moral support my wife my kids my mother and my sister do give me water support me make sure you help anyone make sure see the National Center for infectious diseases or NCI D is the epicenter of crisis management there are long uncertainty with this Arco v19 and what we do is really to actually listen to them then our listening here and belittle actually empathize with them to beef them where and behave so the concern really just to hear them how this work you comfort them rather than you know just rushing them or getting things done yeah and that work the in Italy the patient yeah because we are just treating the disease process rather than treating patients patients are treated in so-called negative pressure rooms behind double doors only fresh air can come in and only cleaner goes out this actually protects the community that is siding near the building itself and to assure people and the general public they are very safe ready a thing so this is our assurance who are the general public and also our commitment in terms of protecting the lives of Singaporeans it's not the first time Singapore is fighting an epidemic in 2003 staff here fought the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS during on our SAS experience we saw about 300 ovations Betances and this was why we actually built this building to actually handle up to 300 patients but in case of need we can in key skill up to 500 over at a much older institution that 94 year old College of Medicine building a special team from Singapore's Ministry of Health has been working tirelessly to help contain the spread of kovat 19 during normal peacetime our role is in the surveillance of infectious diseases of our concern and response towards these diseases currently with Kovac making outbreak our role has been transformed into that of the contact tracing center contact tracing is an extensive process [Music] the team's role is to find out where these patients have been and who they've interacted with in some cases this detective work has also helped reveal the source of infection if we are able to identify all context of a case early on before they develop symptoms then we will be able to break the chain of transmission and also by identifying contacts early on they will be able to be referred for medical assessment as early as possible so far we have managed to link most of the reported cases so as long as we're able just an established linkage with previously reported cases we are quite hopeful that we will be able to continue this another high-risk group people returning from areas with a high number of cases as a precautionary measure they'll have to remain in their homes at all times for 14 days we have a multi-level defense system and one of the first levels is to try to reduce the amount of importation of cases into Singapore and the logic is that if you have many many cases imported then they are likely to create many clusters of local transmission and then overall our health responds to be much more difficult local transmissions are kept at bay as of 3rd March 2020 the tally of cases number over a hundred with 30 remaining in hospital none are from community spread so far we've extended our surveillance very greatly and we haven't seen any evidence to suggest that wider spread community transmission is occurring and this is because we were able to identify patients early to identify contacts and to ring-fence these local clusters of spread before they can transmit to the wider community press conference regarding coronavirus disease covered 19 we're very impressed with the efforts they are making to find every case follow up with contacts and stop transmission Singapore is leaving no stone unturned testing every case of influenza like illness and pneumonia and so far they have not found evidence of community transmission in any battle knowledge is power but it a multi ministry taskforce spearheading crisis management of kovat 19 gives daily updates the aim to inform the public about the situation hazard unfolds good news or bad we have to be prepared for the worst crises can breed speculation and conjecture the task at hand is to prevent panic we are learning more about the virus every day and as we get more of this information we will share it with everyone so that everyone is informed and updated of the latest understanding of this virus and we will also reassess and update our strategies to deal with this evolving situation in an era where social media Trump's by speed and shares timely announcements are critical in fending off rumor and misinformation that's where the smart nation initiative comes in digital products what is this a new digital product would help in the delivery of a key item in the real world with public concern rising the government announced it would give for surgical masks to each household that's 1.3 7 million households across the city but people needed to know where to pick them up and all this happened in the middle of the Chinese New Year long weekend I started calling our engineers for SOS right so they came by office about midnight and they're by our brief was ready to come up with a website to get citizens knowing where to collect your mass we have less than 24 hours the first three days the steps was about 100k views which is quite surprising how would the whole thing fell about this exercise was really very meaningful it was during the Chinese New Year weekends where a lot of them will have heavy activities visiting but they all let go there and come to help make sure that this exercise went all successfully the site is called Moscow where dot SG and it's now been expanded to include information on public health preparedness clinics elsewhere in the world cases are on the rise on February 7th Singapore raised its alert status to dusk on orange leading to some scenes of panic and easy fair price has tripled the volume of supplies to stores a day after demand for essentials are surged by about 5 times we have been increasing our supply runs in fact it's gone almost three times more than the usual there's really no need to create your own data stockpile at home because when you do that you just add strain to the system I think there's no buckle it's going on so there's no need for us to hurt any of the things yeah there's continuous supply they are not stopping any trade so you're definitely to be able to get things off the shelf fear can do more harm than the virus itself it can make us panic or do things which make matters worse like circulating rumors online hoarding face masks or food or blaming particular groups for the outbreak instead we should take courage and see through this stressful time together let us stay united and resolute in this new coronavirus outbreak take sensible precautions help one another stay calm and carry on with our lives [Music] February 7th 2020 it's two weeks since the first confirmed coded 19 case in Singapore the tally rises to 40 and the alert status is raised today the task force has deliberated carefully and decided to raise the risk assessment to dusk on orange moving to orange means we should heighten our vigilance that we should step out our measures but it does not signal that things are getting out of control and it's very important to understand this because the best way to deal with an outbreak is to act preemptively to act early rather than late in the response so many things need to be stepped out ahead of time in order to have effective control of the situation around Singapore anti infection measures are stepped up Singapore's Transport Workers are doing their part to keep everything on the right track we think that traveling in Swati is too safe the reason is because we're a step up the way we disinfect the major touch point and if you are passenger traveling in our system and you're not feeling well our station staff will come to you they were put on your masks and gloves so to take care you commuters aren't the only ones being taken care of frontline staff to getting the necessary tools and knowledge to ride out the crisis we were actually arranged for doctors to come to a certain crew point and some home base to talk to them give dr. talk so many a question they can ask them personally where she tried to relay the theater frontline staff and to assure them they're working SMRT it's okay you just need to be healthy [Music] such measures give assistant station manager raha tha peace of mind she works on the east west line it's one of Singapore's busiest train routes and also serves the airport as a friendly I am concerned about the outbreak crisis but then I do confident too for me as a friend like to serve the passengers know better is whether they are well or unwelcome this confidence is shared by bus captain Michael Oh Oh before this that WA are two temperatures secondly buses every day are being disinfected and each trip when we reach interchange all those and windows after packing is being opened to left inside a to be future up first it is very safe to take our buses [Music] the same rigor is applied to precautionary measures at the city's points of entry more than a million people passed through Changi Airport every week it's not just cleaning itself but also disinfecting some of our high tide surfaces we have also applied a protective coating so that this in fact encoding actually what it does is that it helps to kill the viruses and bacteria that live on the surface and this can last from three to six months so that will help to keep the airport clean and safe [Music] cleaning and disinfecting work has doubled at the terminals and connected spaces including the recently opened jewel that required core want young to present overtime shifts almost every day here now water come to our what you know consumed yeah she rents the sing who yo yummy can come toy the toy pay the context of the woman that Southern High Sultana pain our message either housing hate our woman soil Torah don't see that dedication extends to everyone here at Changi Airport we are doing at most to keep the place safe and operating as normal in terms of the safety I think we have definitely put in sufficient precautionary measures we have also stepped it up so I I certainly feel that together as a team we'll be able to work through this crisis together here at mastercards asia-pacific head forces business contingency plans kicked in during the early days of the outbreak they are reducing large face-to-face meetings and non-critical travel Shafi shake is the head of the regional Crisis Response Team we are making sure that our people do not panic and they do not take any knee-jerk reaction to the situation and they are being provided the right guidance by our TV so for us it is mostly business as usual in fact most of the critical projects and initiatives which we are working on none of them have been impacted so far they are all running as per schedule the business district might look a little quieter than usual [Music] but behind the scenes everyone's in the fight together I think if everybody does their job which they are supposed to be doing and cooperating with the government I think this crisis can be handled and we would possibly see normalcy returning back soon the strong response from the Singapore government is highly commendable and and and in setting a very high benchmark for the rest of the countries to emulate I don't think anybody in business died for one moment Singapore's abilities to cope with covin 19:00 everybody I've spoken to has been very complimentary by the way kovat 19 is being managed in this country so in terms of business confidence in Singapore it remains high obviously people are struggling with the effects of covin 19 but that has got nothing to do with Singapore it's got everything to do with managing a crisis and businesses survive and grow and learn like governments and communities learn and grow from crises so I think there's every reason to be positive [Music] [Music] Sentosa the party island of Singapore looks a little too tranquil these days on the islands prime beachside strip businesses are feeling the heat the impact is actually quite big our business has dropped almost 70 percent tourism numbers have plunged in Singapore despite measures in all hotels to disinfect and stay virus free every hour cleaning wiping down you know so I said it so man leaf button was showing a bit of rust rust ins cause of the Bleacher the outbreak was certainly impact our economy the tourism and aviation industries are most directly affected I will introduce two special packages with a total budget of five point six billion dollars the first is a stabilization and support package this will stabilize the economy and support our workers and enterprises are helping workers to stay in their jobs and enterprises with cash flow under the budget hotels will get a faster write down of investment in renovations they'll also get rebates in property tax it comes with a pivot and single-bit yeah this actually allows us to to sell this room for four more people to stay this budget actually allows us to also redesign some of our rooms since this downtime rack we are able to very much isolate more rooms for this renovation before the guests come this corporate service hotels will also receive subsidies for training workers the budget allows us to reconsider how much this training funds we can allocate we employ a lot of special needs we always have to conduct training you know I'm confident that together we will stay strong and get through these trying times [Music] this is only for the short-term this virus very sure that we are able to go back to the type of occupancy that we used to enjoy [Music] it's just before noon staff at this restaurant are preparing for the lunchtime rush in the restaurant business good health practices in hygiene our priorities now even more so I'm Kelvin so I lasted an angel in KL q so we went to wash your hands later a plutonium mask so prevent your saliva from jumping onto a customer or onto the airflow okay first thing that we do nowadays we have to do sanitizing I will wash our hands and thighs so that make sure the place is fully clean they're measures to curb the spread of infection extend to patrons as well most of the customers that comes here they say that this place fixed and feels safe so coming here with these measures being put up they become they come back again many businesses have taken a hit most try to make the best of a rough patch because challenge I would say is to help save jobs for every employee that we have you know there are many people in the household who depend on them and we are talking about life in hood here our biggest asset is our exceptional people we have come together in weather many persons like the global financial crisis SARS and now the ongoing Kovach 19 outbreak budget 2020 is a strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet these challenges and seize new opportunities [Music] despite the storm Singapore keeps going everyone everywhere steps up to do their own small part to battle the virus down to the very youngest it's the start of another school dance many of these children come from the more than 1.6 million strong foreign community in Singapore everyone here knows the routine but today there are some new lessons to learn her own a virus can make can make us have a runny nose so it might make us how should we coffee you need to in your elbow very good might sounds a little bit scary to make you anyone named Sarah Mackenzie I'm from Aberdeen Scotland I'm the core teacher here for the nursery to be class Sarah's job is to instill life lessons and to build confidence among a young Ward's she has many blessings with those same themes in mind monster in the bin so that's very interesting for them and people have asked questions like is the virus gonna eat us is gonna get us and that's a good way for me to explain I'm like no it's not gonna eat us but it is something that we need to be careful about and we can discuss ways that we can keep yourself safe from the virus and it's good for all the children to discuss together and like if your friend feel scared you know how can we help to reassure them learning about the virus goes along with new routines including some for those who couldn't come to school so all this was put together in 24 hours but why that's really good it really shows families that we're thinking of them and caring about themself staff here developed a home learning kit for some pupils on leave of absence the kids were so well received that they decided to produce more to help lower-income families in the community who might be quarantine our charity actually came together and we made these the home landing kits for these students so 60 learning kits were made in about 48 hours and they were sent out to NTUC schools what we're trying to do is kindness through crisis because for much hollis point of view when you go to enthuse here you see all the toilet paper s : what's going on helping the community to fight fear from the youngest to the elderly how Singapore is coming together [Music] Singapore settles into life under a heightened virus alert life and work go on so just the learning we want the children to understand that despite the situation right now as long as all of us have the common faith we do our part to keep everyone safe we are able to overcome these crises one June and Pavitra are formed teachers of a primary one class can be sick can we die pupils learn the basics about protection fear can be worse than a virus itself but talking about it can help in class we actually go through about feelings so when they share their feelings we really reassure them and tell them I mean there's no need to worry if we take precaution measures and we practice good hygiene every all be safe before this is such a good opportunity for us to actually inculcate in them the values such as responsibility and resilience responsibility in terms of you being responsible for yourself your own hygiene and of course the social responsibility to us in keeping your friends your family members safe there are some changes to daily routines like staggered recess times one of many contingency plans designed well before the outbreak if schools head so close I mean we were still used to the linear space as a platform to upload a lesson package so the students do not miss out on any of their learning there are life lessons - such as showing appreciation to others in the school community [Music] [Music] giving people of all ages the tools to protect themselves against infection [Music] it's a familiar message by now they'd gone but this time recorded in local dialects looks you home or eat a cat yeah it's the work of Eugene Lee and his wife ski Eugene is a former banker who set up learn dialects SG to invest in social capital between generations we're thinking in our house what happens to all this seniors have no idea don't speak English nor Mandarin and usually mainstream media when they are reporting about coronavirus it's always in terms of English or Mandarin what bank again we cut so and we thought actually outside the nursing home that expecting seniors will also benefit it's only when they protect themselves that you know the society becomes safer [Music] another community group takes that message out of the streets I lay one month right but the mother remember this is operation hands on volunteers go from door to door in HDB Estates handing out masks in hand sanitizers they also educate seniors about the virus with the help of Eugene and skis dialect videos d'Alene live has himself been affected by the virus fallout he runs a business organising enrichment courses for school students but such activities have been canceled due to virus precautions with business down d'Alene and his staff are instead doing their part in the community they are also concerned why everyone is wearing masks and they feel that there is a level of insecurity when they don't have any mass so that's where this campaign operation hands-on came about because they received a lot of news from their children and again in from their grandchildren from their peers and realised that they are very confused with the news son even thought that they were allowed their kisses in Singapore so this was a society is to educate them is really about assuring the elderly [Music] seems like these are being repeated across the island as citizens step up and rally together against a new silent and dangerous enemy if every one of us do a one-time rather make big or small ways this later parts that we play to strengthen the country resilient and I always believed that no virus is stronger than the nation unity and how can we have a phrase to say I'd say I'd say Mike yeah all right so which means to stay calm all right don't panic I think that's that would be a first kind of best response right though to see how each other's can work with one another in order to ensure that we come of this together stronger as Singaporeans businesses on their own accord have come up with creative and quite moving solutions right hailing operator Graham as a new service for healthcare professions it's to help them get an easier ride from hospital to home Gabriel Cove is one of the four thousand drivers that have signed up we do here you know some health care workers sharing that they may have a difficult time getting right home and so on so I hope I'm able to do my part and bring them home safely I really hope that our the public do not dis discriminate them and appreciate what they have done and let's do this together as a nation we'll be able to get through this tough time together and during such times there's extra attention to hygiene it might take a little extra time and effort but Gabriel says it's worth it oh the feeling sure you know it's always happy that are you're able to contribute to the society the feeling of being able I mean to be part of the welfare program is fantastic seriously while healthcare workers keep their morale up on the front line there's also a heightened response from a different group of medical workers of the three genes now dunno which ones we would choose as the final the best candidate now for us is the our DRG acumen is a singapore-based biotech company they develop genetic molecular diagnostic tools to help hospitals test for illnesses like sepsis but now the focus is on coming up with test kits for kovat 19 it's part of the international scientific community's response after Chinese scientists completed the virus genome sequence and shared it with the world as soon as we got all the raw materials in including running tests through the night up to like 3:00 a.m. and the weekends as well within three weeks dr. Hong and her team had developed a test kit this is a sample that is provided to us extracted by another lab in the hospital and provided to us it is taken from the throat as a throat swab we will start to introduce the sample into the reaction plate and then it will be introduced to the Machine for analysis [Music] we hope to manufacture about 200,000 tests starting with the first batch of 40,000 dr. odd is also exporting the kits to countries in need it's one of at least three Singapore made kits to test for the virus the leaders from the government sector the businesses the R&D sector the innovation sector are all coming together we are all addressing the issue with the right tools such as technology medical knowledge so I think the public education as well as these tools that we have will allow us to not panic and be able to contain it successfully we continuously adjust our risk assessment based on global and regional developments and adjust our measures accordingly we will not hesitate to take further decisive measures to keep Singapore safe as the situation warrants Singapore will survive this we'll get through this together only time will tell when the war against this new virus will end but keeping spirits high is the belief that together we will be stronger [Music] [Music] [Music] ",True,True,True,True

 and it was something I had to do I can't change the world Maybe I can help one person at a time Taking care of animals
 is something I'd do for the rest of my life We're happy for them
 when they've found a home They're happy
 when they receive that packed meal That joy is priceless I don't think I'm doing anything noble It's so pretty! I'm happy! To bring comfort, joy... and closure for patients I think companionship is the greatest gift (In corners where most people
 don't pay attention to,) (they devote themselves
 to helping others day after day) (With love and warmth,) (they paint...) (the most heart-warming picture of life) (Bedok Reservoir Road) It's past 9 pm, but in the east region of the island, there's a group of people... working hard for the community There are 20 to 30 people
 throughout the day... who come downstairs to spend some time here Senior Resident's Corner is a familiar sight
 in any community in Singapore But this one here
 must have some unique appeal... for it to have this much popularity every day Before the pandemic, we can entertain 50 to 100 people... in our corner But due to the restrictions in the pandemic, we try to keep the capacity down
 to only four to eight people Many seniors think they are useless... because they can't do much in their old age They're showing signs of mild depression Our Senior Resident's Corner
 is a place to cheer them up... and make them feel useful again I find a lot of work for them I ""bully"" the seniors Tonight, the people who are ""bullied""... into packing Lunar New Year gift bags
 for low-income families... include not only seniors, but also children
 and fellow citizens of other ethnicities The lady who jokingly said
 she ""bullied"" people... is Sandy Goh, who is also lovingly referred to as ""Sis""
 by the residents That's what Sandy is like.
 She's quite a fun person She helps people like us who need help So many of us know her She helps people like that If she has something coming, food or anything, she'll give us She looks after us I live on my own. She's helped me a lot I even asked for her help when I lost my IC She accompanied me to the police station... to make a report One time, I couldn't turn on the lights... and found that a short circuit had happened How would I know what to do? It was after 10 pm, but she asked her husband to fix it for me Another well-known figure
 among the residents... is Sandy's husband, Cheah Kok Hwa He's a handyman in the community Also, on important festivals
 of different ethnicities or religions, he'll create festivity for the residents The God of Wealth,
 the ox and those lights... are all my creations I would work until 10 pm I'd work for a few hours before I go home He worked like that for over half a month Tonight, he can finally
 display this golden ox, which symbolizes trailblazing,
 bravery and strength It took me over a week
 to work out the design of the ox I had some residents... who helped me after work Everything is done here
 in the kampong spirit - working together The practice of making
 Lunar New Year light decorations... has been going on for 10 years But the members of this lovely kampong... are not only the locals Take this. I'm going to grab the cables Auntie helps us One day, I was bringing something bulky... upstairs on my own It was very heavy for one person Auntie came to help me carry it up Farhad, the supervisor
 of sanitary work in the community, met Sandy soon after
 he started working here over a year ago Since then, he and his colleagues
 have often been treated with food and drinks They even get to share the food
 in the community fridge He wants to repay Sandy for all her help We enjoy helping Auntie... with decoration and everything We also want to know how to decorate I asked Auntie if she needed help That's why I come and help Auntie It's dark outside Most people are ready to drift off to dream, but not this person who just left work I'm going to a cemetery in the west There is a group of unneutered dogs We're going to capture the female dog... that gave birth
 to two puppies a few months ago, a male and a female Today, we'll try to capture the mother
 or the female puppy Low Fan Zhe has been a volunteer
 of Action for Singapore Dogs... for five years He captures stray dogs to neuter them... so as to prevent them from overbreeding Some issues may arise
 if there are too many dogs Firstly, many male dogs
 go after the same female dog... and it mostly ends in fights When they fight, they'll be injured Sometimes, their injuries... can be fatal without any treatment Secondly, with more dogs in the same area, there may be a food shortage Fights will break out too
 due to food shortage They may fight over food Hey, bro  -Hey, Jimmy Not familiar with the stray dogs in the area, Fan Zhe asked for the help
 of two fellow volunteers... who knew this area well We're going to set up the trap door and food And the battery By wiring up the cage
 that is already in place, the volunteers can watch it from afar... and remotely control the door... to trap stray dogs
 that come to eat inside the cage I'm turning it on  -Do it All right Before tonight, the volunteers have placed food
 inside the cage for a few nights... to lower the stray dogs' guard We stop feeding them... before we set out to catch them Because after a day without food, they'll get hungry... and go inside the cage themselves If you feed them today, you won't catch them with the cage Teng Bang Wei has got a number of dogs
 in the area neutered Having been feeding them
 for the last seven years, he can identify tonight's targets... by the dogs' appearances I don't know which one it is. I can't see It could be Mr Brown, which is neutered This is the female puppy We can catch it any time Now we wait for it to go in It's here Okay. Stand by  - I'm waiting over here I can see it  - Do you see it? Okay. Press it when you're ready I come down to see you every Saturday Residents who come to have a chat
 or ask for help... are a common sight here... no matter what time of the day it is It all began nine years ago... when Sandy started helping residents... with reading letters from the Government
 and filling forms She's been doing the same thing since then At first, I only came down... three nights a week Now I pretty much hang around here every day This became kind of an SOS centre Why? We have many seniors
 living on their own If they fall down in the middle of the night,
 they'll call us for help Sometimes, if a senior living on their own
 is injured and has difficulties cooking, I'll prepare meals for them Through Sandy's arrangements, this corner for residents to hang out... gradually became a nursery,
 wheelchair rental spot, recreation centre and food distribution spot It's like a mini version of Community Club Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered free tuition... and free barbering service We even hosted small cooking classes... and outings for residents We also took... children from single-parent households... to ice-skating in Kallang We offered all sorts of activities This is our emergency food storage Anyone in need can come down... and ask us for some food any time Or they can apply through me Since last year, many people who got reduced salaries
 or became temporarily jobless... due to the pandemic... have benefitted
 from the food donated by charities... or residents in the neighbourhood Such service has tided them over
 their food insecurity Frankly, I don't get to help
 people in true poverty... because the Government
 and charities have that covered I'm only helping those in between They belong to
 the middle-income group or below, but they aren't so poor to the point... that they can't bounce back I just tide them over
 a difficult time. That's all This is the adoption and rescue centre
 of Action for Singapore Dogs... in Lim Chu Kang There are more than 70 dogs living here They are common in that
 they are all neutered... and have a terrible past Many are rescue dogs Stray dogs, injured dogs... or dogs that became disabled
 because of road accidents - we bring them all into our care As the main keeper at the centre, Tan Yen Yen is most familiar
 with the dogs' stories and personalities Some dogs like red meat... while some prefer chicken They are different So you have to remember
 their individual preferences? Of course You need to know what they like, how much they eat... and what they dislike If it's an overweight dog, you have to add egg white and vegetables
 to the feed for it Some dogs can't eat chicken
 because of allergy Then you have to feed pork to them Yen Yen is one of the four paid employees
 at Action for Singapore Dogs Taking good care of the dogs here
 is not only her duty, but also her way of loving them She's devoted to this job
 even during weekends and holidays, and she always starts working before dawn It's a rough job feeding them. You have to
 set out the bowls and collect them later If you don't do it when it's still dark,
 you'll sweat a lot from the heat This is a big premise Going up and down here
 can be quite exhausting Although she says it's a difficult job,
 she's been doing it for over a decade Including her years
 of feeding stray animals... in the area south of the Singapore River
 since her 20s, she's been involved with dogs
 for most of her life I started sneaking leftovers
 from home for dogs... when I was seven or eight years old My mother would beat me every morning I didn't understand why As I grew up,
 my love for dogs and cats grew I wanted to take care of them Respect for all lives
 and taking care of every furry friend... might not be understood by all people, but they have been the beliefs
 of Action for Singapore Dogs... since its inception in 2000 At first, we had the volunteers
 foster the dogs at their homes We had to try everything to raise money I remember at the beginning,
 we'd sell cakes... and odd trinkets,
 no matter how little the profit is Eventually, we gained public's support
 for our work... and we have a more stable funding It was Ricky Yeo's solo project at first Now, Action for Singapore Dogs
 has become... a relatively comprehensive
 non-profit organization, supported by around 20 dog lovers
 who work as volunteers They've also seen successes
 in advocating against animal euthanasia Most of the dogs in the centre
 are like Treasure here They were rescued from the brink of death It got hit by a lorry The worst thing was nobody tried to save it That lorry drove off after hitting it I remember it was during new year No one fed it in the new year... and it stayed there on the road
 for three days It had been staying under the sun
 with no one giving it any help When the volunteers found it
 three days later, Treasure was seriously injured
 in its lower body It survived after emergency treatment, but it lost its ability to walk Joe was rescued from a nearby clearing
 10 years ago It was caught by a wild boar trap... and lost one of its back legs With the meticulous care
 of the keepers and volunteers, Joe was nursed back to health
 and got adopted at one point However, it was sent back here
 after biting its owner It's been staying at the centre since then Of course it'd be best if someone
 would give it another chance We aren't giving up hope.
 We'll keep going one day at a time We hope that Joe will eventually find a home To improve the lives of stray dogs, three volunteers of Action for Singapore Dogs
 devote themselves... to catching stray dogs in remote clearings,
 forests or industrial areas... to get the dogs neutered It's unpredictable with stray dogs Pet dogs may live to 15 years old, while dogs living around factories
 may die after 7 to 10 years One of their targets tonight, a female puppy,
 has been hanging around the cage It usually takes them two to three hours
 before they go in They'd inch their way closer,
 but they wouldn't go in They'd go around the cage
 and still wouldn't go in They'd wait at the door It usually goes like that It's here Okay. Stand by  - I'm waiting over here I can see it  -Do you see it? Okay. Press it when you're ready There's another one there. I'm worried... There's another one coming We have two No more dogs I'm activating the trap Okay. Easy. Calm down Okay Calm down. Good girl The carrier Do you need two people in there? Okay. Good girl Let me cover its head Did you get hurt?  -No It was relatively simple just now It's still a puppy, so it doesn't have much experience
 with this thing Its mum has seen it before
 so she won't go in It'll be difficult to catch the mum But sometimes, the dogs
 will get agitated and fight back, putting the volunteers
 in danger of getting injured No  -You got it. Let me see The volunteers capture around
 15 to 20 stray dogs each month Over the years, Action for Singapore Dogs
 has neutered around 4,000 stray dogs... in Singapore The captured stray dogs... will be placed in a shelter
 of the organization, awaiting further sanitary procedure
 and quarantine arrangement Then we train it to get it accustomed
 to being around people... and living in a home environment So when the dogs leave the shelter, they'll become friendly and gentle We're happy for them
 when they've found a home This is another rescue centre
 of Action for Singapore Dogs... in Sungei Tengah It opened because the plot
 in Lim Chu Kang... will be repossessed by the Government
 by the end of the year... as part of the plan to centralize management
 of all animal welfare organizations In 2007, we established ARC, which is our adoption and rescue centre This factory can house around 100 dogs The place in Sungei Tengah... can house around 40 So in total, we take care
 of around 150 stray dogs... in our adoption and rescue centres They are our duty It certainly requires a lot of manpower
 and resources... to take good care of 150 dogs However, when compared to the 5,000
 to 8,000 stray dogs across the nation, it isn't hard to imagine
 how many stray dogs... are living rough on the streets They keep breeding,
 which is an issue that must be addressed So we've been advocating a solution
 for this issue to the Government, which is neutering the stray dogs Trap-neuter-return
 is a guaranteed effective method In 2018, in response to the call
 of animal welfare organizations, the Government launched
 the Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme By providing funding support, it's hoped that more than
 70% of the stray dogs in Singapore... will be sterilized over five years The dogs will be released
 or adopted afterwards As one of the pioneers
 among local animal welfare organizations, Action for Singapore Dogs
 has pushed for changes in the system... under the leadership of Ricky Yeo
 in the past 20 years The measure implemented in 2012... which allows HDB flat owners
 to adopt stray dogs... is viewed as an important milestone
 by many dog lovers The general perception then... was that stray dogs
 were dirty and aggressive We had to try to change that So we suggested taking it in stages, like starting with 50 dogs a year Of course we have to set down rules The dogs must be trained There will be fewer issues if they can behave Since their inception, Action for Singapore Dogs has found homes
 for over 3,000 stray dogs 500 of them have benefitted
 from this adoption scheme in HDB flats We screen our adopters... and fosterers very carefully For adoption, they would need... to meet the dog at least two times... before they're allowed to bring the dog home Zubi, sit Graphic designer Wendy Low... is the person in charge of
 adoption and foster care in the organization We make them walk the dog, spend time with them either at the kennels... or the fosterer's home... and we observe the interaction We'd advise accordingly... if we find that the adopter... is doing things that scare the dog Action for Singapore Dogs
 used to host outdoor adoption events... as their main way
 to seek new owners for trained stray dogs However, since the pandemic, potential adopters can only visit the dogs
 at the rescue centres or fosterers' homes... by making an appointment in advance Wendy Low is also a fosterer herself A year ago, she brought
 the then months-old Zubi home Zubi is a puppy rescued from... a recycle factory with a harsh environment
 by volunteer Low Fan Zhe When it was found, it was fighting over food
 with a bunch of grown-up dogs And its face was seriously swollen When he came to us, he had suffered some trauma, and a lot of his teeth were broken We're not sure what happened Could have been hit by something... or maybe he bit down on something hard The volunteers brought him to a vet The vet removed all his broken teeth But oral reconstructive surgery... can only be done after it grows up Usually, the dogs that are sent... to fosterers from the rescue centres... are dogs with special needs, like Zubi or Kangaroo Kangaroo has trouble walking
 due to a birth defect in its front legs It's an old acquaintance
 with many of the volunteers 10 years ago, it was brought
 to the rescue centre... by workers in a nearby factory
 when it was three years old Perhaps it's getting old In recent years, it has developed
 an unpredictable temper... because of chronic back pain Sometime at the end of last year, she was not doing very well So we sent her to the vet... to be checked up and then... She actually stayed there for quite a while After that we decided... we didn't want her to go back to the kennels As an office worker, Wendy tried to entrust Kangaroo
 to another fosterer But that person injured their lower back
 a few months after taking it in Remembering how Kangaroo... always warmly welcomed
 visitors to the rescue centre, Wendy decided to take care of it herself She is actually very easy to take care of And all she does need from me is for me to... bring her out to do her business twice a day And then her two meals a day... and treats in between And some loving, and she is a happy girl It's often said that every little bit helps It's especially true for those who have been
 struck hard by the harsh reality A helping hand can hold you steady... when you're about to fall These vegetables might only cost
 a few dozen dollars, but they can actually help a lot If you used to have a salary
 of $1,000 to $2,000... and you now earn 30% less, I want to try to help make up for it
 as much as I can For two to three times a month, this white lorry will be the hope
 of dozens of residents It'll carry around 200 to 300kg of gifts... to Bedok Reservoir Road Sandy has around 200 residents here... that need the food So we deliver vegetables and fruit
 to her every month Sandy made the arrangement... so that these blemished
 fruit and vegetables... can be ""rescued"" from wholesalers
 who would otherwise throw them away, and collected by
 Daniel Yap and other volunteers Since a year ago, such fruit and vegetables
 have been delivered to the estate regularly We need to save some for those in need Please share with everyone... and only take what you need Our beneficiaries
 are also volunteers themselves So besides their own portion, they might help bring some up
 for their neighbours or the families in need Each food sharing event
 benefits around 200 to 300 households Besides seniors living on their own, there are also people who became unemployed
 in the pandemic Some of them are temporarily out of work, but it's quite hard to find
 another one at their age So they may require some assistance
 in three to six months, but they can't apply for subsidies We aren't exactly low-income families We try to ease their burdens This is something we can try to do In other words, anyone in need, even if they're not from a low-income family,
 they'll be taken care of Some packages designed... by government agencies or charities... might not meet their actual needs For example,
 for a senior living on their own, it might take them three to six months
 to finish the food in that package But if it's a family
 of seven or eight people, the package won't last them long,
 making it awkward for many people So the way we do it here is... you can take however much you need Chong Chiou Foong
 is a young mother living in the estate She's one of the resident representatives
 recruited to help by Sandy She gets busy whenever
 they receive resources from vendors There are at least 20 to 30 households
 that need delivery... in these eight blocks alone There are Malays, Chinese, Indians,
 people with mobility issues, or seniors living on their own Some seniors can't go out
 or they can't find their way home So we usually ask them
 to wait for us at home Since the pandemic, the scaffolding business
 she manages with her husband has taken a hit Now Sandy is almost
 helping the residents full-time Her efforts through the years... have not only strengthened
 the bond between neighbours, but also inspired many residents to help Mr Hing lives at Block 701 He got food at our events... when he had some issues with his job Now he's doing well, so it's great He saw me riding my tricycle... to take a lot of goods... to the blocks around 709 and 710... to distribute to the families in need So he said, ""Why don't you let me help you?"" When Sandy calls, Lim Tian Hing will show up
 to the Senior Resident's Corner on time Then he'll cart the goods... to his elder brother's newspaper stall
 across the street... for the residents to take It can be vegetables, noodles, biscuits, chocolate, water, milk, etc. We may do it two to three times a week, sometimes four to five times It varies We just take the goods when she receives any Usually, Sandy would ask
 the resident representatives... to spread the news of food distribution So sometimes,
 there are residents waiting in line... before the cart even arrives And everything
 will be distributed before dark As the sun sets, Sandy sometimes takes this old lady home... with the tricycle she bought online 84-year-old Goh Cheng Hong
 has trouble walking, but she still walks a short distance
 every day on her cane... to the Senior Resident's Corner Luckily, the clinic is still open The clinic is open She took me to the clinic to see a doctor She told the doctor... that I am her mother Now Changi General Hospital calls her... for anything about me It happened three months ago Goh Cheng Hong was home alone Her chronic leg pain was bothering her again
 and she asked Sandy for help The two took this tricycle ""ambulance""... to see a doctor in a nearby clinic This corner eventually... became a corner offering emergency services She helps many others too, not just me It's her hobby Helping others is a good thing In time, everyone knows that... they can come to the corner
 when they have problems This is a cemetery in the west region There are around 60 to 70 dogs here The industrial area is further ahead There are lots of dogs there too For three to four nights a week, Low Fan Zhe goes to remote areas... to search for stray dogs
 that have not been neutered... or have not had dinner Up there  -Oh, that one People feed dogs
 because they want to help... so the stray dogs
 can at least have one meal If we don't feed them, the dogs might eat something dirty, or they might have to skip meals Sometimes, they might even starve Sometimes, we see dogs that are skin and bone There are many stray dogs here
 at this factory who need food Low Fan Zhe often comes to feed them
 after getting approval from the owner He's captured around 30 stray dogs here... and had them neutered in the past year It takes persistence and kindness... to keep feeding stray dogs But to rescue injured dogs, it requires determination
 and courage to risk injuries It's more time-sensitive
 when the dog is injured Stray dogs hardly have enough to eat... if not for the food given to them
 by dog lovers It's common to find
 injured dogs that need to be rescued... in harsh living environments Rescues must be done quickly and skilfully Less experienced people are prone to injuries You often get bitten by the dogs Another reason for injuries... might not have to do with the dogs,
 but the environment There might be trash
 or wooden boards with nails in there Bolt and Rocket are the dogs
 rescued from an industrial area... by Low Fan Zhe and Teng Bang Wei... after more than five hours of struggle When they were found, Bolt had a limp in his right back leg, while Rocket had serious inflammation
 in one of his ears... and required immediate treatment When we first found the two dogs, it was hiding under one of the containers Its ear was evidently wet It was possibly breeding
 so it was dirty and inflamed We could only use
 the most rudimentary way... and got it out with a stick The doctor diagnosed that
 Rocket's ear was bitten... while Bolt got its right hip dislocated
 possibly from a car accident It took $2500 for one operation The medical fees have doubled
 in the past five years A vet's visit used to cost only $50, but now it's $100 So we spend at least $10,000 a month
 on vet's visits Usually, a rescue dog
 needs a lot of money to get treated While they have funding support... from the Government's
 Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme, Action for Singapore Dogs still need
 to cover the rest of the costs Selling calendars
 is their most iconic regular activity From printing to marketing, everything is done by Jenny
 and three other volunteers They even distribute the calendars themselves
 instead of using a delivery service These are our 2021 calendars They used to be able
 to sell over 10,000 calendars a year, but it's hard to sell 7,000 in the pandemic Calendar sales make up... at least 40% of our income for the year It goes towards... the running of the two shelters... and medical fees We also help a lot of independent rescuers... with medical fees We will start this simple walk process We call it ""start, stop, change direction"" The volunteers
 of Action for Singapore Dogs... have worked hard in the past 20 years... to show the public that... even stray dogs can be your family They're also part of society When we established
 Action for Singapore Dogs 20 years ago, the public had a hard time accepting... the idea of treating your pet
 as a family member, especially the strays They believed stray dogs should be euthanized There have been a lot of changes
 over the past 20 years For your starting position, the front leg is aligned with your body To change the perception
 that stray dogs can't be tamed, Ricky Yeo acquired
 a professional licence in the UK... and gave up his
 software development career of 20 years... to become a full-time dog trainer
 nine years ago The dog walks nicely, without any reaction to anything No, he doesn't normally walk like that There you go He's given obedience training
 to over 1,000 dogs over the years, about half of which were stray dogs The class focuses on... teaching the owners
 how to lead their dogs... when they go for a walk, so that they can do it without a hitch... and people can see they're able
 to control their dogs If your dog is criss-crossing you, shorten the leash Down Usually, adopted dogs
 get complained a lot... because they keep barking and they're loud This class teaches the owners
 how to get their dogs to bark less, be quieter and stay calm Then down Okay, finally Are you ready, guys? Okay, let's walk Keep it steady Since the launch of the scheme in 2012, which allows HDB flat owners
 to adopt stray dogs, the complaints received from neighbours
 are relatively low at only 2% This shows that people feel more and more
 at ease with stray dogs It's also what the nameless heroes at
 Action for Singapore Dogs strives to achieve Shorten the leash Keep walking, don't stop. Good Taking care of animals
 is something I'd do for the rest of my life A world without animals
 would be no fun at all We're happy for them
 when they've found a home The life outside is still very harsh There are still many dogs out there My dream is that someday, we won't see as many stray dogs out there Then we can relax and retire But to achieve that goal,
 we still need to work hard To Sandy, the support
 from the residents and volunteers, and the smiles on the beneficiaries' faces... are her motivation... to keep bringing warmth to this community They have a satisfied look on their faces Very genuine in a way that... It's not a forced smile It gives me a sense of accomplishment Subtitles: Iyuno Media Group ",False,True,True,False

Estimating the odds of hospitalisations and deaths due to covid-19: https://econ.st/3fkL4cj",[Music] covid19 has proved to be one of the most virulent and disruptive viruses to have ever swept the world but the death toll is much worse than what is widely reported official statistics suggest that the virus has claimed around 3 million lives but a statistical model created by the economist calculates the number to be more than triple that it's likely that between 7 and thirteen million people have died as a result of the pandemic so why are our calculations so much higher than official statistics our data journalist andre ulvin solstad explained how it was done for the economist's podcast the jab sandra you've been researching the number of excess deaths since the pandemic began how accurate is the official death toll not very to be honest um it depends a lot on which country you are in uh for instance in america it's pretty accurate we think access deaths are about seven percent higher but in many developing countries the mismatch is enormous so according to our modeling the total account of excess death is about maybe three or four times um the official death toll that's quite an undercount i just wonder if you could step us through how you've calculated the uh your estimate for the real death toll of the pandemic so i think the first thing is to to know what excess deaths are so these are the deaths we observe compared to those we would expect in normal years now many countries account excess debts or count total debts and enabling us to calculate excess debts but most don't and so the challenge becomes estimating access that's where they are unknown you don't want to just sort of spit out a number and say here's the truth because the truth is you can't actually know the exact number of excess that's the data just doesn't exist so what we've done and invested a tremendous effort in doing is to provide ranges that capture the the variation that we think is possible but on those ones where there isn't good data i just wonder could you explain how you filled in those gaps well for one thing we used a whole lot of data so we tried to collect as much data as we could on all sorts of indicators so that if some data was missing at least we would have some other data that perhaps could fill in altogether we had 121 indicators in our models on everything from demography to geography to how much people moved around and so on we then did a few other things the first thing we did is that when data was missing we recorded it because there is information provided in a data point being missing it says something in itself the second thing we did was that we constructed indicators based on what was happening in nearby countries so if you don't know how much testing is going on in one country how much testing is going on in the countries around it might be indicative or at least give you some information another thing we did was that we we tried to do region averages so maybe countries in africa or countries in latin america tend to be similar in some ways enabling us to fill in the gaps where data was missing okay so based on your modeling the pandemics claimed around 10 million lives which parts of the world have been more or less effective than perhaps we've realized as one might expect the undercount is most severe in poor and middle-income countries in these places testing is less widespread mostly because it is expensive and that's something that officials there like to prioritize we also suspect that in some countries governments might not prioritize testing because it would reveal how bad the pandemic really is for instance in russia the excess deaths are about five times the official count moving it from a somewhat light-hit country uh to one of the most severely hit in europe and the world anyone watching can find out what our statistical model says about their part of the world by clicking on the link above it goes to an interactive map so andre are there parts of the world where excess deaths are actually lower than they would have been yes there are actually indeed places like that um where they have deficit deaths so the most most sort of straightforward are are australia and new zealand where the lack of a flu season and the lack of many deaths to covet mean that that's overall are down from last year there are also some countries in europe for instance norway where deaths are lower than one would expect probably again because of less transmission of infectious diseases and so give us some more examples of the kinds of countries that have been more overwhelmingly hit i mean the shape of the pandemic that is in the popular narrative is that there have been a couple of waves around the world and that for example now india is going through a very severe time in its second wave is that really what happened according to your modelling you don't think so um unfortunately there was no first and second wave but there's just been one enormous wave and then a further spike now that india descends into a tragedy what we found was that their pandemic hit of course china first but but then the rich world where that's where somewhat accurately reported after that it moved into the more isolated and less internationally connected developing countries causing mass amounts of deaths there um in indeed deaths have been rising for most of the past year and every month that is not total debts but that's per day what we're seeing now is another spike driven by what is happening in india where we think about 20 000 people die every day compared to about 4 000 which is the official tally what did your modelling tell you about the the about india itself is is india an outlier or is it something that we can expect to see more of in terms of the the rates of death and the rates of infection unfortunately india is is not an outlier actually many countries are modeling suggests have been much harder hit than india for instance peru which is one of the worst hit in the world i've seen deaths per person or per million population about 2.5 times what we currently estimate is the case in india what we instead think is happening is that india is it's just something that we probably should expect has the experience of this pandemic been different in the rich world versus the poor world in terms of how the populations are structured in those countries and therefore how many deaths have occurred the overall story of the pandemic as revealed by these models fits well with what we now know about the disease how easily it spreads and who it kills that's have been relatively high in rich countries including europe and america and canada and so on but the reason for this we believe is that the disease is just extremely dependent on age old people die at much much higher rates than young people one of the things for instance that we did was that we calculated the expected infection fatality rate on a country-by-country basis based on their population so this would be taking a random person off of that country or from that country looking at their age and gender and then looking at what tends to happen of people with similar age and gender in the rich country if you start adjusting for demography in this way you find that the disease would be about 10 times more deadly in italy than in uganda because uganda's population is just that much younger so what is probably happening is is that these countries have somewhat comparable death rates simply because they're so young likely infections are much more widespread there and that's the reason why the numbers become comparable because if they were not a lot fewer people would die i'm sandra alvan solstad a data journalist at the economist you can read more about our model and what we find by clicking the link thanks for watching you

This week the number of recorded cases passed 300,000 a day, along with more than 2,000 deaths - which is close to twice the daily deaths India experienced during the first peak of the virus between July and September 2020. 
Hospitals in Delhi have now issued SOS alerts on Friday, saying they had only a few hours’ supply of oxygen left and pleading for government help, while social media was flooded with requests for oxygen cylinders, shared by people seeking urgent care for their relatives.

India, the world's second most populous nation, has confirmed 16 million cases so far, second only to the US. The country's real death toll from the virus is thought to be significantly higher than official figures, amid reports of some state governments fudging data, and crematorium equipment in some states melting due to the constant heat of fires burning day and night.

#BBCNews",north korean state media is reporting the country's leader kim jong-un berating top officials over lapses which caused an unspecified great crisis related to coronavirus in a politburo meeting kim accused party executives of neglect of duty including failing to implement important long-term measures to fight the pandemic one report suggesting a number of senior officials have been replaced now this is a rare sign of the pandemic severity in north korea which previously insisted it had no covert classes although that is a claim that has been doubted by many i've been speaking to dr edward hall who is a lecturer in north korean politics at oxford university he said it was highly likely this meeting was called because of a possible outbreak of covert in the country it's quite clear that the narrative that north korea has um disseminated for the past year that it's the land of the covet-free um is rapidly disintegrating whilst the state has not been particularly specific in terms of the nature of this covet related threat um it's highly likely that we are starting to see signs of covid um infiltrating into north korea and the implications of this on um the north korean people but also uh on the ability of the north korean infrastructure to cope is also particularly worrying at a time when kim jong-un himself has admitted that he has been unable to fulfill his five-year economic plan and also his emphasis on improving the economic situation for the people in the country edward was had the authorities in north korea done to try and keep covert out up until now so we've seen um regular testing we've seen state media broadcast um people getting their temperatures checked you know and move towards online learning for instance um at schools and universities but obviously this is the image that north korea wants to project to the outside world i guess what's particularly interesting is will north korea ask for help because south korea has offered to send vaccines to the north in the past and north korea has simply not replied so he's now going to be are we going to see a turning point where pyongyang realizes that it has very little choice but to ask for international assistance because how about are the food shortages there at the moment edward so the food shortages from what we know um are becoming increasingly severe it's a combination both of meteorological problems typhoons last year but also largely to do with the fact that north korea was one of the first countries in the world to um close its borders and it closed its border with china and trade between china and north korea has declined by 1775 which has had a huge deleterious impact on the economy and why are people in north korea expressing their concern over the health of kim jong-un i think first and foremost um the claim that he is emaciated is a little bit hyperbolic i mean it's quite clear he has lost weight um i think secondly um obviously kim has co-morbidities um he's very much obese we've seen the fact in the past kim take time off i'm out of public view um and perhaps one reason could be because of his fear of catching covet um i also think this has big implications in terms of domestic governance as well and as a slimmer healthier kim i'm quoting quite healthier kim what could this mean in terms of how he governs domestically could it be a way of him trying to say that the economic situation is also affecting everyone and he wants to be seen as a man of the people even though this may not be close to the actual truth ,True,False,False,False

#BBCNews",malaysia has gone into a strict nationwide lockdown as coronavirus infections rise it's the latest country in southeast asia to strengthen restrictions as more transmissible variants of the virus sweep the region and vaccination rates remain low while only essential businesses are open most schools have been closed and people can only go out for necessities malaysia has reported more than 7 000 new infections in just the past 24 hours and deaths that occurred in just the last month make up almost half of the country's official death toll we'll hear some reaction from malaysians to the restrictions imposed i think even with the new restrictions the airports are still open so there's still a potential that covet can spread while people are struggling under the lockdown the lockdown has been imposed too late for me it should have been imposed during ramadan when there were fewer cases and people didn't move around as much well our southeast asia correspondent jonathan head sent us this update well malaysians are wearily contemplating going back to the very strict lockdown they experienced in the early weeks of the pandemic last year it means that to all intents and purposes all public life is shut down shopping malls are shut people can only leave their homes if they have to just two people at a time and they cannot travel more than 10 kilometers from those homes there will be police road blocks 800 of them around the country enforcing these very strict movement control orders um it's bound to have a bad effect on the economy it's a step the government of malaysia did not want to take and they had been hoping for something of an economic rebound after seeing the economy shrink by five and a half percent last year but they are dealing with covered case numbers going up much much faster than they experienced last year to give you an idea uh by the end of last year total covert cases had reached just over 100 000 in malaysia in nine months they've gone up now to well over five hundred thousand in just the first five months of this year for the first time last month they experienced more than one thousand deaths this is a trend that is worrying even though malaysia has a relatively well-resourced health system its intensive care units are not now near capacity and what's worrying people is how long will this lockdown last it's supposed to be for two weeks but no one knows given the much higher infection rates now whether those two weeks will be enough but overhanging what malaysia is going through is a much bigger problem which which is that it cannot get enough vaccines to get enough of its population vaccinated so far it's only vaccinated three and a half percent of the population fully around six percent with one dose and even that's much better than neighbors like thailand and vietnam which have barely begun vaccinating a lot of that is simply because like so many countries you just can't buy enough vaccine the malaysians have been buying from many many different sources this whole region had far fewer infections last year than most of the rest of the world and here in thailand and in vietnam they did remarkably well at containing covid getting case numbers down almost to zero and they assumed they had more time they too are seeing very rapid increases in covert infections now and they're having to build up their vaccine programs as fast as they can ,True,False,False,False
109,e5PwxTS049E,India Today,Coronavirus Crisis: Why Govt Delayed Distribution Of Foreign Covid Aid?,2021-05-04T11:46:43Z,"Around 40 nations across the world announced that they would send medical supplies and assistance to help India deal with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has devastated many parts of the country.
The first consignments of medical supplies from foreign nations arrived in India on April 25 from Singapore. Since then, tonnes of foreign aid in the form of oxygen generators, concentrators and ventilators were received by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) officials in the past one week.
It, however, has come to light that while the first consignment of Covid-19 assistance arrived in India on April 25, the Centre took seven days to frame the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of distributing these life-saving medical supplies among states even as hospitals begged for oxygen and people succumbed to the deadly disease.

Telegram: https://t.me/indiatodayofficial",another very important story so a lot of foreign aid is coming into our country where is this aid going how is it being distributed there are reports of several delays india today has found that the health ministry took five days just to work out standard operating procedures for distribution of relief material and foreign aid now the ministry of health and family welfare notified the procedure to distribute the supplies to states on the 2nd of may aid had already come to come into india from the united kingdom on the 27th of april now the ministry delayed its response despite the fact that the prime minister opened the gates for receiving foreign aid as early as 26th of april during his conversation with u.s president joe biden and the question remains why wasn't the health ministry and other ministries who are working with the health ministry working on systems right from the 26th of april this delay did it not cause more lives india today is anand patel now joins me for more on the story and anand break this down for us the day aid started coming in there are reports that oxygen concentrators that should have been deployed immediately in hospitals in delhi in uttar pradesh in maharashtra in rajasthan and other parts of the country where they're so desperately required were they just lying at the go down and big halls at customs at cargo well gaurav what we have accessed is the uh sop sop which is the ministry of health and family welfare issued on the second second of may now this is exactly one week after the first aid came in that was from singapore singapore uh the ministry of external affairs has not mentioned about it in its official twitter handle it just says that our first aid came on the 27th but the supplies began as as early as 25th of april agara and on the 26th the prime minister himself spoke to u.s president joe biden welcoming all the foreign relief aid but despite that despite the head of the country asking for relief aid from foreign countries there was no sop it took one week for the ministry of health and family welfare to come up with the standard procedures as to how to allocate these supplies which are coming in thousands of tons oxygen cylinders oxygen generators ventilators all these are life-saving equipments and these were not being distributed as they came in because there was no sop there was no procedure there was no protocol now the government has come up with a press lease saying that no 30 uh around 31 states have gained uh from this around you know a dozen more hospitals have gained from the foreign supplies the list is therefore the dates are not there the government is not diverging as to when these supplies were sent across now the problem here is that the government took a lot of time to decide as to which agency will get do this it's only on the second that the government notified and designated the indian red cross society that it will be the official consignment it will receive all the foreign aid and then hand over to the ministry of health and family and health welfare which has appointed hll hll live care as its manager for distribution that was the company which was designated on the second of may wasting one week time crucial time when hundreds of people lost their lives and and that needs to be audited from the 27th of april uh to the second of may how many lives did we lose and why won these oxygen concentrators and oxygen generation plants immediately deployed at hospitals all it required was accounting these many came in these many destroyed you know deputed and put in various hospitals but keep tracking that story i will come back to you from ,True,True,False,False

Twitter: https://twitter.com/NewsX",as india battles a devastating second wave of coronavirus support from other countries continues to pour in the european union has expressed its solidarity while france and their leader emmanuel macron has said that the country stands with india against this struggle that seems to be sparing no one uk prime minister boris johnson said that they are looking at what they can do to help india out while health secretary matt hancock said that the country stands ready to help fight the virus and the chinese government has also extended its support while pakistani citizens have called to help india as well pakistan's high foundation wrote to prime minister narendra modi requesting permission to enter india in order to help people who are infected with the virus russia has also offered ram de saved and oxygen to india to fight the covet 19 pandemic the european union will uh obviously be uh discussing its support to india in the upcoming eu india leaders meeting on the 8th of may president of the european council charles michel said and i quote that the eu stands in solidarity with indian people amidst the resurgent covet 19 pandemic the fight against the virus is a common fight well we need help we need support and no denying that that india is uh been a country which uh during the low phase of covet 19 was extremely uh you know magnanimous in offering its help even exporting vaccine which is uh perhaps uh you know going to be found wanting in the next few days to come but we will cover that scenario as well we'll talk more about this joining me on the platform is padma shree dr sanjeev bhabhai chairman md of nephron we're also joined by dr roger liu associate professor social sciences department flame university he joins us all the way from pune ambassador bhaskar teemu khaji former diplomat will also be joining us joey tabasu editor of the sunday guardian is also going to be here dr bhagai you know we we can utilize and leverage all the help that we need and it's really heartening that uh you know at this point at this time when india is perhaps going through one of the worst phases medical crisis you know china and pakistan are arch enemies countries we have in fact you know sworn uh you know to in fact fight and oppose have also offered help what do you make of the situation right now and how badly is this requited support which is coming in from all across the world yeah i think uh we're talking of uh now saving humanity uh we are talking of saving lives uh we are talking of international collaborations right from the time the initial clinical research uh embarked on getting the genome of the virus in early part of 2020 down to the multinational intercontinental clinical trials which was again international collaboration we won't have had vaccines so quickly if it was not for the indian uh volunteers as uh clinical trial uh humans or in uk or in south africa or in brazil and so on uh likewise india has exported to more than 40 or 45 different countries uh millions of vaccines i think it would cross probably seven million vaccines to to countries which were less fortunate who didn't have the technology of the know-how anywhere close to getting a vaccine including to pakistan from syriam institute through the oxford link we've exported our ppe kits ventilators to the caribbean islands we've exported initially hydroxychloroquine to us so india has played its part as a as a global leader what is extremely important to understand that this virus is not of a particular or a center domain this has crossed all boundaries and no one is safe till everyone is safe uh we are in crisis of course we are in crisis uh there are 101 reasons medically and scientifically for it but i think if the globe doesn't rally again with the countries which are more vulnerable at that point of time uh then the entire universe is not going to come out of this pandemic uh we are in crisis now it is quite likely that maybe another country after a couple of months who may sink again and because that's the nature of this pandemic it lasts for a couple of years and it has troughs and it peaks so we are in the trough now and i think whatever help which comes is most welcome uh it's a question of saving human lives uh there is nothing more important than life because if you're dead you're gone and uh it's not only the oxygen but i think it's more of a moral solidarity it's a it's a human being to human being solidarity and it's much appreciated absolutely absolutely and joatha dr bagai made a very important statement that it's not only about helping india it's about saving humanity now you know countries we have had differences with have offered their help and countries we have thought would be our allies would support us through thick and thin have blatantly refused uh you know to give us help the united states has said that american lives are more important than indian lives but at the same time you know it's only an adversity joytha and i hope you concur it's only in adversity you get to know who your friends are uh well vinny in fact if you look at that statement that came from the spokesman the u.s spokesman it was extremely offensive he said something like you know saving american lives is important saving american lives is important for the world you know i mean as if saving not every life is important for the world that it's saving american lives is important for the world so if this is the kind of thought process that the us has so what exactly are we talking about what kind of values i mean why is the u.s holding vaccines why is uh the u.s is holding raw materials and you see i mean they're saying that they are worried that there may be a third wave and possibly there will be a third wave but you see now the world is interconnected we cannot be like china nobody can be like china but they shut off all communication uh with the rest of the world they will hunt you down and in fact we don't even know what they have done to their own citizens i mean i mean i would say exterminated is a possible word that you can use for what china has done to its people people who were actually initially affected by the vitals perhaps millions of them were literally exterminated so the whole point is you see we nobody none of us can be like china so each and every country in the free world is vulnerable so you say this is the time if you are not going to stand together this is the time what is going to happen is that you see today the us is in a position i mean tomorrow that nobody is going to help the us i mean nobody is going to take the us seriously and u.s thinks in terms of becoming the world leader i mean frankly this is no way of i mean country which claims to be the world leader behaves i mean this is totally i mean the kind of statement that came yesterday was shocking to say the least absolutely and ambassador we keep you know childing and admonishing pakistan even they have offered help not that we really seek pakistan's help at this point in time but the bottom line ambassador mukherjee is that is is that it's the thought that counts not necessarily so the action and the follow through it's the thought also that counts which was obviously opposed by the united states your thoughts on this grave crisis we find ourselves in and you know the kind of help that we should be soliciting but thank you actually it is not the pakistan government that offered to help but an ngo based in karachi there is a distinction uh between an ngo and a government uh to the best of my knowledge and i do follow news very carefully i'm sure you do it better than me there has been no official sometimes you know concern uh can come with a secret uh love for us or a kind of a bloating that this is where india finds itself after talking about its vaccine diplomacy that is the way i would also categorize the some of the remarks that have come from the chinese and nothing could be making the chinese government happier than to hear critical remarks from india about the manner in which united states has behaved and i agreed with joytha that the language was very offensive because if the united states wants to build up a new uh western alliance against those who are inemical to the west headed by china then suddenly their response to india was inhumane and also out of tune with the politics of the time there is always a way to convey a message it can be conveyed one-to-one uh the public utterances could be completely different having said that let's face one thing vineeth that when we went into this corona crisis and we thought we were coming out of it a large number of indians and i have observed them in delhi where i live thought that corona was behind us and behaved in a manner which was completely irresponsible without a mask saying that young people will not be affected etc so you know we cannot completely whitewash responsibility from ourselves as a society and as a nation for the situation that we find ourselves in today as far as health is concerned health today in an interconnected world is never solicited health should come from countries that are friendly naturally when they see the kind of horrific scenes that are being paid played out on television channels including yours it would be natural for india's friends and allies to want to help to not want to see people gasped and choked to death so we are grateful to the to the germans we are grateful to the to the uk uh we we uh have uh never said that we do not want even those who are sitting on our territory as the chinese are if they now wish uh to make superficial gestures of friendship and say that they are willing to help us please remember where the virus also came from but we have not said anything impolite to them as far as pakistan is concerned please remember that whenever there have been earthquakes or any disaster in pakistan india has been the first to offer help and have sent help so it's quite normal for neighboring countries to have a code of conduct but what is most disturbing is that how and who will tell president biden that this is not the time to let down india a second time india was let down in 1962 because the west did not come to its help now india is a different india and india and indian public opinion was of the opinion that a strategic partnership with united states the quad the indo-pacific is the need of the hour at india's hour of dire need if the united states behaves in this insensitive and ungenerous way speaking about american lives mattering not just to america but to the world as if indian lives don't matter either to india out of the world then certainly it's a very big step back to a huge new political and international relation system that was being carefully stitched into place as to how i see the future veneed i see it first black marketing within india has to stop the government has to take full control of delivery of oxygen supplies to hospitals people who are doing black marketeering have to be dealt with with an iron hand as if the country is at war if necessary a national health emergency should be declared and we must solve this issue sitting by ourselves as indians with indian resources as much as we can because we have long past the stage when we need to solicit help from anyone we don't solicit help but help should be offered by our friends and partners when they when it is not offered then we should remember those lessons of history and also remember as legal said that if we don't remember those lessons of history history has a habit of repeating itself absolutely man i completely concur with you and dr liu taking a leaf out of what basically said that you know it's going to be a mistake for any country to uh you know take india for granted it's going to be a mistake even for the united states to think that's the same india it denied help and support to they did help out in 62 but it was too late by the time heavily and and it's going to be a different india and a very different reaction from the one that we had in 1962 if countries don't realize that india is not going to take this lack of an initiative in terms of helping us out in a crisis situation lying down yes um i agree i totally agree with the best monkey that i don't think i think it's very unwise for the united states to say such a word in such a time because um quad well when they are talking about quad actually they need help from the indian side but when it when india needs help well if the united states just expressed such a statement that is not very this is not what friends do uh in the time of crisis um well what i can share with you is that the people in taiwan and the government and all the people in taiwan care very much about the second wave rise of the kobe 19 situation that is taking place for now and well we keeping high concerns for now and um our hearts are with the indian people as well um well i'm not a government so i cannot speak for a government but i believe i i firmly believe that the government and the people from different sites are working closely on that because what i can share with you is that well last year since last year indian taiwan has been working closely in last april when um there is a need for the ppe's or other masks well taiwan has acquired some of the ppes and send it to india and later the two government and the people actually has been working on the traditional medicines and explore the ways to cure kobe 19. and all the after that there are several medical collaborations going on between the two countries so i believe that for now the people must be working on that but well because this is a government to government issue so it takes government and it needs political momentum to do that i would like to indicate very important point is that well if we see the cases that how we got the oxygens from israel or germany it is the iaf carriers it is a c-17 carrier sent out by the indian air forces on the directory of the indian government to do that so it it that being said it is a government to government affair so we have to acquire the government to work together but we have to remember there is a tested one china policy there so this has been posed a hurdle there so i think uh for india and taiwan they should work together quickly to uh find a way out to support each other on this crisis dr baghi india has always been more than eager i'll alacrity to help out other countries uh you know has been healed throughout the world perhaps it's also you know time now to revisit uh you know that stand we have helped out countries and now we are facing the brunt for it and when we are seeking out help you know we are getting a hot and cold response and a national health emergency is perhaps going to put to rest what we need to prioritize at this point in time and in the future and in your analysis as well sir we have spoken a number of times this is not the end of covet we have to brace ourselves for you know many more resurgence coming in the future okay so uh there are two parts to your question one is uh within the indian uh domain and second is that more international platform i think within the indian domain uh i've spoken on this earlier we need to use and leverage technology to the maximum we have that avenue readily available we need complete digitalization of seamlessly integrated supply chain management i would be very very foolish to believe that it can't be done it can be done it's been done in different parts but we need it integrated how can you reach a bottleneck and say that now there are no tankers or there is no oxygen i mean that is very naive and very careless of the administration i don't care a damn or whether it's the central government or the state government they're ill human beings and those human beings are there because they know what the responsibility is and i'm sure you declare if they can't fulfill the responsibility then they should leave the chair if they don't leave the chair the public will make them leave that chair and i think it's better if this message reaches between their ears very quickly uh you can't let human beings die 20 people died in jaipur golden batra hospital max gangaram and all these hospitals hospitals how can you ask critical patients which are oxygen dependent on ventilator say find alternative arrangement does any of the elected politicians or bureaucrats or bubbles know what it means to take a sick 80 90 year old father or mother in an ambulance who's gasping that's if the ambulance is available it's a crying shame to let human beings be treated in this manner so one is of course the technology part which needs to be leveraged uh the second is we need a complete re-look at our national health policy i think each state is working in separate fortresses much like marajas and marandi's i think that era is gone kobet will make indians not forget many things let me tell you that talking at a larger international level i think countries are not going to be living in silos anymore uh and uh there is a nature and law of nature although uh what goes up also comes down um us is no longer uh arching power which had enjoyed in 60s 70s 80s and 90s there are a lot of other countries which are made more epic progress than them i'll turn the clock back just two months back their own patients were dying on new york streets in california streets right and they are supposed to be the pioneers of healthcare in the world so they've done not much better but having said that they up 5.4 vaccines per person canada 9.2 vaccines per person that's the illogical manner in which they have rationed and stored and folded vaccines that itself tells you how much they care for the world well if you don't care for the world the world is not going to be caring for you much longer and with regards to the local coming back to the local local domain uh being in health care now for close to 40 years i think health is not an investment any longer which people feel that let's show a small little carrot and walk away this is something in which you will save expected of the government public health is the only way forward for you to become a prosperous country imagine saving five rupees not spending it on public health and spending 500 rupees a month later because of complication money is going from the expected the other thing is we have to make health insurance completely compulsive you can take a car and i'll take two minutes more beneath you can take a car from a showroom and not drive it out under something have a comprehensive third party insurance payroll tax and all other compulsory mandatory taxes how can a human being be born into this world and the family have no health insurance people are spending five acts on a hospital building and they don't have insurance i think insurance is the only way forward in which you can safeguard help of a nation and the most important thing is and i've said this again very often because this is something which is very dear to my heart all all of india so far has been relying on reports predictions projections uh virology studies of john hopkins mayo stanford howard we need an international level public health institution in india which acts as a pandemic and epidemic alert center for any future pandemic staff it will be foolhardy and extremely forced not to do that and do it right now we need our own r d because our uh our epidemiological profile and disease profiles and biology profiles are entirely different and i'm pretty sure because what i have seen and heard uh of what this present government is doing i'm completely a political i'm pretty sure that these things are going to happen in the next uh few months if not within a year i think our hands are tied and our feets are tight because people are dying all around us uh but in the end what i would like to say is there is nothing more valuable than human life if any country feels that they can dominate because they were x y or z in the past years well forget the history uh the future will not forgive you absolutely i completely concur with you a number of uh excellent points made by dr bhagai but the fact of the matter is that in your opinion do you think that geopolitics will also be affected with the kind of sea change of responses and changes that we can anticipate after the u.s denied us help uh i will tell you i think in this case there is something else also at play big pharma because you see india is so capable of making vaccines and they're really cheap vaccines you know india is the vaccine manufacturer of the world i mean so the whole point is you see if you are going to block indian manufacturing you are going to make things inconvenient for the indian manufacturer what happens is that the world of will have to turn to the more expensive vaccines that are being manufactured by big pharma and the us-based and the western big pharma so you see this is something that they are trying to do so i am certain a lot of lobbying is has also uh gone into it i am certain that the us is pretty sure and uh certain about the quad but the way it is going about it the way it is trying to arm twist us in fact the way it is trying to i would say um twist the poor people i mean the poorer countries of the world i mean that is it shows some kind of a very cynical uh i mean approach to geopolitics that the fact you see ultimately for us what matters is that we cannot even depend on we cannot depend on a supply chain from china we cannot even depend on our supply chain from u.s what we need is that we need to be self-sufficient so can we do that i think we can do that okay we've almost run out of time i'm going to take a quick concluding comments from abbas mukherjee and dr liu and then we're going to wrap up the program ambassador mukherjee i'm coming to you well i just wanted to conclude by saying that this is a wake-up call for the uh for india and for indians and the indian government that we need to be self-sufficient we need to understand as joyta said that when business and big pharma demands indian lives don't matter because what matters is a profit margin of big multinationals this is something we should remember and we should also remember that in our haste to help others we should first make sure that we have enough for ourselves that is something that if in in case we ever forget that and you know diplomats never forget that by the way i've never forgotten it we have to first we have to first make sure we have enough for everyone in india before we offer anything outside even if it's not a nice gesture we have to always mentally think that indian lives matter first because if others say their lives matter first then we are in india we are indians and indian lives should matter first so this is a wake up call for all of us but i am deeply deeply disappointed by the american reaction we need and i can tell you one thing this is going to have a devastating effect unless they quickly rectify their stand this is going to have a devastating effect on that strategic partnership because the optics of it look terrible not just here but in social media and worldwide and to those who are opposed to india's closeness with the united states so they need to quickly rethink what they said all right thank you i have to leave so no thank you for having me on your show thank you thank you ma'am and dr liu 30 seconds for you and then we wrap up we've already run out of time talk to you well the taiwan is harder with the indian people so i believe very soon we will see things to be done between india and taiwan to combat kobe 19. and now two things are being done for now first india and dale are working to use ai to detect uh the spread of the kovi 19 so i think we will have some some things and the second thing is that the the traditional medicine collaboration between the iu verdict and the taiwanese medicine is also going on and very soon we are going to commercialize this so um i think i believe very soon we will see more and more being done between india and thailand and we are always be with you absolutely and considering the track record and the uh you know brilliant uh efficacy that taiwan has shown against the virus uh you know we definitely could leverage help from taiwan as well dr bagai joytabasu dr liu appreciate you joining us and giving us your important perspective on this grave crisis that the country finds itself in we're going to dip into a very minuscule break our rolling coverage uh covering the secured crisis in the country for more such videos subscribe to the news x youtube channel hit the bell icon

the company is no expense I just need to put in effort to train young people so I've approached some companies myself so some of them are prepared to take ten twenty one people from prepared to take 50 and I think we want to add it all up your University and polytechnics each of them have a few thousand industry contacts and they will also help reach out so you want to build up this traineeship pool so it's like a long internship at this time you get to do more work you will offer use something to get into to spend your year meaningfully you know right now it's just very very hard especially for this industry and we have mentioned that this virus may never go away so unless it is a job to me this was three minutes of trade uh so this actually means that the tourism industry is going to be very heat hot here because like travel as much so should I continue with these or should I switch okay I my advice is this you must be open-minded about something you must be stubborn about other things yeah well should you be open-minded about is the sector you get into yeah if not tourism another sector be open-minded about it don't be stubborn about it don't be just say I go and work you know HR in a hotel or nothing else and if they turned you down there you go no job you know so you must be open-minded manufacturing sector hiring HR where you consider you must be open-minded grab the opportunity whenever you have it because some of them are still hiring what should you be stubborn about you should be stubborn about your specialty what is it that you have learned in your current course that makes you strong in certain area and for us hospitality so within hospitality you must have done something could be empathy could be the way you treat people could be the way you work in teams could be the way you just able to deliver very good customer service wherever you speak to right so these are strengths that is not just needed in the tourism industry so be stubborn about that so if you are clear about your skill and your specialty you also find that you are more open minded in applying that skill in other contexts the IH ELLs have have come up with three modules for everybody so I will also advise if jobs is hard to get if you apply for traineeship and you still can't get the fall back is really take up some of this CET modules big modules that is a bit outside of your comfort zone yeah for example let's say you a new engineer right so you may want to take something that is art related you know so that you expand your repertoire and your skills base let's make you a bit more versatile you can do Advanced Diploma but more importantly is when you do Advanced Diploma what subject do you want what is the thing do you want to go into it must be able to add to your portfolio must add to your CV yeah there is this more important what are you thinking of okay whoever still don't know how to code in Python you want to spend your time meaningfully going that I have been trying to sign up for Python but I have not had time so something I really wish to do yeah something I really wish to do I think of it 19 is very unfortunate a fact that the whole world but like all crisis it will pass so you come into the job market at this time some say is unlucky some say is lucky and lucky because hot harder to find job lucky because when you are older and you look back this is a kind of experience that differentiate you know from every batch of graduates you are that graduate that come into covet 19 and you have a chance now to fight it and if you make use of your time well in time to come when you overcome it this is an extra story you can tell this an extra gem that can be in your CV and one of the best use of my time of your time do some social work yeah it doesn't pay but I wanted catch up with your work help one family with the old folk to deliver food and check in on the old folk from time to time and all this will be meaningful in time to come we will rebound we are bounce back and the labor market will start becoming vibrant again so I hope everybody take care of yourself send my regards to your family yeah okay stay healthy all right bye [Music] you ,True,True,True,True

Each junior college will have one career counsellor, and secondary schools will have one counsellor supporting two schools -- up from a ratio of one counsellor to four schools. It's part of efforts to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable students and their families. The ministry is also looking to improve the quality of education by posting more teaching leaders to schools.

Healthcare workers and the elderly are the first in line. The vaccines from AstraZeneca and Oxford University have been donated by India. China has also promised to provide 300,000 doses of its own vaccine. State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi has urged the public to remain vigilant even as inoculations begin. The country managed to contain the pandemic early on, but is now battling a second wave of infections.

Instagram: https://instagram.com/sofiawellness","today I would like to share with you five tips for managing stress and anxiety during the coronavirus period right now we are all dealing with a lot we are struggling with fears of economic loss the fears of being infected and also having concerns for our loved ones as well being confined in one place has also taken a toll on us we are unable to conduct our day-to-day activities such as going to shopping from basic necessities and the reduced physical and social contact is also making us feel very isolated which is all very distressing in the long term Esther Perel describes what we are experiencing right now as prolonged uncertainty the sense of feeling uncertain and also not knowing when the sense of uncertainty is going to end David Kessler describes what we are going through right now as grief the loss of normalcy fears of economic loss and also the loss of connection there is of course also anticipate relief grief for something that is going to happen in the future the first can do is to acknowledge and accept her emotions we're in the midst of the global pandemic and it's normal for us with feeling anxious to stress helpless or distressed to a certain extent it is difficult and definitely not realistic for us to be unaffected by what is going on however when we experience this uncomfortable feelings our instinct is always to try and get rid of them and often feel worse when we can't instead of struggling with this uncomfortable feelings it helps for us to explore what we are feeling with a sense of openness and curiosity so try and put a name or a label to what we are feeling and just be curious about it ask yourself how it feels like in your body to be experiencing such a emotion so for example anxiety anger or sadness and what information this emotion is trying to tell us being able to do so helps us to struggle less with these difficult feelings and also helps us to connect better with the feelings of the people around us the second tip is to limit your media exposure if you're on any social media platform chances are that you're going to be bombarded by countenance polls and studies Markovic 1,900 discomposed range from healthful updates on the current coronavirus situation Vick news that are meant to sensationalize mislead or invoke fear opposed from other people about their thoughts and feelings on the cove at night and such while some of this information can be helpful the constant exposure to information about covet 19 something that we are already quite anxious and worried about may actually do more harm than good this is because we are allowing ourselves to be exposed to unpredictable stress triggers in an uncontrollable and prolonged manner which leads to vulnerability instead of resilience in the long term to avoid experiencing unnecessary stress manage your media exposure Kathleen limit seeking of information on over 19 - just one or two sources and ideally check for updates not more than once or twice a day so turn off push notifications on your phone as well so that you're just not receiving information about koban night interrupt the entire day the talent tip is to focus on what you can control if you find yourself ruminating or worrying excessively about the current situation try to shift your focus to things that you can control you can write down some positive coping statements on a cart and put it somewhere that you can easily refer to here is an example if you find yourself worrying excessively about getting covet like didn't a possible coping statement could be if I practice physical distancing wear a mask when I go out and stay at home as much as possible I have a very good chance of protecting myself against Kovach night in this coping strategy it's very different from having false optimism such as same this will never happen to me I don't have to worry about it what we are doing is acknowledging that our fears and worries are venit that there is this possibility but big or small that we may get co19 in response to that it is then normal first few anxious but we are preventing ourselves from being caught up in these fears and worries the fourth tip is to focus on the present while it may be very difficult for us to see it right now since we are in the midst of the pandemic the current situation is not going to last forever things may not go back exactly to how it was before but eventually the storm will pass during this period of time instead of evaluating how our lives are going according to our long-term plans which is actually not going well for everybody right now try to shift your focus to the present and what is working right now in the short term which would be something great that could happen in the next month the next week or in the next 24 hours what is working out right now for you that you can keep doing more off so ask yourself this questions to help you to focus on what is important right now rather than what is distressing in the long term last but not least we also need to remember the fundamentals so the fundamentals are eating well exercising and having an adequate sleep during this period of time without our usual routines in place it is actually very easy to overlook these things such as having such as having a regular sleep and wake shadow these three fundamentals do affect our moods to a certain extent so we need to make sure that we are prioritizing this during this period of time so these are the five tips that I have to share about managing stress and anxiety during this period of time I hope you found this video useful please like and share this video with whomever you think might benefit from this information as well leave a comment down below to let me know how you have been coping during this period as well take care and I will see you soon ",True,True,True,True

E-mail : kelvin@aventisglobal.com",okay a very good afternoon Sunday afternoon to everyone who has made some time to join us online this is a online webinar brought to you by Aventis School of Management and today we intending to share with you it well it's a little sharing on how do we cope with anxiety and stress during the common 19 situation it's also for us to share some details of our program with you and later on you will have the opportunity to ask questions about our program on social psychology and counseling with representative mr. Calvin I perform the main part of the online webinar I will be sharing with you a bit of what we know about commit 19 and how it has impacted individuals psychological health as a whole right so again this is not an in-depth academic analysis of the Cove in 1902 some global perspective and political considerations of things I think that's not the objective if you are here for that perhaps it's not correct that from its small just to this share how this situation has some very real impacts of on the psychology of individuals organizations and even be government themselves right so I think that's the spirit of the session today I'm gonna move on a little bit about myself my name is Anil I am a senior lecturer as well as a coach and I've been in the field of lecturing for about 10 years and also you know in the field of coaching as well as counseling so I've been with when this for the last five years previously I've run a drug rehabilitation center where I help recovering drug addicts as well as their family members to go through their recovery stage I was also in the National addictions Management Service that's a tertiary outfit in Singapore that deals with treatment of various types of addictions namely drugs alcohol gambling and gaming of course there are many other fringe addictions but these are the big four that we look at in Singapore and so if you'd see my mind my experience deals largely with people who are recovering from addiction in the school front I am a lecturer at many institutions both government and private institutions and currently I'm also with the Singapore University of Social Sciences where I do academic coaching so academic coaching in the sense of not tuition per se but both helping students understand their struggles that they are facing with school and also to see how I can better help them from a coaching counseling perspective to reach a better state of doing well and managing the challenges the multiple challenges that they have in life with regards to school and then the academic progress so that's a little bit about me I shall move on to my sharing today Oh as we speak some of you would have really gotten wind of the news and I've also seen some very cynical interesting comments online Oh Singapore you'd like to be number one right so finally you are number one and we are number one in Southeast Asia for the most number of Kobe 19 cases I think part of the reasons is is because the past few days we had sharp rises in numbers of between 500 to 900 plus numbers aside yes we do have close to about six thousand five maybe slightly more cases of in we have about 740 recoveries if you do a little bit of math that is slightly more than 10% and we have 11 fatalities from there but at the end of the day these are arbitrary these are number some people are very concerned about the quantitative aspects and I think with numbers it's usually a measure of how well a country is doing to manage the pandemic and so on now being too fixated on the numbers somehow blinds us to other aspects of the pandemic as a whole for instance once what's the coronavirus impact on food security yeah there was a very good article yesterday on food security in Singapore and how we have always taken that for granted but how do we review our food production for instance this is the impact of coronavirus on the economy for for obvious and all of us know that and we see how businesses are affected people losing their jobs some having to take pay cuts some having to adjust to working from home like many of us and and myself in fact even and if you think that all working from home well what's so difficult and it's good you don't have to travel to work you've got a bit more time with families and so on well at the micro level some individuals may tell you that's very hard to go school work or work itself with family some have kids running around some have elderly parents some could be in a small dwelling with seven or eight individuals and you know suddenly having to face the prospect of being with seven or eight individuals at home for an extended period of time is something that it's not whether it's it's a nice or not nice thing from a family perspective it's something that needs adjustments right and people may not exactly see them right similarly from a a country point of view if you look at Japan there were reports on how Japanese are struggling with working from home because all alone when it comes to work ethics and the idea of of respect of interpersonal relationship between employees and employers Japan places great pride in in working and somehow now they have to adjust their mode of working and it's not easy for organizations and process and so on to do it so these are just some examples of how a global pandemic could impact a country on on various levels and to just be fixated on on governance alone it's okay I mean we all expect that you know a good government would be able to tackle all sorts of crises but I think what's also more meaningful at least for for some of us in the social service sector is to see how the impacts of the pandemic has now trickled in many other areas of life and one area is on mental health of individuals as well as organizations and even the government themselves right so you see here from the screen that I've shared with you worries about the pandemic see more calls to mental health help lines and this is not just in Singapore it's also across other countries right so more people are calling in in order to speak to one over the line someone who's trained someone who's professional to share about perhaps their bouts of anxiety some physiological changes to them during this period and so on now of course there must be a reason why they're getting all this you know sudden spike in in society levels and those touch on that a little bit right so you could see here that you could have situations and families where even before coven 19 there are already incidences of abuse and you you can see how this abuse is going to get worse especially with more contact with the abuser in the homes right so again I'm not gonna get into this moral discussion like you know Oh be thankful you know that you have a nice home to be in during this pandemic and someone is else is suffering in the slums and so on and you have a happy family with kids running around and someone else is it's out there in a flag where you know they're abusers and and then they're gonna get up you so think about how this whole stay home thing is it's not working out for them yes we can always make that distinction people will always be more realistic about things and so on but I think the more objective thing to think about here is if we know that they are going to be such cases and there may be a rise in in family abuse victims then and what are we gonna do about it of course some of us are just you know commenters will be talk about it and so on but from from a services point of view how do we put in place interventions immediate interventions that allow us to you know maybe coordinate even with enforcement and so on to see how we could reach out to both I think he victims as well as the abuser so we we know for a fact that you know bullies for instance individuals who need help to not just the bullet or the wing tips in that sense and so this this was one area that came out about the expected rise in we abuse victims I think MSF it's very busy in this front right and and you see that domestic abuse need not only be physical it could be psychological right it could be sexual it could be emotional it could it could also be stress that people may have from mounting debts you know or the need to think about who's gonna pay the bills for the next 2-3 months and so on I'm getting but I'm gonna get to mine my key point here so just bear with me right so okay what how is this how does this all add up and also what what's causing all this it is a global pandemic it is a crisis some have compared this to to SARS and a lot of them compared based on again fidelity is number of cases how many days the schools were closed and so on sometimes the quantitative aspect of things are important I'm not denying that but if you look at the qualitative aspect of things I think you are able to uncover more and and that's what we try to do with some of our courses in in psychology we try to help students and prospective students to see the issue with a different lens right I've always I've always shared with my students whether it's in psychology sociology or international relations or security studies and sometimes they ask me so what's the hallmark of a good student in psychology what's the hallmark of a good student in insecurity Studies or political science I say in whatever you do it's not about your mastery of the concepts and the theories instead you think about it as pre and post meaning before you take on a course and before you have knowledge on on psychological principles and you encounter a particular issue in this case Co v19 how do you view it and after you have gathered some psychological knowledge you've gone through a course you are able to appreciate the concepts and the theories and you look at Kobe 19 again if you are able to see it differently from a psychological lens I think that's the true value of going for the cost it is not about getting is it's not about kneeling in and saying that yes conceptually I know everything does it help you to change your perspective about certain things are you able to see a situation differently and I think academically that's what we want to offer in our courses right it's to help individuals Park embark on a learning journey but also how how do you how do you measure the effectiveness of that learning journey how do you know if you have learned something is it based on you know rote learning memorization regurgitation getting good marks for the exams or is it applying is it forming a new wave is it appreciating how people may have different views and is it about being a little more open-minded to understand that the world is full of subjectivities right I think that's what we want to try to do so now in our programs now coming back to this I think the main reasons here and then and this is probably my take you may have read it from somewhere you may have your views I think this generally they're all very valid a pandemic like that but which may not be similar to say SAS because it seems to be worse now now if you think about his SAS was quite a while back so the gap between SAS and and covet 19 it's a good one 1517 years more and the very fact that it doesn't happen frequently means that the adjustment period for people is going to be really slow now that's I saw this as a as a whole now if you look at your situation okay I'm going to use myself an example and my mom for instance my sis and I had a hard time trying to help her to understand what's going on now part of the reason could be because my mom is not very educated and she's not like us so connected everywhere we go every day we thing and seeing it was a new number now and what's the rise in cases I don't think she's they're connected and engage and as such majority of people from our baby boomers grew that generation would take longer to try to adjust and enforcing them and said why you don't understand you don't understand it's not really gonna be very helpful for them in fact some level of patience could help now again I'm not gonna go into the discussion of all the naughty characters are who went sit on the floor passers deliberately define guidelines and so on my thing is empathize a little bit you know you gotta bring them in your arrest them because you're picking out the situation speak to them you know talk to them maybe help them to understand because I do think that boomers take a longer time to understand that the general population right so that's one it's about the lack of frequency of things like that happening so when you suddenly get a situation the mine is not exactly condition to change so quickly right and this is one problem with expectations or people and I do a lot of this with addiction and then clients or addictions right family members tend to be I understand why they're eager I understand why they're frustrated and so on and they say I'm not changing he went for counseling even for therapy why is he not changing and sometimes we need to politely tell them that hey you know you don't change overnight you don't change in the summer finger you don't make a change of decision yeah I want chicken burger and then now I want fish it's about an individual trying to adjust new ways of thinking new ways of feeling and new ways of doing right in psychology we talk about this very important relationship between behaviors ie actions the affections your feelings as well as your thoughts the cognition part of things you know and all these are related to to really understand why people do the things they do it's about trying to understand how they feel and think about things right so I always remember my neighbor she's still around probably downstairs don't meet her as much as oh it's last time maybe because she's just staying home or she's demented and she'll always see me and she'll ask me the same questions right how are you okay so pleasantries exchange and she'll ask me what are you doing I said I'm teaching oh and then she said why are you teaching and I say psychology and her eyes will light up and she says ah you can read my mind they cannot read your mind but I can predict your behavior I can roughly try to aggregate and explain why you're gonna do certain things you do or why you're done certain things you do so it's a myth to say that psychology is about mind-reading and fortune tellers and fortune-telling is it's not scientific and if you have a sixth sense and you can see goes good for you thank you you know but those are not exactly kind of you know the sensors that we couldn't look at right so I think with psychology here we can understand how covert 19's a stressor so as a social situation that's a stressor is creating very serious levels of uncertainty insecurity for individuals and this has translated into a type of fear you know very unprecedented fear it could be someone where encounters husband is three or four years older and not much recollection now he's 21 and boom well SAS is not really relevant to it because he has not been in it right so this new generation of a deeper level of fear is largely due to a sense of uncertainty as well as insecurity and if you think about it we're coming into maybe what the second one but it all started kind of in January there about if it stretches up to June July it's it's it's more than six months it's a bit chronic right so it's it's it's long term and people may not be able to to understand these fears and accordingly when you have irrational fears irrational worries certain types of behavior will follow but because this behavior behaviors are now guided by some irrational thoughts and irrational feelings that you have and so when you behave that way someone else looks at it and being seen as abnormal when it could be perfectly normal for you because it's respondent is in response to some thoughts and feelings that you have at the moment does not really characterize you know what am I trying to drive it I'm trying to say that these psychological impacts of such a condemning or a crisis for a matter it could even be war in some other countries where you know people get your traumatic incidences now these are very real just as much as workplace burnout is real and how we need to give attention to individuals who are recovering from workplace stress well here we're not talking about workplace stress although there could be a subset we're talking about stress from a pandemic so it's in crisis type of stress that individuals are are facing and not everyone has the same level of zillions but we have resilience but some of us may not know how to strengthen our resilience during this period right so if we don't then shouldn't there be more attention given to this area so that we can reach out to these individuals and perhaps offer them more platforms to be able to seek help them I do admit that there are many community services there are outlines even the ministries are getting some of their staff to be many some of these public hotlines where people can call and talk about anything but the aim is really to see how we can reach out because I think there is a recognition that there is a psychological implication of the pandemic but recently you may have also come across a debate that's going on because there was a ruling that psychological services were not considered as essential services so they're non-essential service I think the intention was ready to protect the practitioners as well as the patient because it's close contact nonetheless right the argument from the psychological fraternity or the counseling fraternity was that well you cannot deny the psychological impacts off of the pandemic please ensure that you make it an essential services because we don't know what's gonna happen if some of these individuals are denied treatment temporarily what's gonna happen to them at home and they may be even endangering your caregivers I mean granted these are all valid points and then we think about how this places psychological stress on your government but yes I know there are earning millions they're earning hundreds of thousands they've got the resources and so on now to be able to come up front and then to make such decisions okay do we convert the services back to essential what's going to happen does this threaten the security of others and so on this in itself you know the whole idea of decision making critical being able to stand by your policy decisions I guess these are these are also challenges that a group of people called the government would face and you know they did they do get into situations where they do face mental stress as well I think you would have read about the very elderly German minister who took his own life because he just couldn't deal with the challenges that the country is facing so that was quite sad to read and again we need to understand this from a point of view of how people are reacting to the crisis as a whole now having entered the context for you and helping you understand the psychological concerns how do we tackle this circuit breaker with say positivity right these are just some suggestions and I'm also sharing these suggestions in the sense of you know based on how certain services may offer themselves to to help individuals like that to improve their mental wellness right of course what works for an individual may be different some say I go for jokes I'm saying to skimboarding some say I do eating and watch Netflix and so on so it depends on how you take it now take full advantage of this time organize your time and set a certain schedule with activities set routines and and timetables that must be wondering why do you do that well think about normal life and when commit 19 is not in you you basically go through every day even though even though sometimes it gets mundane you go through everyday relatively successfully in terms of you know not freaking out and so on you do face challenges you do get stress you get tired but that's because almost every week you have a sort of routine and so you can adjust now with the pandemic and a crisis like that your routine is thrown upside down and you find it difficult to adjust right now certain things are beyond your control and then there's also uncertainty whether we will resume normal life or fifth of me well one thing you can do is is set up a bit of routines at home you know so that you are guided you've got something to look forward to conceptually it does help but give you a very simple example of how perception works if you got a bottle of 24 pills and you have to finish the course of antibiotics keep the last six fields red the first 18 pills white the chances of you reaching the red pills would be a lot higher because there is that milestone to reach right so if you don't have any routines you lace around I become day they become 9:00 in the long run it could have some troubles for you mentally so to speak find the ideal workspace if you are working from home a lot of people the men are my kids running around that neighbor's you know fighting these other guys the cars are holding and so on well see what works for you I understand that not everyone has the best and ideal situations at home right so maybe you could think of looking at how you could arrange that because when you are comfortable in your workspace you tend to be a bit more relaxed you can become okay some other points I thought the fourth point is very important and I just said a reminder of my phone and I say Oh Papa you know so calm and then after because we usually meet like once or once a week or once in two weeks and our favorite haka center john bursee sit there have some drinks have some food and then that's my interaction with him and this goes on for three four hours it's very consistent and suddenly now our routines are you know taken apart and I felt that while I am constantly engaging with people talking to myself on the screen sometimes as interaction if others what would be the older older folks go through I mean they have their own modes of entertainment but many of them have been detached from the community so stay in contact maybe helping them do a little bit of video calls getting them to use it more often you'll be surprised and they might tell you after a few rounds that hey I think this this works at least I can see you on the screen and so try to stay in contact with family and friends that's very helpful schedule rest breaks and and make them part of your day-to-day routine some people have too much rest time so depending on your situation you could find an interest or develop a new skill or I think a lot of people are doing that a lot have gone to cycling some have gone for you know jogging and so on some are doing a little bit of a slower brisk walk so they you know can be out there maybe don't have to wear a skid more people exercising some are doing online mood sessions with some are still keeping with your face online but quite a lot of things you can do online or with your phone for the better if you don't have that power PC and of course taking up a course and so on these are things that are very viable a lot of schools are now quickly adjusting to to online learning and then systems I in place yes you do hear about all the stories about security measures let me tell you on him I have used them from January until now I've got no one coming into the session showing me pornography pictures and telling me Anu please straight for us to see not here right but we had an encounter with that in the primary school so people get you know really alarmed and so on I mean I do understand if you understand them the theory behind security there's really no 100% guarantee of security all you need is a weakest link right so weakest link in one group but security measures are put in place so things like zoom can carry on you have a lot of other things like google meet microsoft team so these are all platforms and schools are I believe equipped by to ensure that the course runs smoothly and so on I'll share a little bit more if I can about how my online classes have gone and generally this there's a strong level of positive positivity from reg students okay so I think counseling understanding psychology these are some valuable skills that you may want to consider if you're intending to take up a course or learning something new or something of value and in fact even or to complement something that you do in your workplace a lot of my students come from everywhere I've got students from hey charm I've got students from finance I even have a guy who's in engineering and I say what are you doing here and this is that well I think what work is very stressful my boss is giving me more stress and I find it increasingly difficult you with my my stakeholders so I'm just trying to use this as a course to help me understand myself better and perhaps to improve my interpersonal relationships with other individuals I think that really captures the whole essence of trying to do to learn something and consoling and psychology yes we all want it to translate into some career options in the future sure but I think there are also more benefits I give her an example out of 10 students who meet me for the first time I asked them why do you do counseling or why'd you do psychology eight out of ten would tell me because I want to help someone because I want to go and be a counselor because I enjoy psychology I think it's interesting or you could be like my neighbor can you read my mind all those only two out of ten will tell me that I think psychology because I want to understand myself better we call them intrapersonal intelligence whereas the other would be more interpersonal but I think that interpersonal aspect is very important if you want to go and do conflict resolution you want to win in enhance your relationship others shouldn't you be able to understand yourself better first you wanna have better EQ isn't that doesn't that come from within right so I think some of these causes besides a career option have this to offer as well yeah so the program that we are gonna talk to you about and then you know if you have questions you can always direct them to to Kelvin we're looking at social psychology as well as counseling in this graduate diploma and you know just to give you some snippets off of each when we take when we talk about social psychology is very interesting right some people say is social psychology something like sociology but I can tell you that sociology and psychology are cousins and social psychology is a nice you know marrying of the to know a lot of people think that psychology is just you so I just want to study the individual he starts his feelings and his behavior very nice but if you tell me that the individual is someone who exists in a silo working on his own up in the mountain like a hermit not exactly right anywhere you go that individual needs to be understood in a context and this context refers to society this context refers to other people around you this context refers to the environment that is influencing your behavior and I think in social psychology we just really want to do just that we want to understand these social factors that influence an individual's behavior but because it's not enough to say that your behavior stems from your genetic disposition your behavior stems from your heritage three aspects and to adjust you it's only your minds working then that results in you behaving that way studies have shown the behavior is for instance have come on board and say that you know when you come into this world your mind is a blank slate and all behaviors are learned we learn these behaviors through the interaction with our environment right so it's impossible to discount the social aspects of how it influences our behavior right so for example in the course of social psychology what you see here is a list of topics that we do in that particular module perspectives of social psychology wonderful module we do it over a couple over weekend students I engage there's so much room of for them to share their views and and overall they they learn the key concepts in the body and of course they do their assignments they apply it and some still come back to me and say that here you know what I've learned in the Graduate Diploma was so valuable then when I go on to do something else or when I bring it back to work it was easy for me to apply and and then you know better understand situations that I face right so for example a question you know we we all have anger and why do some of us get aggressive and some of us don't it's always interesting and people would like to focus on those people who are aggressive it's like it's like in criminology right something else that I teach we are fixing that we're trying to find out why people commit crimes what are the reasons so fascinating it's so nice why don't you also ask the other simple questions why do people not commit crimes no one really asked them if you try to understand why people not commit crime it gives you an insight into why someone would commit crimes right so pretty much in social psychology we try to give students a critical perspective of things not just feeling them if concept concept consequences now when Lundy's regurgitate go for the exam do your best free heart God will do the rest it doesn't work that way it's it's about really trying to be immersed in the course and seeing how you can build on is you know what I call a a neck for thinking differently and I think some of our courses here allows you to develop that a little bit of counseling here some of you are very interested in this field you you know you probably see counseling as something that's engaging its value-adding it's something that's Noble and and you can help individuals who are in trouble lives and I I do agree with that and here we try to provide an introduction of some counseling types of course if you tell me you want to get into a greater specialization of counseling we do have a program in partnership with roehampton university from the UK currently we've just started one bench and we have you know students who took it and I'm taking one module with them and it's quite an interesting journey here so far they're getting hands-on counseling we're trying to assess them whether they're ready to do the counseling and once they're done with that first two initial modules they are their own and they'll be put on placements and so on it's a very robust program and this is something that you can consider after your your graduate diploma and I think Calvin and Hema would be in good stead to answer your questions on them sometimes of counseling techniques you've got direct counseling techniques where the the the therapist is largely in charge it's very directive towards the client in helping the client get out of his or her predicament or mess or confusion or distress if and if you like in non-directive approaches for example person centered therapy by this guy called Carl Rogers they prefer to rather they believe that individuals have that ability to get out of their situations on your own and to be you know self of us to be fully functioning individuals so the therapist role then is to facilitate and kind and and guide the client to discover their own solutions to their problems you may be thinking a crazy oh I give money and then you're supposed to counsel me now i console myself some people think of it that way but if you understand the the theories and the rationale behind person-centered therapy the counsellor is that the therapist is still in a way in charge but more more of trying to use an approach where it's it's more bottom up rather than top down and and once an individual is able to discover some solutions to their own problem of course with the help and kindness of a terror I tell you it what wonders because after the therapy session when they face other challenges in life whatever they learn in the counseling session is going to be very helpful for them in devising their own solutions in being resilient for example I think that's what we want to try to achieve in counseling and of course you have cooperative counseling techniques where it's a little bit of both so this is just some initial snip snippets you know if you are very interested in this I think we've got a good set of counseling programs lined up for you now just a little bit more about my take on on on things critical factors okay so we are still on the counseling part so how we want to avoid personal judgment clients and they sometimes come in they present you know very challenging life circumstances sometimes these challenges you look at here you get a shot I never thought these kind of challenges existed and if you don't experience that they are reality are you able to counsel them I think that's the question that we want to us of course from a conceptual point of view yes but I've always maintained to my students that counseling in books is not the same as counseling in theory it's quite similar to policing policing in books it's not the same of police it's not the same as policing in practice you can get a you know for for for law you can get a four person centered therapy and then practically when you face the client I think that's where the adjustment go it's just like a policeman right you go and see a situation you suppose whereas okay hey hold on when I take out my manual according to chapter the father would have run off you know you may be very good but in practice what you do so in counseling when you face the client and you deal with your challenges you realize that your biases your views your thoughts all these things have to be suspended because if you're doing it might even bring the client more harm right so we we do a lot of coaching in that India area trying to help students understand what counseling is really about what it it forms active listening and so on yeah so my little bit of my tape just to round up this part of things and I'm so glad that you know I'm looking at a participant rate those who came in y'all have not left I really appreciate you bringing in here spending one hour of your Sunday evening now I think individuals have to start normalizing anxiety it's it's perfectly fine to be anxious but I do understand that too much anxiety to a point where fear becomes irrational it's not entirely healthy and some of them may go on to need professional help as you would have seen based on reactions of some individuals who you know in a way lost it when we seem normalizing xiety we also need to recognize that our anxiety is being shared by others there are others who are also essential Assessors when we are able to accept that there's this level of anxiety out there I think it's easier for us to cope because then it doesn't become something that's abnormal or unique or peculiar to us in fact everyone else have that level of anxiety and we should try to understand one another right so normalizing something could sometimes be beneficial go easy on yourself I do understand you know I'm very empathetic I do understand that people have challenges that bills to pay job is uncertain some have lost their jobs and so on go easy on yourself try to seek help look out for community resources try to see you know if there are there people out there who may direct you to these resources some individuals may be too shy to go look for help and so on if at this point in time you have to settle for some something lesser go will be easy on yourself because there's really no point in being overly hard on yourself it can affect your mental health further ok again my disclaimer I'm not saying that this is easy it's always easy to say difficult to do and so I do understand that some individuals could find this situation a lot more challenging than than others kalla consoling crisis online you know something to their faith some look for help elsewhere I think I mean the sense of connection is very important because suddenly we feel disconnected from a lot of things and and this this whole stay home thing won't be surprised for some individuals is like the number of hours at home is probably equivalent to say maybe six months when they are working because some of us are just mainly out most of the time and we come back simply to present to our basic drawers above all you know mental health there's this mind-body connection some of you have read it if you're interested read up health psychology look up this guy called George Engle yin GTL 1977 George Engle talks about a biopsychosocial model of health in which he explains that health is not only physical health is also psychological health is also social and you see how these three domains interact with one another to give us this thing called wellness if you talk about well-being there's a lot more than just physical psychological and social well-being that's career well-being best you know you know career well-being there's community well-being with how integrated you are with your community so I think health is a broad range of things and you know apart from psychological health we we should also you know be mindful about our physical health and then we we do have that capability to perhaps increase our mental resilience on our problems now I just wanted to share a little bit so this is you can find more information about Aventis India courses right example then on social psychology and counseling as well as our master's program so it that's the website you know when Disney's are some pictures of of past students in our faculty who have taken the course and well many of them well you think all of them you'll see are working adults that come with them with this different experience and so on so I think the the learning curve as well as the learning opportunities for fellow classmates it's it's it's very it's rich it's not me we don't just have people from one particular industries right I just feel that the the environment is it's very healthy and very conducive for learning now of course here we have some information Kelvin is still in in the chat so I'm gonna pass it over to him very soon in the event that you have to run and you you need more information that's kelvins email Kelvin at Aventis global calm and that's his contact number and you're also able to download our brochures from the website that's given I'm just gonna leave this here for a while we have a group chat here so if you have any questions for us please let us know you you can type it out okay now if you find that you have to go and do something else the details that you see on your screen will be available and I think Kelvin who is also working from home will be on hand to respond to all your questions above all thank you for listening to me and yeah thank you okay over to some questions if you have for Kelvin and I um queen meow I'll take it offline with you Oh dropping email regarding um the cause details about that and I will pick that offline you have any questions for our new hmm yep so the cost fee subsidy since regarding oh good thing thank you for all the things it's very nice you're most welcome I've got a question here from Jessica oh how would we explain more to the younger generation so I'm thinking it as how do we explain the copy 19 situation to them Oh are you referring to - psychology as a whole yeah Thank You haps ah - good to see that you're on board as in do we hire if Jessica you referring to the explanation okay - Cove in nineteen year younger generation I I suppose you're referring to the kids the teenagers and children for example yeah I've got my nephew his 7 just went into premier one in January having a ball of time I mean back everyday excited they suddenly we tell him a you don't go to school I'm friendly so confused and he didn't understand everything that's that's quinion it's very hard to absorb he see people reading news he's not understanding I think you could explain to them slowly in terms of trying to explain not the very technical bits of things maybe explain to them that currently there's this health problem that's going on and it's not safe for people to go I think they do understand some of these basic things but also getting them to adjust to the fact that you know they may be they may not be able to have the kind of close contact with with others right and then they need to be sticking close with their families for the time being and then that everybody else is trying to also adjust I think with cases you can see me struggling a little bit with case typically I do admit it's a good question for Jessica it's probably hotter some teenagers are still quite ignorant of the issue they're still meeting up with people have been close contact I think that's where the education bill really needs to come in for this group of people unfortunately a lot of people also very sensitive if you if you cannot tell them what to do yeah it's hard to get true I do understand that the rebels in the Millennials sometimes they have you know very I mean how can we use and I know we say both choppa and and I think this is more serious if you look at the u.s. situation now we've got a bunch of Trump supporters who are diehard Republicans coming out in society to protest against staying home and they say you know look what you guys are up to there's no pandemic I think they're the real rebels but good thank you for your questions I okay yes any tips to share about cabin fever yes I think cabin fever it's a real thing we may not be seeing it now this is what today is the self so we're into a 13 day next Monday tomorrow will be two weeks probably by third weekend and for free you see some people getting very restless now I think here's the thing that many of us may be may not be appreciating we still can go out of the house and we still could be using some area within the vicinity although we're not supposed to loiter I think getting out of the house every day based on the schedule I see a lot of elderly doing it one hour in the morning one hour in the evening I think that helps because if you're just gonna stay cooped up I do the Cristina's point that cabin fever may become a serious problem and then some people may develop complications here question from Sam how can we help the older senior citizen cook when they require to stay at home and change the entire routine like what Christine shed on cabin fever yes I think I'll some older people those WOM a lot more outs we got two groups I want like to stay at home and and at TV and so on and they may have tightness and and leg pain and so on and so far so we try to encourage them to be out for exercise sessions and so on those who require to stay at home more and their whole entire routine of not being in the community and so on is out of action these are the individuals that are going to struggle a lot more right I think from an organizational point of view some of these elderly affiliated organizations or even places you know where typically the whole volunteer service and they provide activities for elderly I am not sure how they're gonna see the opportunities to engage elderly online this could be a challenge because not many of them may have their own devices if you don't know how to do some of this but I think that this really could be some engagement with getting the elderly people online for for some services or activities but it's going to be harder it's probably you know one you really have conceptualizing maybe some organizations are doing it ritual this should still be out although it's going to be difficult they can congregate and so on so they may feel that that sense of loneliness right so I think this point for the questions from Sam and Jessica and us reflect that Moyes is neither I think organizations have to step into device perhaps some activities if if the seniors are required to stay at home to each them so that they some level of connectedness and they don't feel too too out of it can you repeat the title or no Erica is not a book by George Engle but it's a it's a George Engle 1977 it's a bio psycho social model of health you can easily google this up he gives you a think on how health should be approached and and studied so that's something that we do yeah gamers they're pretty happy with being at home so they already have their own cabin even before Coby 19 well the deep able to help meet career change and three would love to work in hospitality yes I I mean if I'm going to if I'm going to or if we are going to see that that there is a predicted rise in the number of people who so seeking help or more organizations coming on board with which services today I even see how some services are going online I'm very very sure that in health care hospital even in community health or healthcare settings definitely there would be a demand for counselors and psychologists like so yes I think a mid-career changes definitely viable creamy war casualties yes those guys who have post-traumatic stress disorder by they'll be long-term effects from the pandemic I think even can give us family members who have lost their loved ones to do you know if you look at and Italy and Spain you know they don't even allow family members to come into contact not even during a time where the bodies were put and they couldn't even come in contact with the ash and so imagine that kind of heartbreak that is for for the families and I think yeah definitely needs to be counseling services from them and probably in the area of grief to help them to manage the grief that they are facing with the loss of a family member and it's gonna be an uphill task but probably direct them to a level of acceptance on the situation it's not going to be easy so that's Christina's point on counseling services for the effects on those who have passed on because of the virus oh yes Jay mr. Jadis parents to think about Homebase plea I like that them and learning for little ones while working from home children get restless very easily yeah because they can run around to release the energy okay yeah I think I think it's how comfortable people are about letting their kids you know I still my nephew who's 7 still goes down and and I think he knows every single pillow wall around a white day I see how come he's here every day I run run from one end to the block I come back and he just you're right they just wanted to release the energy and then the fact that grandparents now can't be close context or the stresses upon good thankful for that point hospitals for bachelor degree okay so Erica I'll leave this to the academia the coming and team to to advise you on on the requirements there okay what a session any more comments Calvin what do you think right anyone has any other thing you've answered most of them so anyways I thank you very much for the time no problem thank you very much and everyone thank you very much for your time as well so if anyone has any questions my name is um my name in numbers on the screen website as well so I don't know for sure give me a coin Simon drop me or whatever if you want more details or program so any once again thank you very much okay thank you thank you very much okay I'll in this session yeah sure thank you ,True,False,True,False

WEBSITE: https://jensentung.com","So you want to know what a day in the life is like as an exchange student at the National University of Singapore Close your eyes, our day is about to begin Good morning! Another day at NUS! Rushing for my class, as usual. Today's going to be an ordinary day, nothing special I start it off with my normal morning routine Singapore is hot. So simple t-shirt and some shorts and I'm good to go Ugh, thank goodness I don't live on the eighth floor, although there is an elevator so it's not too bad for them I live at Prince George's Park residents This is one of the dormitories on the NUS campus and although being one of the older ones, still pretty comfortable and relaxing to stay yet. It's got a good mixture of both full-time and exchange students Now NUS is so big that they run their own internal bus system. I don't need to pay anything I just hop on and start my day This semester I'm taking a variety of different course subjects but as a business student I spend most of my class time at the NUS Business School I'm in awe every time I come here This place is modern, its sleek and there's always something going on here from hiring fairs to free stuff I'm lucky to have this building as my faculty home *exhales in relief* Made it to class NUS classes are pretty good there's some great professors and cool subjects and they usually last from three hours to two hours and they can get tiring sometimes After class a head to The Deck or any of the many food canteens on campus all of them have unique stalls Different cuisines and the food is generally pretty good They've got drinks and snacks vegetarian, meat, fresh fruits, everything you want is here and it's all relatively affordable I don't call it a good lunch unless I have it with some great people. Not only can I look at their delicious food, but Lunchtime is a great time to socialize. All the friends I've met at NUS have been awesome They all come from different ethnicities and backgrounds and they all carry with them their own unique story After all my classes are done for the day I take a bus straight to this place every time. This is my favorite spot on campus And is the hub for all things student life This is University town People always talk about the infinity pool on top of the Marina Bay Sands Well NUS, it's got its own infinity pool, and it's open for all students U-town is a great spot to study and there's always student life and activities going on here To stay in shape I go to the U-Town gym It's accessible for all students and has all the equipment and tools I need to get a good workout After my workout I head over to the Mac Commons where I finally begin to study NUS provides some pretty powerful Mac's loaded with creative software, so I edit my videos here, too Once it's dinnertime. I head over to one of two U-Town food canteens Fine Food This place is fully air-conditioned and it is lively there are people here all the time and there's so many different types of food that there's no way that you can leave here without eating something After I'm done eating I return my tray to either the halal or non-halal shelves this place is inclusive Nighttime in Singapore's warm. There's no sun shining on you and it's relaxing I take one last bus back to PGP where I'm welcomed home every time I set my alarm clock, hop on my bed, and I close my eyes for the adventure tomorrow Hey, it's Jensen, yeah, I don't eat breakfast in the morning And yeah I don't sleep with the blanket because Singapore is so hot If you're planning to go to NUS or you're thinking of wanting to go here Hopefully this video gave you a good overview. And if you're not going here, well now you know what I'm up to. Let me know in the comments below if you have any questions about Singapore, NUS, you name it I'll answer them.

122,GXNJtjBclXY,Sofia Wellness Clinic,COVID-19 in Singapore: The Silent Mental Health Crisis **Must Watch**,2020-07-21T05:57:30Z,"This video was conceptualized, designed and produced by my very talented friend, Ian from https://www.iandanmari.com. We had this idea of collaborating on a video when circuit breaker first started in Singapore, to raise awareness about mental health issues during COVID-19.

I hope that this video will help shed some light on what we are individually and collectively going through during this period of time, and as a reminder that all of us are fighting different battles. When you see someone making different choices or behaving differently from what you would, suspend your judgement and ask them how they are doing. Hear their stories, listen to their perspectives, and perhaps say, 'This must have been a tough time for you. How can I help?'

Please share this video with as many people as possible, thank you!

Join us as we take on a very important topic and issue that revolves around the complexity and perplexity of human anxiety. Can we be the protector of mental state for the people around us?

The covid-19 has not just brought damage in terms of health and economy. It certainly has brought damage to many in terms of mental well-being which is part of health.

How to we know our friends and relatives are suffering from depression? What do we do when we see or notice someone around us struggling mentally just to keep up with the covid-19 situation? Where do we highlight these problems or seek help for mental well-being.

Join us with James Leong from Listen without Prejudice-A Singapore-based Professional Counselling Service live on Facebook and Youtube. Engage us, ask the counsellor questions and we will try our best to give you answers that you seek.","[Music] you [Music] you everyone welcome back to success videos so sorry for the technical issue I'm having a extreme lack today if you can see I'm like why is this called slow motion and metrics alright yeah but yes welcome welcome back I hope all of you can hear me loud and clear today today we are very blessed I mean yesterday we had our guests that came in to talk about pets anxiety and stuff said today today we have a very great and known counselor all right he runs a platform called listen without prejudice right so his name is James long and James John has a very strong belief that in this current pandemic situation there is something that all of us need to take note and that is our psychological barrier or mental well-being and we know further ado let us welcome James wrong on to our even yeah so sorry yes good to be here thank you for having me yeah you're welcome y'all come so sorry the first time you come on to our our show and then now we have a technical error everything hung on my laptop on my screen and everything and after that we have a metrics yes so um yeah I think I think I'm I'm not the best person to actually do the introduction for you because you are the best person to actually intro yourself to the viewers then you will know who you are wanting to do and NGOs that you have been helping yourself like this right yeah over to you tips right out remember thank you everyone and good to see you all yeah I'm an independent counselor and I'm my business is called listen without prejudice and my aiming of this housing practice to ingest the fear the unspoken fears of a society and the desperate need to belong by practice this really aims to give witness and make sense of the pain the disconnect that we are with you and I try to do this by authenticity raising self-awareness and also the most important empathy of inventing oh really instead of a media consultant I ran along public relations consultancy I stood on my curb iam helping a lot of hotels and tennis tournaments and even even Serena Williams I build up FMV restaurant I launched a Michelin star restaurants and menus but well you know Desmond in the last few years I realized that helping the rich and the famous is all fun and it's great and all but you gotta find some purpose you know like at some point and that's when I decided to turn my PR business and started to focus on the NGOs and I helped different charities I helped international NGOs and then I also decided to kind of get a masters in my counseling not a PR practice so really right now I am a media consultant for the NGO social service sector including the mentally the mental health industry and I'm also independent counselor and you're living in very very pressing times now understand the pandemic it that's the question our stance on emotional well-being so I'm very happy and I think that the viewers out there will be interested to hear what we have to say about coping with this anxiety yes yes well you have a very vast background of the liver without background of different things that you actually do I think sidestep a bit I'm very curious about um you've been helping the FMV in stuff so you help them grow their business Beauty our business is it - no I saw a large restaurants I invite a mediator to try the food I had to represent shares that fly from carriers three Michelin star restaurants to flying to Singapore and talking about business it costs as much as $2,000 for here so I don't know that could itse and glamorous kinds of things and that's really fun but and I'd be really my party when I started and I also was a a journalist a long time ago go to restaurants and review food and incognito and rate the restaurants Wow Wow okay oh really very interesting I think I think I would find our time to actually learn no more now on is you know I think there's so much more I want to ask you yeah but I would not think the time off from the viewers and something very important that we want to address today like what James has mentioned is actually the mental well-being of the people in around the world in Singapore in Asia wherever you are I know during this Cobra nineteen pandemic situation so yeah so the first question that I have for you is what thoughts do you have for the current or pandemic situation Coby 19 pandemic situation well I'm being in my capacity and I answered a question in my capacity as an independent councillor and what that means is that because I'm independent my observations are based on my experiences with my clients they are also based on what I see with my own eyes many years and what's happening on the ground and also based on what I need so I think how we are responding to this pandemic crisis we are already dreaming that's what we're all grieving over the loss of the way of life our life the loss of our job so what those jobs mean to us the meaning of those jobs that meat was all those jobs are gone and some jobs did not even come back a posthole in nineteen so we are already dealing in a great sense of loss and this loss is something that we have never experienced before because it came so fast in the king so let me give you kind of an example what I mean by grieving okay when I say grieving we're not just talking about people dying but talking about losing things that are dear to us so when I say a self-employed person who runs a restaurant cafe and you caught his Ohana and it's all business and it's a visa to the into the restaurant so you could sacrifice miss holidays his condominiums you could build something they've always wanted to build since he was young and now he has three mouths to feed and a family to raise and now in all the same had gone to this little cafe of hers is home maybe gone and he's not even gonna get it back because the snow me he's gonna pay the rent there's no way he's gonna get the salaries of his staff so you're not just talking about the loss of a job and also incandescent talking with a lot of grieving the loss of things are very very but meaningful to us so this harm example of how the Coby 19 Paris is not just taking away and affecting us economically ideologically right so so a lot of us when we use the word grief we over optimally related to the loss of the lives of people close to us and ours actually the word grief or when we agree it comes natural even when we lose something that is precious to us if it could be our habit it could be our jobs it could be things that are nonliving thing am i right to say that so leaving the link that things are meaningful to us so these meanings could be a ticket form of our jobs our relationships or even the things we possess but that emond costly one want to say is that because this pen deeming is so destructive it's affected all levels of society not it's all a lot not just our jobs our relationships the stay upon notice when you're forced living people that we don't always line and can endure for such a long time there's also affecting our relationships so we also creating a better than lost relationships so as I spend income in nineteen is really not just affecting our health I've been literally killing us it is making us lose things and grilling in a way that we never grieve before right right so so um now you are on board of resilience series so one thing that always I would like to hear from you will be in in this time of this time of crisis in this kind of situation where we are grieving for the small little things are the big things that is always around us but resilience is something that everyone is oftenly up coming up from everyone even for for our show is college student series but how do we stay with zealand or how is your turn for for resilience how do we see mission impossible as define resilience I think I mean is the ability to adapt to change us it's a bit ability to bounce back and to adapt and make an accommodating to do to to new situations of new events you like that you never had to accommodate before would you agree that definitional resilience yeah in a way yes how do you resist so question is Army Reserve let's take a question I think that is so with the question that's been throwing around you are you ever to know hang hang on to whatever that is around you in a tight situation in the situation you know feeling positive staying there and not feeling down or giving up you know I think that's that's what a lot of living men has been feeling yeah so residents alert has been thrown around a lot it's almost a bit of a cliche and I think that we have to be careful when we use these words incident because you can't stay you can't use the let me say that without acknowledging the context or what's happening in our lives let me give you an example so someone was really mentally not well and he's something serious oppression in anxiety know something fear and this fear paralyzes you to inaction so if you tell him example Adam who suffering from depression anxiety because it's kind of pain that he built over a period of five years and say hey Adam you need to be resilient I don't think that's gonna work for him because he's affected by the loss of his income this restaurant is better system and he's grieving and not only is he grieving is also suffering from depression and maybe even a zion.t at the same time so we just have to be resistant it's such a horrible down time it is just not possible so I with the context of the situation I say what do I need to be resilient and also the second questions there is that another time to be resilient is there a time to really embrace your sorrow to really accept your grief and go through it as opposed to getting over it so we need to go through it rather than thinking about getting over it yes it's like so much the one whistlin the connotation that you have to canal maybe even snap out of it and you know bounce back as soon as you can because life's not gonna wait for you but the truth is sometimes we just can't it's not possible for us to bounce back because we are so laden with depression as well the situation we just cannot have you have to give our permission to say I really can't today I already can tomorrow maybe next week maybe next month but please keep me the time and allow myself to go through this first right right right speaking about going through house I 'ti of that leads to depression or or something other but the main thing is that anxiety how can we identify how many types of anxiety are there that actually exist well I think that's possible define the word anxiety and scientist also aware that we cannot throw around a lot and I think Singaporeans are not very good at confronting our abilities so exactly the definition is really the prologue anticipate that fear of danger of an event that has not happened yet it's a you know feel is usually accompanied with ruminations of the mind your ruminating the past your ruminating the future but you're not even focusing on the present so when you combine the anticipation of danger that you're gonna be panel with rumination and you combine it together it's really a bit of a recipe for disaster so that's really the end the definition of anxiety and the reason why is important to define what anxiety is because you cannot make light of it it's actually very serious illness and even if sourness is something you must pay attention to now Singaporeans how do they come skirt around anxiety you like the use of it don't stress are those strands look stressed oh they like I say let me such a conjunct finder you know right let's say let me like now when you use these terms you cannot make light of the imagery will you make it trivial but easy genocide he can escalate to a point but you do need medication and it can disrupt your life so I think we have to be very very can about making light of emotions and we need name to tame it if you're suffering from anxiety don't say oh I'm distressed don't see I'm discounts ooh if you are really in society let's look at the symptoms of anxiety look at that definition and then access and assess Madeira in deeds suffering from Ashanti and you are what can you do about it so there are really different kinds of anxiety out there that's social anxiety as a general anxiety disorder there's a social advance of a growth phobia fear on being in a place where you can escape this thing a whole list of anxieties even a kind of disorder this is a constant anxiety so this whole list of anxieties that missing our shows how serious it is a condition that we must pay attention to right how about how about an example of if I'm worried about okay with me taking the bubble tea the recent most recent Muppet issues at the moment it was announced properties are no longer sound quite we have some people that rush down worried that they will not have any bubble tea for one month hey I know I wanna be I don't wanna be too quick to judge and make you know I mean for all you know it could be nothing to me on you but it could be a source of anxiety to others because I mean he is a source of all great happiness opinion maybe you've been a form of addiction to em so if I know how am i TT I cannot function and you might be right it could be a form of anxiety if I don't have it protracted periods of time you could affect my daily functioning I don't know same reason that people are suffering zion.t when this really something might be small to you but can also live experiences of the history or the combination of the genetic makeup it could be a source of serious anxiety to them and completely nothing to you right right so how do we identify um small symptoms or those people who are around us to identified earlier so that you know or even ourselves as an individual so I believe that people who are going through anxiety or they have this this issue but they are unaware and there are these kind of people right yeah yeah and where I think it's because you don't recognize the symptoms on the thing that they are able enough to get over it so some of the symptoms you can look at all it requires attached is your physiological functions so we have studied he lose sleep okay number one or we are having trouble eating a lot of appetite we have trouble focusing even concentrating and Nancy is the slightest things makes a bit ng inevitable and this goes on for a period of two weeks minimum two weeks or more you might want to get some medical attention have someone look at it right when we talk about medical attention it doesn't mean um medical medications that that we eat it means to seek professionals or professional help to our sitting people like you people usually in inside come in a space of psychology psychiatrists and counselors cannot walk hand in hand it's like just dispense the medication and he says okay that's man I think you're suffering from mild depression I'm gonna just give you some pills now to help you with your serotonin levels your brain bring it down but giving you the menses designer I like you to work with accounts they see how they can use certain counseling approaches to meet you calm down and so that could complement the medicine I'm working you some an answer is that you can't work with the psychiatrist it becomes a point where you need medication and then also the counselor and with a depends on the condition if you go to accounts like me and I recognize your symptoms are affecting a daily functions obviously it doesn't I think you should see a psychiatrist and get the right medication and then you come back to maybe see probably can work together the psychiatrist oh you go should go to the Contras that write me and say you know I'm suffering from this I need some medication to get to my sleep back then the psychiatrist might say well okay I think I'm gonna diagnose you to this certain condition but please see a counselor so I can go either way right right alright viewers I think at this point of time if you have any questions relating to anxiety depression or any other form of mental well-being questions please feel free to ask James is here are we all ready he's ready to answer all questions I'm ready to put your questions up so please feel free don't be shy let's just type into our comments and then we'll prop your your questions right yeah so James now I'm back to the question on anxiety and and how do what what do we have to do right um how on what do you recommend for our viewers in this in this period because why why I'm asking that is because um mental well-being or I would say that part of the industry has really been been put under non-essential so if we have people around us that is going through a depression and they they they can't go to a GP and say that hey I need counselling because because of counselors and psychiatrists they are already part of the non-essentials and they are not allowed to go back to office to attend to their our patients right so how what do you recommend the viewers to do in this time is to to bridge this gap well it depends of severity of the situation if you are going through a very serious case of an emotional breakdown with you when you feel like you're gonna harm yourself or harm others the first thing you can do is that you have to check your servant to the attorney depend on any hospital but your question really if you're not even at that to the extent what do you do on your own right if you don't even not that extreme what do you do you could really pick some reading exercises deep reading exercises to calm yourself down and what the reading exercises does is that it makes you focus on the present you focus on the sound of your breath going in and then breathing out through your nose and you do that kind of 20 times and that's a bit of a stopgap measure you can do on your own because that helps you focus in the present and it helps you say okay I think I'm going to an anxiety attack perhaps but I'm going to do these deep reading exercises now so I can calm down perhaps and they reach a point where I can use the next move so I think I see us out that while going through an episode but I feel that you have to do something because you can't stay still they feel like about to maybe include inside out of engines oil tea draining is one good way to cope on a moment the second thing they could do is that there are a few hot lines on there the national cap it comes in hot lines and you need someone to talk to now I want people not underestimate the power of talking it's not so much you talking but the palm of you being listened to yeah and that's actually why I call my my practice this without prejudice there are a lot of people are there despite the best intentions Desmond when you tell them your problems you tend to say things like oh you know just sleep over it you know don't think too much no things will get better soon but these comments do they really work do they really make you feel better yeah and you don't and I'll tell you why you don't mean you feel better because you don't feel you're being listened to you feel that your anxiety or relative traction your emotions they are suffering invisible to your friends so really what you want to do is you want to be made visible you want to be seen you want to be hurt and one thing you could do is just call a free hotline and get someone to listen to you and talk all you want and that's one way besides reading you can feel her you can feel this right so so um is to get it out of us so we can also talk to a friend right you using a call wish hotline um you can call it feel lousy hotlines out there you'll run by local charities you can just do a Google search on there no cost and service is one of them these are important in the sense that because you can't see anyone face to face due to the circuit breaker rules have you someone sent to you and it's also healing in itself right right alright so viewers you heard it um you can call hotlines or you can even call your friends am i right we can call our friends right I mean then go through a zoom and it helps us it well you can call your friends but my concern is that our friends and our loved ones it's the cat for us and I know you don't always have the best tools to address your fears so okay so the best mattify example you can have you know that if you're white and you talk to me and say hey James let's go to have a beautiful and I'll say something anyway and I'm not really really I don't think you should be having a feeling you probably are so incest with your by maybe just go by and apologize when you feel better now how would you say that to you right right so yeah you would definitely feel that is another person just pushing me away and I'm your friend I'm supposed to help you but I'm hurting you instead so like mom's name is that people don't know how to show empathy you don't care but they don't how you don't know how to so the best way if you empathize is to call a professional and co-op crying and you get the sense of objectivity and your second empathy and if you listen right so you know which I think in in a reverse mode so if someone would call me and it always happens or know when when we miss if I call like what you mentioned earlier but you say that relax don't catch on is a very common terms use so ah if we were to tell someone someone going try it at the end because we are not professional enough to actually identify the symptoms and we could start telling them no it's really okay why no I want true in its normal relaxed I know this are not helpful ways of helping right it's not at all in fact I say actually has asked a basis of situation I've had clients would come to me and say that you know I'm here to talk to a professional because my friends are telling me to cool up and show them and actually that makes me feel worse and really slow but it's not all your friends despite their best intentions because we humans in general are very comfortable with people confronting a vulnerability so does good not just we're not used to that you're not used to having a friend and we kind of have under saying you know I feel I just cried yesterday and I feel like I want to just end it all it makes you feel you're not comfortable or friend to say that to you so your response coming from in that discomfort comes off as insensitive right I see okay so um now we have someone commenting um Karen I owe Leslie hi Leslie hello sorry is a we respiring lady I see on thank Nancy was a question Leslie Leslie has not asked the question just yet unless me if you have any questions feel free to ask but we have Karen Karen have our how do we deal with conflict in the home yes yes a home now everyone is together that has bound to be a lot of conflict so how do we do it it's a good question this is a very difficult question I mean it's a difficult situation to be in and because of the circuit breaker and and how we allowed not allowed to go out you can create more tension when in a home that already has tension and I want to talk about the issue of boundaries now everyone has your own boundaries and I say boundaries I'm talking about the emotional boundaries that you have around ourselves if you are that's when your father right yep yep i oh yeah you had that I have a boundary of my father definitely draw around me and it's the children you cannot talk to me in a certain way because I'm your father you cannot cross this boundary okay so there's a above a boundary now in your home there's a specific boundary but this is all an emotional boundary embedded within that is compoun dream so when you're involved and you're not not to go out and you're living with someone who you have tensions with not only your physical boundaries being an acrostic on your emotional boundaries are also being encroached upon immedia encroach tension rises and uh be more and have this a bit resentment so that's what happening a lot of homes and in fact if you look at aware aware and ms.fer or report increasing calls of women calling a hot knives reporting domestic violence yeah right not your husband's and I'm assuming is the men they're abusing their wives what could be the other way around but because of circuit breaker roost your fall to stay at home this also increases the Croesus domestic violence and even there were no domestic violence in tongues that already had tensions you have boundaries physical boundaries being a crucial prong and because you're not allowed to go out these ponies kind of cross and you in tensions rise so there's something we must be careful about right but how do we deal with it like like when it's a boundary do we obviously we are not asking them to know like lock themselves in the room and stuff like this yeah I mean I mean when we when we say boundary to two teenagers and sometimes yeah I think it's very normal for the kids or these my boundary I close the door I shot myself you know I don't like my dad and he's Asian no Tina just going through another my kids don't like they they love me I love them right there well yeah but you know we went through that stage as well I I went through it even without COBIT when I was young I locked myself in a room because I did like to talk to my mom so how do we do with it is that the right way to deal with it I'm not saying that's when this is an unprecedented crisis that we are having in Singapore never have we had to lock ourselves in a hole ever like that before so I don't have the absolute right answer to do this but I can't miss that in a space where there's already so much tension I think we have to kind of further draw our boundaries that have some reading space before we come out of that boundaries again to have dinner so I think we really haven't find our own little safe haven in that space if you can get out of the house and do some essential services and maybe buy some groceries viciousness any essential service let's do that but Tami's having to stay in a home and have really tensions and boundaries in cross and and match it's a bit of a scary situation being and I really really do hope that this circuit breaker and soon and psychology based based services and counseling services actually become sane central because people need time to leave your homes and to kind of draw new boundaries and calm calm hue and the mannequin cue I mean against a counselor or psychologist face to face that really helps when you go can you go back to the home and a few more listened to and more relief so I really really wish the essential services to include face-to-face counseling because there's really a lot of hungry state unprecedented situation see again our increasing our risk of our mental health right right so so it's really about a safe haven one can actually create in their in their current living condition in space that they are in yeah for them to these are safety men on the beat thanks on carrying on an essential service that also helps hmm okay well the essential services or how about probable entering to do works charity you know test us does that help them student they are you know because they are like some people they are going through very difficult times at home you know but they are given the opportunity to go out to do volunteer works and it's for charity so they get to go out this one I think the second one is that they get to contribute back to the society do you think do you think that will further help them emotionally now helping others in your time of me is always the good way to heal because it takes attention away from you that's one but there's also something to be said about being the right time and the right place to do that because I was pretty crippled by fear anxiety the last thing you want to think about is helping other people okay yeah actually what you want is really attention for yourself I want to be seen I want to be heard I need to help you I don't have trying to help someone else so the level of anxiety and depression but generally yes helping other people when you are in the difficult situation can take the attention away from your troubles right right yeah alright for following up a little bit on Karen's question um so he says she's she's asking about um staying at home park so I just want to ask how can someone affected psychologically during this COBIT 19 we know we know there's so many things on going economy job losses lives lost relatives passing away and it's wartime and even a relative when they pass away not because of it the funeral and everything has to be limited to ten so that's really a lot of difference in in life state like what you say taken away so everyone are grieving or this risk how can one be affected psychologically during this cope me let me give an example through a story I actually attended a funeral two weeks ago a friend of my husband passed away she she dunno cancer and I was not allowed to go to the hospital to see her and I allowed to go to the funeral I wouldn't say I was gonna die I was kind of discouraged because of the social distance rules doctor I you like today isn't until we've seen her cremation I feel like she's still alive today I feel I haven't had a chance to properly grieve a loss and it's very surreal that's been the feeling of having seen a cop in Rio Azul and tenderness but not being dead physically and I feel like because I wasn't there and I saw everything by assuming he's still alive today and my amputees amazed because I wasn't allowed to grieve at the funeral he was like no not agree personally the funeral my greed was a witness by anyone because I was at home looking at the funeral pyres ooh right so you answer your question how we affected psychologically and you think that this whole business of staying home not attending funerals basically it doesn't allow us to have our anxieties and depressions a nun grieve witnessed we can't be witnessed and we need not witness we cannot heal and why do we need to be witness because humans are wired or connection I'm not talking about zoom connections or stream young connections or whatsapp connections are talking about real-time face of these connections and it's one common night and evenings doing to our assessment is robbing us of this human connection buying funerals to the point the parents of the dead child could not even hold each other's hands when a body the copy men to the furnace how do you expect a parent grieve properly when you can next to each other and the server at the funeral so the bribery process the witness the ability to witness and having our emotions witness at all be stripped away from us right right so that's why that's why this Cove it it's not just disabling our economy you know it's not just disabling or affecting helps it's really disabling a lot of our mental well-being right yes and I'm concerned that despite the visitors package the gum has rona and I really congratulate the government on doing that but I feel that despite the losses of jobs and and and and well-beings the mental health that suffered from these job losses are not quite being addressed and I want to just joy some statistics for you okay the mental health Singapore now these are the mental health statistics of Singapore before Kobe nineteen in ranking maybe eight there were ten percent more of mental health conditions and then it was even up to 12 percent in 2007 there were 12 percent cases in 2010 even at the thirteen point nine today now in the Iron Age - in 2018 study one in seven people in Singapore have experienced a mental disorder one in seven okay we're talking about major depressive disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder and general assign disorders most alcohol user related disorders now more than three-quarters with a mental disorder in your lifetime did not seek professional help did not see professional help and yet the government only spends three percent of our health care operating expenditure in financial aid 17 on meth aha compared to 11% diabetes now this information is public and was shared by an MP monster on a speech or the budget statement they be entitled advancing as one Singapore into a six bedroom so these are the statistics that can kind of show that we are growing mental health crisis before us and this before Koby 19 okay yeah right so email in one's life gonna be like now and even after hmm so it is it is truly something that we we have to be worried about and just tell you one more quick thing Oh Keith your listeners out there yes the sixth and we protest a statistics in 2018 the number of elderly age 60 and above all nice peak at 129 never has any more ldcs iceland in 2018 in the report in The Straits Times July 2019 the number of teenage boys taking the online reach a record high in 2017 okay 19 boys aged 10 to 19 committed suicide in the year 2080 as high as ever and then of course we have now been a more increasing cost in domestic violence and conflicts our receive I am an MSF in a social service agencies and due to over 90 so can you see where we are doing in this how the trajectories call moving outwards in terms of mental health spikes right right but I think to be fair to be fair um when we talk about the spike and everything or or even the low percentage of people that you mentioned are seeking professional help I'm just wondering I'm just wondering could that be could I be people who who just find that it's it's it's a shame to be visiting a psychologist it's a shame to be visiting a counselor yeah there's a stigma and I think has come to a point in mental health cannot be hidden anymore it has to be as serious as ETS it has to be su SS as getting a heart attack even a check-up for stroke so it is a stigma I'm not sure why but perhaps one reason is because in mental have you can see you can see condition at night licking an arm or having a long talk sure you can see and the manifestations of unseen illness can be so scary there could be a lot of misunderstanding about it and I think that to reduce the stigma and yes there's a stigma to seeing a counselor again psychiatry now but reduce stigma we had to make it visible illness way to make visible access to mental health help I think by doing so and by not being afraid of this okay you can perhaps reduce the stigma and make accessibility to counseling and psychiatry more normal like seeing a dentist or a wisdom tooth extraction right right so what what are your recommendations for people who you know they yeah they know they are going through they know they are going through something right but they are unsure but they don't want to go straight into counsel to to visit I am hitch to say or to visit the clinic where I say oh I might be suffering from this I might be suffering from that because I'll be I'll be honest in in the environment that we are in whether we the scoobies or this non kovat situation right the moment you say that hey I'm feeling depressed the moment I say that hey I'm not feeling good I'm feeling now I need counseling the first thing everyone around starts to judge I'm not sure whether you agree with this and I believe that is something that causes people not to step out of their comfort zone to visit to find the necessary how but what are your recommendations for people who know that we are going through for that small little things and they can subtly approach counselors or clinics you know well I think people need our help in the helping profession but as counselors and psychiatrists or even doctors I would like to think that we have a natural sense of empathy yeah and I mean we have a sense of empathy we don't judge you all or come home feeling ill and approaching us hotel so write something we all have to have in a happy place to assess empathy in a helping profession I think that people who are not in the helping profession also might be useful sense of empathy and buddy's ability to feel your situation without actually experiencing it and when you have a sense of empathy you also develop a sense of sensitivity and humility you're not getting it however having said that FPT is not Bristol readily available in everyone some people just have less of it and some people have to be close and nothing you don't have very so what I would suggest is that if you don't have empathy is be curious I think we need to be curious we do have a sense of velocity about level so if you were to come to me and say hey James I think I've seen this way I'm not gonna immediately judge people or that's because you haven't been taking care of yourself you know you don't know how to relax and therefore you're feeling anxious it's all your fault so if I'm judgmental I can rate easily say that - you ever said to myself but I'm curious and I'm saying yes ma'am why you feeling this funny feeling this way you know and a sense of curiosity will allow you to be more kanjo into talking to me without feeling judged so I'm gonna say unknown and helping profession and you get approached by some awesome feeling anxious or depressed start the message really I think the most basic and purpose that we can take right right having the curiosity now in this situation in the current situation that we are in a lot of parents are out there and in their kids I am home and everything no going to home based learning and stuff so I believe there's two set of people that has this coinciding first thing first other teachers who are well not so tech savvy I think they go through something a very huge change and the other group it will be the young children we don't talk about maybe the secondary school on a use you know they are very tech savvy but there are little children that that parents have not given them technology ever since they were young because there's this stigma that though I'm not going to give you technology until your next mistakes and stuff like this so there is a form of anxiety in these two groups right yeah um this is something I hear you know continued society on conformity conformity what everyone else is doing am i hearing you right yeah in a way because everyone else is doing it but I I be struggle to it and yeah I think why somebody just are messing up the the lesson because you start so tech-savvy - call call all her friends called IT and stars can't even lock in though they're putting strains in the same for the children they forget password they don't know how to use they do know how to upload the picture onto the girl yeah yeah I hear you I think we have to be more forgiving of ourselves and I think you have to understand that it's okay to say that we don't have all the answers in our lives because you know so it was so desperate to belong to feel belong that we had to fit in we had to be like everyone else to be tech savvy that can be wrenched transferred to you because I don't belong there and therefore I feel I'm not good enough so it's okay to feel like you don't know it's okay to say that I don't have that technical expertise and it's okay it's okay that I don't know and I'm gonna become that but I'm gonna know and someone can teach me and just because I don't know it doesn't make me feel less anyone else it just makes me if you challenge because we all of us are going through this don't just mean oh yes it's always a fuss for everyone it's always a fuss for everyone especially doing is finding me so I think we have to be more forgiving more compassionate and be able to be vulnerable not in the weak way but to be vulnerable and be courageous enough to say I don't have the answers okay we don't have to be perfect but today is not about me being perfect but I'm gonna find out and I don't have to live up to expectations I'm gonna find out and it's okay for not to be long and that's fine but I'm gonna find out so what I'm doing here is that I'm getting you to understand and grace of other abilities do a solo and expectations to say you're not alone in this you know but it's okay it's okay you'll get there somehow right right so viewers if you are watching this now or later or you are watching the replay yes I think James had mentioned it's okay to feel vulnerable to be vulnerable um accept it and then find ways to move forward rather than staying in a self-pity more right is that not the Middle's optimism I think we put a lot more stress no sound and believe in Singapore we have this incessant need to feel belong okay doesn't need to feel like to be accepted to fit in in my parents you know if other teachers are doing that I should also do that if I don't do that I don't you belong so I unspoken neat if you belong and to come a chase that that race that I had to be part of this group my mom saying is that you don't have to you don't have to let's get out that racehorse for now and just be comfortable in what you don't know and that's okay too you'll get you'll find a way in your own time space because chasing other people saying give me the need to be accepted and to fit in I don't know how long you're gonna sustain yourself okay right right all right so uh before we move on to the next question that I have for James a viewers please if you are watching this you know chant a video she'll like it get people you know who are going through difficulties can come into ask questions you know James is here ready to answer all the questions that you are about to throw to us right yep so now James back to you um I want to find out from you in terms of Singapore how do you think Singapore is faring in the in the current fight against this cookie in terms of maybe what the government is doing in terms of what the people of the nation is doing I think the Singapore and I'm gonna once again I'm gonna speak in my capacity as independent counsel not say economist or politician is it okay yeah definitely because of how you're coping in the special mental hell I don't think you're quite there yet I think one of the examples how the circuit breakers over that mental health is still not a priority even now so I think we are not ready to be vulnerable in facing mental health and kind of taking it head on and accepting mental health or what it is I don't think that there yet in me but there we will be not afraid to talk about it we've been not afraid to allocate more resources mental health and I think that can do better in this area we need to be home honorable to say things like we don't know what mental health I is scary but let us make it a priority so we can find out more and that's okay let's not be frightened by what we don't know anything let's be okay with not knowing and what better at it right right so it's okay to not know wait and then be better it yes and I think we need to be brave in the area because if you want to make mental health a priority you have to really embrace it for what it is you know the anxiety schizophrenia the panic attacks everything that's far off and it's not different from any any other disease are you gonna kind of accept and and look at it for what it's worth and then put your resources and make it a priority because your mental health is your health how's it different from your physical health why should we not make it a priority as well yeah I see alright so um how about home of the two because this Cove it has redrawn now really drawn out two sets of people I think not just in Singapore we talk about Asia with October the world itself drawn up two types of people from my observation um would be one group is very United and they will support a lot of things that that the government has ruled out other people have screwed our organization has rolled out to fight the dynamic when a bit they can't are throwing in money or doing delivery doing free services and stuff another set of people will be those that are so many affected when a bit um affected directly or indirectly but they had this grudge that hey someone has to bear responsibility and they are so and they really hold it so badly that they cannot move on yeah so this is my observation right so how do you see see of this this observation that I have made and can you explain to me in a second group well my main responsibility so because they are bearing this grudge that hey someone has to bear responsibility of are the kovat 19 or someone has to bear that possibility on what how how the government is going to run you bility yes yes in a they want someone the whole responsibility before they can move forward and if no one steps up to make response me they will obviously like although this is bad or it should have been this it should have been bad it should it can get out and move move forward mmm I think two groups have you although they had different behaviors they do have one thing in common being a moderate the most are free from fear and when I spoke your differently so the first grip the response a fear by helping others and then maybe make makeups makes em feel better the other group is also fearful and Andy and I'm blaming and maybe that's done we are coping with fear so what you're saying here real how people are coping differently but they all have a common sense of there's a commonality and that is your bull afraid of the situation and just at the end coping on a different name right right so it's fight off like kind of thing um is it final flying oh yeah I don't know whether the helping part falls into the final flight of freeze response I'm not sure that there is a good example here but you see that both groups are both frightened and they are spawning in your own way one is respond I can't say whether one is better than the other because you won't say you need to take accountability for it you could be coming from that place of authenticity and your banisters that was very much based on fairness and justice and so you're on your own value system and the response comes from your system if the other the first group ends up helping people there and balances them could be down on benevolence you don't increment and so they are free from that and the system so it's very hard for me to say that one better system is better than the other or one response is better than the other right right but the common thing is fear so many things fitna and they both have different value systems and they are both coping in a way that is based on that value system right right I I definitely agree because I'll be honest with you I mean since the was out here as well we know you are here resiliency we saw stuff that Musa because yeah I mean now that you mentioned fear and then I start to think back yeah I started is because of fear because I was worried that no success video has nothing to you we are just going to be quiet for two months no production whoo nothing which is going to disappear for teen an or but yet at the same time when I know that I need to do something in this fearful mode I need to do something meaningful I need to do something that you know society and and that's how this thing yes I definitely agree now that you mentioned oh my goodness you you liked and liked on me my we are living people society and we all showing yeah from the top level society down to the lowest level Society it just had different ways of showing it yes y'all beautiful we all feel I'm not so keen to admit it but it is quite clear to me that you're responding from a place of fear right right okay okay um having having fear in all of us but there's something common or something that I know everyone can try to do which is to stay positive I don't dare to say that I'm the most positive person I find we might not whine but I I tell my partner's the difficulties that I had the struggles that we have we share with each other you know I share with my wife I share my business partner I share with closest close friends but how can viewers stay positive in this current situation well when you encourage people to do I mean you just said you're on I think just give you an answer and you will operate from I like what you say you said yes I'm beautiful I don't know where this business is going to but I know the line you might miss is fine just another lines my wife I'm gonna share that my true consists of my true fears and what you're saying is that yes I'm afraid but I'm really doing the best I can isn't my isn't it right yep yep you're right all right yeah yes oh my this is play that's meant to display a sense of vulnerability not in the sense of you being weak but in the sense of you being prey and bodied uncertainties of the future and saying that these are my certainties I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do in the back yeah and that's why you're done so the same I would like you like share this with all the viewers out there be ok you're ok if you don't feel positive today you can feel better today - tomorrow be ok have on durability so somehow day by day take it one day at a time ok not everything is a Hollywood or Netflix movie that when you wake up in the morning the Sun is going to shine and everything's gonna be better everything's gonna be made better by singing a few songs that's a reality of time but let's take one at a time if you can take one day at a time take it one hour at a time if you can take one hour at a time do it thirty minutes at a time and this why I call trying to live in the present and not thinking too far it because take me to a fire hit is really what inside it is right oh speaking of singing really had a hook Singapore sing yesterday yes yeah yeah I hope to hear from you hon dude what do you think of that campaign that is being being run well I I think was a wonderful initiate I think one of my friends was behind it I think it is rich it is a spirit I don't think songs alone would really address people who are suffering from mental health conditions it's like a bomb that you apply in our skin so if you specify really addressing the wounds of the bacteria underneath the wardens so a songs knife is nothing wrong songs and singing nothing is lovely but if you really want to heal the wounds we got abilities I see I see ok ok great so uh yep coming coming close to an end I want a one who hear from you what is your current witnessed witness wish my biggest wish in my capacity as a counselor is that for all those who are listening here either right now or you know in the on demand service anyone who is suffering from anxiety and depression yeah yep they're going Dory you are not alone remember this you are not alone okay it will pass and third thing is that is okay not to be okay three things right so it's okay not to be okay is it me okay number two it will pass number three what's the third one I forget it's okay not to be okay you will pass the third one is I forget not alone right right we are we are all not alone wish might be the switch is for people anyone suffering from a mental condition that they remember these three things you are not alone okay and it will pass you will come will okay it will right okay but that's not your wish right it's my wish my other people more suffering about yourself myself my step um my wish is really for mental health to be seen as something as normal and common s going to the dentist I wanted to be normal at least I want people to say all I'm gonna see your concert today and then people are think all okay I'll see you after your counseling then I have coffee of you on today I want my wish is for to be normalized I want the people with the resources to make it a priority not for my sake yeah all of us because any one of us is not invincible to mental health conditions and even if you're not inflicted with mental health conditions our loved ones our families our relatives could be so my wish is to be a priority in Singapore right if I can make a wish together with you I think my wish were definitely for it do even during the circuit breaker for for mental well-being this the industry in this sector to actually be one of the essentials because that's the reason why I caught you on to our show because there's something I strongly strongly believe believe in that mental well-being is very and extremely important and it has to be important because they need to be seen you need to be heard you can be covered they can be mean and not a priority anymore we need to bring it so that you can sing and hurt and be treated with dignity and humility right okay just before I asked you what to just pick up before we close I'm curious if we get people to listen to songs and sing along with us I mean we know yesterday we had a host nation coming together if we just have a simple sing sing song such session or you listen to songs that you like is this a way to to help emotionally to go through this one month you understood there's not beautiful music therapy but music can be important you know think the songs that you like and became your form on calming your senses but if the source of your mental health is it's not addressed then music will only be seen as a distraction for the moment you've got to really look at the source of anxiety and sometimes you seek professional help you get someone to really uncover the source of anxiety what are you afraid of what are you surely afraid of don't tell me you're afraid of losing the job what does the job mean to you you know is that what your truth is the loss of your job because the job means this to you so you need any professional help to uncover their true feel the true source of the fear and some science settle with your own emotions you cannot do that you need someone to help you do that it's been the professionals of coming do that for you right so so music can only be a stopgap measure before but they still need to go for a long run therapy or two to solve the problem for the long run identify find a place for music therapy Leslie that way but I think we have to get the source of your side and depression yeah right right you know I'm asking this because tomorrow we have a guest and again she's gonna sing Yeah right right okay so yeah viewers I think tonight we hope we hope you had a great session it's a bit very cheery wise very serious topic because this is something that both James and I feel has to be the priority now so that in the long run we don't have that number of suicide rate I didn't James you haven't even touch on the the the part where all this anxiety might need to lead to increased rate of suicide maybe maybe we'll just extend a little bit more I would just like to hear from you you know three signs I just keep some statistics on suicide which are rising among the elderly and and teenage boys but I don't think a suicide is the beyond and all I think even before you talk about suicide and shows suffering of inside and depression in your day to day can sometimes arguably be worse than death so let's we sign you I when I can trigger say that you can only come and see see face to face psychology console it's only when you have self harm to others I'm not if I sure if I agreed that because sometimes it can be too late by then and the daily suffering that you suck that you experiences in anxiety where you're so fidgety you can't sleep you know you're so irritable your mind's all foggy that is torture in itself and that something has to be treated so let's not even talk about three side debate the handlings and your manifestations in your live experiences of anxiety and depression have to be spoken out they can't be made visible and hurt right right alright so um karen says thank you she has been good mast thank you so much Karen yeah we hope you enjoyed the time with us and we hope that whatever we have said or more mom James I'm just you know being the parrot and echoing her whatever James have seen so we hope James have had lightened all the viewers even more insights to how important mental well-being anxiety managing anxiety and stopgap measures for depression you know all these things so James thank you so much for the time with us and you for having me yeah we're the we are we are very very glad and honored to help you so yeah okay one say safe yes oh you have anything to say to help us y'all before you take a leave anything sure and one last thing three things and I'll repeat it again number one is okay not to be okay it's okay not to be okay you're not alone you're not alone number three it will pass it will pass so viewers remember that all right thank you James goodnight goodnight goodnight all right yes so that we have um we've extended gone beyond an hour so thank you for all this with um stay with us we really hope that yep like what I

#aventislearning #aventisdialogue  #aventiswebinar #aventislearning #aventisonline #sgunited",[Music] okay hi everybody thanks for joining us um at this time so i'm gonna introduce myself a little bit if you can hear me clearly okay um i'm going to share before i start introducing i'm going to share my slides hang on in a moment okay yeah so today we're going to talk about um our uh grad uh the programs okay so this is about the counseling and psychological psychology for master and graduate diploma all right so just a brief introduction of myself okay my name is jesslyn and i'm currently a developmental psychologist and i'm the immediate past president of association of psychotherapies and counselors singapore uh apex for short okay so right now i'm currently doing my private practice i founded my culture in about 2012 and recently the tribe psychological clinic basically the tribe psychology cleaning is mainly targeted on children and youth okay so my culture is more like adults so some of the services that we actually provide are psychotherapy counseling we have art therapy animal therapy you know hypnotherapy and things like that and we also do um diagnostic assessments okay and i'm also currently providing services in the community hospitals like nuh um alexandra jurong healthcare and things like that for the staffs working there so it's not for the public there but rather the staff wellness okay and um also lecturing in some of the institution i mean of course one of which is this aventus okay um so yep let's go into apex okay so association of psychotherapies and counselors singapore mainly the courses that they have here in advance are accredited by apex okay and um for this association of psychotherapies and counselor singapore we work in a very holistic manner meaning that you can join um this association as long as i mean if you have interest uh keen interest in working as a in this helping professions um basically we also have not necessarily that you have to be a counselor or psychotherapist to be in this association i mean we have nurses we have teachers we even have monks priests anybody who are interested in this okay and can join us and we have different tiers of membership in this association student members and i'll tell you more of the different levels of the membership for apex later on okay so that this is the association that accredits um the courses here all right so what about adventist adventist uh is established since 2007 which is about 13 years ago or so and um most of their courses are actually catered for adult learners like yourself like if you're busy um working adults uh their courses are whole i mean being helped in the weekends during the weekends so for more information about these advances you can go to their website or you can check with um kelvin here later on okay so welcome to the world of counselling and psychology counseling psychology and psychotherapy they are considered mental health right and i'm not too sure if you have noticed that this profession has actually gained a higher recognition during the recent years with our government not sure if you notice that especially during this kobe 19 situation before that our mental health is not considered as essential services uh only i think last week they started re uh the reclassification and um what i'm trying to say here is that um that this this uh profession is is of importance okay so if you go into this course um this this program in counseling and psychology psychotherapy like you can use it for life it's not that you definitely have to use it for your career after that you need not become a counselor or you need not become a psychotherapist or whatsoever it's for life so uh you can use it with your family some of my students they are teachers they are not even in this field um they are engineers they are accountants i mean they use with their co-workers um children or it's that's why i say it's for life okay so it's not going to be wasted per se and this graduate diploma in social psychology and counseling um it's been held in uh four weekend blocks okay and it's six months part-time so after six months um and it's also for people who has um little or no knowledge in in terms of uh counseling and psychology basically i can say that this is quite fundamental okay is a fundamental basis for you to start going into this industry so what you will learn in this great day is that um the syllabus so we have um perspectives in social psychology we have effective counseling techniques developmental psychology counseling and psychotherapy so uh perspectives in social psychology in social psychology people learn how you know how others behave around other people okay in different settings it's all about relationship cultural differences and how people think and relate to one another okay so this is what you learn in social psychology i mean we are humans we are all around people all the time okay and then effective counseling techniques so some people are saying counseling very easy to just talk and then listen and then advise why we need techniques so here it is not simply just by listening and you know giving advices in fact in counseling we don't give advices okay we try not to give advices and that brings you to another higher level we learn things like empathy awareness observation your body language the posture and how do you actually respond towards your clients and things like that so that's a little more be a little bit more in depth into the counseling techniques developmental psychology talks about emotional behavioral and basically the cognitive aspect of individual throughout the different life stages um i can say this is more about like you know developmental growth so what's the difference between a two-year-old and twelve year old and uh maybe 40 years old 80 years old how they think how they actually behave and how they feel so too young may differ from 12 years old and differ from 80 year old man okay so that's developmental psychology and lastly is the counseling and psychotherapy so what's the difference is counseling techniques and then counseling again and then you know what's the difference again between counseling and psychotherapy again so basically counseling techniques are those that i mentioned initially counseling and psychotherapy we have techniques we have different modalities like i don't know if you have heard of it like very popular ones like cbt cognitive behavioral therapy and things like that there are different modalities that you have to put into use and to apply how you apply and how you actually going to conduct the session with your clients that's what you're going to learn in this um counseling and psychotherapy okay and how you're going to put apply in different settings right so this is the fundamental that is in graduate diploma so why graduate diploma why i can give you like you know 101 um reasons why why graduate diploma right first it's actually very focused like here it says focus curriculum it's very straightforward um you know this is going to be counseling and psychotherapy and it's six months that's why it's really focused so it's basically what you see is what you get okay and also six months is considered quite a really fast track to complete the pursuit okay and also one thing that is good that i think when i tell people why is it good for graduate diploma is that you can check your interest if you are not in this industry you want to maybe have a career switch or you want to try to practice go further in this industry you can check whether if you have interest and if this is your cup of tea and it's connected over like four weekend box and um basically if you don't have any fundamental knowledge in in this graduate diploma is the one for you to check and if you like to go further of course you can have the opportunity to go into this later i'm going to share with you this rehampton university which is a very good school in uk okay so that's one and what's uh what's more if you don't really like you think that this is not a cuff t so after that you finish you can also practice as one it's not like a halfway through okay so i i'm neither here here nor there and i cannot practice okay you still have the skill set like i say just not earlier skill set is for life it follows you throughout your life and another thing is i think it's quite affordable for this okay and also this graduate diploma is not as demanding as um like you're going for a four-year degree kind of thing okay so and of course so on so far okay for graduate diploma what's y d squared d and then um let's see okay let's look at the flow so after you finish so okay let me talk about apex a little bit more first apex we have actually four five levels we have level one uh level two practitioner number three level four level four s so one two three four and four s is s is super supervisor okay so basically the more experience you have um you will be at level four so level one is for people who complete 150 uh practicum 150 hours face-to-face session practicum and then you can go to level one but even before that you can already join as student member okay so let's say after this diploma in social psychology you finish your practicum 150 hours you go to level one and you can start practicing so in between these people i saw i cannot start practicing how do i actually achieve these 150 hours so basically these 150 hours that's what we call internship practicum or rather placement practicum where you do voluntary work okay and source for the practicum over i mean it's social services and all that they have this they recruit interns to do their practicum work and also what's the difference between oh i want to be level two left how about you know can i straight jump to level two there's difference between level one and two because for level one you know that you're actually conducting or um doing sessions that is at your level you won't want to be level one and then you conduct a complicated uh complicated case um like what level four does okay so that's one thing and also because of the fee okay the higher the more expensive um joining association also helps you in professional indemnity in terms of insurance to cover yourself so that is the track okay from level one two and up if not after you finish your graduate diploma and you think that it is your cup of tea you really like it you want to go further into this industry you want to learn more in that that's why i say you have the opportunity because this is tied up with also a rohan university okay um unless you have the correct or rather you have the requirements you can surely go to this but if not if you start from fundamental this is a good way to go into this okay so rohington is really really a good school i'll tell you more about it uh here it is master of arts in integrative counseling and psychotherapy which is only two years but master is yeah around there two years or so okay and um ru rohan university is one of the top university in london i think the top 12 okay it's a top 12 university in london and it has been around for like 176 years okay you can go to the website and have a look um it's it's quite um prestigious okay so why does school uh they have they are being accredited by vacp in london which is a british association for counselling and psychotherapy okay so program structure two years we have 11 modules here and then um you have to complete 200 hours of practicum over the two years um it's broken down okay and then two weekend blocks surely per month so it's also we end like i said like this they uh curate the program especially for weekends saturday sunday saturday sunday okay so you have more time these are the modules have a look okay introduction to counseling the theory and the skills uh foundations and then there's one and two personal development now the good thing is that in psychology you not only learn that how you want to talk to people and how you want to guide people and things like that it's about how you gain inside yourself during this journey you know a lot more about yourself which is a way that it should be that you have to understand yourself and know yourself well before proceeding to um help others okay so this is a really a life i can say it's a transformation if you're going into this course the things you see um your perspective in life and the things uh how you see things will be different okay so that's why a lot of personal development here as well okay and then your dissertation i will graduate here [Music] just to show you so the very very happy thing that you know when i heard about this is that um the certification for this ru it's from rohington itself which means the award is from ru itself there's there's no other schools uh there's no advantages on the certification which means that your certification is solely um from rohingtom university okay so are some of the admission criterias uh you can check with it uh you can check with uh kelvin moore after this the next intake for graduate diploma it's may 30th right and for this one it's only once a year which is much uh next year okay so after let's say you finish your graduate diploma here within six months then just nice you can go into the question of arts okay um let me see if you have any questions for now okay so at the moment there are no questions if you have more questions you can actually um take it off live with uh we take it offline with a kelvin is that okay yeah so um kelvin do you have anything more that you want to add um let's see does anyone want to ask any questions about anything um yeah there's nothing in the chat so um maybe you want to uh give them a bit differences between counseling and psychotherapy like how psychotherapists can practice counseling in a counselor can't do psychotherapy okay so basically um okay so basically counseling is when you target on specific more on specific issue for example like i say i'm a counselor okay you can come and see me in a session and i target on what your issue maybe specific issue like grief okay someone just passed on and then you're feeling very sad it's just a brief part that you want to share with me and it's usually more short term like weeks and months rather than psycho therapy whereby you go really in-depth into what is the root i can say what is the root of the problem that causes this person to feel like that or thing like that or to act like that and then it's more of a it's usually it takes years for psychotherapy and for counsellors for counsellors you uh you cannot do psychotherapy work but for psychotherapy you can do counseling work but of course uh sometimes the psychotherapies they can they use a little bit of counseling every now and then so it's not a black and white you know you're coming for session i'll just use counseling method it's not like that so it's a combination so it depends on which um what what kind of program or what certification you are at for most of the counselors you have to look at their background basically so um counselors uh many speaking it's more on a specific thing you work on specific um issue and then for psychotherapy it's it's like you know what is what's the root and what is it causing you to be like that or your childhood and then we start from there so that's the difference between psychotherapists and counselors okay if i answer your question someone asked about a jungian it's yes it's part um because yeah i mean his modality it covers a few of the different um psychologies um so a little bit of behavioral and a little bit a little bit here and there so it is included i remember teaching i lecture this kind of modality okay so someone else uh what is the first step to determine if we seek help for mental health do we see a counselor a psychologist psychiatrist or psychotherapist it's quite confusing for a layman yeah okay that depends on your that's them right okay that depends on your uh suitability and it depends on your preference as well for example some people say that i don't want to divulge too much about my in my my personal information maybe i'll just try a controller first and i think that maybe my problem is just um let's say give you a brief one i just want to work on my diet okay i just want to work on my diet i think i'm getting fatter and fatter i'll just see a counselor because that's a straightforward one okay i don't want to divulge too much and then psychiatrist is really more of a mental issue like you have the different kind of disorder um maybe really major this uh depressive disorder or or personality disorder or you're not sure if you are into that you see a psychiatrist psychiatrist actually there are doctors medical doctors they prescribe medication so you're thinking of taking medication to help you along you see a psychiatrist there are also patients in psychiatrists and psychologists at the same time i have many clients doing that as well concurrently psychologists are people like um i actually like like me i do um diagnostic assessment and things like that for people who doesn't want to take medication and for psychologists we can do counseling work we can do psychotherapy work and things like that psychotherapies is something similar to counsellor and also something similar to psychologists so it depends on the person as well that you want to seek for help and sometimes it's not about seeing a psychologist counselor psychiatrist or whoever is that just just helping industry and as long as you have the bond and rapport you trust that person you feel that you're comfortable then it's uh it's going to be a very good session okay okay so we have another one that says does completing the masters in psychotherapy equate to the same level of competency as compared with being licensed in a psychotherapy skills taken outside like cbt cfbt cbt and sfbt all these are actually um the modality and techniques that you will learn in uh psychotherapy this kind of program in this program so licensed psychotherapy i'm not quite sure what you mean by because license is very heavy it's only used in um in other countries in singapore we don't call license but we can't certify either you call it certified or registered because it's not quite regulated here in singapore so when you say license is like oh a licensed doctor but of course if you finish your course you are practitioner so meaning that you are a certified practitioner certified psychotherapist which means you can also use or rather you have to use cbt sfbt and things like that okay that's jonathan i think the basis of cbt sfbt is also covered in the um graduate diploma and we'll go deeper into the masters so so here we have another one that says can you give examples of the root issues you are describing in psychotherapy because it can be manifested as specific issue too because it can yes so the root issue maybe if okay for some clients they know that i have this specific issue like um okay i'm depressed but this depressed feeling or this mood is only um i had it like maybe just two months ago so before that i wasn't like that okay so this is a specific issue so right now i have this specific issue of feeling depressed and i go and look for a counselor okay so i tell a counselor that i'm feeling depressed but this is only for the two months ago i don't know what's going on maybe i'm too stressed lately and things like that if the counselor can help you in this i mean it's good but after a few sessions you think that it's still not working or it's still not progressing then maybe it could be the root issue so this is a root issue maybe um something that's sent from childhood that you have been suppressed for very long and this one even some of the clients they don't know about this they don't know if this is a rude issue or this is something that is um you know just happened like that um so it is for them to actually okay so if the counselor is not able to help in this sense usually what the counselor do or things like that is that they will refer you to um another helping profession so another helping professional let's say is a psychotherapy and he or she will be able to find out is this is and things like that they'll find out is this a root issue and things like that yeah so root issues we really don't know what it is could be something from a childhood it could be something that um i mean you you have uh you've been traumatized by some incident in your life like many years back and yeah so these are issues okay so another one is um can you explain what is the pathway for one who is interested in becoming a certified psychotherapist and psychologist in singapore is this certification recognized in other countries should i be keen to start a practice elsewhere okay um certified psychotherapy so after this grad date usually um they can be a practitioner so that's why i say after you finish 150 you become a practitioner and it's considered i mean with apex and you're considered certified psychotherapies um by apex so that is certified psychotherapies or we call it registered psychotherapies and you can practice it in singapore for psychologists you need to go through a stinger stringent so-called exhausting really degree master db course for the psychology part because psychology does a lot of evaluation diagnostic assessment and things like that okay that's uh for psychology and um certification recognized in other countries so if you go to other countries you cannot just practice like that but you have to follow the country that particular country's law so if for example if i want to practice even as a psychologist and psychotherapist if i'm going to practice in the uk for example i must have the recognition from the uk uh government or rather the association from there which in this case if you are with ru they have the bacp um you have to apply with with them so that you can practice in that country so it uh it depends on that country you cannot just practice anywhere yeah but singapore i can say that it is recognized does master of arts support uh support your need meaning yeah don't understand the context of the question what do you mean support your needs master of arts you mean the rohan all right so um anyone has any other questions oh yeah i saw one the one uh previously by jason just to check again if the classes are on weekends oh yeah definitely all the classes we run cater towards working professionals so we don't touch um weekdays we only do weekends especially um people of slightly older generation whenever they go to um class you know they don't do weekend they don't want to do weekdays because you know exhausting from work firstly physically mentally so when you come in on weekends yes weekends especially to everybody but weekends itself you come in a fresh mind so you're able to absorb and for a postgraduate program we also um recommend students to actually do some self-study before you come to class so you'll be more receptive for the things taught in class okay does training sites have to have a trained counselor or supervisor training site meaning the practicum am i right yeah i think she's asking about the masters because the master cell they have two o'clock in 200 hours right yeah she'll say yes yes uh they'll have a there will be a supervisor with you because each time when you go into a practical i mean you get someone to so-called like um uh that means okay if you're doing a practical you cannot just go into a volunteer a voluntary organization and say i want to do my practical so you have to have this confirmation that's this acknowledgement as well and also rohan them there too to acknowledge that you can work with this organization to do your practicum usually the predicament side will have to have a supervisor and a trained counsellor or psychotherapist or psychologist there this one as you go by they will guide you yeah yeah the minimum requirement for the on-site supervisor has to have um they have to be with a professional body secondly they have to have a post um graduate qualification with minimum three years working experience so they have to be registered as a supervisor as well then um the organization and your supervisor when you're on the master's program you have to submit a form then you can once it's approved then you can take that site as your placement all right so um anyone has any other questions okay um you mean upon graduation upon completion of great deep am i able to practice in singapore i got that does this masters of arts from are you make me a certified psychologist psychotherapist to practice in singapore okay like um i think she explained the difference between psychologists and psychotherapists already so this one is not towards being a psychologist this one is towards psychotherapists and counselors hi i'd like to ask a question um with regards to this caution because you're quite counseling and psychotherapy right but i and i seeing the the causes that's being taught they do have focus on cbt and psychodynamic features and all that how is this different from other courses they just call it uh master's in counseling because they also do cover like like uh cbt techniques as well inside the program so like can they if you compete from there and as long as they register with the apec can they also then become a psychotherapist or is this something that only you can do it through this master's program okay so in the modules right what you're talking about the uh uh the postgraduate or the are you uh the masters of uh psychotherapy and counseling okay uh the rohan university one yes okay so for this one right um you're asking about cbt and you know as sfbt and things like that there will be a lot more cover it's not just cbt and things like that these are all modalities don't worry about modality side that because that is um the techniques and uh rather the the really the things that you need to use as a psychotherapies okay so i think the question you are asking is about after this um are you going to be a certified psychotherapist am i right yes like basically is there a difference between this and maybe a person who does just a master's in counseling by covers the similar topics then they can apply under apec right from what i understand that's the body for psychotherapies in singapore yeah usually as long as you have this certification of psychotherapy and counseling and then you apply yourself i mean you do the application with apex then as a practitioner you are considered actually a certified certified or rather record registered psychotherapist or registered or certified practitioner the good thing here is about the school one thing and then also the more in-depth okay ken thank you okay um anyone has any other questions okay any more question about apex i can say this one is a like a very good package it's really a very good package because it's already accredited with um apex so when you say when you are signing up and uh doing your application for apex i mean it is already there we know that this is being accredited already and things like that maybe you want to go to that slide then you can uh you know the the level one level two one so you can go to this slide and then just brief i think some people just came in and all that so you can just explain real quick this yeah so for apex we have the different categories for membership we have student membership we have uh original membership okay we all start from original membership you don't even need to be a certified practitioner to join apex let's say if i'm just a layman i'm i'm very interested in psychotherapy and counselling so i just want to know what's going on in this industry how you know what is it like and then the events and you know some voluntary works and things like that i can join as an original uh ordinary ordinary member okay so as an ordinary member you don't have to do anything we don't practice and things like that and after that follows by level one or rather okay for those students they are student members so as student members they enjoy of course at a lower fee and what's going on and things like that okay after that level one you finish your grad deep you go to level one because you have 150 hours of practicum done and you go to level one then you can start practicing and you can call yourself a practitioner or you can call yourself a counselor or you can call yourself a psychotherapist okay that's level one even for level two level three it's all the thing you call yourself a practitioner already you are already practicing the differences between level one two three and four is just the experience okay any question about this and of course to practice in singapore it's better for you to have this a backup from the bot which is this kind of associations um also with your insurance like you know the medical doctors they have this uh insurance a professional identity so even for counsellors and uh psychotherapists like us we will also need this kind but if your clients sue you in in that sense you don't use your personal insurance to claim and things like that okay and for singapore it's apex for the uk it's the baecp for the master course it is also moving towards accreditation by sac okay so the accreditation here is by apex but not as ac for the counselor for the counseling component of course um you register yourself as a okay accreditation itself is from apex but if you want to join sac as a member you can do so as well it's not that your accreditation is from apex and you cannot join sac we have members from both sac and apex as well so what's the difference between a tax and sac f um actually [Music] okay okay apex stand for association of psychotherapies and counsellors singapore sac singapore uh yeah singapore association of councillors so as they see mainly the members there are councillors so for apex is a very holistic approach so it's counselors psychotherapy and everyone in the i mean whoever i told you their nurses their teachers even engineers they just got a certification for probably like let's say cbt and they just join impacts it's more of like a you know very holistic uh and like health care professional but for sac it's mainly counsellors yeah there are also psychotherapies as well um just that also one thing the difference is that i think as they see the uh what's that called uh requirement for entry it's quite rather uh they're quite 600 hours to complete yeah yeah they have 600 hours to do a registration so that's why we actually go for apex accreditation so you actually have a step by step instead of you know going for sac one so even if you don't um complete 600 hours with them you can't be with the organization so we do almost step by step yeah although apex is like not so uh you're looking like compared to sac it's not so stringent doesn't mean that it's not good because uh we are not like yellow sam cobb like everything everyone will take in okay but we work towards the direction whereby we give people the opportunity like let's say people with diploma really diploma and they want to um go into this field but they are not yet a degree holder in this field so in between they really don't know where to go but they want to help in this case apex also provides some courses between courses for people to take to uh go to level one before they continue with their degree outside and continue their journey so it's really step by step okay okay yes anyone has any other last questions okay then i think you can go on to the slight radical my contact over there okay all right so if anyone has any other questions about the program the masters or the grad tape my name and number as well as email address is over there so anything can just give me a call or whatsapp um after this i will send you all the um maybe the slides something so you can take a look and have a clearer picture so if anything you can just give me a call so anyways i just thank you very much for this afternoon right okay thank you very much [Music] you ,False,True,True,False

Singapore is famous for its cheap hawker food, including the cheapest Michelin-starred meal in the world. Why does hunger, or food insecurity, still exist in this city?

Food insecurity refers to the lack of reliable access to nutritious food due to financial constraints. But we found that it doesn’t exist only among the lower-income or the elderly poor. 

In a two-part special, CNA Insider investigates the issue of hunger, and the efforts to address it in Singapore. WATCH Part 2: Feeding the hungry - and how to do it better https://youtu.be/dLVSKx8Wl70

We spent months talking to recipients of food aid, and groups like The Food Bank Singapore, Free Food From All, Food From The Heart, Keeping Hope Alive, Willing Hearts, Volunteer Switchboard and SG Food Rescue.

UPDATE: Clarifications from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which reached out to some of the profiles with their permission:
- (5:10-34) Income is not the sole criteria for ComCare assistance. Applicants' needs are assessed holistically, such as food, financial debts, healthcare, employment, family-relationship issues, and housing needs. In Sam's case, he approached the SSO in 2015 over rental assistance and declined to apply for financial assistance.
- (9:35-10:40) Azhar has to apply to extend his ComCare assistance every 3 months, because the period of assistance is aligned with the three-month duration of his medical certificates. He had last applied in late August 2019, and submitted his doctor's memo (certifying him unfit for work) on Sept 25. His application was approved a week later, on Oct 3. 
- (9:45-52) Most applications for assistance are processed in 2-4 weeks, once necessary documents are submitted. Almost all are processed within 6 weeks.

yes even there are people but hunger in Singapore is not about having absolutely nothing to eat often it means being able to only afford instant noodles cream crackers canned food and sometimes two degrees all right for you senator please keep a lot of excessiveness so the worst case they thought it was fair right hotel sauna this is food insecurity food insecurity to me someone who don't really know when the next meal is coming one of the issues of food insecurity also is that it's associated with inability to choose the foods that you feel suit your needs in life the best the low-income elderly people larger families working poor people who even though they're working age have legitimate barriers not to work the people who are food insecure are really diverse when fee on fire first met Katie the euro left a deep impression each time when you finish with E I buy some extra food I home with me was every time and no matter there is always a focus the food if we find someone that really need to eat Fei Yan is the founder of keeping hope alive a volunteer group helping residents living in rental blocks across Singapore I was at this corridor and I discovered a little girl every chillness I've been taught that you know don't speak to strangers to nesic strangest food I'm quite surprised when I give it to her I said well oh stop okay she needs the frustration was he's a mother saw one up and that really caught my attention later that week Fiona and her volunteers came back to the house to help Katie and her grand aunt clean up the place [Music] nothing found inside the fish nothing to eat what she survived every day he's on this couch potato chips okay that's all gummy it's a main course there's nothing she can eat when I push open the door what I see inside is it I know that her living condition is not not super powerful her to get to the bottom of the family situation fian spoke to Katie's father the father is a is achiever willing as a real father to bed owners mostly DF but he has to work more than trust hours he really don't have much energy on the daughter Sam is a single father he works as a security officer and makes about 2,000 Singapore dollars a month the problem was for three years most of it went to paying his debts that time my job wasn't stable because I keep falling sick I wasn't able to really say concentrate because of the family issues katie is also hyperactive and some struggles to keep up I did not tell her that a clear very stress I just keep i n could be myself in 2016 Sam stopped working for a couple of months to pay for the household bills he resorted to borrowing from licensed moneylenders that's how he fell into the debt trap every month he had to borrow money just to pay back the previous loan this left him with less than 200 Singapore dollars to spend on food [Music] my Katy receives financial assistance from the Education Ministry and gets one free meal at school a day she don't result is Amman Jordan Godzilla now we are today getting help remains a challenge for Sam's family for households in financial need the concat file offers short to medium term assistance but to qualify applicants need to have a household income of 1900 Singapore dollars or below or a per capita household income from 650 Singapore dollars or below sam's income of 2000 Singapore dollars Falls just shy of the criteria when we think about targeting social welfare services we often have this idea in the back of our heads that we need to do some kinds of means testing objectively speaking there's nothing wrong of that concept because we don't want to waste volunteer time or taxpayer money on people who genuinely don't need the help the risk however is that there are going to be gaps they're going to be households for example who are not adequately outreach to buy that Fame a universal program here in Singapore you'll have for instance the dad is employed but just running from odd jobs odd job and so they are one paycheck away or one sickness away from being in trouble Shango knows all too well what this is like there was a KFC cleaner and the mum was saying many contract jobs are fundamentally new in 2009 his mom stopped working due to vascular disease in her legs a year later his father also lost his job when he was diagnosed with psychosis so when I got five years om Shiva image intended on 15 cents

rice hot-air solder chango's family applied for food rations and financial aid from their family service centre and the Singapore Indian Development Association the Community Development Council also helped with our utility bills but many is [Music] for many people on assistance the money is used to pay off bills first rather than on food hunger doesn't just affect those who live in rental flats some living in purchase plans but there's so many other issues they get embroiled in because of the the timing their age their family situation vahana is a mother of five living in a fall room flat she told us a story on the condition that she will not be filmed I found Bob a misty it's about how we struggle dearly shortly after we moved into the flat leaks and floor cracks developed to do renovations we had to borrow a few thousand dollars from licensed moneylenders my husband earns $1,900 a month as a technician and thus food delivery on the side after paying for our loans bills and school expenses when left with less than $50 for food a week kocha sisters is to provide for those that can immediately see her daily expenses regardless of her housing background look at my sources on revenue look at her savings they don't think of himself is currently looking into community come and I supposed to be working they also look at a family relationship and I stood together that could be kids they could be parents then they can use to support 55 year old aza has been unable to work due to health problems in 2014 he started to get cramps and tremors in his limbs doctors suspect he has Parkinson's disease I cannot want to my 79 for him dog broke my hand as I realize on financial assistance from Comcare and the Islamic religious counsel of Singapore almost each month he receives a total of 600 Singapore dollars every half a year he has to reapply for conquer systems which takes at least six weeks to be approved conch assistance is meant to be a short-term and medium-term assistance depending on the lender circumstance of her family there is flexibility to decide how long the assistance a city in the meantime other talks upon instant noodles and cereal when we met him he had been waiting for more than two months and he was running low on supplies [Applause] the Lisa Concord interim assistance we provide for our journey if you get cases yes it aza hasn't asked for interim help to survivor you know please this man you can mean Kenny the second man we can eat that much come to the same food esteemed Emily I like to work them in sting home no matter I enjoy your own income ICC if I take this medication can cure if can't cure I try my level by better a meal like this doesn't look too bad for one day but what happens if food looks like that every day every month for years to come so to find out we track the diet of serene for seven days and then we consult a dietitian on the long-term effects of her eating habits this is serene and she's 39 years old she is a mother of four teenagers and in your own now serene told me that she has about only 10 to 15 dollars a day to prepare one meal for a family of six so that means that she really has to stretch that budget alright let's take this day as an example now she only had one meal a day which was dinner and she cooked miso soup and potato wedges now serene also told me that usually should have very little of the sides because her children have huge appetites now in this particular day she only had one bowl of miso soup and two three pieces of the and a bowl of white rice and that was just her only meal for today on another day she had curry for dinner which again was the only meal for the day she had some chicken two to three pieces of carrots and also potatoes now you can tell from this two days alone that her mousse generally I'm missing or low in protein and fiber I also noticed that serene users frozen hash browns a lot her muse in general like variety due to considerations like cost convenience and her children's preferences so they rely a lot on frozen deep fried food which are high in saturated fat and can give her a high cholesterol according to the dietitian if serene continues to eat such food with little nutrition copper the fact that she skipped most of her meals she could develop chronic diseases like diabetes malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies but what about when conditions improve do all these problems with poor nutrition go away today Shango is in a better place a polytechnic student he brings home a thousand to her a Singapore dollars from his internship and part-time work the family it's much better now but the years of hunger have left a lasting impact gastro in disorder medicine yeah yeah gastrointestinal disorders our pain is unbearable that's not anybody I I need too much any 8 / 10 dB chuckling hey Doc yes yes okay according to one US study those who experience poverty have a much harder time regulating their food intake this could be due to the years of being conditioned to eat when they can instead of when they are hungry yes this really is what Shango can eat in one meal yeah I think the past impact me alone and now that I'm able to do what I want to do I just cannot let go I finally will get another illness I get a person eating too much can also cost effectively well don't know what thing or not but I thought doctor off life I don't care I want to I really I should but hunger also has a more insidious impact it takes away your ability to plan for the future for single mother nor iron making sure that her children are fed is a daily concern she was left to take care of five children on her own after her husband at the time was jailed as a part-time foot delivery rider she made 300 Singapore dollars a month on average things like having a savings plan or looking for a job with better prospects were far from her mind I have to take care of them like 24/7 make sure they go school make sure that I fetch them from issues to half-pound make sure you eat every day at one time I almost got depressed I cried every night I thinking about what will come tomorrow yeah every night people in poverty have what sociologists called reduced cognitive bandwidth which limits their ability to make better life choices solving the food problem gives them more attention to other things in their life you know upgrading themselves paying bills by an extra storybook you know for their king I think those are important in 2018 I approached the Social Service office for help the first thing they did was set out a plan for her find childcare expediter application for a home and finally help me for job search meeting these needs help to turn the family's life around ever since we have the house then convenient for them to go school just the next door then I have got my own job she is now working in retail as an operation specialist I got me royal and new powdered milk powder from a family service center and every 29 I really like thank thankful to the organization that really have mean like MSF my concealer from like that Lisa V Center indeed for those in need there's plenty of help on the ground from social service agencies volunteer and grassroots groups like this this one Southby has a welfare fund that helps residents type through tough times such as when they are waiting for concurrent systems normally I would do two things when I found that situation I will first ask as I saw see whether they can shorten the waiting time which most of the time they do and the other thing is also we give temporary help and we also work with our foot from the heart they give up bread every Wednesday and give up groceries once a mile for now Sam and Katie have found help in beyond and the volunteers from keeping hope alive they buy lunch regularly for Katie and a grand aunt and are helping to tutor Katie they are working towards helping the family become self-reliant again soon routines are you wanna wheeling around on a few considered Tito marketing Sedna oh yeah fatal doses are all thought up okay how the top of had the New Year's so when your party is when I send in television significantly long term now I have my job to keep the house moving Amir food should not be any problem we believe in mind hopping heads were actually many partners step forward to depart for our society it's very important to be a caring and inclusive society and therefore different players are to be able to contribute to this effort collectively but I think the reality is many households either don't know about the welfare scheme so they won't come forward or they may feel embarrassed at identifying themselves because of the stigma associated with seeking help and this is a real concern because again even though in Singapore we're unlikely to see such families starve they will have to make choices that compromise the longer-run nutrition and health and I think that's what we want to guard against [Music] ",False,True,False,False
130,j7zo6mg3LcI,St. Maurice & St. Verena Coptic Orthodox Church,CREW Meeting - Coping with COVID: The Counsellor in All of Us,2021-01-13T02:37:06Z,,path called mystery called mystery like god does things in our lives that we don't really understand or we don't know how he did it but he just does it right and he works directly at our lives and um us as christians we have this faith and this experience that wow god did something that was that was god or thank god for that right so um the just to give you some examples of that is god works in ways we do not understand he is the one who ultimately gives the increase and we see that in first corinthians 3 7 we said uh paul planted apollos water but god gives the increase right and so we know that god is the one who ultimately uh gives the grace for a specific change and we have to build our faith in his love grace and care for each person and his care because the very hairs of your head are numbered right like the very hairs of your head are numbered that means that god cares about every detail in your life god god knows about it and nothing happens in your life without him knowing and he works directly in your life in addition to this path god also works through others god works through others and um we see in second corinthians 6 1 it says that we are workers together with him like so so we as his people work with him in doing his work right so he even though he does it directly through mystery there's also another path that he works through which is through his people god strengthens the body of christ by making it a resource for itself the body is a resource for itself and and within uh the others path there are professionals where each person has skills and gifts and there's the community where god uses the community to support us i want to give you just um what the bible says about this quickly because i i don't want you to lose these points because what we're going to get to is is really the through others point but i don't want you to miss this whole structure that's happening because this is the full picture of how god works in our lives um in mystery he says but but as it is written i has not seen nor heard nor have entered into the heart of men the things which god prepared for those who love him like there are things that we don't understand we've never seen before there's all this stuff that our ears are never heard before that god has prepared for us right not just in eternity but also in life now because eternity begins now in fact proverbs chapter 20 it says a man's steps are of the lord how then can a man understand his own way and what that means is that sometimes in my own life i am engaged in things that i don't understand and this includes good things and bad things right so i i don't understand my own way completely and also jesus said uh to the disciples he said what i am doing now what i am doing you do not understand now but you will know after this so god is doing things now that we don't understand when it comes to professionals we see in this beautiful book called the wisdom of sorak it's one of the books of the bible it says and he gave skill to men that he might be glorified in his wonders and another later he says and keep in touch with your physician that's a doctor right keep in touch with your physician for the lord created him and do not let him leave you for you need him and this is in the bible like so in other words god is pointing us to the resources that he's given us through professionals and we also know in the book of exodus there was a man named bezalel the son of ruri with wisdom and understanding to be able to design the tabernacle to do all these beautiful works so but and there's a specific person with a specific set of skills and talents and gifts a professional there's a professional who is there to do stuff for god's work right also aside from professionals we have the community itself which which all of us fit into the community and some of us fit into the professionals right but all of us fit into the community um the centurion whose servant was sick sent friends to jesus those friends are the community right he sent friends to jesus and said hey those friends were not experts or professionals they had a job their job was to go get jesus and make that connection right that's what we all do another very popular example is the four friends who brought their fit their fifth friend through the roof it was because he was paralyzed they brought into the roof that i think you can do and i'm giving it to you so you could do it okay so like i want you to be um you know like want to be counselors not but you're not counselors you just want to be counselors okay i want you to be good at this okay and you can do it okay um this is all about sophisticating your thinking and learning some skills and having a new and a broader and a better perspective and we're going to talk about that for the rest of the evening so the first thing you should do is know this something is always going on with the other person something is always going on with the other person you just need to look you just need to look so don't over simplify and uh don't be naive and don't be like over generalize or be too hopeful or wishful in your thinking you should your starting point should always be that there is something going on with the person i'm talking to it doesn't necessarily mean that they need to have like a full blown out conversation but there is something going on every person has pain every person is going through losses especially now right we're going through losses and we have gains too we're losing things and we're gaining things and these losses require a grieving process these losses are not easy these losses are things that everyone is going through i'm going through them we're all going through them stresses and challenges and changes come and go even if you're not dealing with anything right now you will later right others who are dealing with something are likely affecting you and what i mean by that is that if someone is bothering you that's probably the best target or candidate for oh there's something going on with them and they need help and just that's like a really easy indicator if someone is bothering you they're probably going through something you may currently be called by god to support someone who needs something so that's why you need to look for something right you need to look and be aware in the present time you may be the only person that someone is willing to talk to because of your relationship with them or because of your reputation maybe you have a reputation where they just see you as a warm person or a nice person or they just have a good history with you or you're the only person they have history with so sometimes you might be the only person that someone is willing to talk to at this time and you may be the the determinant or that conversation with you or that encounter with you may be what determines whether or not they're going to get more advanced help so you can see that even if you can't do something you might be what determines whether or not something is going to happen in the future to help that person lastly a good example or something that affects why we need to look is time because people change over time and people have different needs over time maybe someone is doing okay right now but over time they're not they're becoming less and less okay because things are changing things have become more or less severe and you have to decide whether or not someone needs a check-in or a follow-up i know um some people who can uh have expressed their disappointment that someone didn't follow up with them after they had a conversation about something a challenge they were facing so think about that can i follow up with someone on a conversation they had with me in the past and see how they're doing are they doing okay your starting assumption should always be that something is going on now i want you to sophisticate your thinking meaning i want you to be sophisticated i don't mean sophisticated and like uh you know raise your socioeconomic class or act as if you uh you know are better than other people i mean sophisticate me make it more complex don't like i want you to de-simplify your thinking i want you to make your thinking complicated okay and make it more sophisticated and i want you to look at dimensions look at dimensions okay because a person is not just uh some little some appearance right a person is not just a box on a zoom screen right there's a lot going on okay so think about body spirit culture social environment family and soul and mind and if i was gonna really make this diagram the way i should make it i was going to draw arrows between every circle like there would be arrows in all directions going in this diagram they'd be everywhere okay because all these things affect all these things okay all these things affect all these things and in each of these things there are things that you can control and things you can't control there are things you can control and there's things you can't control and now let's talk about them these are just a few considerations but there's many more in in your body there are health problems there's brain chemistry there's fatigue there's drugs and medications there's diet there's so many things and you could and i think it's clear to everyone and some of these things you can you have control and in some of these things you don't have control in your soul or in your mind there's negative thought patterns that people have they think that they have sometimes they get caught in a bad cycle of thinking and they have negative thoughts and those thoughts can really lead them down into a really sad place or that they can be really down um there's myths and false beliefs and and this is really frustrating because especially as someone who is trying to help people when you see that they believe something that doesn't make any sense right you you you can't just tell them hey that doesn't make any sense you can't do that especially during covet times right i was just giving a talk the hour before this to a different group and we were talking about how different people have different perspectives on the same exact pieces of information everyone we all have a lot of the same news the same data but we're interpreting it differently we're coming to different conclusions different decisions different behaviors different beliefs right and this is really tough um there are biases and also people have been through trauma or have anxiety and these are things that affect how people think and what there is going on in their minds with your spirit and with everyone's spirit there's sin there's temptation there's this connection from god there's spiritual inertia inertia just means the the force that's keeping you from moving the force that's keeping you from moving and um there is that in your spiritual life that you don't you're not going anywhere right and that's that's difficult also similar to myths and false beliefs there's false theology there's there's misconceptions or or bad or inaccurate understandings about how god works who god is and those things affect how we connect with god and how we see who we are and how we understand how god cares for us with our families there's lots of generational patterns um there's unspoken rules there's poor modeling most of us in our relationships are repeating what happened in our parents in our homes in our families of origin and that's that's bad uh when there were bad models they didn't show us how to um speak with each other they didn't show us how to handle a conflict they didn't show us um how to express affection they didn't show us how to go to god when there's a problem they didn't show us a lot of things um also there's expectations from our families and lots of boundary violations like and what that means is families not letting you lead not letting you leave emotionally or physically or anything like that that's that's really tough in our culture there's a stigma of dealing with mental health and that's very important because um i just actually wrote a blog post about what makes it hard for men to seek therapy what makes it hard for men to seek therapy and uh because it's a known fact among uh health mental health professionals or mental health professionals that um most of most clients are women most mental health professionals are women and um and there's a there's a lot driving that and and so there's a stigma of around mental health in general and then there's another stigma around men getting mental health support right and this is this is this is sad it's so sad because i can tell you from my own personal experience um even just as part of my my training i was required to get therapy for 15 sessions i was required to do 15 sessions that was like the minimum i had to do and and i met that requirement and then i was like this is so great i'm going to do so many more i ended up doing like 40 something sessions for my own therapy and i grew so much during that time and and i i i'm so sad to see anybody missing out on this humongous opportunity to grow it's a humongous opportunity to grow and you saw the list that i just showed you of the things that a professional christian counselor can do with you ain't nobody else going to do that work with you even a priest knows that they don't they don't they can't spend all those sessions with you even if they're trained in doing it they can't spend all that time doing that work right so um the stigma is really making us miss out on a lot of good things there's also expectations from culture like when you should get married how you should be how you should show emotion blah blah blah all that stuff and then there's rigid rules and then in your social environment there's the availability of healthy friends it's good to have friends and especially during colgate times we should have lots of friends and connect with people and we should take any acquaintance and see if there's an opportunity to be a closer um but at the same time not all friends are healthy not all friends are helpful some friends are invalidating some friends don't encourage you to go to god some friends don't encourage you to do good things um and that's that's that's sad and then there's a willingness to deal with vulnerabilities all right you know i'm gonna just say this but um sometimes we don't do a good job of um encouraging each other to be vulnerable and and i don't know uh how uh what the culture is like in canada but i know on you know many parts of the us if guys are talking to each other and one of the guys says his emotion someone's gonna be someone's gonna say aye bro that's gay don't say that like or they'll make fun of the guy for sharing their emotion right and um and there's lots of versions of that among women to um and and just kind of maybe gossiping or maybe like there's just so much nastiness that we all have towards each other and we we need to allow ourselves and give ourselves the space and the permission to be vulnerable um so there are many factors at play to interfere with your emotional health with your emotional health and i'm structuring this talk in terms of you where you being a better like being more emotionally healthy and then how to support others but the first step is begins with you but there are many factors that play that interfere with your emotional health and those factors are things that are in you and things that are coming from everyone else but the point this slide here is showing you the factors that interfere with your personal emotional health everything on the side is affecting your emotional health okay um what is coming from you from you you can't always believe or trust your mind or your heart just because you feel it doesn't mean it's right some people are sometimes you're afraid or anxious but it doesn't mean what you're saying that what you're feeling is right or your thoughts are accurate or your thoughts are complete um when you are hurt you want to avoid further vulnerability which works against your seeking support and that's that's so sad because sometimes when we're hurt we enter into this fight fight or freeze uh response and we we avoid getting being more vulnerable through getting help like because we're like wait i'm hurt so i don't want to be vulnerable but you need to be vulnerable to get help right it's kind of like the person who's sick and they don't want to go to the doctor because they're afraid of what the doctor's going to tell them but you need to know the doctor because you need help right and i mean that not just going to the doctor but going to each other uh change and grief create very similar emotional processes so uh and these are very difficult things when you're going through changes or you're grieving something these are you're in a difficult emotional process and sometimes it's hard to justify emotional work because you don't see the effects immediately and and that's important like why should i talk about something that's difficult why should i get help um and usually and i always love to say this to any client that it took you 10 20 30 years to get here it's not gonna go away in in two sessions or three sessions and i always like to remind the client that sometimes it's gonna get worse before it gets better because you have to go in in order to come out you have to go and work on it it's kind of like uh like you had a wound and it got covered up with all this other stuff if you and there's like a bullet or something stuck inside if you need to get that bullet out you got to open it up then go and get it out right you have to do that work and it's painful um what are other people doing that's or things that are coming from other people that interfere with your emotional health um the past is a very useful but often imperfect reference point sometimes people refer to the past in order to determine what is acceptable in the present and what i mean by that is like um sometimes you were hurt in the past and so because you were hurt by someone else in the past in the present or in the future you have a similar interaction it looks the same but it's not coming from someone who's hurtful or harmful to you it's coming from someone who's good but you use that past experience as a reference point an automatic reference point and you think oh because this looks the same i'm not going uh um this is bad and it's not good for example if you if in your life right now someone yells at you um someone yells at you or someone um uh says something to you and it sounds exactly like how your mom used to say something to you and you never liked that and then that could trigger a lot of emotions from the past because you have that reference point and now you're responding with anger with hatred with bitterness um even if it's to someone who you know and you trust is very good for you um also the past ignores advancements and improvements in life i want to tell you guys we can do things now emotionally that we couldn't do in the past with each other it's kind of like when the wheel was invented or electricity was discovered and we were able to route it to do certain things for us right now we have things like emotional intelligence there was nobody talking about that that framework years like like decades ago so it makes sense that in this generation we're able to talk and do things that prior generations weren't talking and doing and and i always deal with that with older people like like older couples or older families especially if they're struggling with their kids or their marriage is struggling that i see that and they're like wait but why didn't my grandparents need to do pre-marital counseling well the emotional needs at the time were very different right and and now we have more sophisticated needs people around us often fail us when it comes to providing support and that interferes with your emotional health sometimes people are not cool and they really don't help and um sometimes they say very invalidating things like you tell them hey i'm dealing with something like bro i'm going to pray for you i say god has a purpose for you and that's all they say they don't say they don't listen they don't validate do nothing or they say no that's not a big deal or why are you making a big deal out of nothing or many people have been through that before it's going to be okay but these things can may not be helpful and sometimes people are actually say hurtful things and also you may be changing but the dynamics around you are still adjusting to the new you and that's another way that your emotional health can be interfered with so i just want to summarize these key messages so far mental health and emotional health is complex and a vast majority of the time it's not caused by sin it's not a punishment from god okay mental health challenges are uh not coming from uh sin and it's not like god is causing them okay most of the time we cannot separate mental health from spiritual health social health and emotional health we are all relational beings and that means that our growth involves others our recovery involves others to cope with covet for example involves others um also all of us need to be more sensitive to and attune to what is happening emotionally there is always something happening emotionally every single person with no exceptions even me on the zoom call is going through something okay and every person you know all of your family everyone is going through something right now and you just need to be more attuned to it you need to listen for it i'm going to talk about that in a moment um and each person is responsible 100 to get help for themselves so uh what i'm saying to you and this asymmetry is really important i want to just acknowledge this you are responsible to get help for yourself at the same time you help others i so i'm not gonna tell you wait for someone to help you i'm not gonna say that you help yourself get help for yourself and help others okay so that's that's an asymmetry right the other i'm not telling you to wait for someone to help you that that's not on the table okay so that's off the table it's not an option you get help for yourself and help others that's it um all right so how can i help with my own community first is get in touch with yourself and we're going to talk about that the more in touch you are with yourself on all dimensions the more you can support others so you have to know before you can help others where you are where are you where are you and these are five questions that you can ask yourself how much of your life experience is clouding your ability to understand the other's experience so if you're going to try to help someone you need to ask yourself where you are what where am i how much of my life experience is clouding my ability to understand the other person's experience does this does what this person is experiencing remind you of anything in your life for example if you didn't have a good relationship with your father and the other person is complaining about their father are you going to interpret what's going on the way you lived in your life and your relationship with your father that's not right don't do that right you have to understand what's going on with them what's their relationship with their father right maybe your father was a really nice person maybe your father was not a nice person doesn't say anything about their father it just says that they're having a problem with their father and you had a problem with your father doesn't mean they're the same thing right so you have to think about that also the solution that worked for you may not work for the other person so don't rush and just offer a solution that works for you listen more what is your current emotional state are you stressed tired or anxious and of course this applies to all of us right now i think all of us are stressed tired and anxious to some extent so i'm not saying that when you're stressed high or anxious you can't help anyone what i'm saying is if you're not aware that you're stressed how you're anxious that's going to affect your ability to help someone so but when you're about to talk to someone ask yourself what is my current emotional state another thing is what do you want to get out of this interaction what do you want to get out of this interaction and sometimes my brothers and sisters when we're talking with someone um we want something which is introducing a bias and which means we're not free to let that person get to the best place that they can possibly get because we're really trying to achieve our own objective and and that's what i want you to be aware of do you want for example do you want to be credited for solving the problem like so sometimes hey i want to be the person i want to be the guy who helped that person and i want to get that credit or i want a specific outcome and i'll give you even as a christian sometimes we want in that conversation for that person to say oh yes i believe in god god is the answer to all my problems we want them to say that but but we know even in our own lives it takes time it takes time to get there right it's not like someone is going to have this major realization the likelihood of that happening is very low we hope but so we can't just like bombard people with the outcomes that we want for them we have to be patient and support them in letting them discover what is best for them what don't you know like what what um what information don't you have i want you to know that what uh knowledge what skills don't you have and and you have to be aware of that and seek it and lastly what other resources that are available what are what are other resources that are available to or needed for this person these are things that you have to ask yourself so um step one we said was to let me just come back to that side just to see step one is get in touch with yourself and i showed you five ways to get in touch with yourself so that you can support other people now i want to tell you how to support other people okay i want to tell you how to do that okay and this is i want you to focus on these because these are skills and what i love about skills is skills are something you can learn it's kind of like learning how to ride a bike it's learning how to ride a bike these are skills that anyone can learn it doesn't matter what your personality is anybody can learn how to do these things there so and i'm going to call these intermediate skills because i'm going to talk these are much more advanced than uh like making eye contact and uh smiling and having open body language those are the basic skills okay i'm gonna talk to you about some intermediate skills okay so move into and sit in the pain move into and sit in the paint what i mean by that is when someone is expressing to you a difficult thing don't follow that natural gut reaction to pull away from it i want to give you an example one time i was at work and um someone had uh come uh had come back from a trip uh that she was there on her trip for a few weeks and i was passing through the hallway and going to the bathroom and i saw her in the hallway and i said hey welcome back we missed you how was your vacation and she and i was just smiling and i was walking while i was saying it and i was planning to have like a five-second interaction right and then she said oh my father passed away and i went to see him for the funeral and i wasn't ready for that i wasn't ready for that thank god i had some preparation and i knew this piece of this piece of this skill uh before that conversation happened because i was able to quickly change my face quickly just stop slow down try to like embrace what had happened in her life and and say oh i'm so sorry like like that's so sad i can't believe that happened i'm so far away from home and then she started talking and before before we knew it she was crying she was telling me all these things about what happened and her dad and um she couldn't be there in time for to say bye because of kovid and it was a very very difficult situation so um but but the the point here that i want all of you to do it's not i didn't do anything that only i can do i want all of you to do it is whenever you see pain move towards it lean into it okay be there like don't pull away from it okay all right next is slow down and focus as much as you can slow down slow the conversation down stop trying to have conversations about serious topics in 10 minutes or 15 minutes or 20 minutes or 30 minutes slow down okay and and and just tell yourself in your mind this is going to take 30 minutes this is going to take 45 minutes and i'm going to be here for that and focus listen focus uh be careful with distractions of course right this that's an obvious one be careful with distractions but listen to the person listen to the words they're saying follow them like it's almost like they're taking a step and you're taking the step right behind it's like they're walking and you're putting your feet in their footprints and walking right behind them in counseling we call it tracking right but just track the person and and what are they saying what are they what are they going through and all of them be focused okay don't don't lose focus number three is such an easy one is ask at least five questions i really put that there that's kind of like the baseline minimum really ask like ten questions over the conversation but start with asking five questions ask questions don't give advice please don't give advice i can tell you this as someone who has worked with so many people that i have no idea what's going on okay i have no idea what's going on it's not not because i've never seen it before but because what's happening with that person is their experience there's definitely details that um that i that that i don't know until they tell me right you will always be a student of the other person you'll they will always have something to teach you they'll always have something to explain to you don't assume anything ask questions always ask questions okay and let me just say that ask questions don't give advice i just want to make sure that's so important all right now number four is remember that each person's experience is true for them each person's experience is true for them it might not be true in in like in the absolute true way but in that moment until they believe something else that is true for them and and so like we don't want to get into this discussion or this kind of like uh discourse or or cycle or dynamic where we're arguing with someone about they shouldn't see something that way and by the way in relationships this happens all the time um like when when communication breaks down somebody raises a point and the other person says oh that's so such that's no big deal or that doesn't make any sense or why would you say that i think communication just collapses it's kind of just a building like like a a house of cards it just falls right so um you have to remember that when someone is dealing with something that's true for them if they feel like life is over for them at that time they feel like life is over and you have to be there with them and sit in the pain and focus and slow down and ask questions does that sound so easy now i've got i just gave you this formula somebody says hey my life is over oh okay so what do you do when somebody says that move into the and sit into the pain lean in okay slow down focus ask questions what are some questions you can ask oh that that sucks like what's making you say that that's a nice question right what's making you say that and they're going to talk about it and then empathy again like oh so so you're gonna be there it's a long conversation right and now you know what to do and that's true for them please don't say ah no your life's not over of course you're living right now i can see you aren't you breathing of course your lifestyle right don't say that that's not good right and if someone says that you should probably uh try to ask you know if they've made any attempts to take their life um and if they've um if they've in the past or now are they thinking about ending their lives and please don't i should say this right now i was planning to say it later but i'll say it now which is um if someone is uh talking about like ending their life or any sort of danger don't be afraid to ask about it directly you should ask about it directly like are you thinking of ending your life and then and then and you could say um have you taken any steps to end your life how would you do it if you because you want to know if they've planned it out right um and then if if you're finding that this is pretty like uh they're pretty serious about this uh do not leave them like get them to help okay like i'm not saying that you can help them but but you could at least get them to help somehow okay um and if you're unsure what to do you can talk to someone right you can talk to someone um uh about like about what what you heard with that person uh lastly is remember each person in each situation has a different level of readiness and timeline for change and that's really important because not everyone is able like you might see the the path that that person needs to uh go through to get to where they need to be but there's different stages of change and not everyone is ready to go through all those stages right away so that's why you might talk with someone and you feel like they're not ready to change yes some people are not ready to change and that's okay like we're trying to support them and be there for them so that when they are ready they they have a place to go all of this stuff is is is in addition to the commonly known listening skills and things that we've discussed that you guys i'm sure you all know about um as as adults of course and like advanced professionals uh body language eye contact empathy paraphrasing things like that um so before i i have this side and then i just want to tell you some two things about um covid and getting help from a professional um but i want to summarize this stuff so so the first step the first section was becoming in touch with yourself how much of your life experience is planning your ability to understand what's your current emotional state what do you want to get out of the interaction what don't you know what resources are available and then in terms of new skills that you're going to have which i think you all have these skills now is moving into and sitting in the pain slow down and focus as much as you can ask five questions at least remember that that person's experience is true for them and remember each person in each situation has a different level and readiness and timeline uh for change okay now some special covert considerations because what i just said applies to everything all the time but i want to give you some special covet considerations one accept that each person is entitled to see risk differently and and what i said before is that the same set of data and information doesn't lead for each person the same set of decisions and behaviors and conclusions and we see this all the time like there are people right now who are not leaving home there are people who are out partying there so so same information is out there right um so we don't want to see uh assume that everyone's seeing what's different sometimes you and another person are exactly the same in everything except that that other person has someone who's immunocompromised or someone elderly in their life and so they just are dealing with this differently that's just like you don't have to agree with another person's risk assessment in order to be supportive this is where empathy is important just just be empathic try to be in your shoes it's true for them their risk assessment is their risk assessment i'm not telling you what mine is by the way because i don't want you to use that as a reference point and that's not the point right what i'm trying to tell you is it's hard to support someone who has a different risk assessment than yours okay don't challenge their perception of risk unless you feel like they are really really open for it to be challenged and that's not common okay don't assume that your desire to talk about covet is the same as the other person's some people don't want to talk about anymore and some people that's what they want to talk about so but the point is don't assume that your desire is the same as their desire maybe you don't want to talk about it but they need to talk about it because it's really affecting them and they and you're you're their only friend um the physical risks are on covet are one thing and the emotional effects are another someone could be physically safe but they could be alone they could be anxious um they could be depressed they could be going through a lot even if they're physically okay be prepared for the other person to need to have a more serious conversation with you also you need care too connect with supportive and encouraging people almost every day and i just want to say that again even if you feel like it's not making a difference or you don't need it blah blah blah do just do it just do it find supportive and encouraging people every single day and connect with them even if it's for 10 or 15 minutes because what could end up happening for some people is you could be home not connecting with anyone and that's it for for days on at a time and your your soul or your mind is is going through challenges and it's piling up and you don't even realize it until you find yourself really down and in need of a lot of support so connect with people every day um you can say i need to talk i am not doing too well just say those phrases if you need help say it um and know the resources around you and think the community and professionals the last thing i wanted to say before we open it up for questions is the five ds um the five of these are the these themselves not this bullet points under them these themselves come from a good friend of mine and dr mina marham is a psychiatrist he's uh really awesome and um i love serving with him i love him very much and he he helped to um to tell to create this kind of like list to help you think about when do i need to seek a higher level of care and the five these are duty danger duration daily and depth to help you remember them duty is is it affecting your your ability to carry out your responsibilities in your daily life like are you finding yourself not able to work not able to do your assignments not able to uh like meet commitments that you had danger is there any danger to you or to someone else has the issue lasted for four weeks since duration uh frequency or daily how frequently is this happening is it happening every single day every two days every three days and depth like how how like deeply it's just bothering you because sometimes you have like a anxious thought but it doesn't stick or it doesn't come that often so but if it's there and you can't stop thinking about it's becoming compulsive then that's an issue so so that concludes the prepared material i had and we'll open it up for questions for about 15 minutes or so thank you very much sure thank you i hope i didn't bombard you with too much it's a little it's a little bit much but you know what it it's good to hear it regardless okay good good yeah so so the the this i believe is being recorded so you could always uh review again if there was something that you kind of zoned out if i gave too much so you could always listen again makar thank you so much that was full of super super important information especially now um and i i i encourage everybody if you're uh if you're shy you don't want to ask questions uh just directly like on zoom you can send makara a direct message on zoom as well um and that'll be anonymous but please this is this is our chance to ask a professional counselor who's been doing this for so long now okay i have a okay there's a question coming in from an anonymous person i'm excited the question itself hasn't come in yet so this is suspense is very high i see i see that someone wants to ask a question so feel free to by the way direct message me on the chat i'm going to know who you are but i won't say your name um and uh and i'll do my best answer all right so the first question here how do you suppose someone going through the exact same issue you are going through oh how do you support someone going through the exact same issue you are going through someone you care deeply about yeah so um i want to maybe kind of uh reiterate some of the points that that we discussed but maybe just in a different uh packaging which is you being there for them is is means so much means so much you being there for them so and i i want to tell you you know um like i've been serving for for a number of years and sometimes anyone who has been will say the same thing by the way so it's not just me but um that sometimes conversations that you have with people they don't feel like they're going like they're um productive but they're not like going anywhere you're just kind of like they kind of feel like small talk you know or sometimes you do a visitation uh if you in the times when you're visiting people uh like our sunday school kid or something like that or you or you you're calling people that you just to say hi those conversations don't feel very productive sometimes you're just like what was the point of that i just called to say hi or i just visited someone and they weren't even paying attention or whatever but that rapport means so much the rapport means so much having that connection and that open line and that that connection means so much to that person and that person will feel like somebody cares somebody is here i am worth it right and those those things are are the difference between suicide and not suicide by the way if we're going to talk about something as extreme as a suicide but i and someone cares about me i am worth it there is someone here for me that is that that those statements are that's the difference between life and death for many people right so the first point i'm trying to make here is be there for them just ask about them check in how are you doing whatever all that stuff is good even if it doesn't feel very productive even if it doesn't feel like you're solving the problem um then what you can do is you could um uh share your own experience you could share your own experience or you could ask about their experience and talk about it you can just talk about it and that that's going to add another component to this which is uh which is shared experience so so sometimes just knowing that someone else is dealing with what i'm dealing with you're like wow okay i am a lot more normal and i am seeing someone else going through life maybe i can do it too and all of this by the way is without solving the problem so in all of this that i just said none of this involves solving the problem because a lot of times you can't solve the problem yourself um and then of course i would say uh pray for the person and uh and see if you can get them to other resources so i hope that helps and if you feel the person who asks this question if you feel like what i said is not enough you can ask like a more specific question or ask me to touch on a specific point or tell me what obstacle you feel you're facing or why you think what i'm saying won't work because maybe there's an exception that i haven't addressed because what i said is more of like a one-size-fits-all type of answer okay there's another question what are some tips that you can offer in interacting with a close relative of yours who is full of anger and resentment and this person often raises his or her voice when speaking to you or other people thank you for asking that question thank you for asking that question um so first i want to say that god is not expecting you to take any abuse i just want to say that first god is not expecting you or asking you to take abuse like 99.5 of the time sometimes sometimes god gives a person a specific calling to endure abuse abuse but that's only like 0.5 percent of the time like even if you're married i'm gonna tell you god doesn't want you to take abuse right like from your spouse so most of the time if someone is yelling at you or treating you in an abusive way or um or cursing at you or hitting you that is there needs to be we need to intervene okay and i want to make that point clear the church is not asking you to take abuse okay now let's move on to the next part of this which is what do you do when the hospital of yours is full of anger resentment and they raise their voice when they're speaking so um one what you can do is you can like speak calmly and let them express themselves and stop trying to change them usually when someone raises their voice um it's because they feel like they're being constrained and or they're not being understood and what you can do is uh calmly um like pull out from them what they want to say right and like listen to them let them say and um and let let a conversation with someone who's kind of like hot tempered like that let a conversation with them be spread out over multiple conversations okay so what i mean by that is because that person like they get flooded with emotion usually like a person who's hot tempered usually they're flooded with emotion and they don't know how to manage their emotions so if you are trying to have like a usually like a productive conversation they're so flooded they can't get through that whole conversation so what you have to do is break it up into pieces right and so break it up into really really small pieces like for example uh like ask them what's going on and and empathize with them and then and then just go away just pull just end the conversation in a nice way and not in an abrupt way and keep going and then next time you can ask you can bring it up again but now you have you're starting on at another level and your relationship is stronger and they feel more understood and always speak calmly if you lose your ability to speak calmly um then um then you're part of the problem and and don't do that i want to add one more thing where there's a little skill here and this is this you might may or not be able to do this but because it's a little advanced of of um thoughtful interruptions thoughtful interruptions to prevent things from escalating so thoughtful interruptions to prevent things from escalating because what ends up happening is once someone gets to the point where they're raising their voice and they're full of anger it's gonna take probably hours for their physiologically it's going to take hours for their body to calm down right like their body has switched into this mode their heart is racing they're sweating all this stuff is going on so they're going to need it's plenty hours like they can't even do it with their mind their body needs to calm down so it there is value in preventing things from escalating and you can do that by some uh thoughtful interruptions so like for example if you sense they're about to start yelling you can say okay just just one second like before we uh start yelling or let me ask you a question to help my understanding like put it back on you right or whatever it is but think of ways that you can interrupt not in a in a offensive way um but just in a way to prevent things from escalating because the moment things escalate too much you you need hours after that to just calm down to move forward i hope this is helpful um thank you and thank you for your question that was a really good question okay so are there any other questions or comments or concerns or disagreements um i'm also going to check we are live on youtube so i'm just going to check if there are any questions there okay well your audio was very low but i did hear what you thought so sorry okay yeah no i got it just check on youtube uh uh uh while uh while uh we're seeing what's on youtube um i saw some another question came in um how can different socioeconomic statuses between a couple be managed and not deter it from destroying a relationship that's a really good question it's more couple related and not covered related um so uh the way the important question is it's gonna be two parts two parts one is what does money mean to each partner and what does income mean to each partner that's going to be one uh question um and this this matters for both for the one that's the higher socioeconomic status and for the one that's the lower socioeconomic status because both of them if they don't view money and income in a healthy and balanced way they can uh create like a pretty stubborn wedge in the relationship so the way we should view money is one way of providing right it's one way of providing it's not the only way of providing because we also need to provide for each other emotionally spiritually psychologically physically right and so providing financially is one way um and and um it's possible that one person can is providing for their family financially the other person is providing emotionally or they provide um i'll give you a good example like i know a couple where uh the wife makes a lot of money but the husband is really really good at managing the money and so and and and when in working with this couple based on what i'm seeing with them and what they've explained them the problems that they face and what's going on if the wife was left to her own decisions she would have lost lots and lots of money like and not because of um uh foolish decisions necessarily but mainly because of ignorance and not i'm not saying in a critical way i just mean like she didn't she doesn't have the financial savvy to to manage the money well as compared to her husband who has a lot of skills and experience in this area so it's it's almost like she brought in all this money and he the value he added was preventing them from losing all that money so so that that's like such a big thing that that he's bringing into that relationship um uh and also some of his decisions have made money for them as a couple so um so so that's the first part and the second part is going to be is going to have to do with the amount of respect in the relationship which is really important um you know especially these the common i'm gonna say the common scenario even but if it's if you want me to talk about um an exception i can do that too but but the common scenario where couples get stuck is if the wife makes much more money than the husband and so um which can or can't be a problem depending on first how you see money and how you see income and the other thing too has to do with with um the way the executive role is shared in the marriage so what that means is how does the couple make decisions um for example let's say the wife uh like manages people at work and then when she comes home she treats her husband as if she's managing him too right so that's that's not gonna be good right that's not gonna be good because once you get home you're both equals same thing and that would be a problem if the husband was was was was the one making more money and the husband was only managing people aren't working and screening his wife like she works for him like that would be a problem too right so once a couple in this situation if money is uh means like it's not a completely healthy understanding of money if the respect isn't there they're going to be extra sensitive um if they're not respectful and making decisions together i got another question through the chat but i also want to see if there's any questions from youtube first mary are there any questions from youtube okay all right so uh okay there's two uh two more questions that came in so is it okay if i continue for 11 more minutes does that work okay all right um so the next question is does mindfulness and meditation help in dealing with anxiety do they have negative impact on our spirituality since they are byproducts of new age okay so um i it's a really good question um mindfulness and meditation are if you look at them from a christian perspective and apply them in a christian way they can be extremely valuable extremely valuable um so like of course you know if you look into the origins of these things maybe you'll find some bad origins but but that doesn't mean that the the principle itself or the practice itself is bad right so um what what does this mean mindfulness is becoming more aware of the present because anxiety is usually uh coming about fear in the future about the future about the unknown future right this anxiety is there's something in the future i can't control it or i don't know what it is and i'm really worried about it and and then it becomes very uh obsessive and compulsive those thoughts and they become very automatic and they start to interfere with your life so what mindfulness one of the the main thing you do is you want to become in touch with the present right and and there's a verse in the bible that says what everything is good when everything is holy whatever thing is all these things meditate on these things that's what the bible says meditating on good things right so think about the present think about good things focus on those things okay um and when you're being practicing mindfulness or meditation just be really careful not to let your mind go off into um uh meditation or focus on the thing you're anxious about right because that's that's going to be counterproductive and one of the things you can do to ensure that this is uh to to help increase the likelihood this is going to be a healthy process is uh pray for god to be present in your practice of mindfulness and meditation like invite god into it say god please come into this process with me i don't want you to forget that many many of the church fathers many of the monks their meditation is on the jesus prayer right like they're saying lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on your sin and many of you have read the book the way of the pilgrim and it's not just him who says that but that that they they alive they say that jesus prayer with every inhalation of the exhale inhale exhale and they're saying that jesus prayer lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner so so the point here is that meditation is not bad um mindfulness is not bad if you if you practice it in a christian way and and they can be great and meditation and being in touch with the present is so important and there's many verses about it like god said be still and know that i am god right and and where god was heard in this in the silence in that story with elijah right that that and that you close the room on yourself and pray right like you go up into your room and you close the door and you pray all these things are are all very much aligned with these very healthy practices if you practice them in a christian way and invite god into them i hope this helps and again if anybody has any uh like exceptions or obstacles to my answers or auditions please feel free to write them or add them next question i have here is if you reach out to check in or follow up with someone after not having spoken for a while what do you do and how many times do you reach out if they're not responding without being a bother how do you balance or discern whether they need to talk versus perhaps being intrusive by continuing to check on them well i would say um if you don't know of a specific reason why they are not answering you um it's okay to keep trying um maybe once every two weeks and that's fine and also you can change how you're reaching out maybe like with a text message maybe one time with a phone call and and and you can switch it up and once every two weeks should be fine you could also if you if you are comfortable and if it makes sense to ask someone who knows if there might be an issue you can ask around and see and also um you can part of changing it up could also be you instead of asking them for something you can leave that with something like with an encouraging message you can say hey i really care about you i've been thinking about you lately i hope you're doing well that's very different from saying hey how are you how things been right so uh and at least you didn't you didn't get something from them but at least you were able to show them where you stand um but i think unless unless they've told you that they're upset with you or something which is a different kind of situation um i think um you know once every two weeks is totally fine that's that's my opinion um the next question i have here is how do you avoid comparing similar situations from your past to your present use the example using the example you mentioned of this relationship a person reminds me of x so i gotta get out of it asap how do we stop comparing people to our past traumas um well it's gonna be a combination of two things one is processing the past trauma and number two is being very intentional about this person is not who that who that prior person was right so um let me just explain what i mean by those two things one is um in terms of getting through your trauma usually this needs professional help um but but you could there are books out there that you could read that could guide you through the process as well or give you so much insight that you end up like kind of uh bouncing or growing through it by having all this insight and awareness um so what what that means is um if you've experienced trauma you were hurt and you need to get to a point where you forgive that person it doesn't mean you need to reconcile with that person if they're still unsafe or if you don't feel ready but it means that you need to forgive them that's an internal process that's not something you have to do with them you don't need to tell them i forgive you but in your heart you need to forgive them that's not something to be rushed and the steps that happen before that are painful because you have to be specific about the offense that you experience you have to be specific about how it affected you you have to be articulate your anger towards that person and you have to be clear about that and you can do that through writing a letter for example to that person and not giving it to them but you can say hey i really hate you for what you did to me and i can't believe that you did this and you said that and this is how it made me feel and i trusted you and all of that and then after you go through that difficult and painful process you forgive the person you say i release you i forgive you i do not hold this against you anymore um it doesn't mean you have to go back to that person because some people are still unsafe even if you've forgiven them right uh so that's that's what you need to do right because if you don't forgive them that's unresolved so that's going to manifest itself index in your next relationship so that's why you need to resolve it now how do you avoid uh um seeing making that connection when when you're dealing with another person is also making you can make a list of how that person is different from the person who caused the trauma literally make a list you can make a list of um how this person loves me how this person cares about me what are the indicators of this person caring about me what are the indicators of them loving me how is that person different literally write down the list of 10 to 20 things and and that list is going to help you because once you articulate it for yourself it becomes more tangible and real and you're going to see that this person is not my mother is not this is not a dad so i hope that helps so i don't think we're going to have time for another question but it was really a blessing to be among you guys i love this so much and you're such an awesome group and you uh ask such great questions um so that by itself makes me encouraged and it says a lot about you guys so thank you so much for participating uh makar thank you so much for making the time to be with us i know you're extremely busy um and your help is needed by many people right now so we really really appreciate your time and um just your presence um and and and your expertise and we're so so so grateful that you've been with us and you've been able to answer these questions so well i'm just wondering would you mind putting in um your contact information in the chat for people in case they want to get a hold of you after sure sure i'll send it over right now so make sure you get and then teresa also also has my email address so feel free to share this email address yeah amazing um also do you mind just sharing on your screen i'll take a screenshot and keep it on the two questions actually because i'm having tech issues at the moment um of the two discussion questions that you mentioned oh sure yeah yeah i'll send those over so macar has graciously kind of given us a couple of um really great insightful questions that we can discuss in small groups that should kind of help us think about things a little bit more individually and as a group too and this has been really really helpful i think for a lot of us i am sending them right now thank you i'm so sorry i've had too many challenges this evening that's okay that's okay [Music] all right ,True,False,True,False

Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",of course our covet 19 response was not without shortcomings covet 19 has severely tested every government in the world no country has been perfect in its pandemic response some have done better than the rest like south korea and new zealand but even for them the fight continues with new cases surfacing as they open up again with hindsight we would certainly have done some things differently for example i wish we had known earlier that people with covet 19 were infectious even when they were asymptomatic didn't show any symptoms then when we brought singaporeans back home from all over the world in march we would have quarantined all of them earlier instead of only those returning from certain countries so that the virus did not spread to their family members or their colleagues and friends and we would have tested all of them before releasing them from quarantine whether or not they showed any symptoms instead of assuming that no symptoms meant no infection we would also have recommended that everyone wear face masks sooner than we did but at the time we took the best available scientific advice once the who recognized that asymptomatic transmission was a major problem we changed our policy and distributed face masks to everyone we would also have acted more aggressively and sooner on the migrant worker dormitories we knew that commoner living in the dorms pose an infection risk communal living in any form poses risks on board ships and army camps and student hostels nursing homes we stepped up precautions for a time these seemed adequate but then bigger clusters broke out in the dorms which threaten to overwhelm us all this is wisdom after the fact we must learn from these errors and do better the next time but in the fog of war it's not possible always to make the perfect decisions yet we have to decide and move we cannot afford to wait the key is to watch things closely learn from experience and adapt our responses promptly as new information emerges and as the situation changes because of the scale and complexity of our operations they have inevitably been some rough edges for example now that we have cleared the dorms we are helping the migrant workers resume work especially in the construction industry but this has to be done safely because the risk of cases re-emerging is still there and it is a complicated exercise i know we have made things more difficult and burdensome for employers especially the contractors and subcontractors they have found it frustrating to deal with all the new rules approvals and inspections even as they try to get their businesses up and running again but i hope that they understand that we are doing our best to smooth things out for them and are doing all this in order to keep our people safe it's better that we make these measures work and get businesses to operate safely than to suffer a new outbreak and have to shut down again overall we've been able to deal with covet 19 only because the public service the political leadership our businesses and the singapore public have worked closely together each doing their part and more in the public service the officials the ministries and agencies have worked tirelessly building new capabilities on the fly and stepping up to do things way beyond their normal scale or scope without a high quality dedicated and adaptable public service we could not have carried out all these major operations the political leadership has also played a role to define the priorities to make the major decisions to direct the civil servants implementing the decisions with public win public support for these measures and take responsibility for them for example whether to impose a circuit breaker what activities to restrict which businesses to keep open whether to close schools or reopen them we explained these decisions to the public at frequent press conferences video addresses and in parliament so that singaporeans understood what we were trying to do and what each of us individually had to do these are the responsibilities of the ministers and ultimately of the prime minister and the cabinet without political leadership the public service alone could not have done their job businesses came forward also to do sterling national service they put their people to work furiously on solutions often going well beyond their business mission they set up mask production lines constructed community care facilities built up testing capacity scoured the world for test equipment test kits and reagents and design booths to swap patients safely and much more their contributions were a vital complement to what the government agencies were doing our covert 19 response also depended critically on singaporeans working together and giving the government their trust and support they understood the need for tough and painful measures and complied with them many singaporeans lives have been severely affected but they have borne these difficulties calmly and stoically they had confidence that the government would see them through the crisis and beyond many volunteered to take part in the covet 19 operations sometimes on the front line and also in the community efforts to help others through these tough times i'm very grateful for their cooperation and support their support will remain crucial as we continue the fight to keep singaporeans safe the situation is currently stable but we must not let our guard down a recent strategy survey showed that almost half the respondents were weary of the safety measures the irony is the more successful we are in keeping cases low the more people wonder whether all these painful measures are necessary i recently received an email from a university student his socializing had been disrupted he complained that our reaction to covet 19 was one of the greatest overreactions to a public health issue as proof he pointed out that our hospital systems were far from overwhelmed he said that instead we should let young singaporeans do us the service of achieving herd immunity you only have to look at the situation in other cities that have let this happen to imagine how this could have turned out for us the covet 19 virus remains as infectious and potent as is was before this has not changed what has changed is that we have taken measures and we have built up our capabilities to contain it if we relax these measures now because the numbers have come down we will have a resurgence just look at europe and many other places in the world covet 19 will not be our last public health crisis sars was 17 years ago in 2003. after stars we knew that sooner or later another novel pathogen would appear and pose a threat to humanity we had h1n1 which was highly infectious but fortunately turned out to be relatively mild then there has been ebola but we escaped it because it was confined mainly in some african countries next there was mers the middle east respiratory syndrome but fortunately that's not so transmissible and we've been lucky not to have had any cases here although the koreans had they had an outbreak they learned painful lessons from it and the lesson served them well when covet 19 came scientists talk about disease x being overdue disease x a new disease unknown that is highly infectious deadly and mutates easily so when comet 19 appeared people asked whether this was disease x covet 19 has been a disaster for the world but it is not disease x it is by far not the worst new disease that can befall mankind but it is only a matter of time before disease x happens so we had better learn from covet 19 how to deal with a pandemic and be as ready as we can should the worst one when the worst one befalls us we should build up our resilience our instincts our preparations so that when disease x comes one day we will be prepared ,True,True,False,False

hello@yougotwatch.com","Because the cabin is very dark, it was a long-haul flight,   Then the guy was just touching the woman's boobs, 
then the head was like... Hi, I'm Claire. And I'm Kay. Today we'll play Spill It! And we'll share what it was like 
to be a cabin crew in Singapore. I'm Kay and I was flying with Singapore Airlines 
for five and a half years. I joined Singapore Airlines right after I graduated and now I'm actually a property agent. And my name is Claire, I've been a cabin crew for six years. Currently, I'm a full-time makeup artist. Actually, at first, we were like looking at each other 
like you know the Wong Fei-Hung sparring that scene... Oh, okay. I don't know her. Then after that, I'm like hmm... She told me ""Eh, we went to FIFA World Cup you know."" In Moscow. Oh ya, how can I forget! To start the game, each player will draw five 
question cards from the deck. Players will then take turns choosing a question card 
from their hand to ask the opponent. Players will also be given three action cards each 
but they can Skip, Switch or Spill at any point of time. For Skip, you skip the question. Switch, get your opponent to answer instead. Spill, you get to ask a follow-up question!  First question, have you ever had a crush on your passenger? Not yet, not yet. Maybe, call me... Actually I want to share one story. Like India flight, you know India right the elderly they like to do this... Do they? Yeah! They like to do that! They always do that to you only.  Then after that I ask my India flight stewardess, 
""Eh, why they do this to me, ah?"" Then they say ""Oh, cause you're pretty. 
They want to intro the son to you."" HUH? I don't want, I don't want. On the infamous nasty crew list, 
have you flew with any one of them before?  I would like to say that this nasty crew, 
they actually are not nasty on every flight. I have flown with one of them before but he's very nice... I flew with one or two. So many? I think one or two is enough for me to like 
""Oh, I'm done. I'm done, girl!"" So before flight right, we have a briefing . Briefing time maybe 30 minutes. So before we start right when you step into the briefing room, 
you have to shake hand with every one of them. Imagine, you're the last person who stepped into the briefing room. Wah, so scary. Oh my god. Then you must open the door, ""Hi, good morning.""   Then you must shake the hand. ""My name is blah blah blah..."" Twenty times ""My name is blah blah blah..."" Then the nasty crew right, she only nasty at the briefing room only.  So she was like using her handphone... Hmm, like that. She sit down, eh! Because normally when people shake hand with you, 
you will like stand up right. Then she just sit down. Then I was like ""Siao liao, this flight siao liao..."" I like this one. You got to answer, very juicy... Are you sure? Have you ever came across a mile high club meaning like in the airplane toilet you know hanky panky?  Err... I have not see any or witnessed any among the crew. But I've seen a passenger... With passengers? Like I think they very long never do already... But it was because the cabin is very dark, it was a long-haul flight, I think they were in the last few seats right, 
then guy was just like touching the woman's boobs. Then the head was like... True or false, you must be good looking to be a cabin crew. OHHH... this question! Do you think I'm good looking? Of course. Hit the like button right below! To be frank, definitely there's a certain standards, Whether is it true...yes. Some say the flying culture is toxic, so how true is that? I would say I had my fair share of experiences. But I wouldn't say toxic, really toxic you know. Like any other workplace, you will have this... it's normal. You have people talking about other people and like you have backstabbing sometimes but not on every flight.  So could you share like did you witness any? Okay lah, Spill! I mean you know like juniors right, they don't really... 
sometimes they are a little bit slow, So we have to be more understanding towards them.  We all started there right so there was just this stewardess 
who was not very patient with her. And she went around the plane and to tell us about this person. I guess, it's very poor thing for her you know 
to experience something like that.   Is it common for cabin crew to cheat on 
their partners since they are always abroad? I would say it's two ways. Sometimes, it's the cabin crew that's very very loyal 
but the partner is having a lot of things going on. That's very true... I think maybe why people have this perspective is because we are overseas number one, number two we have hotels.   Okay, the story is right, this lady she is in red colour. She's been dating with this steward, red colour as well for very long. I heard it's very long, she's been very single 
and staying single for him. But this guy has a wife. So one day when the automatic gate open, she came out. Then right somebody in home clothes came over say something... Then slap her in her uniform. I was like holy shit... Tell us your worst experience with a passenger or your colleagues. There was just this passenger who... so you know she was sitting at the bulkhead seat, because usually at bulkhead seats, 
you have to put your back up in the overhead compartment. Like just in case for takeoff and landing, when the plane takes off right sometimes it may like you know fly off or something. It's just for safety reasons that you have 
to store all your luggage into the overhead compartment. So for her, she refused to stow it. Then my colleague was telling her nicely ""Oh, could you just stow your bag in the overhead compartment?"" So she said like ""It's your job, you should do it."" What are some of the unwritten rules in this profession 
that most people do not know? Do you know even the bun, there's a measurement to it. How many cm? 6 to 6.5. And there's a height also, you have to be like at two o'clock I think? Three o'clock And you know the hump right, they call it a hump, 
it cannot be too high, it has to be round. But the hump kind of like represents your seniority   Yes! When I just started flying like you know three years in, 
I feel like okay I kind of know my thing, so the hump slowly gets higher and higher, there was at one point my hump was so high actually I got complained. You can get complaint as well. Because your hump cannot be higher than the red colour. Another thing is when you want to eat your meal, you need to ask people around you ""Have you eaten?"" ""May I have a meal first? Would you like to have it first?"" At the hotel lobby, we always have to wait for the seniors to get their keys first before we can go ahead to get our keys. when someone comes into the galley that 
you are working in, you actually have to offer them a drink, or like if you want to drink, like if you want to get yourself a drink, It's usually you have to ask everybody first 
if they want, ""Does anybody else want to drink?"" Or you just pour like for everybody. What is the most common misconception 
that people have about cabin crew?  That we are bimbos. Are we? Actually we are trained in a lot of things, especially safety-related. We have to know where all the safety equipment for every of the different aircrafts are like in case of evacuation or ditching, Like what do we have to do? What are the step by step procedures? And we actually go for training every year 
to refresh our recency you know. What is the strangest request you have gotten on the plane? I will Switch! Switch card! You know in in economy or in business, 
we actually have choices for meals right. So there was this passenger, she said ""I can only eat my chicken with potato and I cannot eat the fish with the noodles..."" Which is what we usually have. Very particular... So correct, the strangest one was when 
she asked me to switch the meals all around. I told her you can choose one of the meals first and like you know if we do have like extras, then we can accommodate to your request.  What is the most embarrassing 
thing that happened to you while on board?   Actually me tripping over was quite a... I tripped over in front of the passengers like while I was on the... Day time? Yeah correct, that's because I was just looking straight and there was this passenger who had his legs like sticking out. So I just tripped and fell face flat on the floor. What your favorite part of being a crew? I guess I have to thank the company for selecting me to be part of the staff because it really gives you a lot of experience. You can be experiencing winter today 
and tomorrow it'ss summer time. Like even for us, we didn't plan for the Moscow trip. We went to Moscow but we didn't know it was FIFA World Cup. Yeah, so we wanted to purchase the ticket 
to the match but it was sold out, So we said ""Let's go for the carnival! Everybody was like... COVID happened in March 2020 right, where the CB lockdown... So I did my last flight in March 2020 actually to London. After I came back, I didn't have like any flights all the way. And I was on no pay leave for a while so it kind of like affected 
the whole flying aviation industry as well. And that was also one of the reasons why I 
decided to look into another alternative which was property. For me, I would say blessing in disguise because actually, 
I was thinking of quitting the industry. Yeah because about time you know set up my own family, 
contribute to the nation. Thank you for having us on this episode of Spill It! If you want to see more, don't forget to like and subscribe! Bye! You must do SQ one. Oh yeah, oh! ",True,True,True,True

The Straits Times, the English flagship daily of SPH, has been serving readers for more than a century. Launched on July 15, 1845, its comprehensive coverage of world news, East Asian news, Southeast Asian news, home news, sports news, financial news and lifestyle updates makes The Straits Times the most-read newspaper in Singapore.",good afternoon i'm haryana diman now thanks for joining us on sd live it's almost 4 p.m and in just a few moments singapore's prime minister lisa long will be speaking to the nation on the country's strategy for tackling kovit 19. now what is he expected to announce well in a facebook post yesterday he said that a solution was testing contact tracing and vaccinating all faster and more he'll also be sharing with singaporeans what the new normal will be like now for the past two weeks since may 16th the country has been in phase 2 heightened alert which means no dining in and restaurants and hawker centers no social gatherings larger than two people and no working from the office unless it's absolutely essential the titans restrictions will remain at least until june 13th meanwhile let's take a look at where we are now after the spike from late april onwards in a sign that the measures may be working the number of locally transmitted cases has since stabilized but clusters are still forming now seven cases are linked to a new cluster at ntuc food fair at 308 anchorville road and investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at the coffee shop to help companies and individuals tied over this period the government on friday announced an 800 million dollar package of support measures including enhanced wage subsidies under the jobs support scheme as well as rental relief now our prime minister lisa roon will be joining in and of course addressing the nation in just a few moments as you can see in the box right there we will now go over for the last three weeks we have been on heightened alert we had discovered new clusters of covet 19 infections one cluster at tantoxing hospital and then another at changi airport more cases soon followed we also started seeing unlinked cases implying community spread so we had to step back from phase three we went on heightened alert to reduce social interaction and new infections everyone has responded to cooperate on the measures we had to take offices malls and the streets are all visibly quieter because of your support the number of daily cases has come down barring another super spreader or big cluster we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control we will know for sure in another week or so meanwhile i count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigilant please continue to stay at home work from home if possible and go out only if you must most importantly if you feel unwell see a doctor immediately even if you have been vaccinated if our situation continues to improve and the number of community cases falls further we should be able to relax the restrictions after the 13th of june compared to a year ago when we had our first big outbreak we are in a much better position today we have built up our testing and contact tracing capabilities crucially our vaccination program is well advanced with stronger defenses in place we've not had to impose a full circuit breaker unfortunately we are also fighting new more infectious variants of the covet 19 virus the b117 variant which was first detected in the uk has become widespread in the u.s and many other countries we are now dealing with a b16172 variant which was first detected in india and is now in over 50 countries more variants will inevitably emerge and we'll have to deal with them too what does the more infectious virus mean for our fight against covet 19 it implies that we must continually adjust our strategies and raise our game to keep covet 19 under control specifically there are three things that we have to do more of and do faster testing contact tracing and vaccination let me briefly explain the multi-ministry task force will provide details later on first we must test faster and more liberally and extensively this will enable us to detect covet 19 cases more quickly so that we can isolate them and ring fence their contacts promptly before the virus spreads further many different types of covet 19 tests have become available for example antigen rapid tests art saliva tests breathalyzers waste water surveillance even sniffer dogs we've been using some of these and evaluating others for some time each of these new tests is suited to different use cases for example antigen rapid tests arts produce results much faster than the pcr test the polymerase chain reaction tests that we have mostly relied on arts are also cheaper and easier to administer however they are less sensitive than pcr tests and may miss some cases that are actually covet 19 positive arts are therefore invaluable as a quick check if you visit a gp or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection you will be given an art in addition to a pcr test within 30 minutes the art will show whether you are likely to have covet 19 if the result is positive you can immediately be isolated and the pcr test will confirm your diagnosis later which may take a day or two that way we reduce your chances of infecting others if you're already ill but don't realize it other tests are coming on stream breathalyzer tests which take just one minute have been set up at the causeway and the airport they can be deployed to many other places too and soon you'll be able to purchase diy tests over the counter at pharmacies they are simple to use and not so uncomfortable you can administer these on your own if you are worried that you may have covet 19 and want to put your mind at ease or if you are a front line worker and want to test yourself frequently or even daily these alternatives to pcr tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious this will be a big help in slowing down the spread of covet 19. as the virus mutates to become more transmissible we must respond by testing more widely we already do rusted routine testing rrts in a number of higher risk settings migrant worker dormitories construction work sites shipyards air and sea ports hospitals and nursing homes with faster cheaper tests we can do routine testing at more workplaces like offices restaurants and shopping malls we can also routinely test individuals whose occupations involve close contact with many people and could result in super spreading events like taxi drivers and bus captains physiotherapists and massage stage performers sports and fitness instructors and educators all could be tested regularly this will reassure their customers patients and students and enable them to work safely even with covet 19 in circulation in short we are shifting our approach to testing henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up we will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well in normal work or social or community settings to make them and these places safe extensive testing will give us confidence to resume larger scale events or gatherings for example we can deploy fast and easy tests before a religious service a football game a concert or a wedding reception and participants can be assured that the event is covet 19 safe therefore you should expect routine large-scale fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal second we will contact trace faster and more widely our contact tracing operations have vastly improved the contact traces are working faster and better because they have more experience and skills and better tools trace together helps them identify and quarantine close contacts of an infected case within hours rather than days with safe entry they can identify thousands of people who had visited the same places as infected cases and inform all these potential contacts to come forward for a free covet 19 test this is what we did for white sands gem west gate and now ntuc food fair in anchorvale because of singaporean self-discipline public spirit and support of trace together and safe entry we are contact tracing faster and more comprehensively we can improve our contact tracing further by casting the net wider our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household therefore in future when we identify a close contact of an infected case we will not only isolate him himself the first degree contact and test him for covet 19. we will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately without waiting to see whether the first degree contact tests positive if later the first degree contact test negative we can safely release his household members from isolation but if later the first degree contact test positive we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier this more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly and with fewer cases third we will vaccinate more people and faster we've made good progress since vaccinations started in december our healthcare and frontline workers and the majority of those 45 and above have already received at least their first dose these are the ones more at risk from covet 19. now vaccination of those age 40 to 44 is underway the mtf recently announced that we would speed up vaccinations in the next two months and prioritize first dose vaccinations this is in progress we want to protect as many singaporeans as possible as soon as we can especially with the new covet 19 variants this approach will quickly provide the maximum number of people with good protection instead of a good number of people with maximum protection we are vaccinating as many people as our supplies allow our 40 vaccination centers island-wide are running smoothly the constraint is vaccine supply this is why we've been working very hard to confirm and speed up deliveries of vaccines from our suppliers i'm happy to report that since the last update by the mtf we've received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months with the latest supply schedule we can further boost our vaccination program we can offer the vaccine to everyone even sooner than we expected the next group to be vaccinated will be students in this latest outbreak we've seen more cases of children getting infected in schools and tuition centers the children were not seriously ill but parents are naturally worried therefore we will take full advantage of the june holidays to vaccinate students bookings will open tomorrow we will give priority to the graduating cohorts for o n and a levels as well as special needs students then the other students 12 years and above will take their turn including students in our institutions of higher learning after the students we will vaccinate the final remaining group young adults 39 years and younger this should start around mid-june this group is quite large therefore we will give the singaporeans among them a two-week priority window to book your appointments first before we open up generally to the rest who want to be vaccinated finally i want to make a special pitch to our elderly your response has been excellent nearly three-quarters of our elderly 760 000 senior citizens aged 60 and above have had at least one jab or booked a slot already but 280 thousand of you have still not yet booked appointments please come forward to get jab as soon as possible most people of your age have already been vaccinated including many of your friends and neighbors the president and i have been vaccinated too and so have all my cabinet colleagues the vaccines are safe and they will keep you safe we will make the process even more convenient for you if you are above 60 you can now walk into any vaccination center and get vaccinated on the spot no need to register no need to book in advance just turn up at the vaccination center and you will be jabbed if you are not mobile or unable to make your way to the vaccination center contact the silver generation office a doctor and nurse will visit you at your home to give you the vaccination for those with elderly parents or relatives please encourage and persuade your old folks to get vaccinated today nearly four in 10 residents have had at least one dose of the vaccine our next target is to get two-thirds of residents vaccinated with at least the first dose with our accelerated vaccination program we should be able to do this by early july provided supplies come in as planned and everyone who is eligible for a vaccination and wants one should be able to get at least their first jab by national day whether you're old or young please come forward to be vaccinated once it's your turn with a more infectious virus strains we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity or get close to it this is the way to make everyone safe and resume more normal activities even as we tackle our covet 19 situation the pandemic religious on around us many countries are still not able to bring it under control fully much less eliminated india has suffered a huge surge of new cases although their numbers are now coming down in southeast asia many countries have not started vaccinations in a big way and may see more spikes in the next few months malaysian cases have been rising and they are just entering a nationwide full lockdown even places that have kept covet 19 well under control like taiwan australia and vietnam have recently experienced outbreaks one day this global pandemic will subside but i do not expect covet 19 to disappear it will remain with humankind and become endemic the virus will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come this also means we'll see small outbreaks of the disease from time to time in singapore as well in this new normal we'll have to learn to carry on with our lives even with a virus in our midst our aim must be to keep the community as a whole safe while accepting that some people may get infected every now and then just as we do with a common flu or dengue fever which we now manage through public health measures and personal precautions and in the case of the flu with regular vaccinations too covet 19 vaccinations will not entirely prevent you from getting covet 19 but the vaccinations make this much less likely and if you do get sick despite being vaccinated you are also much less likely to become very ill living with endemic covet 19 also means we don't completely close our borders we need food essential supplies workers business and other travelers to keep on flowing we must stay connected to the world with effective safeguards and border restrictions to keep ourselves safe we will not be able to prevent some infected persons from slipping through from time to time but as long as our population is mostly vaccinated we should be able to trace isolate and treat the cases that pop up and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak singapore's priority is to get through this pandemic and position ourselves strongly for the future even as the virus continues to rage around us if we stay united and continue to work together we'll be able to progressively open up and achieve our aim in the new normal covet 19 will not dominate our lives our people will be mostly vaccinated and possibly taking booster shots every year we will get tested often but it will be fast and easy we'll go to work or school meet friends and family participate in religious services and enjoy entertainment and sports events we will reopen our borders safely visitors will again come to singapore singaporeans will travel again to countries where the disease is well under control especially if we have been vaccinated and eventually we will even go about without masks again at least outdoors right now we are some ways off from this happy state but we are heading in the right direction in this new normal the countries which are united disciplined and put in place sensible safeguards will be able to reopen their economies reconnect to the rest of the world grow and prosper singapore will be among these countries more confident and resilient than before and toughened by what we have overcome together and experience together as one nation i have outlined our strategy for the next phase of the fight against covet 19. to keep our people safe while reopening progressively we have to test we have to trace we have to vaccinate and we have to do all three of these more quickly and more extensively the heightened alert has two more weeks to go i thank singaporeans for your forbearance cooperation and support each individual effort counts our collective discipline and social responsibility have served us well and taken us thus far let us go the distance together as one people so that we can look forward to a new normal and emerge as a stronger and more united singapore thank you in the battle against kobe 19 with the support of all singaporeans we have made progress in rolling out vaccination program expanding our testing capacity and enhance our contact tracing capability but the next few months will be critical we are in a race with a virus the virus will attempt to spread wider and faster and therefore we need to do more and do faster too in vaccination testing and contact tracing minnesotan yikang will talk about accelerating vaccination and expanding testing capacity while minister chan chen singh will focus specifically on vaccination for the education sector overall the kovi 19 situation remains extremely fluid malaysia has just announced that they will be implementing a full movement control order phase one for two weeks starting from tomorrow we are working with malaysia to ensure continued flow of essential supplies between our two countries i visited fair price and ych over the weekend to better understand the measures that have been put in place to ensure that there is sufficient food in essential supplies for all we have been working closely with the relevant agencies and companies to build up our existing stock further diversify our sources of food and essential items while also increasing local production i want to assure everyone that we have ample supply of food and essential items but please remember to only buy what you need our economic agencies are also working with companies especially those dealing with essential goods and services to minimize disruption to their supply lines as the pandemic continues to evolve globally we must remain prepared and vigilant as a nation while staying flexible and adaptable it has been two weeks since phase two heightened alert the overall impact on singapore's gdp is expected to be modest the impact of the measures will differ across different sectors domestic consumer oriented sectors such as food and beverage services retail and land transport will see a greater impact on the other hand the impact of these measures on outward oriented sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and finance and insurance is likely to be less severe last friday minister lawrence wong announced various support measures for business segments that have been significantly affected by these measures mti and the economic agencies are reaching out to the various companies as well as the trade associations to continue to work with them and to continue to monitor the situation even as we do our best to manage the situation at hand mti will continue to give businesses our full support to help them transform and seize new opportunities when they arise and now let me say a few words in mandarin zone vaccination and testing thank you and hello everybody it's been slightly over two weeks since we started the phase two heightened alert posture on the 16th of may so that is slightly over one infection cycle moh has been monitoring the data and the epidemic situation in singapore so let me give some updates on how well we have been doing under this phase so let me share with you some insights by dividing the past 14 days into two halves the first seven days which is 17 to 23rd may and then the next seven days which is 24th to 30th may top line numbers first seven days we have 182 cases the next seven days we have 136 cases so the number of infections have fallen by some each day's number when we read the papers the daily numbers it can actually be broken up into three subsets the first is those who are linked to a cluster and already quarantined this group we are not very worried because they are quarantined they were in quarantine when they were discovered they were detected which means there was no chance for them to move around and infect others next group is those who are linked to a cluster but not quarantined so for example when we did special ops for westgate and jam we tested many people who visited the malls and then they were infected but they were not quarantined it could be because they didn't come into very close contact with an infected person but it was enough to get infected so this is a group slightly more worried but they are linked finally the third group the unlinked and this is the most worrying group because unlinked cases means they are quietly transmitting the virus in the community and the fewer there are unlinked cases the better so for the first seven days i talked about 57 of all cases are linked and quarantined this is the group we're least worried about 21 percent are linked but not quarantined and 22 percent are unlinked so 57 21 22 in descending order of worry for the last seven days the breakdown is 57 25 18. so unlinked cases have come down from 22 of all cases to 18 in absolute numbers it has also fallen 39 to 25. so the more we can shift this number away to link cases or better still linked and quarantined cases the lesser will be the spread of the disease and the more we can bring the overall number down and suppress this wave of transmission in addition to this there are a few encouraging signs with how we are handling the current wave one is close to seventy percent of all linked new cases every day are due to household transmissions they are transmitted within the households and not out in the community and for those who are transmitted in the community they are not due to dramatic movements like parties or whatever but usually uh the the movement patterns are quite mundane home work darpa food you know grocery shopping and so on and thirdly other than the gem westgate cluster there were no major transmission settings over the last 10 days so all in all we are nudging in the right direction but just nudging you know and controlling the situation and we are constantly improving our contact tracing and quarantine protocols but this wave of infection is not over and we must continue to stay alert and vigilant in order to suppress it further and one major strategy to do so is testing which the prime minister just spoke about in his broadcast because to the testing is essential for us to quickly detect and isolate those who have been infected when we detect a cluster we carry out mass surveillance testing of persons with possible exposure to the infected cases and in the past month we conducted close to 40 special operations across the island targeting housing blocks supermarkets malls the seaport the airport so on schools as well so in the second half of may we conducted on average 55 000 pcr tests a day or more than pcr and art tests a day let me repeat that so in the second half of may we conducted on average over 55 000 pcr and art tests per day all that translates into more than 76 500 individuals tested per day and we will continue to step up the number of tests and one change that we are implementing is what the prime minister spoke about fast and easy test strategy so moving forward we will extensively roll out fast and easy tests and that will complement our current pcr test and there are different types of fast and easy tests each with their own pros and cons one that we are familiar with is the art antigen rapid tests it takes about half an hour involve solving that is not so difficult just around the nose drills costs as low as 10 10 dollars per test deployment is very flexible because it's a handheld device and can be on mess with many people swapping at the same time so we have wrote out art to almost all our public health preparedness clinics that is providing the swap and send home service all our polytechnics and we want to expand the capacity shortly and deploy them also to private gp's we are also exploring test art and you can purchase them in pharmacies and perform the tests at home by yourself so it works almost like a pregnancy test kit and you can do so before you go to work and that way it is even more flexible in terms of deployment thirdly is the are the breathalyzer tests now toolkits developed by nus and ntu respectively have received in principle approval by moh and the health services authority the test takes a minute no swabbing you just blow into a mouthpiece or into a cartridge and so turnaround times is fast so it's very fast and easier to test than art but it involves some equipment yeah and so it's not as deployable as the art which is very very agile so depend on the cost the flexibility the throughput the turnaround time we will deploy the most suitable test for the right settings a few pilots are ongoing or about to commence for example art has been deployed at psa and also selected dormitories for foreign workers and over and above the current roasted routine testing the causeway and the airport have adopted breathalyzers so in the coming days or coming couple of weeks we will implement many more pilots using fast and easy test kits for certain group of workers for certain premises for certain events so group of workers they can be cleaners they can be fmb workers frontline workers for premises we can look at for example hostels in universities we can look at hospitals we can look at malls and for events we can look at say weddings or conferences or religious gatherings all these will be rolled out and then spread to even more users next i'd like to talk about our vaccination program we have just crossed 4 million doses mark in all over 2.2 million individuals in our population have been vaccinated with at least the first dose of covet-19 vaccine vaccine reduces the chance of being infected and more importantly reduces the chance of being severely ill if you are infected with covet 19. i've given some data earlier about our local experience let me give an update today of all local covet 19 cases since the 11th of april 8 of unvaccinated individuals developed serious disease requiring requiring supplemental oxygen amongst the vaccinated the number is one out of 93 with severe illness requiring supplemental oxygen so that is slightly over one percent and that patient is was ill even before infection so this is not a full-scale empirical study but as more data become available the benefits of vaccination becomes clearer in terms of protection for the individual prime minister outlined how we will boost our vaccination program in the next couple of months chun singh will be talking about the exercise for the 400 000 students in a short while beyond that we can now be more inclusive in administering vaccinations since the start of the vaccination exercise a few sub groups have not been included mostly because of medical reasons the expert committee on covet 19 vaccination our ec 19v they have reviewed the global and local data relating to these subgroups and is satisfied that vaccination is safe and efficacious for many of these subgroups who are they number one pregnant women number two breastfeeding women number three cancer patients on treatment but before they receive their vaccinations they ought to consult their doctors and receive the vaccination in a hospital setting number four persons with severe cutaneous adverse reactions the current restrictions for these subgroups will be lifted from 4th of june 2021 so based on the rollout schedule for the various groups if you belong to this subgroup and your age group has the turn for your age group has started you may register for vaccinations last important point on vaccination very important point is that the expert committee is also examining the data and reviewing the current policy where we restrict individuals with known anaphylaxis to take the vaccine specifically the committee is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mrna vaccine or its components but other substances like seafood painkiller antibiotics the review will take about two weeks with the intention of removing this restrictions and allowing more individuals in this group to be eligible for vaccination and this is quite a sizable group of over 30 000 individuals so the lifting of these restrictions will be a fairly meaningful one director for medical services associate professors kenneth mark will speak more about this in a short while finally i want to talk about the special excess root moh has authorized two vaccines as everyone know the pfizer biontech vaccine and the moderna vaccine and these are these two vaccines are also used in our national vaccination program and they are vaccines used in other countries but either there have been no applications to use those vaccines in singapore or the application is outstanding with data still pending these vaccines can be useful for individuals who are unable to take the pfizer biotech vaccine or the modern vaccine due to medical reasons as i mentioned earlier it's not a small group over 30 000 individuals so the review by the expert committee to allow more people with a history of anaphylaxis to take this two mrna vaccine will address a large part of the current concern nevertheless to provide more flexibility hsa will open up the special excess roots under the therapeutic products regulations and this is an existing avenue to import and supply unregistered medicines to address medical needs in unique or special circumstances and this is for limited duration and only during a pandemic under this route hsa will take reference the vaccines that the world health organization approve to include in its eul or emergency use list once a vaccine is included in the eul a private licensed healthcare institution can bring it in to administer to individuals in singapore the vaccines currently under the eul includes pfizer biontech moderna johnson and johnson astrazeneca and synopharm as and when the whho approves the sinovac vaccine into its emergency use list the licensed healthcare institute institution can apply to moh to draw on our existing stock of 200 000 doses to administer to those who wish to have it now let me hand over the flow to dms kenneth mark thank you very much minister to now we've had a vaccination program going on quite smoothly and minister has announced that we've vaccinated just over 4 million doses being given out and a total number of persons vaccinated being over 2.2 million this is nearly 40 percent of our population our vaccination centers make good progress in vaccinating eligible singaporeans since we started at the end of december 2020 and about 73 percent of the elderly over 60 years of age have booked their appointments or received their vaccinations the majority of frontline workers have also received their vaccinations amongst eligible healthcare workers more than 87 percent have booked or received their vaccinations and the proportion of essential workers in other sectors receiving their vaccinations is also high we've been working closely with the health sciences authority and the expert committee on kovit 19 vaccination to review the eligibility criteria for vaccinations and i'm pleased to share that moha is satisfied that the kovit-19 vaccinations are safe and fictitious for most people for more people with health needs and we are issuing an updated guidance today which allows vaccinations to be given to the categories that minister ong has mentioned and in particular who had previously experienced severe cutaneous adverse reactions or severe skin allergic reactions to medications other than the mrna vaccines or components of those vaccines can now receive vaccination and this will include specific medical conditions like stephen johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis these are very severe reactions that occur as a result of taking various types of medications and if you have previously had such a severe allergic reaction to medications like antibiotics you will now be eligible to receive your covet-19 vaccination secondly women who are pregnant may receive vaccination after they discuss and receive endorsement from their obstetrician and this applies irrespective of the stage of pregnancy also if a woman had become pregnant after receiving her first vaccine dose she may proceed with a second vaccination after discussion with her obstetrician women who are breastfeeding are eligible for vaccination they can continue to breastfeed their baby throughout the period for first and second dose vaccinations and there's no need to stop breastfeeding for patients with active cancer and are undergoing chemotherapy immunotherapy or radiation therapy presently or recently in the past three months we had previously exercised considerable caution and advised that they complete their treatment before getting vaccinated we have since reviewed the data and experience in other countries and will now allow them to get vaccinated after they are assessed by their treating doctors on their suitability for vaccination at this time we prefer for these patients to be vaccinated in a hospital setting where they can be better monitored for their health status and we will review later whether these conditions can be revised patients were soon to start chemotherapy immunotherapy or radiation therapy in the next two months should similarly consult their oncologist for their suitability for vaccination but patients with a past history of cancer and who are no longer on active treatment can apply for vaccination in any of our vaccination centers we hope that these adjustments or guidance will offer vaccination opportunities for more people and allow them to benefit from the enhanced immune protection that vaccination offers as we see more cases arising in the community and with the emergence of more cases due to viral variants of concern at our last media conference we had announced that the health sciences authority had extended the authorization of the pfizer bioentec covit-19 vaccine for use in adolescents between the age of 12 and 16 years the vaccination regime for these within this age group is the same as that for adults the approval under hsa's pisa approval framework has also been endorsed by mohs expert committee on covet 19 vaccination which also looked very closely at the data for safety and efficacy of the vaccine the data available for review was very similar to that submitted to other regulatory authorities in the u.s and other countries and was based on the ongoing phase iii studies that involve nearly 2 300 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 16 years of age and there was a very high vaccine efficacy shown in the vaccinated group with no covalent 19 infections being reported in this group compared to 16 cases of infection in the unvaccinated control group and this is a result that was consistent with the results reported in the adult vaccinated population as in adults vaccination offers a good protection for children of 12 to 16 years of age protecting them from getting infected but may not prevent all infections but the data provides great confidence that those who are vaccinated will be protected from getting severe infections vaccinating children also carries the secondary benefit of reducing the risk that others within the same household will be exposed and infected with cov19 infection the safety analysis from the study also showed that within the period of follow-up which was at least two months for many of the adolescents in the study adverse effects were not common and were generally mild in fact the safety profile was very similar to other vaccines that are normally offered to children children generally have a stronger immune system compared to adults and they may experience a slightly higher incidence of minor effects like fever injection site pain tiredness and headaches compared to adults and this is a common phenomenon for children from all types of vaccines that they receive not just the pfizer vaccine these reactions will resolve within an average of one to two days in fact these reactions demonstrate that their immune system is functioning well and responding to the vaccines there have been very isolated reports a report of adolescents with a known history of depression who reported their symptoms worsening after their vaccination but there is insufficient data to assess whether this is due to the vaccine or not nonetheless we recommend that children with a history of depression or anxiety should first be assessed by their doctors and assured that the condition is stable and under control before they go for vaccination there have been isolated reports of myocarditis being reported following covet 19 vaccination myocarditis is a condition characterized by an inflammation of the heart muscles it's been reported in patients with head covin-19 infection not just vaccination and it can occur due to a variety of causes unrelated to covid19 infection or vaccination and so far the number of cases reported does not appear to be more common than what is generally present in the unvaccinated children population we are monitoring this trend closely and we'll see if our vaccination strategies need to be adjusted over time as more data emerges but at this time based on the overwhelming assessed benefit of vaccination over the risks that have been reported hsa the expert committee on covet 19 vaccinations and moh remain confident that the kovin-19 vaccination can be offered to our children between the ages of 12 and 16 years this is the same position adopted by other countries like the u.s in fact in the u.s since approval had been granted by the fda there have been more than 6 million adolescents vaccinated between the ages of 12 and 18 years so we'll be watching very closely the experience of others in the us in israel and they will guide our policy even as we start our own program to offer vaccination to our school children thank you jin singh over to you good afternoon everyone the well-being of our students and educators are foremost to the confidence of our parents in our school moe's intention is to have as many of our eligible students vaccinated as soon as possible when vaccines are available to achieve this we will organize the vaccination program for more than 400 000 students with the following considerations first we will leverage on the network of community vaccination centers across the island for ease of booking during the june holidays second we will have four additional vaccination centers by the 7th of june three of them in our ites and one additional one at refers convention center kindly offered to us by moh to provide greater assurance to our students for the access to the vaccines these four additional vaccine centers are geographically spread out across the island to provide added convenience to our students and parents third for students who require greater support and are unable to get vaccinated through their parents booking our schools will arrange for them to get vaccinated when school reopens we will commence the invitation to vaccinate with the graduating cohorts of o n and a level students tomorrow first of june with the earliest slots available from the 3rd of june we will also work with moh and our spat schools to facilitate the vaccination of our spat school students in situ so there's no need for them to go to the vaccination center separately as the three dedicated moe vaccination centers are located on the ite campuses ite will also make arrangement for their students to take their vaccinations on campus the rest of the eligible school cohorts polytechnic students and autonomous university students will be progressively invited to make their bookings in the coming days all medically eligible individuals are encouraged to consider getting vaccinated when the vaccination is offered to them and would like to thank all parents for working closely with our educators at schools to keep our children safe now let me say a couple of words in mandarin c10 the uae email good evening as you can see from the daily cases so far our measures are working and bearing fruit but we are not out of the woods yet if all goes well we should be able to bring down community cases over time and break the transmission chain but meanwhile there are still unlinked cases popping up every day and any one such case can easily be a super spreader and cause a major outbreak to happen i go back to the metaphor that we had used last year of a fire we are taking steps to contain the fire and to minimize its spread but the embers of the fire are still out there and they can easily spark another major flare-up so the situation is highly fluid and our assessments are being updated on a daily basis as much as there is a chance of us relaxing some of the measures after 13th of june if things continue to improve we must also be mentally prepared that we cannot rule out the possibility of further restrictions down the road if they become necessary for example from the recent cases we are now studying if there is any common pattern of activity or movement that might suggest new areas of risk to watch out for and which would require additional precautions or safeguards at the same time if there are specific venues where we find people gathering or consistent breaches of safe management measures then we will have to take actions to close these venues so that's the overall posture we will be taking over the coming weeks in addition to all the steps that have been highlighted just now which is to ramp up testing speed up comprehensive contact tracing and scale up our national vaccination program meanwhile i want to thank everyone in singapore for doing your part to help curb the spread of the virus all of you have demonstrated tremendous discipline and social responsibility over the past two to three weeks so thank you very much for this tremendous response we've done well so far but this is not the time to relax or to let our guard down in fact it is absolutely critical that we continue to stay home and to work from home wherever possible go out only for essential activities and minimize our daily contacts if you feel unwell see a doctor immediately if we all continue to do that then we will be able to bring down community cases further and bring this current outbreak under control thank you very much thank you i now have questions from the media thank you ministers and dms the time is now 501 pm we have until 5 30 pm for the question and answer session could we have the first question from st salma please thank you ministers dms children remain less severely affected by kobit 19 than most adults if should they get infected so it seems rather unfair to give them priority over people who are in their 20s and 30s possibly with the exception of students during the national level exams this year in fact if anything i would say domestic workers looking after the real elderly should be given a priority because they go out and do the marketing they come back and they possibly could bring the bug back to people who are at the greatest risk okay there are too many ministers that can answer that question i'll go first i i think some of your points are well taken on the other hand students also live amongst households and often three generation families do they can also come into contact with the elderly and they also go to schools they do mix around with other students and for the older students in ihls they also have a campus life so i think given the new strain that we are facing and the the priorities that we are then the fact that we have gone out to vaccinate the most vulnerable groups plus the front line which is most exposed to the virus i think for the rest in terms of public health and i think dms can elaborate on that in terms of public health i think the differentiation are no longer so big and so for students given school life given their proximity to household members including the elderly we felt that it is appropriate to start our next phase of exercise prioritizing students and in any case i think we are looking at beginning of june to middle around middle of june when we extend to the next group of young adults thank you minister could we have the next question from taobao ka yang please thank you ministers at dms uh okay i'm from sao paulo here um if we come to block 745 which will start testing tomorrow there are three blocks of flats with all residents tested since this new wave of infection hit us with any indication of within block preservation for the first two blocks under what circumstances do we maintain all residents from the whole block to be tested and is this what we will anticipate as a new normal thank you thank you very much for the question with each case that occurs in the domestic setting and when we start picking up clusters we do uh ident look to see whether there are obvious uh chains or transmission modes or transmission they are of concern and when we pick up several cases that occur within a fixed geographic vicinity then we have to be concerned that there may be also chains of transmission occurred to other people that live in that same area and this is the reason why we would then extend and carry out testing operations uh in this case in a housing precinct involving several blocks of flats we re we reinforced our testing by looking at other data as well as has previously been explained that we do look at various other testing modalities including wastewater testing and where waste water testing shows signals that may suggest uh still shedding of virus that comes out in the wastewater it raises concerns that we may still be seeing some additional people who may be asymptomatic but carrying the virus infected and potentially infectious to others and this creates an urgency for us to launch these testing operations including the the example you have mentioned earlier so we look at each cluster on a case-by-case basis looking at the circumstances and making that decision whether we want to organize these testing operations they're not easy to do but it's important for us to do this aggressively in order to get ahead of the curve and to try and make sure we we get control to prevent further infection occurring to others in the community thank you dms could we take the next question from cna silhouette please yes from cna i just want to ask about updates to the vaccination program especially on the special access route um there will be open access to other vaccines do we know which vaccines are on it and how would this move allowing other vaccines actually affect the national vaccination exercise thank you sufi as i mentioned earlier the special access route is is a existing avenue um and what we are taking reference on is the wh o emergency use list yeah so if a vaccine is approved by who to be in the eul we will allow a private healthcare provider to apply to moh and bring in that vaccine to be given to our to individuals in our population and right now there are only a handful of vaccines in the w-h-o-e-u-l as i mentioned earlier is a pfizer biontech modena the two which we are using for our national vaccination program in addition there is jnj johnson and johnson cynofarm and then estrazenica yeah so of course uh there are many other applications before who now one of which is the sinovax vaccine a if who approves the synovic vaccine into the eul then a healthcare provider can apply to have access to use the 200 000 doses that we have and then use it to administer to individuals in our population who wants to have it having said that i i was mentioning earlier that a large part of that group that that one's alternate vaccine is because thus far because of their history or anaphylaxis they were restricted from taking the two national vaccination vaccines yeah but the expert committee is reviewing our current position they need another two weeks or so to come to a new position with a view to allow many in this group to have access to our current two national program vaccines pfizer biontech as well as moderna so i hope this move in the coming two weeks will largely address the current concern just to extend on the minister's comments uh the ministry of health as well as the expert committees continue to look out for other promising vaccines that we may also bring into singapore our approach is to provide a portfolio of different vaccines that meet our needs and we do understand that there are individuals who are not able to receive the mrna vaccine even with a relaxation of rules and we look towards procuring some of these vaccines that then can also receive hsa's pisa approval so we hope to present more alternatives to the population that allows a greater confidence in being able to take on vaccination and and to allow them to be protected thank you minister and dms could we get the next question from channel 8 tsungi please you are muted sorry hi ministers and dms this is chummy from china 8 news uh we would like to clarify currently priority is given to students sitting for no or a level exam so what about psle students thank you cerney thank you for your question the psle students will be notified together with the sec 1 2 and 3 batch when we next rolled up the program but i must explain that we go by age so only the students in p6 who are 12 years old and older will be eligible to take the pfizer vaccine thank you minister could we get the next question from bbc nicholas please hello everyone um it's very likely we're going to see a scenario even possibly this year where singapore is fully vaccinated where almost everyone has a very high level of protection from the virus singapore's neighbours countries here in the region are still way behind my question is uh will singapore have to wait for everybody else in the region to catch up with their vaccination programs before opening up or will singaporeans be allowed to travel freely in any case knowing that they're very well protected well we have always taken a risk-based approach towards this so if you look at our border measures we already differentiate countries by risk and based on the infection levels in these countries so if a country is safe we already allow singaporeans to go there and come back without any quarantine in singapore and we even allow travelers from these places to come to singapore without quarantine on the other hand if a country is not so safe there are high incidence rates that's prevalent in these places then we have tighter border control measures where traveler coming in will have to serve a quarantine in a dedicated facility so we will continue with that approach uh in the coming months and you know if we can as we monitor the situation if more countries become safe infection rates come down vaccination rates are high then potentially we will be able to open up more with these places on the other hand if there are places where the you know incidence rates will remain high and and there are concerns high risk areas then the border measures will remain and the quarantine measures will remain can i just add to that i think our our desire is probably similar to yours which is that if we are well vaccinated if singapore is safe individually we are quite well protected of course we hope singaporeans can gain the freedom to travel especially business travel going overseas visit your your relatives they are living overseas or family members living overseas or look after the investments that's been overseas and then be able to return without serving 21 days shn which basically you forget it nobody will travel that way so of course we hope to resume that normalcy but i think the truth is we don't have enough data to see whether to decide whether lifting all those restrictions is possible as of now but certainly we are heading in the right direction if we can get ourselves substantially vaccinated protected certainly travel restrictions will have to be reviewed with a view to restore our ability to travel and become a business hub thank you ministers could we get the next question from reuters chen lin please uh go evening ministers saw on allowing private sector to supply copy 19 vaccines does that mean that non-residents such as tourists will be able to get a copy 19 vaccine in singapore and is there any pricing guideline for the copenhagen vaccine nations via the private clinics thank you thank you for the first question our priority now is still to vaccinate our own population yeah so it's still for residents even for the sar route is primarily primarily targeted at residents second in terms of pricing you are right because it becomes a private initiative under the sar route pricing will have to be determined by the private health care provider that apply to moh thank you minister could we have the next question from rita haryan atiyah please hi ministers um i'll just like to get your opinion on what are the risks um in having the ert testing kids over the counter um because you know you might have individuals who already test themselves and probably they do not want to go back to the doctor for a second check or things like that i mean what could be the risk for for such i mean they are really good but what can be the risk for this thank you thank you very much for your question uh we are actually working out a set of instructions and guidance that will accompany these test kits once they're made available in in the pharmacies so for example and they will explain not just how the test is to be done how to perform a swap for the for the purpose of administrating the test but also the the circumstances where the test is appropriate so for example if you are sick you actually have symptoms uh you should actually see a doctor get that properly assessed and get the best tests done to diagnose or exclude the presence of a covate19 infection and the antigen rapid test would not be appropriate for either making that diagnosis or excluding in that particular setting if you are asymptomatic and this was done really for screening purposes as minister had mentioned previously then the antigen rapid test may be suitable however you need to be careful about how you interpret these tests because they are not as accurate as pcr tests and therefore a positive test on an antigen rapid test kit needs to be confirmed and we still recommend that you see a doctor for proper confirmatory tests to be done it will negative we would recommend that you not be complacent and you should still adopt the precautions including mask wearing hand hygiene infection control safe distancing which would then protect you because you never know whether you're still in an equation period and the following day you might actually become infected and turn positive and it's important to to appreciate and interpret the results in the correct setting so these uh uh sort of faqs will be provided when these test kits are purchased and we will provide relevant additional information on our website so as to better educate the public and for them to be able to understand how to use these kids and how to understand the significance of these test results let me just add a few words i think the use case is important i mentioned earlier that we are rolling out many pilots and the pilots really is to nail down the use case and the settings so take for example self test art really we need to find a use case and it could be say an employer could be could be sph or middle corp and you hire journalists who are front line workers who meet many people and therefore you may have a protocol for the company and the employer to say all my employees every week you can purchase a self-test kit test yourself just to make sure that you are safe so it becomes part and parcel of a surveillance program uh under a controlled use case facilitated by employer for example so the pilots that we are rolling out in the coming days are very important to really nail down the proper use of each of these kids thank you minister ndms could we have the next question from today janice please good evening thanks for taking my question um on the new um requirement for uh those who are household members of uh contact uh to be placed under quarantine um i just want to ask whether um how are authorities going to enforce this will they be left to uh individuals to self-manage because you are mentioned self isolate right or um you know basically how will our authorities make sure that people actually abide by this new requirement thank you thank you very much for the question we're working through all the processes the intent really is to make sure we get ahead of the game we understand that when closed contacts spend quite a considerable amount of time with a person who eventually is found to be positive there's very high chance that these contacts can be positive and in order to be able to get ahead of the game then then we ask that these whole household members also self-isolate as a precaution until we can clear the the context and be assured that these contacts are also not themselves infected we will do this in a variety of ways once we get information in in terms of who the household members are we may send sms's uh contact these household members ourselves to inform them that they are identified as contacts of contacts and our and they should they should isolate we may follow through subsequently with quarantine orders for this purpose and only when we clear the context from being infected then we rescind the the orders and allow household members then to come out at this point in time the thinking is that they can isolate at home but it would also depend on the household situation to determine whether it is feasible and possible to self-isolate at home we asked the public to cooperate with us this is done with the the best of intent to make sure that we control infection quickly decisively and it's not intended as a means of trying to stifle the freedom of household members to move around and this is really for the benefit of all others in the community if i may just add a few words remember these are the second order context they are not the closed contacts they are the household members of these close contacts second order but we have found from experience that because the new variant strain is so infectious that it tends to circulate very quickly amongst household members and that's why as this as an additional precaution we are now asking all household members of closed contacts when your household member is put under quarantine we will notify you immediately to stay at home just as an additional precaution until we confirm the test result of the person under quarantine we again call on everyone just cooperate with this simple but i think it will be a highly effective measure because it will ensure that if you are already infected but you don't you may not know because it's still incubating and or you may not have symptoms but by staying at home you can ensure that the virus does not go out it does not spread to more people so it's a precaution that we are putting in place it's an additional measure we think it will help and we seek everyone's cooperation to comply with the rules let me just come in with one more sentence which is a data point that i mentioned just now today of all the link cases 70 70 uh household transmission so i think this is a worthwhile measure to take thank you ministers and dms we will now take the last question from tamil marissa into please with this new label of endemic we understand that this virus is expected to be around for a while uh given that the new virus spreads faster is there a possibility that we may see another spike and how far should the number of cases fall before measures are relaxed and are there any traces of the new wiring from vietnam well we will continue to monitor the situation as as i've highlighted just now it's very fluid if all goes well we already see the reproduction number of this virus in this latest outbreak coming below one which means that day to day week by week there will be a chance of cases coming down further and we will continue to monitor unlinked cases cryptic whether or not there's a sense from our surveillance of the extent of community spread and if all goes to plan there may be a chance as we have highlighted on 13th of june for some adjustment and relaxation of measures it's very unlikely on 13th of june that we will go all the way back to phase three we will have to do this gradually and in a controlled manner so there is some chance of relaxation but in a controlled and calibrated manner on the other hand if we monitor over time and there is a risk of or we see new risk emerging new clusters emerging more unlinked cases which we are not able to track down and pin down then it may suggest that this is continuing a little bit more than um we are comfortable with and therefore we may have to take additional restrictions or precautions and safeguards based on the data so it's really uh you know we are updating our assessments on a day-to-day basis and we are continuing to monitor this very carefully recognizing that this new strain is highly infectious and we have to continue to do everything we can to bring down the latest cluster at the latest outbreak uh you asked also about the recent report about a new viral variant of interest being identified in vietnam to put this into perspective this was what the vietnam national institute of hygiene and epidemiology had had discovered when they were testing four cases in vietnam and they described a particular deletion of a particular gene that codes for a particular part of the spike protein on the b16172 variant which was also reported previously in the b117 variant they have not as yet up to the weekend register this information with the global registry that we that we use to track all these emerging viral variants so until it's actually registered with a g site we don't have enough information to tell what kind of specific variant of interest this is i should point out that even in the b16172 variant there are in fact sub variants that exist because the the virus does continue to evolve and some mutations will continue to take place and they have been previously described some local mutations that in fact are also seen within the b117 variant who exercise uh encourage uh has asked us to ask all countries to exercise caution in interpreting these results because at this time it the presence of such a deletion is not it's not known to be associated with any increased virulence increased transmissibility increased infectivity so we wait more information before we can actually tell whether this particular viral variant would become a variant of concern until we get formal information through the global registry we won't be able to tell whether this particular variant is also seen in any of our cases but we've not seen any particular particular deletion in the in the same area which was described by the vietnamese we'll wait for further information before we can be absolutely certain let me just wrap up very quickly we are two weeks into the phase two of a heightened alert next few months are very critical and as we plan and move forward and hope that we can slowly open up and it is very important to bear in mind that it's not just depending on the number of cases and the minister wong has mentioned that you also have to look at whether they're linked or unlinked but beyond that it is also important for us to look at our capability and capacity of testing and contact tracing as well as the level of vaccination as we mentioned as pm highlighted these three are very critical for us to push ahead faster and do a lot more and if we are able to do that raise a vaccination level significantly test much faster quarantine much faster and able to contact trace very quickly then this will give us more capacity to open up gradually and safely so we are we have to continue to remain vigilant and continue to exercise caution and observe the safe distancing measures and this will allow us to move gradually towards opening again thank you very much for being with us this afternoon and you've been watching the multi ministry transforms the press conference here on st live don't miss a special edition of the big story coming up shortly we'll have more reaction and analysis on today's announcements joining us will be professor ying of the nus

With that, food services are greatly impact and citizen can only takeaway food aka dabao. But we still continue to say dabao to the stall owners. Of course now we do not need to tell the stall owners we have to take away food now.

Well, it has turned out to be more of a serious issue than previously thought. We're talking about myocarditis happening to some young people after getting the coronavirus vaccine, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines the CDC is looking into it. And we wanted to get an idea of just how big a problem this might be Dr. Guillermo Oliveras, professor and chief of the division of cardiovascular services with US F. Health Massoni College of Medicine. He's also the director of the U. S. F. Health, Tampa General Hospital, Heart and Vascular Institute, and he's a good friend. Not good to see you. How you doing, man? Good to see you. So how are you? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you. All right, Let's start with the definition. Shall me what is myocarditis? inflammation of the heart muscle. It can be caused by a number of different. Ideologies including the most common of which is viruses. Multiple viruses can cause inflammation of the heart muscle. It's similar. If you think about it as inflammation of the liver. inflammatory reaction. Um that can have a multitude of symptoms. From what I've read, it can be serious. It can be minor. Am I right? Correct. Most cases of micro tight as we believe are asymptomatic. In other words, people don't even know they have it. Um, there are a number of, uh, sciences that believe that even with things such as the flu, which is a very common. Um, ailments. There is a large number of people that can actually have a myocarditis and not even know about it. Most cases of my code itis are, uh, asymptomatic. People don't know that they're having. However there are some cases. What Where we begin to have symptoms and those US little stabbing chest pains, sometimes chest pressure. Some of them can be confused with the symptoms that you would attack. Um, shortness of breath. And so on, and so forth, Is it a treatable condition? Good. Good question. That's a really good question. It depends on the ideology and yes, the nice thing is, um even if you get myocarditis right say they have micro night is that affects their heart function. Where you go from having a normal heart function to having an abnormal that we call heart failure. People that have heart failure from my card itis 50 to 60% of them. Completely recover spontaneously after, uh six months. Having said that? There's some specific types of microlight is that we can treat depending on the ideology. Okay issue at hand here with the with the with the vaccine. We've got 226 confirmed cases and these are people under 30 and the they've received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Younger people. Is this concern for you. And what do you recommend at this point? So let's put this into context. Right So Mike Road itis in COVID if you in other words, if you have covid, you're likelihood of getting micro That is about seven. 500 So about 7 to 5. We're talking about an incidence here. That's still about 60 and 100,000. Chance of getting Of getting, um Uh, Micro notice, So it's a much much lower likelihood. If you get the vaccine and you get micro dies from what I know and from having read the report. So far, none of these cases have been lethal. And only four cases are actually in the hospital with myocarditis. So this leads me to believe that most cases of. Others micro notice that we're seeing which with the covid vaccine. Mind you. We don't know There are other viruses there around that are not covered by the vaccine. Um. Seem to be mild, mild, mild cases of micro guys what we think In other words, it's much more likely to get my creditors from covid itself, Okay? Then from the vaccine. Hey, Doc. We're going to wrap this up real fast. But I want to ask you a question. Before we go it if a parent is on the fence, because I know what's happening in younger people of appearance kid the vaccine. What's your recommendation? Is to give it my 12 year old got it. And the only reason I haven't given it to my 10 year old is because it hasn't been approved and studied in 10 Year olds, but I would definitely recommend that every. Young had a lesson in everybody else. In fact, I wouldn't hold it for anything at this point, okay? Okay dot good to see you as always talk to you soon. Okay Thank you. ",True,False,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] so it feels great being out here in the open but studies show that in reality we spend 90 of our time indoors now with various studies pointing to covet 19 being potentially airborne is it time we pay more attention to the air we are breathing at home i bought myself an air purifier about five years ago when singapore was dealing with the regional haze crisis but you know what i haven't been using it it's been sitting here in my storeroom oh i think for the past three years so in this episode of talking point i want to find out if we really need air purifiers in our home and just how effective are these things sales for air purifiers surged when singapore was hit by the regional haze in 2018 and when the corvette 19 pandemic struck early this year demand spiked again retailers say sales went up by up to five times compared with the same period last year do you have any air purifiers at all yeah i do i do have a fire at home i ran the home studio so it's very important to keep the air clean at home what made you get them worry about dust and allergies and do you find that it's been effective when you breathe you actually feel that the air is thinner especially the smell you put it there the smell will go on there's less dust and what i understand the filter can trap bacteria and viruses there's growing evidence that suggests corvette 19 is airborne this means that if i am in a poorly ventilated enclosed space with an infected person i might contract the virus too of course we're looking at an extended exposure of about 30 minutes but still it's better to be safe than sorry i want to know if air purifiers can rid the air of the coronavirus so i'm going to the one place that will have all the answers about colvit 19. singapore's national center for infectious diseases dr glory joy tan specializes in controlling and preventing infection and was involved in developing a test to check symptoms for corvette 19 infections so is the air purifier able to catch those particles from the coronavirus based on our current understanding uh the main modality of transmission of covat19 remains primarily through respiratory droplets as well as contact transmission however there may be certain circumstances in which airborne transmission of covet-19 could occur and this may be in a setting where there are a lot of people within a very enclosed space doing very specific activities such as speaking in very loud voices or singing most of the air filters that we are talking about these days pride themselves on having an hipaa filter and the hipaa filter holds itself to a very high standard in that it's specified to filter out up to i think 99.97 of particles this includes infective pathogens and viruses and so i guess an air purifier with a hepa filter would probably be quite effective especially if the air sort of circulates through the air purifier multiple times however having said that i think we should be mindful not to think of the air purifier as like a magic bullet i think the overall strategy to reduce one's risk really would be to include things like frequent hand washing wiping of surfaces air purifier itself while it may provide an adjunct to improving the air quality shouldn't be thought of as like the magic bullet to keeping ourselves safe from infective pathogens in general basic air purifiers come with what's called hepa filters and activated carbon hepa filters are a grader filter that can remove microscopic particles in the air together with the activated carbon these air purifiers claim to remove harmful substances from the air by up to 99.9 percent an air purifier with a heaper filter may protect us from covert 19 in the air but as i've learned it's no magic bullet covet 19 isn't the only thing that's lurking in our air many studies have reported that the air inside our homes is far dirtier than the air outside shocking isn't it professor tom cox why has been studying indoor air quality for more than 30 years and he's going to tell me what's in every breath i take so professor tell me what would be some of the most common contaminants we find in the air i think we broadly can classify as three different categories the first is what we call the physical contaminants so these are principally dust the second category i think that much more pervasive it is gaseous it flows all around the place and we basically briefed it in and the third are things which are basically living organisms what we call the biological category and from these three categories where did they come from uh let's take das for example the physical ones i'm sure that this is a very common household vacuum cleaner yeah one of the things that we must understand is that when it sucks in the dust you can see the filter inside over here the filter does not remove everything and this means sucking must come out and unfortunately the finer does basically follow the airstream out the final ones actually become airborne and this final one's actually much more damaging because they're small they remain airborne and they actually go much deeper in their lungs the other part that i'm going to mention may scare you a little bit okay when it is actually being sucked through this it actually churns that grinding so the bigger particles become smaller particles imagine your cockroach egg and the very thing that you actually don't want this can ground and then maybe become very small particles they get born so when we vacuum our homes we remove the dust that is visible to the eye but inadvertently release finer pollutants which are invisible back into the air to avoid this proftam recommends using a vacuum cleaner with a water filter the water will prevent finer pollutants from being released back into the air what else contributes to pollutants in the air gaseous pollutants are one of the most important exposures that we must guard against thick cooking for example firstly there are two types of cooking one uses gas or town gas which is still quite common but you think the source of the heat is really because of the combustion of the town gas okay and that combustion will produce by-products and we are inhaling them not all of which are actually good for the body are there any other areas that would be of concern in our home i think there's one one last category that i mentioned which is the biologicals there are things which are very minor in nature the bacteria in particular most so if you smell something musky is actually an indication that it is mold infested and some of this mold they produce chemicals which are toxic to the body so it seems that the air in our homes is a hot bit of dangerous contaminants small debris such as dust harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and spores from mold they can enter our lungs leading to respiratory problems and chronic conditions such as heart disease and these days air purifiers don't just come with heater filters they come with ionizers with uv light with ozone generators and they claim to kill microorganisms and remove harmful chemicals all of which can cost a hundred to over a thousand singapore dollars the bigger the coverage area the higher the cost so which one do i choose for my home [Music] only one way to find out i'm putting this machine to the test i've discovered that air purifiers with the hepa filter can help filter out the much-feared corvette 19 virus from the air but how effective is it against regular dust gas and biological pollutants such as more air purifiers now come with add-ons like ultraviolet light ozone generators and ionizers but do i really need them helping me figure this out is professor david chong he's done extensive research on ways to improve indoor air quality in the tropics i'm meeting him today with muhammad jufri ahmad bajuri he's been thinking of getting an air purifier for his home because his father-in-law and wife both suffer from asthma he believes an air purifier can rid his home of allergens like dust which usually triggers an attack but he's not quite sure yet if it's worth the investment there are so many air purifiers out in the market these days how should i go about choosing one it's my personal opinion i would say the conventional hipaa filter okay right with activator carbon what is important is really something that is uh have been tested and proven which is the conventional hipaa filter and what we see in the back here i mean these are the dirt especially the outer frying particles that can be arrested by this hippa filter as the dirt accumulates over time the filter degrades and has to be replaced with a new one very often some of these come with not just the hipaa filter but also activated carbon activated carbon does absorb pollutants from the air in fact we use it a lot in commercial building when they have basically odour they may to some extent remove some of the chemicals but do take note our environment is very hot and humid so moisture content in the air is relatively high they will deteriorate with time i've heard about other you know purifiers coming with things like ozone generator ionized air or uv light do i need them in my air purifier there's a word of caution that they may be effective but they're also side effects for some of them you need to check with the professionals if you want to use those technologies while ultraviolet light can kill harmful microorganisms it can also hurt our eyes and skin injuring the cornea and increasing the risk of skin cancer ionizers and ozone generators on the other hand produce ozone and breathing in too much ozone can affect how our lungs function and make it more prone to infection so for a home setting all we need is essentially a basic heaper filter with activated carbon one that is suited for duffy's bedroom costs about 500 singapore dollars only one thing left to do and that's to test this in geoffrey's home and to see just how effective it is in removing dust and other pollutants like bacteria and gases which could be dangerous to our health hi hi jeffrey hey hi you're here i am here with the air purifier i'm not doofy's only visitor today joey fung is an independent air quality inspector she runs tests to find out how much contaminants there are in the air in an enclosed space hi hi are you joey today she's going to help me test the effectiveness of the air purifier by taking air pollutant readings in duffy's home before and after we run the machine this is my bedroom okay so this is where you spend a lot of time and i guess you want the air to be good you know joey how do we check the air quality in this room firstly the ac has to be turned on and the door has to be closed because we need to contain the space so this is to test your temperature relative humidity and come out outside for this is air velocity and velocity like whether it's a breeze or not exactly whether it's stuffy whether that's strong okay so this is carbon monoxide this will be testing for vocs and formula height harmful gases if the results are bad we should be concerned about that one and this is also for a dust level your pm 2.5 and your pm10 so you can tell whether this is a dusty roof yes we can especially if you know you have sinuses asthmatic you know the triggers you want to know your dust level oh yeah all this dust problem next joey sets up a device that can tell how much mole and bacteria there is in the room basically we will put the agar plate inside and then it will suck the air and whatever is being transmitted onto the agar plate and then we send it back to our lab to analyze it so now we wait [Music] once the checks are complete it's time to turn on the air purifier there we go leave it running for a while i'll put it on auto for this experiment we will leave the air purifier running for about an hour and that should give a machine of this size enough time to purify the air in juffrey's room joey heads back in to take the pollutant readings it will take about a week for the test results to be processed [Music] meantime i'm leaving the air purifier with juffy so that he can use it for longer to see if there is any discernible difference in the air quality of his home and we're about to find out that he's in for a shock i hear you've got the result from your test right this is alarming it's almost four times over the limit one week ago i started my journey to find out how effective air purifiers are in removing dust and other airborne pollutants i conducted an experiment in muhammad jufi ahmad bajuri's flat his father-in-law and wife both suffer from asthma so he's hoping that an air purifier can help to alleviate their symptoms since we last met joffrey's been using the air purifier regularly at home so you've had the air purifier for about a week now have you noticed any improvement in the air at home wow yes a lot of improvements steve yeah my family seems to be more restful and calm is it yes okay well let's find out what the results actually tell us sure let's go yeah let's go [Music] hi joey joey hi nice to see you guys again yeah i hear you've got the results from your test right overall in general the number seems good but there are a few parameters that i want to highlight that it's a bit concerning you see in a rate color size what is tvoc right it's total volatile organic compounds which means chemical gases which can be commonly found in like a disinfectant perfume sprays herjan all these household products so the ideal is 1000 parts per billion this obviously has exceeded limit of a thousand ppp this is alarming it's just almost four times over the limit is it dangerous prolonged exposure for elevator amount yes even with the air purifier turned on it's still on the high side so you might have to take note on that what are the other things that may contribute to to this number formula is a subset of tvoc commonly found in newly ventilated spaces varnishes newly painted house newly bought furnitures that gives off the gases but in this particular case because your formula height is zero so it's largely still on like your household products what about cleaning if you clean the floor with detergent yes all these have very little amount that contributes together there's one more one the other one it's total bacteria count anyway it has reduced significantly after the airport fires on that's actually quite a significant drop i'm impressed geoffrey had switched on the air purifier in his room for just one hour and the results overall were quite positive the levels of chemical gases such as benzene dust bacteria and mole all dropped so geoffrey what do you think actually i'm quite surprised all this while i've been not knowing that i'm having this air pollution in my own home but since the air profile was installed in my home for the past one week i realized changes in my family for sure especially my dad once in a while he will start to sneeze yeah and that sneeze will you know become more stronger and stronger he will be we need a pump asthma but this week i mean it's a bit quieter for me oh i can sleep with them so are you convinced you think you would like to have an air purifier running you know all the time i'm very very convinced joey's test proved that the air purifier really does help to clean the air but i wonder if there are alternatives out there for those of us who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on an air purifier i'm going to try and find out from an international authority on indoor air professor chandrasekhar is an indoor air quality consultant who also studies heating ventilation and air conditioning systems what are the other options besides having an air purifier at home the fundamental word is ventilation and ventilation means you've got to let the air from outside come into the house into the rooms and that provide that kind of dilution that can take place let me talk about this unit that we are seeing here this is fan filter unit there is a fan and there's also a filter okay and what it does is it takes the air from outside and then you have air from outside providing nice ventilation into the room so you see that the air is actually blowing into the room right and this is coming from outside and this is what ventilation is all about this fan filter unit is a motorized research prototype for removing harmful airborne particles from recirculating air and it is not yet available commercially i'm sure it costs quite a bit of money too right there is a cost to it but it requires a proper installation you cannot just pick it up from somewhere and install it yourself are there other alternatives that will allow for this same idea to work similar effect certainly we open the windows everywhere in the hub sure what we expect is air from outside through natural ventilation comes into the house now it'll be great if we had very high wind speeds but in singapore we don't usually experience high wind speeds as you can see not much you depend on the wind speed and the direction of the wind to let the outside air come in we can facilitate that by perhaps placing a pedestal fire and you can expect the same thing to function a little bit like the fan filter to draw the air in the idea is facilitate cross-ventilation whenever you can that's the whole purpose of what we're talking about here does the air conditioner or the air conditioning system provide any kind of filtration for the air that i'm breathing there is a filter that's attached to the air conditioning unit but that's the basic minimum they wouldn't be removing the fine particles professor chandra's research also shows that when you sleep in an air-conditioned room the amount of carbon dioxide can be up to six times more than the levels outdoors lowering the relative concentration of fresh air and triggering headaches and possibly fatigue would it make sense then to therefore be in the air condition room for a few hours and then stop it switch it off that's the right strategy just have to be mindful of the fact when you open the windows don't open it straight away after turning the air conditioning off right for the simple reason our outside air is very hot and humid warm and humid if you like if that egg comes in the surfaces are cold there could be potentially some condensation over time and then we have other issues like mold growing and stuff like that chemicals harmful gases dirt mole and bacteria we can't see them but they're all in the air and in our homes they can also be created as we do things we can't avoid like cooking and cleaning so do i need an air purifier at home well i've discovered that this machine can help remove the bad air so perhaps it's time i start using mine again but i've also learned that it's incredibly important to keep your home well ventilated so that every breath you take can be a fresher ,True,False,False,False
142,qwezL_1jrfo,CNA Insider,Former Singapore Airlines Air Steward Turns To Baking Basque Burnt Cheesecakes After Retrenchment,2020-12-19T13:00:25Z,"“My leap of faith became a leap of death.” 29-year-old Daniel Tan was a Singapore Airlines cabin crew member for 7 years before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global aviation travel. As planes were grounded, he decided to make a pivot to digital and social media marketing. 

Daniel thought all was good when he got a job with Airbnb - but his dreams were quickly dashed when Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of the company, announced a mass layoff. Daniel was retrenched one month into the job, not even completing his training. 

But as Singapore’s ‘circuit breaker’ created a new wave of home bakers, Daniel saw an opportunity and set up his own cake business - the BBC - selling Basque burnt cheesecake and fudgy blackout brownies. 

As a retrenched worker, he also got help from the Government’s COVID-19 Support Grant. His father, who is a Grab driver, qualified for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) that gave him a total of S$9,000 in payouts.

hello@zula.sg",so i think a very common thing that happens is a possibility of meeting celebrities so for me i saw some of their vote on jay park before hi guys welcome to today's episode of ask zula and today's guest is sangi wow nice intro okay i mean you guys probably know sangeesh has appeared in a couple of videos before but in any case please introduce yourself to everyone hey guys i'm sangee i am 22 years old this year i'm a full-time cabin crew and i also work freelance with zula yes as you can tell very professional freelance host with a beautiful voice used to be a radio uh dj hosts what we do teachers is that what it's called butchering the job here oh god okay but i mean that was your old job today we are here to kind of talk about your current job you imagine that your cabin crew yeah yes so that's the topic of today's video so i guess people outside the industry don't know too much about what goes on behind the scenes of like being a student being a steward being uh working in the industry itself so people i think are curious to find out about um the culture and also like the whole interview process and stuff yeah but before we go into that maybe you can share with us a little bit about how long you've been a cabin crew okay yeah so i've been flying for uh six months yeah but i've been in the company for about a year so because of covet i stopped flying in march but i joined last year in september okay right so how long was the training then if you joined in september last year okay so i think the training was about for two months oh okay so i started like beginning of september right and i ended by mid october so it was about one and a half months last maybe you can share with us why you decided to become a cabin crew now why why you love like that why why is this what is because i get this question like all the time right okay so for me i think a few people might know from like my instagram that i actually studied communications yes so i did like my diploma and degree so when i told my mom that i was gonna fly she kind of like lost a [ __ ] lashes like you gonna do flying after studying yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah she had expectations for me to like go join like a pr company or to do like a nine-to-five job buying parents expectations right here but then she also knows that i am not like a nine-to-five person yeah so i cannot sit like in an office and do work as much because i kind of like go crazy then i decided okay why not i go fly because i've been trying to fly for about three years yeah but i wasn't really working out and it was like a childhood right you take the plane and you see like people like so feeling like oh so pretty yeah i mean i never get this experience before that but um i mean some people something tells me wow that's me so then after that i decided okay i kind of like enjoy traveling yeah but i didn't use that as a reason to join this job actually yeah it's just that i like service and i wanted to try a different form of service yeah because i've been i've always worked in like fnb right then communication so like kind of service to people by like like producing news and content right yeah on the channel different aspect like straight up so i went to join as a cabin crew actually i think you mentioned that you like service i was like i can see that it's in the way that you talk right to people like you enjoy talking to people i love i'm a very people person and i'm the kind of person right i can talk to a lot of people came from different backgrounds nice i will pick on like what is the interest and everything so i can make a very introverted person feel very comfortable as well nice so i decided to like touch that spot and go work as a chemical that's basically a life skill right there yeah but um so that's the reason why you decided to join the industry how did you apply like what was the whole process like because tsl did a video a really long time about up no because okay [ __ ] this up and it goes into the edit right tsl did a video a long time ago on the interview process to get into like one of the local airlines uh i think the reason why that video did so well is because people just want to know what they are going to expect when they apply right yeah but for you um how did you apply to the company that you're currently working for okay fun fact about that video right i actually watched that video and i was one of those people that is like what happens you know i watch that video like and i kind of knew what was happening and i didn't know what my airlines that i'm working with kind of had for the interview process so i just went in blindly to be very honest right so when i went there it was pretty much similar so the interview process is like five rounds and then like the first round is they'll check your documents check your height skin check as well so for example like i have scars on my hands because i used to look at fmp so i got a lot of burns cars right that was something they had to kiv about because when you work in the airlines your uniform and everything will expose your hands and sometimes your legs as well so they want you to be like look flawless a bit loud because you know it's professionalism as well so after that they also checked like tattoos uh visible tattoos yeah instantly fired like the first stage i'm like goodbye earlier like get out of here like hello welcome to yesterday with my tattoo arm and then for the second round it's like an english competency test oh okay so we set for like an english like return test oh i feel like it was so long ago i honestly thought i was going to fail you know okay was it like a like a full-on test it was like this written test like vocabulary and some other things remember but i saw the people they finished so fast i was writing till like they say please put your fans down and i was so nervous i was like great i didn't answer a few questions because i didn't know how to do it and then in the end like i got it so i was a bit confused i didn't know what they were looking for right english competency tesla and then after that they were actually like cut the bachelor they will eliminate people it's an elimination round throughout the entire interview process okay wait so the interview process is like in a day or yes it's one whole day oh yeah so it's like really really long so after like the competency test like i think half of us got eliminated so the remaining half of us just text each other like oh my god what the hell is happening you know and then we got pushed into groups so that's round three you get to do like group discussions and they want to see how you work as both a leader as well as a follower yeah and then the remaining people will be sent in for one-to-one interviews with management so like management or hr will interview you two people to one uh or one to one in some cases and they will just ask you about you and your resume why you want to be a cabin crew i think that's a very important question people always ask why you want to be a cabin crew and then okay honestly right i always say this i prepared this since i was very young okay go um so i want to be a cabin crew because i really enjoy serving people and the fact that you know i get to meet a lot of new people and there's a lot of experiences that you can definitely gain do you hear her voice instantly like i was like yeah but for this interview i decided no i'm not gonna do that so i just went oh because you know i really like to talk to people and the fact that i know that i'm good at this job so then the final round after all of this they will eliminate again after the interview and then the last one is medical checkup right and then also people get eliminated wow okay that's a very detailed interview process yes it is it's like five stages but okay i think this was kind of expected like this is knowledge that i kind of know of already it's just that to you for you to explicitly state each each stage it's like oh okay at least it gives me a better idea of what if to expect yeah let's say anybody any of y'all want to apply for our interview in the future yeah in the future is that it brings me to my next point which is kind of expectations versus reality your first ever flight or maybe the first time you met your colleagues or people that you're working with how was it different from your expectations so for me right i have friends and family who have flown before or are still currently flying so when i spoke to them and like asked about what their concerns are and everything yeah they said that oh you just have to be very careful because the industry is pretty um scary and it can be a bit toxic like generally so because of that i wanted to go in with a very high expectation but i told myself to actually not have any expectations because once you do that right then you get a bit more chill you don't feel so stressed you don't feel disappointed so when i went there thankfully it was actually very fun oh yeah i i didn't expect it i was very very scared yeah it's really about working ethic and like we have fellow colleagues who are very senior they've been flying for like 25 30 over years and as long as you seem like someone who is interested to learn yeah and you just will be very receptive like you know when someone tells you you know you're not supposed to do that maybe you should do this first yeah then you go oh okay sure take it into consideration and then you work on it immediately and not be like huh but i never learned this one yeah huh but they never teach me this what yeah you know once you like start talking ah that's when things go like completely south so thankfully like my colleagues my seniors they're very like helpful as long as you want to do it and you're very proactive proactive is very important yeah they will they will like support you all the way that's good that's good so i think just generally people already know kind of know about what's the expectation of like the industry right yeah where you know you have to like dress well and present yourself well and everything so it kind of starts from the time you enter the airport or even like when you take the cab because you're already wearing your uniform already wearing everything and people know who you are people know what you are you can't even taxi driver know that you're going to fly yeah they're like oh so which country are you going to they always had a conversation so oh my god do they always ask you that always so like when you fly it's very important that you maintain your image from the time you leave your house until you come back right because even if you're not in your uniform but you still have your makeup and your hair people guess they won't know i wouldn't have thought about that one yeah because i think that's something that people may overlook you know when you first join the industry right yeah so the way to make a good impression is to just be on the ball at every single moment from the time you leave yeah but i guess we can go back to um the whole industry itself i think there are very common stereotypes and oh like misconceptions things that people say about people who work in the airline industry let's just throw it all out on the table and talk about it right now and i mean i think for you it's only based on your own experience yeah so you won't speak from the behalf of like everyone in the industry of course but from what you know love so i think the most common like misconception yeah that like students have right is that they are very like cheap yeah like bro yeah yeah so in a sense because like you know the the time yeah because of that people just assume that oh people wait what yeah so when i wanted to join that's the first thing that you hear and i'm very scared because i i don't know because the older people they have the kind of misconception like you fly at what kind of things you do on board that kind of thing i'm like hello i'm serving the customer bro i only serve like little kids you know like food know i don't do anything else it's not very common it's not actually it's not very common at all it's more to when they get into different countries but not on my personal experience i have not seen it or heard of it like in a close like proximity but just generally i've heard that it can be in the layovers or like people getting intimate in the hotel rooms because it's a personal space it's true though it i mean whatever you want to do on your off time off work that is your problem exactly before this video i was already talking to sangi about like what we wanted to discuss and she she you brought up something that was like you know that we are not actually obliged to put the luggages in the open compartment i was like really i thought it was fun because i'm always like hi can you help me okay i'm so sorry okay yeah okay but if you guys didn't know exodus are not obliged to actually um carry your luggage is because it's actually a potential hazard for us because if we injure ourselves or like anybody else yeah it's going to be very dangerous they cannot fly yeah and also the thing is if you cannot carry a luggage why did you bring it up actually that's me in it i'm the kind of person that i try to squeeze as much into my carry-on luggage and then i'm trying to lift it up it's always so heavy for me so i'm like and then the guy's like thank you i'm sorry please don't take no off the weight thanks bye uh oh people oh yeah of course we can help but we don't like completely carry but we we maybe call another crew member to come and like lift it up yeah so that it kind of reduces any potential like uh injuries especially so this happens with all the airlines everywhere if we really cannot lift up your luggage because like it's really heavy or there's no space we will offload it so we offload and goes into cargo oh yeah so then people get very upset about it because they don't want to wait for like the conveyor belt to break bro i would be like yeah please ship it off to cargo so i don't need to pay the extra 20 that i was supposed to be at the start but yeah i think another assumption that maybe i have or i've heard is that you need to be very pretty to be a student i'm just putting it out there like it is a people front line job you are there to represent the brand the company it is something that people take note of right in the interview process i think it's not really about pretty because yeah it's very subjective you know like looks like a subject yeah like to one person person a is very good-looking but i think what they're looking for is a pleasant looking person like someone who is obviously smiling like your persona and you're always very um i would say engaging as well and also someone who takes care of themselves it's different from high maintenance uh don't compare to like saying that oh esther is very high maintenance actually no it's about self-care even if you have like the most flawless skin you still need to look presentable so uh your hair must be nicely done yeah kind of things so it's always a first impression thing i mean i guess the point about the high maintenance thing is also like the job itself requires you to keep up with your looks so i guess that's what people also mean but behind me this can also be taken the wrong way like in a sense that they want like people who work in this industry are always talking about like luxury goods they want branded it's not the case um like i said it's very very like personal okay because for me i don't have lavish things yeah i don't buy like luxurious things i do save up and everything but i also spent a lot of money on food okay yeah like i'm a food person so i go different countries i eat like shillers of food and as long as i'm buying good quality food i'm okay like that's where i spend my my lifestyle on right and then there are people obviously who like buy like all their gucci their products it's just something that not everyone does yeah you know so don't generalize don't generalize i guess we will uh move on to the next part which is a bit about the interesting things that happen on the flight yeah i mean there's so many different people that you meet every day there's bound to be an interesting story here or there yeah that you can share with everyone because i'm curious to know so i think a very common thing that happens is a possibility of meeting celebrities so for me i don't know for me it wasn't like international celebrities okay technically they're international but they are local artists i was at the door and i'm the one who says like hi good morning welcome can i check your boarding pass please like checking the boarding pass so we don't look at the names usually like we just look at seat number five details because there are people who apparently get the wrong flight also okay yeah and then like i saw the surname then i like thank you that i like he walked past me i know that's her name yeah i like a bit mind-blowing a bit because it's like oh my god he's a very good singer and i i've i've like i'd like fangirl fangirl you know like so russell has um this thing called bassam star oh yeah in 2005 he was the winner and i used to vote for him okay he was such a sweetheart on the fly yeah you know he was so polite and i think that's what i absolutely love about like celebrities oh so last sometimes they're really really nice i saw some of their vote on jay park before yeah i'm jealous too i know right is there any anything else interesting that has happened to you i think one of the like cute moments that happened was when like a passenger like passed me his number oh damn girl you got a game right there okay what happened once i was on this flight um it was back from pocket so i was on the fly i was walking and then this guy he was sitting at the like near the front of the plane and i was in charge of the front of the plane as well uh what happened was he just like whips his hand at me and i'm like yes how can i help you this is like going to the party so we close the doors area and he said um can i change my seat and i was like oh um where would you like to sit at even though it's a full flight there were a few empty seats right he said oh i just want to um sit at the seat where you're working at like the zone where you're working it and i was like i just got stunned for a moment because you see oh [ __ ] my whole brain was like okay passengers want to move seat where to move like i couldn't even say anything yeah because i was like literally like taken aback so i just like ah i'm actually working at the front he's like ah okay then i'll sit here then all right sure so i'm sitting at my like who see during like take off so is that indirect there's like uh uh um what's it called a glass right i can look right at him you know oh my god i'm just there like they keep making eye contact he's sitting between like there's like three seats right but he's in the middle he's like in the middle and he doesn't like look straight ahead he's like do you just see me through that i was like wow effort but so then after that right somewhere like in the middle like of the entire flight because very short flight my pocket he suddenly pressed the car like then i ran out with my train yes how can i help you then he said um do you have the immigration card in singapore yeah i said oh yeah sure let me get it for you please okay sure so i went back to the immigration card and i gave it to him right then he gave me this small piece of paper he said uh this is for you please read it uh alone in your personal time then i like oh okay i quickly like hide my piece of paper because we don't really want to carry pieces of paper right yeah then i went through the back close the girl and i was like guys like here is a don't like really in front of people but you're like guys my whole clue was at the back and i was like yo you know this passenger he give me no you know yeah then they were like oh my god what right because that's very fascinating yeah so we opened then he's like his name his instagram his phone number and then he's like uh i am i hope to get to know you like he texts me that kind of thing and i was like wow this is like damn straightforward yeah i told myself okay i've got nothing to lose right so once i landed in singapore i actually texted him oh yeah but but we just like talked as friends when he like then that's it we didn't there was nothing else that went on guys i promise you it's just that you know i made a new friend out of it as well that's cool so that was pretty cute like every time i think about it that sounds like super interesting in terms of like the experiences that you had do you have any things that you feel were like big challenges i think the most challenging is when you have like difficult passengers like straight up that is the main challenge of the job because not everyone is understanding yeah everyone knows what's happening they just feel very entitled because they're like i am a paying passenger i deserve disrespect and i think um another thing that i would say is like a challenge for me is when i miss my family oh yeah yeah because i'm very close to my family and we spend a lot of time together especially my sister i think you guys would have seen my sister like on my instagram so i don't see her she gets sad i get sad when i went to europe i didn't see her for like two weeks and then even if i'm doing like short flights right the timing my sister will go to school at five o'clock yeah then i'll leave for flight at four am then by the time i come back it's like evening and then she's already sleeping yeah so i have to go back to sleep so if you're someone who's very close to your family like me right sometimes flying might not be for you but if you like learn to work around it and just spend time with them when you're back i think that's very important we're going to conclude a little bit about the whole airline industry in essence what are some things that you could say would make a good stewardess or cabin crew that you need to take note of is definitely being very receptive and adaptive because things are going to happen very quickly and there's always going to be judgement no matter where you go from the place you work from other people taxi drivers yeah everyone your family and friends especially who be like hi you cabin crew are not everyone is going to be supportive so you have to have very thick skin thick skin and i think last but not least if you want to be a cabin crew you need to be very patient you cannot say like oh once you start working it's going to be fine it's going to get worse oh really yeah because if you're impatient as a person or you're very like hot hated i have anger issues okay like i really have anger issues but before working i told myself i have to work on the anger issues so that when i go on flights i don't like blast at my passenger so i usually switch la like when i'm flying and everything when i'm doing my job i'm very different yeah in a sense where i'm extra patient people were like scroll me and shout at me i'm like i understand because i really try to think from their perspective how would you expect if someone is like not listening to you or not helping you out or you're waiting like damn long for your flight and you've got no answers yeah something be very patient guys it's a very slow process but you will get there and keep trying now that you know covet has happened and you already mentioned that you're not really flying at the moment what are you currently doing now in the meantime okay so currently as of july i've been working as a patient care ambassador with a hospital to just give you a summary of what i do because a lot of people are very confused at what we do we take care of like patients basically patient care and we do activities with them we take care in terms of we feed them we help them with non-medical things all the time because we are not licensed to do medical stuff so we can help to like transfer patients right and then we do coloring with them we talk to them i think i do a lot of talking we learn about the patients and everything because that's what we do in our jobs ma i was literally going to say the same thing i feel like this is such a natural transition because it's just communicating because it's a different audience right yeah i won't say everyone found it easy for me i found it very easy when i had to just deal with other people of different backgrounds it was very easy to transition to learn about your patients and you can learn so many things in the medical industry which eventually you can like bring back usually yeah start flying in case like oh yeah that's good knowledge yeah it's very good knowledge so when you when you take care of these patients there's anything been very memorable for you throughout this experience memorable i would say like practically every day because i really like the job as well but my most um engaging experience right was working with dementia patients i had this very specific dementia patient and when i started working i was only when i could communicate to him in demo so i think for a couple of weeks when he was there the nurses and the therapists i kind of found a bit of a hard time communicating with him because of the language barrier yeah i could speak to him with demo every single day it kind of helped him to communicate a lot better and eventually about another two months down the road he actually managed to get back home and it was just very nice and then the wife the daughter were like thank you so much you know i've seen the way take care of my father it's just so loving and so nice so thank you for taking care of him so it's a very small thing it's what nurses do every day as well and you finally understand how nurses feel like you know how tough the job is is bloody tough okay you you have to stand on your feet all the time so i really really like look up to them and then i finally also get it why they do what they do because it's very gratifying because you know that you impacted someone's life as well and you realize you are part of that journey yeah you really feel very nice like you you you're like the job is very emotionally draining like sometimes actually to be honest i think that's the that's one of the biggest things right about working yeah like the hospital or like patient care right i would say the difference between communicating with passengers because it's like a very business kind of relationship versus like in the hospitals yeah it's very personal relationships you have to kind of like talk to them about their personal problems yeah like low-key like their friend or advisor to a certain extent right right yeah and it's a lot like not everyone is a family yeah everyone has many many grandchildren many people come and visit them some of them are completely single and they're like 85 over years old and sometimes you talk about life you kind of feel sad i'm not gonna lie life had a couple of breakdowns at work because sometimes the energy like i'm someone who picks up people's energy very quickly it's not about what they're saying it's just that they're transferring like all their emotions in a way so when i go to toilet i'll just like have breakdowns and i'm like why am i crying i'm not even sad then i realized oh it's not really like because of me it's just that the place around there they just have that sad energy sometimes so we try to like make it lively by playing music we always laugh we always joke we try to entertain like them and ourselves as well so that we all have a fun work time if not it can get a bit like very mundane also yeah yeah that's good now that's what you're currently working on how has kobe affected like you know what you plan for the future is this the career that you'll be wanting to stay in for the rest of your life i think when i first started i really wanted to stay for like many years i wanted like upgrade or like try different places different countries and everything so i wanted to maybe go to like international uh another international airline kind of thing but then now with kobe that happened i had a lot of time to think i had a lot of time to research so i decided that maybe i'll fly for maybe like a year plus you know just finish up my contract and everything yeah and then i want to actually go and upgrade myself with um my studies at least work on myself in that sense yeah i don't want to let go of comms like it's part of me i do want to work in like communications background in the future but maybe or maybe not like we see how it goes so go with the flow card yeah that's a very i kind of have a rough like path but we just kind of don't set everything in stone because it's going to be tough got it got it i think on that note about like stay in the industry right is it hard to progress in your career for example being a student versus like if you work in the corporate world or even like a nine-to-six job where there may be a level of progression or career path for you like is that the same for the industry or i would say it's difficult but there is like career progression in its own ways and how you are willing to work hard for it so obviously you can progress within the company with like different roles you know obviously like your basic cabin crew then we have like your in-charge level and everything and then if you don't feel like flying anymore sometimes you can stay with the company and do with their like management side right right and it's just how you want to work and what qualifications you have to back up non-flying jobs that you want to do and sometimes people also ask oh why do you stop flying then how are you going to get back into the world right working world and obviously i think about that as well because after studying i told myself okay if i go on a fly eventually i'm gonna come back yeah so i need my experiences to back me up yeah in a sense so even though flying is very customer service oriented yeah there's always like different aspects is there like huge concerns about coming back like after example you work in the industry for maybe like five six years if you come back do you have to start from scratch at like a new place like is this something that you're very concerned about i think five six years is not too bad okay because like you are around the environment but you also kind of grounded in a sense but i know people who have worked like 25 30 years yeah and when i asked them so when are you thinking of like not flying because obviously flying as an age yeah you can fly to a certain age you know right because after a while your health might not be very good for flying but those people always tell me well no laughter if i don't fly i'm not going to do anything else because they fly for too long and they are very comfortable in that that routine because flying is a routine non-routine thing yeah you do the same thing with different environments that's the only difference and they enjoy the 95 the no desk job the traveling and it gets very comfortable for you and i think that goes with any job also sometimes you get very comfortable in a place you don't want to get out of your comfort zone yeah okay well i guess that has kind of summarized what we want to talk about on today's video but any last words of advice to people who are trying to apply for this job or you know are currently in the industry i think if you want to like fly you should just do it you know because don't be so scared don't be scared that people are gonna say huh you can fly man you know just because somebody else is cannot doesn't mean that you cannot i agree you know don't let other people tell you yeah take some time do your research don't just step into it blindly and then dread it because there's a contract there's a bond so you right understand that if every job comes it's research that you have to do like you don't step into anything blindly yeah similarly aviation industry like as you guys can see now from covet not very stable so you have to know that as well and i think the most important thing is rejection handling rejection because if you can't handle rejection it's gonna be damn tough because i when i went my first interview i got rejected i cried so much and i just felt very worthless because to me it was like a slap in my face because i thought i wasn't competent enough i wasn't worthy enough to fly but then eventually i realized that you need to keep trying understand that potential of rejection and doing work also everyone is not going to be your friend the passengers are not all going to be nice it's not going to be like fairy tales and unicorns in the clouds you know yeah it comes with all the pretty views all the travel benefits and everything but the fundamental of the job is serving people okay thank you sangee for thank you oh my god and every time i end the video i'm like oh my god thank you for talking to me today i had a lot of fun and learning a lot about the industry itself because there's a lot of things that i've assumed or want to know answers to that you kind of answered for me today which is great and i hope that next year you'll be going back into flying yeah hopefully for the best of the world i hope that like covet lets up so that you know it can all go back to normal life yeah definitely definitely so if that's it we'll end the video here so thank you guys for watching this video uh let us know in the comments who else you would like to see on future episodes of asula and don't forget to like share and subscribe bye ,True,True,False,False

https://youtu.be/YP62jFlj41Y","- [Presenter] There's a
lot of excitement right now around the record speed
vaccines for COVID-19, some of which are already
starting distribution in parts of the world. But given that these are mRNA vaccines are relatively new technology that has not been widely used before. We wanted to explain how
they work and what happens to your body from the moment
that needle touches your skin. - Like vaccines, we're used
to seeing these vaccines will be injected into the
upper muscle of your arm but unlike typical vaccines which introduce inactive or
weakened forms of a virus, these will release genetic
material called messenger RNA. So what exactly does this mRNA do? Well in a regular cell of your body, you have DNA inside of the
nucleus and this DNA stores all the information and
instructions important to the functioning of your cells your body and ultimately makes you you. Inside your cell is machinery
that reads through your DNA and transcribes it into mRNA which then leaves the nucleus
and goes into your cytoplasm. And it's here that the ribosomes and yourselves read the RNA and depending on the specific code to
build a series of amino acids which fold in on
themselves to make proteins which keep you alive and functioning. This process is known as translation. In fact, it's this process
that viruses take advantage of in the first place. They insert their own
genetic information into you and then your cell machinery
unwittingly starts taking that information and building proteins to help create more viruses. - So back to the needle, the mRNA that is being injected into you from the vaccine also
carries genetic instructions but in this case, it's only coding for one small part of the virus instead of the whole thing. You've probably seen SARS
CoV2 represented like this with the spikes on it. And it's this spike protein
which on its own is harmless that the vaccines mRNA codes for. The mRNA makes its way into
the cytoplasm of your cells where the ribosomes read the information and start to create the spikeD proteins. Once the protein is made, it goes to the cell membrane
and then your cell breaks down and destroys the injected
mRNA instructions. - So what good does having a
tiny fragment of viral spike in your body do? Well, it gives your body
and more importantly, your immune system, a preview
of what the virus looks like without causing disease. Suddenly your antibodies
will notice it and go, well, this doesn't belong here which triggers an immune
response to recognize and prepare your body for the real thing without ever having to come in contact with the actual virus itself. Your immune system
essentially gets a headstart by creating powerful
antibodies that can neutralize and kill the real virus. And this antibody memory
is stored in your B cells so that if you're ever
infected in the future with the SARS CoV 2 virus, your
body now has the upper hand. This is known as an
adaptive immune response. Your body has already seen
these spike proteins before and therefore it already knows what to do. Essentially, these mRNA
vaccines allow your body to protect itself from a future infection without ever having to
risk the consequences of getting the COVID-19. - So why haven't mRNA
vaccines been used before? While they are relatively new researchers have actually been experimenting
with them for decades but in the past they've
been very unstable. Enzymes in your body would
break down the mRNA quickly so they needed to be packaged well. The ones being released
now have the mRNA encased in lipid nanoparticles
which essentially protect the mRNA from being degraded. Since there are more unstable
than other types of vaccines, they have to be kept cold. For example, the Pfizer vaccine it has to be stored at
minus 70 degrees Celsius and at normal refrigerated temperatures can only last five days. Of course, a global pandemic
has certainly increased the funding and resources going towards these types of vaccines which has helped to accelerate their development. - What makes these vaccines so appealing is that unlike other vaccines, they can be made in a lab with
readily available materials and actually made much quicker
than other types of vaccines. Instead of fully developing
non-infectious viruses and then injecting them,
these mRNA vaccines can sort of pass many hurdles
by using your own body in an ingenious way. It's also far more cost-effective
to create mRNA molecules rather than the proteins themselves and also a lot more scalable which is helpful when we are
in a global pandemic waiting for a vaccine. - So is it safe? And given that it's a
relatively new technology, should you be concerned at all? Well, that's what these initial
trial stages have been for. Not only to test whether or not they work and cause immunity but to make sure they have minimal side effects. As of now around 70,000 people have been given these vaccines with no serious concerns, a caveat being that the full research hasn't been published yet
as of recording this video. But it's important to remember that just because it's safe doesn't mean there won't be any soreness or pain. Some recipients did report aches and pains and as of now you'll
need to receive two shots to ensure efficacy. I saw a really great analogy
by the professor Shane Crotty who works in vaccine research and he said, ""It's not unlike going to
the gym and getting exercise ""and really sore muscles. ""A bit of pain can be a positive sign ""that good things are happening. ""Sometimes you have to earn your immunity, ""just like you have to earn
those biceps you wanted so bad."" - We know you've been asking
about these vaccines a lot, we've also had our questions. So we hope that all this
information was useful and concise and educational for you 'cause it does sort of help make things seem less unknown and scary
in a very strange time. - Thank you all so much for watching. If you want to hear more about vaccines, our podcast is on YouTube. You can check that out, we

States are reporting limited supply of vaccines, leading them to delay appointments and close clinics to the public. Some states lack staff and essential resources to get the job done. With little guidance from the previous White House administration on how to effectively administer vaccines, it’s up to states and local health officials to get the job done. President Joe Biden announced the administration will buy 200 million more vaccines and institute a national vaccine program to vaccinate 100 million doses in his first 100 days. But can it be done? Here’s what went wrong with the U.S. coronavirus vaccine rollout and how a new White House plans to turn things around.

What Went Wrong With The U.S. Coronavirus Vaccine Rollout","The United States rollout of the coronavirus vaccine has
been anything but smooth, Pfizer's vaccine rollout has hit a major snag. Look, it's a logistical Rubik's cube. Let's face it. If the Average Joe like us that needs 
themcan't get, who is getting them. Was there a plan? Was there really a plan for
distribution? There were multiple plans and that meant that there were
no plans. As of early February 2021, more than 8% of Americans
have received at least one dose of a vaccine. And there are concerns about disparities when
it comes to which Americans have access. The Kaiser Family Foundation tracked data from 16
states that are reporting the races of vaccine recipients and found people of color were receiving the
vaccine at much lower rates than white Americans. This is especially concerning since nonwhite
Americans are at higher risk for contracting the virus. The U.S. is still ahead of most European countries when it comes
to its rollout, but experts say the process has been moving too slowly. In comparison, Israel's Covid vaccine rollout has been
the fastest in the world. As of early February 2021, more than 35 percent of its
population has been vaccinated. Unlike the U.S., Israel established a national
vaccination registry, which makes record-keeping a lot easier. Israel, though, is facing growing criticism
for excluding Palestinians from its vaccination efforts. The United States took a more decentralized approach to
its rollout, which has left states to develop distribution plans on their own. And it's causing some problems. Here's what went wrong with the U.S. coronavirus vaccine rollout and how a new White House
plans to turn things around. On May 15th, 2020, the Trump administration launched
Operation Warp Speed to accelerate development, production and distribution of Covid-19
vaccines. Its goal was to have 20 million Americans vaccinated by
the end of 2020. But once it came time to get shots into people's arms,
the Trump administration turned the reins over to the states. This meant state and local health officials
were left to piece together a massively complicated rollout operation without federal guidance or
additional resources. That really requires an assembly line like set up. It requires several weeks of planning. It requires making sure the complex storage is
connected to individuals at the other end of the process. And for places that don't have all of that
infrastructure and that expertise, they really need more technical assistance from the federal government and
unfortunately, Operation Warp Speed only really seemed to focus on the science and ultimately the development
and approval of these vaccines, but not the logistics around distribution and administration. When the rollout began in December 2012, state and local
officials ran into a slew of logistical issues, and many locations lack the resources to
distribute vaccines smoothly. In many states, they have just hacked away at local
public health budgets to the point where people are using fax machines and Windows 98 to try and
communicate and to log their data. The rollout also began over the holiday season, which
led to more complications, especially surrounding limited staffing. The growing pains led to some high profile mistakes. In December 2020, 42 people in West Virginia were
accidentally given a monoclonal antibody treatment for coronavirus rather than the vaccine
mistake that the West Virginia National Guard, the organization leading the state's rollout, called a
""breakdown in the process."" Many state and local leaders now say that their
distribution operations have gotten more efficient since the rollout began. In fact, West Virginia has become
one of the leading states in the country when it comes to vaccinations. Even though states have begun ironing out logistical
issues, they are still facing another big problem. They don't have enough vaccines. The biggest challenge we face right now here is supply
of the vaccine, we just can't get it. There's no question we have an enormous supply demand
imbalance. 23,000 people couldn't get a vaccination because the
supply didn't arrive. If you take the calculation of what the county is
getting each week and you just look at the number of health care workers and seniors, we won't get through
them until June. The issue surrounding vaccine supplies started a few
weeks into the rollout when state officials said the federal government unexpectedly slashed the number of
Pfizer vaccine doses the White House had told them to expect. The Department of Health and Human Services
said states had confused the initial numbers the government had provided them with the actual allotment
the states were going to receive. HHS said the initial numbers were meant for planning
purposes only and were not exact figures. This forced states to scramble and come up with new
plans. On January 12th, 2021, the CDC expanded its Covid
vaccine guidelines, suggesting states allow everyone 65 years and older to receive a vaccine. As a result, more than half of states expanded
eligibility, increasing demand, while still having incredibly limited supply. The Trump administration then said it would release all
of the vaccine doses the government had been holding in reserve. But The Washington Post reported that the
vaccine reserve had already been exhausted when the administration made that announcement. Governors and local officials around the country said
the lack of supply forced them to cancel vaccination appointments that people had made in advance. The Biden administration announced on January 26, 2021,
that the federal government was working to purchase an additional 200 million vaccine doses from
Pfizer and Moderna in order to get nearly every American fully inoculated by the summertime. There's also hope for Johnson & Johnson single shot
vaccine candidate, which released promising results from its clinical trials on January 29th, 2021. A single shot vaccine would make logistics much easier
and could seriously speed up the process. But there's still the issue of locating the vaccine
supply that's currently missing around the country, and that will be a key challenge for the Biden
administration. We are working closely with General Perna, with the
manufacturers, with the states to understand exactly where the supply is. Right now I think we still have vaccine on the shelves
that we need to get into people. So we're looking at a rollout plan that will will be
diverse so that we can get to all people. Another big hurdle to mass vaccination is persuading
hesitant Americans to take the vaccine. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found
that about a quarter of Americans either don't want to get vaccinated or remain on the fence about it. The survey also found that Republicans and black
Americans were among the most hesitant groups. The sentiment is not just in the U.S. More than 35 percent of people in France and Poland say
they don't plan to get the vaccine once it becomes available, according to a YouGov study
published in January 20 21. Most of those polled said the main reason they won't
take the vaccine is because they wanted to wait to see if it's safe. I think once we get to 100 million, maybe 120 million
vaccines, the demand is going to get soft. This year, 120 million people got vaccinated for flu
adult. It was an all time record. Those were people who are worried about getting Covid
going out and getting flu vaccines. That may be the universe of people who really have
significant demand for a vaccine. And so I think we need to also, as we do this, work on
the demand side of this equation, we can't lose sight of that and just take for granted that everyone wants this
vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy is less of an issue at the beginning
of a process compared to the setback in the lack of infrastructure and the supply chain. But there have already been signs people are unsure
about getting the vaccine. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said about 60 percent of
nursing home workers in his state have declined to be vaccinated. He said this was especially concerning considering it
would make high risk elderly Americans more susceptible to contracting the virus. Vaccine hesitancy comes in numerous different flavors, I
will say. Some people really just need it to be convenient. Some people need to have permission to take the time to
get the vaccine or enough leeway to be able to take the day off if they're feeling
unwell the next day. Some of it is they just kind of want to see how it's
going to go. Some of it is education. And what is it that they are what is it that they're
hesitant about? What is the science that they need to understand? And we need to bring that science to them by their
trusted people. With the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a
dismal failure thus far. Just before he was sworn into office, President Joe
Biden announced the administration's national strategy to combat the pandemic. He set a target of administering 100 million doses
within the first 100 days of his presidency and hopes to institute a $20 billion national vaccination
program to help accomplish it. Biden says he will deploy FEMA and the National Guard to
work with state and local officials to build mass vaccination clinics across the country, as well as
deploy mobile units to rural and underserved areas. He also says he plans to make the vaccine
available free of charge, regardless of a person's immigration status, and help strengthen data systems
and transparency surrounding the vaccination process. Experts are hopeful that the slow initial rollout could
be turned around once the systems and supply confusion are sorted out. Massive deployment like this often goes through a phase
where we learn the mistakes, learn how to make the operations work. And it's very common in massive deployments to have
this sort of period where things look relatively flat. You get very concerned and then it takes off because if
you have multiple sites or one site figures that out, a lot of others are doing it at the same time. ",True,False,False,False
147,e-rxx-eLZn0,DW News,India sees rise in rare 'black fungus' infections | COVID-19 Special,2021-05-17T14:57:00Z,"In India, some COVID-19 patients are developing a rare, but dangerous infection - dubbed ""black fungus"" or mucormycosis. Typically starting in the airways, it spreads through the body, affecting the sinuses or lungs. Then bones and body tissue. The fungus can also attack the eyes and brain. If left untreated, it can be fatal.
It's important to note that black fungus is extremely rare. In India, it normally affects around 900,000 people a year, according to one study. That's less than one percent of the population.

But now big hospitals are reportedly diagnosing it in patients every second day in this ongoing second coronavirus wave. COVID-19 patients are especially at risk, because their immune system is weakened. And that may be contributing to the rise in cases of black fungus in India.

#India #Coronavirus #BlackFungus",in india some covert 19 patients are developing a rare but dangerous infection dubbed black fungus or mucomycosis typically starting in the airways it spreads through the body affecting the sinuses or lungs then bones and body tissue the fungus can also attack the eyes and brain if left untreated it can be fatal [Music] i'm ben fizzlin nice to have you along it's important to note that black fungus is extremely rare in india it normally affects around 900 000 people a year according to one study that's less than one percent of the population but now big hospitals are reportedly diagnosing it in patients every second day in this ongoing second wave covert patients are especially at risk because their immune system is weakened and that may be contributing to the rise in cases of black fungus in india oliver corneli is from the european excellence center for invasive fungal infections in cologne first of all what are the symptoms of a black fungus infection well the symptoms of mucormicosis that infection is unspecific runny nose fever but then it might turn into a specific sign and that is that the skin gets necrotic and necrotic skin would look black that is why it's actually called a black fungal disease it's not really a black fungus that's a different class of fungi but it looks black on the skin could you explain what actually happens to a patient what do they go through what do they experience well that fungus or that group of fungi really are destroying tissue so imagine that there is a sinusitis caused by that fungus then it doesn't stop there but it actually moves into the bone and it might destroy bone and then move into the next neighboring organs and tissue that could be the eye and therefore patients uh reported to me and said well i woke up in the morning and couldn't see anything on that one eye it's actually not painful because it destroys the nerves as well okay it's not painful but the consequences are severe i mean can you can you treat it and can you treat it soon enough to prevent something like that happening well if you think of it then you can treat it but it's difficult to get the right point to exactly understand what's happening because the symptoms are unspecific you could treat it with either surgery or with anti-fungals that's the antibiotics directly gets directed against fungi or you combine both but you need to be really really fast with that oliver tell me why it's such a problem in india right now i guess there are several reasons why that is so one risk factor for mucomycosis which is a well-known risk factor is diabetes and specifically uncontrolled diabetes that means that you have very high levels of blood sugar or glucose in your blood and that triggers the invasion the tissue invasion of the fungus and in india and the region you have a massive number of patients with diabetes who are at risk permanently even without corona another reason i i'd say is the exposure to the fungus the fungus lives in soil and decaying material and you would be more exposed to soil in a rural area of india than you are for example in an area in germany where the climate is completely different and another reason that i envision hearing that from my colleagues in india and other countries is that they use steroids dexamethasone for example to get covet 19 under control in a patient but steroids increase the blood sugar so they mimic a diabetic situation and that the fungus would take advantage of so oliver should people be worried in other parts of the world where coronavirus case numbers are also high in other parts of the world the problem is not that um large as we see in southeast asia india the reason might be that fungal infections are not that frequent in other regions north america europe for example south america has a different pattern of fungi and mucomycosis has so far only been diagnosed in a tiny minority of patients we don't know about africa actually and australia would be very similar to um other parts of the world with a low number of muchor so it's it's the different regions of the planet have their different fungal infections and oliver just lastly this was something i'd never even heard of before this show has is that something that makes your work difficult i mean getting the funding to research um is something that's quite fascinating um it's something that's not frequent but uh definitely something i don't want to get yeah that's true it's infrequent and for these infrequent infections there's all there's almost no way to get funding so it's heavily underfunded that's one reason why we only have basically three drugs that we can use against these fungi which is way a number that's too low and it's toxic drugs quite some of them okay we'll have to leave it there thanks for your time today oliver corneli from the european excellence center for invasive fungal infections thank you very much time to answer more of your questions now over to our science correspondent derek williams why aren't injected vaccines manufactured as a single unit instead of having the vaccine and the syringe separate this is a great question one that i've never really actually considered before right now most vaccine manufacturers are are filling and shipping multi-dose vials of vaccine that contain between 5 and 15 doses on site at the vaccination center or at the doctor's office staff then have to painstakingly draw them into syringes and in a complex time-consuming series of steps where where a lot could actually go wrong due to human error and and there are a lot of other issues with the vial system not least that once the seal on one has been broken all of the doses in the vial have to be used quickly um leftovers can't just be stuck back in the fridge for use later so so since everyone is getting their own syringe anyway why aren't machines just pre-filling them directly as a single unit instead of putting large batches of doses in vials first pre-filled single-shot syringes are already the norm in some parts of the world for for vaccinations against other pathogens but but there appear to be two primary reasons why the older vile system has been the method of choice so far for the mass covet 19 vaccine rollout the first is speed with manufacturers churning out hundreds of millions of doses it's simply faster for them to squirt 10 at a time into a single vial than it is to fill 10 separate syringes and with the pandemic in full swing getting as much vaccine as possible out there has been vital and the second factor is cost until now single-dose pre-filled syringes have been more expensive to produce but but many manufacturers say that's changing and that that pre-filling syringes is actually more efficient because then you don't need millions of medical grade glass vials so so when demand for covet 19 vaccines begins to slow i think that you can expect pre-filled syringes to grow in popularity because they have so many advantages [Music] the u.s centers for disease control is no longer recommending face masks for fully vaccinated people but the cdc says masks are still recommended in crowded settings like buses planes and hospitals and anyone who isn't fully vaccinated will still have to wear one over half the us population has received at least one dose against the coronavirus dancing is often about intimacy getting close and connecting foreign concepts in times like these but not impossible as these creative guys explain whether online or in the open air at first each one danced at home on their own whatever you need in this moment but since the summer of 2020 they've been meeting at the former temperholt airfield a huge public park not far from the center of berlin [Music] now it's a big field so we can there can be a lot of people and we can feel that distant closeness which which i also felt here today which is really beautiful there is really kind of a connection well no there's a literal connection it was still the first moment of corona everybody didn't know about what was going on so we were confined in our places and this was really helping me to stay clear with my mind and relaxed and berlin-based choreographer alvin kolantas came up with the idea for the online dance sessions he calls a dose of pleasure kolantas who's been staying with his family in canada also dances along with the participants from around the world the music and moves are streamed online so anyone from anywhere can join in really about their their own journey and then because we tap into the research together we tap into the music together we create a community so this is what i really enjoy is that we're all taking ownership of where we are and then we meet together with the music and the in the guidance whether here in a berlin park or elsewhere in the world they are dancing together to beat the [Music]

149,7Tzi7APK8Y4,"Christy Risinger, MD",New Side Effect from COVID vaccine - Should You Be Worried about MYOCARDITIS?,2021-06-04T14:00:08Z,"Dr. Christy explains the recent data on myocarditis both in the United States and Israel in easy to understand language.

REFERENCES:
JAMA Cardiology study: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548",hi and welcome to another edition of your health with dr christie my name is dr christy reisinger and today we're going to discuss the data surrounding myocarditis and the covid19 vaccine so the question that most are asking is does the covid19 vaccine cause myocarditis and the best answer for that right now is possibly but it seems to be rare this is what we know the covet 19 vaccines that seem to be related to the myocarditis are the mrna vaccines meaning the pfizer and moderna vaccines this reaction has not been seen with the one dose johnson johnson vaccine most cases occur after the second shot of the mrna vaccine and are seen in young men between the ages of 16 and 19. it occurs within four days of the vaccine and the typical symptoms include chest pain shortness of breath and heart palpitations we've gotten a lot of good data from israel on this because they vaccinated 55 of their population aged 16 and over and have a universal health system that's relatively small and can be evaluated israel recently announced the results of their expert panel investigation into this issue and announced on june 1st a possible association between pfizer's vaccine and heart inflammation among men aged 16 to 30 but especially among young men aged 16 and 19. in israel there were 275 reported cases of myocarditis from december 2020 to may 2021 148 of which occurred around the time of vaccination 27 cases occurred after the first dose of the pfizer vaccine while 121 cases occurred within 30 days of receiving the second dose this is compared to a total of 5.4 million vaccinated people in israel they concluded that between 1 in 5 000 men ages 16 to 24 who received the vaccine developed the rare condition but of note as i mentioned earlier israel has only vaccinated young adults aged 16 and older so we don't have good data from them on younger children and israel did not use the moderna mrna vaccine either only the pfizer vaccine but of note their health ministry has just approved moving forward with a pfizer vaccination for children ages 12 to 15 in israel but they have left it optional for parents to decide if they want to do it or not so what have we seen in the united states well last month connecticut's health commissioner said that there were at least 18 teens and young adults in the state who developed heart problems following the mrna of covid19 vaccine and washington state public health is investigating 12 reported cases of myocarditis or pericarditis since early may among king county residents following the first or second dose of the covid19 vaccine with either pfizer or moderna vaccines their cases range in age from 16 to 66 years but 11 of the cases were under 40 years of age and the majority of cases were among males at least three patients were hospitalized but no icu admissions or deaths have been identified well why do scientists think this is happening they're not really sure at this point but one possibility is that the very high antibody levels that are generated in young people may also in rare cases lead to a sort of immune overreaction that inflames the heart younger people have a stronger immune response to vaccinations and as a result they have a higher antibody level following immunization meaning their immune systems are working harder and viruses are the most common cause of myocarditis the inflammation is a product of the immune system trying to fight off the infection and since vaccines primed the immune system too it is possible that a covid19 vaccine might trigger the heart problem in some kids and specifically the smallpox vaccine has also been associated with rare cases of myocarditis in the past especially in younger men furthermore covid19 itself sometimes causes myocarditis the may issue of jama cardiology studied 600 college athletes who had a sars cov2 infection 37 were found to have signs of myocarditis but only five of these would have been detected based on symptoms alone so what exactly is myocarditis myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle known as the myocardium this muscle is responsible for pumping blood in and out of the heart to the rest of the body in many cases the exact cause of myocarditis is not found when the cause of myocarditis is found it's usually an infection that's made its way into the heart muscle such as a viral infection which is the most common or a bacterial parasitic or fungal infection some autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can also cause myocarditis well what should we be on the lookout for symptoms of myocarditis include chest pain which may get worse when you're lying down faster or irregular heartbeats shortness of breath and dizziness upon standing up or being more active these symptoms usually come after the more common vaccine side effects such as fatigue body aches and chills and the myocarditis that is being seen usually occurs within four days of receiving the vaccine well how is myocarditis treated thankfully when caught early myocarditis is very treatable usually with rest and nsaids such as advil or ibuprofen sometimes the inflammation is severe enough that hospitalization is needed or steroids are used and in very severe cases the pumping action of the heart is so compromised that iv medications or mechanical pumps are used to move the blood while the heart is not functioning normally thankfully the myocarditis that has been seen after the vaccine has been mild so what are my personal thoughts about this and of course you need to always consult your own physician and the cdc for guidance but in the future we may specifically choose one type of vaccine over another depending on age and sex for example the one shot johnson and johnson vaccine may be a better fit for younger men while the mrna vaccines like pfizera and moderna may be a better fit for younger women also studies may show that lower doses of the vaccine may be needed in children or that spacing between the two mrna vaccines may be increased in order to lessen the potential immune reaction that occurs or possibly we may find that younger people may need only one dose of the covid19 vaccine because they have such a robust response to it at this point i have given my 13 and 15 year old kids their first dose of the pfizer coveted vaccine and i'll wait for more information before giving them their second dose i have a feeling data may show that younger kids may need only one shot at least for now and as i said in my other video about vaccinating kids ages 12 to 15 the risk to these kids from covid just isn't large enough to pull needed vaccines away from other countries that need the vaccines for a more vulnerable population thanks for joining me ,True,False,False,False

vaccine this regime requires two doses of vaccination administered 21 days apart and is recommended for individuals above the age of 16 years of age this is part of the government's process to stringently assess the safety of covit-19 vaccines that we bring in and ensure that they comply with all international standards on safety and efficacy and only vaccines that meet the strict standard of safety quality and effectiveness will be used in our population the review process involved rigorous reviews of laboratory and clinical data and they have been reviewing the available scientific evidence in detail to ensure that all regulatory requirements and standards for safety and efficacy are met this is similar to what its counterparts in the us the uk the european union and the who have in place since october the ministry of health has also set up an expert committee on covet 19 vaccination and the expert committee has also reviewed the vaccination vaccine safety and efficacy data they have been briefed by the health sciences authority on its full considerations in granting interim authorization of this particular vaccine and agree with the recommendations that the vaccine should be suitable and given to individuals above the age of 16 but not at this time recommending the vaccine for pregnant women immunocompromised patients and those below the age of 16 due to the need for more data to emerge and be subject to that stringent evaluation process they further recommend that singapore should achieve as comprehensive coverage as possible among its population and as such they recommend that all singaporeans who are medically eligible for the vaccine should be vaccinated and the ministry of health has accepted the recommendations of both the health sciences authority as well as the expert committee for the coroner virus vaccination the health sciences authority will continue to actively monitor the safety profile of the vaccines and track for adverse events that are associated with this vaccine either globally or locally and this will allow us to react quickly if we need to manage any safety issues that might arise as a result of the recommendations coming out from the expert committees as well as hsa we encourage all singaporeans to be vaccinated as long as you are within the eligible group as recommended so that you can protect yourself and we can achieve a high level of protection nationwide vaccination is one of the key enablers that will protect us and our loved ones against covet-19 infection and allow the economy to open up for social activities to resume and having this community immunity will help us to be able to safely and quickly return back to normalcy and we encourage there for everyone in singapore to take up the vaccination when it is offered to you further assessment of the of the long-term data will continue to ensure that the immunity that is conferred is long lasting and to determine uh the proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to develop immunity to the cov19 virus and therefore we will continue to review that data and to decide whether these recommendations need to be adjusted along the way we have acquired sufficient doses of the vaccines for all singaporeans and long-term residents in singapore the securing of access to covid19 vaccines occurs through a broad and diversified portfolio and strategy to ensure that these vaccines will come into singapore in a timely fashion for vaccination of the population the first shipment is due to arrive in singapore at the end of december and the stocks will continue to arrive over the coming months we do expect to receive enough vaccine stocks to allow for the entire population to be vaccinated before the end of this year so everyone will be vexed will have a chance to be vaccinated but as the global vaccine supply is limited initially while manufacturers continue to ramp up their capacity we will need to prioritize those at risk and most vulnerable for that infection and therefore we wish to vacci vaccinate those who have these high risk in our plans we intend to provide vaccination progressively first protecting those who need this vaccination the most and these would be the health care workers and front line personnel most at risk of becoming infected with covid19 in addition we wish to vaccinate as a priority the more vulnerable groups at greater risk of severe symptoms if they were to become infected with the covet-19 infection and this is consistent with the who's recommendations for vaccination further details will be provided as we operationalize our plans for vaccination and further announcements will be given to allow you to understand where what your priorities are and when these vaccines will be provided vaccination is not a silver bullet that will immediately end the pandemic or the outbreak that we experienced in singapore safe distancing and safe management measures continue to be critical until such a time when sufficient numbers of our population are protected the kovit-19 vaccine will expedite a recovery from the pandemic but it is going to be some time before the world returns to a pre-coveted normalcy the key is not to let our guard down and to let our painstaking efforts in the past few months go to waste we need to continue to be socially responsible wearing a mask when going out and seeking medical attention if ill and getting tested if we have these symptoms suspicious of covet-19 infection and if we can stay vigilant we will emerge from the pandemic stronger and more united destination thank you ,True,True,False,False

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",my friends keep saying which vaccine should i choose what are the real differences between the two vaccines essentially there's not much difference efficacy of both vaccine is about the same it's about 95 the fisa vaccine is two doses with 21 days apart the modern vaccine also requires two doses 28 days apart the main difference is that the dose of the two vaccines are different so pfizer is 30 micrograms modernist hundred micrograms so i took the modern vaccine does that mean that it is three times more potent than the pfizer vaccine no yeah it does not the difference in the dose is a very practical issue because they had to make a guesswork as to where the sweet spot for the dose of the vaccine is going to be pfizer narrow it down to 30 more than it narrowed down to a hundred i think in reality it's somewhere in between so what explains the gap between pfizer and modena the 21 days and the 28 days and does it matter it doesn't matter by and large the rule of thumb is that about a month apart is about right if you stretch it out a bit more it actually could be even better because you're giving the immune system time to learn the problem though is that people tend to forget to come back if you stretch it out what about side effects then does it mean that if it's a higher dosage you are going to get more side effects it does look that way at least in the phase 3 trial data where especially on a second dose the reaction to the side effects like tiredness the rate of fever and all that appears to be more common in the modern vaccine compared to the physical vaccine but we cannot be sure that it's entirely due to those what causes side effects to begin with it's our immune response to the vaccine the side effects is in some way a good sign that your immune system is reacting to the vaccine right but for those who did not experience any side effects the data is showing that you are still getting a good immune response why are we still seeing people who get infected after they have been vaccinated now what we're seeing are actually mutants mutants which are quite different from the original strand in fact it's like the syllabus that has been changed so now when i used to score 95 marks with this standard syllabus exams i do worse off because i is a totally different mutant it's a totally different syllabus but even if we went back to the original stream the efficacy was only 95 which means while the 100 people there are five of them will still end up with an illness but we understand that to be mild what i'm hearing a lot is people around me saying that you see you see you get vaccinated you still can get infected so what is the point of getting vaccinated changes from severe disease to a mouth disease and from mild disease to a asymmetric disease so our responsibility is not just about not falling sick with corvette 19 but it's also preventing the severe forms which require oxygen or requires intensive care because eventually you don't want to destroy your hospital and your health care system how long will my protection last overall about 30 of us will have very long lasting antibodies that will cope and the other 70 percent won't have enough antibodies it will fall with time or they never mount adequately and in those cases all the more you need to remind the immune system by going for a booster vaccine when you see the 30 percent whose immunity or protection may last for a long time what kind of time frame are we looking at we're talking about years at the least eventually i suspect we will all have to do a blood test for antibody levels when the antibody levels fall to a certain low level we probably have to go for vaccination again how exactly do booster shots work booster shots work by jolting the memory of the immune system antibody levels fall but when you do a booster shot you shoot the levels very very high in fact superman high when that happens you'll be able to fight the virus even if it was a mutant are the booster shots interchangeable meaning if i start off with modern i can take a pfizer booster if you think about the size of vaccinology you should be fine because you are stimulating the same protein again the same spike protein one good possible outcome is this we may be able to find good matches of different vaccines that will even exceed what we'll be getting all along with the traditional two doses of the same vaccines prof i think many of us are looking forward to the past [Music] whereby we need not have social distancing we can meet as many friends as we want and we don't have to wear masks is that likely to happen it's like looking into the crystal ball so we aren't really very sure but personally i don't see this happening for the next three to four years at least to achieve 80 vaccination of the population the countries around us will still not be anywhere near that so that means travel will still be limited for the large part [Music] exercising the day before my jab will boost my immunity and the efficacy of the vaccine true or false false the main reason is because some people when they do too much exercise the following day they may experience some discomfort from the strenuous exercise and that actually makes the immune system even worse than usual i personally experience quite a bit of soreness on my arm i was told that if i moved my arm a lot it actually helps through a vault that is actually true keeping the arm mobile helps to improve the blood circulation of the arm and prevents the joints from stiffening this one is my mom's favorite piece of advice drink plenty of water after the injection it will help true or false it is true and false okay apologies to mommy why we do advise a light snake and adequate hydration before the vaccine and adequate hydration after the vaccine but sometimes over hydration may cause swelling may cause a bloatedness to some people who are not so mobile it can even cause water retention so we advise to just eat and drink as what one would normally do not necessarily have to do in excess alcohol can affect my immune response this question is a little bit complicated to answer chronic alcoholism definitely will affect one's immune system and it will dampen a person's immunity but having a glass or two alcohol wouldn't affect a person's immunity or the vaccine's efficacy will poppings paracetamol before the jab help no it wouldn't the reason being is because we don't recommend taking medication without symptoms for those who really want to maximize the efficacy of the vaccine is there anything we can do yeah regular exercise and balance healthy diet and most importantly is adequate sleep that would be the best advice to anyone to boost the efficacy of the vaccine even just one night of good sleep the day before can really helps to boost one's immunity [Music] you ,True,True,False,False

and never forget another password and keep all your online accounts secure! The year is 2021, and though the rollout of
5g technology has been slow, your town finally got all the fancy new antennas and cell phone
towers installed that will make it possible for phones to connect to the 5g network. Excited to try out lightning fast internet
anywhere you go, you pull out your phone and hop on youtube to watch another episode of
your favorite informative online show. But as your phone connects to the 5g network,
your nose suddenly starts bleeding. Your hands shake and your vision gets blurry,
then suddenly, your head pops like an overripe melon or that one scene from scanners. You're dead now, and it's all because you
just had to have 5g cell service on your phone. Clearly, the previous scenario is hyperbole,
but as 5g technology comes closer to being an international reality, people all across
the world are having some very real fears about what this new tech will do to the human
body. First though, what is 5g, and how is it going
to change the way we communicate? 5g is the latest development in wireless information
transfer technology. The G in 5g stands for generation, so this
is the fifth generation of cellular technology, which is impressive since the tech has only
really been about a few decades. 5G is poised to change humanity in a very
big way, and in fact may be the single biggest redvolution in human culture since the global
adoption of the internet. That's because 5g technology will allow information
transfer rates as high as a stunning twenty gigabytes per second, which is faster than
most wired connections. More bandwidth and improved antenna technology
will make it possible to share more data, faster, anywhere within network coverage. We could see latency drop to as low as 1 millisecond,
meaning that for the first time wireless augmented reality technology could become a real thing. This means that you could play virtual reality
games anywhere that you have coverage, but it would also allow for things like remote
surgery in more places. The military is already looking to applications
of 5g technology, and dream of a heads-up display system that would let soldiers share
real-time data across the battlefield, or let ground combat drone operators to control
battlefield robots alongside human soldiers in real time. Needless to say, the ability to stream so
much data so quickly anywhere with coverage could be revolutionary. 5g works differently from 4g by replacing
large, high power cell towers with many more cell stations spread out across a city. This is one disadvantage of 5g tech, in testing
users reported dropping out of service when more than two blocks away from a tower, so
telecommunications companies are going to have to invest heftily into outfitting each
city with thousands of new antennas. Luckily, these antennas are far smaller than
normal cell phone towers, and can be inconspicuously worked into light poles or the roofs of buildings. The reason for the change from large, powerful
cell towers to a swarm of smaller antennas is because 5g operates at a much higher frequency
than 4g coverage, operating between 30 and 300 gigahertz. This means that the electromagnetic waves
5g uses for communications are much smaller than those used for regular cell service,
and are thus much more prone to interference and have far shorter ranges. Right now companies in the US, Japan, South
Korea and China are building the first 5g networks, and its estimated that a full rollout
of the technology will cost billions of dollars and take until well into the 2030s. However the benefits far outweigh the steep
price, or even the wait, and 5g promises to make a truly interconnected world a reality. But with every new technology, comes fear
from the public sector, and now some people are opposing the rollout of 5g technology
on the grounds that it is dangerous to human health. The reason for the fear behind 5g largely
comes from the very high frequencies that the technology uses to transmit data. 5G operates at the same frequency that microwaves
do, and sadly a general lack of scientific knowledge has led many people around the world
to fear that 5g could literally cook your brain. As many scientists have pointed out though,
it's not the wavelength that makes microwaves cook food so effectively, but the power that
the microwave puts out. The average microwave puts out 700 watts of
power, while a cell phone barely puts out a single watt. Further, microwaves concentrate all of that
energy into a very confined space, while your cell phone spits out its energy all over the
environment. A woman in New Zealand made headlines after
starting an online petition to ban the rollout of 5g technology, fearful of the effects the
network would have on the human body. As is so often the case, the woman first grew
concerned when she read a Facebook post about the dangers of 5g technology, and since Facebook
is world-renowned as a trusted, peer-reviewed authority on all scientific matters, she immediately
launched an online petition asking her local government to stop the rollout of 5g technology
in her city. According to the woman, she feared what the
effects of 5g exposure 24 hours a day would do to the human body. She is hardly alone however in fearing the
rollout of 5g technology, and in April of this year a test rollout was halted in Brussels,
Belgium, after citizens became concerned over the extra “radiation” in the environment. This forced local government to enact anti-radiation
laws, which we wish them good luck in enforcing as we are literally bathed in electromagnetic
radiation every day. In fact we have bad news for Brussels, because
every time their citizens enjoy a sunny day they are being blasted by electromagnetic
radiation. Time to ban the sun, Belgium, except don't
think hiding indoors will save you because those light bulbs in your home? Bam- basically drowning you in electromagnetic
radiation. The culprit here is as so often is an ignorance
of science and scientific terms. Radiation is used to describe every single
electromagnetic emission in the universe, and these include everything from the sun's
warm light to your light bulb, or the waves that carry your favorite radio station tunes
to your car's radio. The difference between benign and harmful
radiation is whether it is ionizing or not, that is whether it is strong enough to remove
electrons from their orbit around an atom, thus causing the atom to become charged, or
ionized. The split between ionizing and non-ionizing
radiation occurs in the Ultraviolet range, and rest assured, 5g technology falls far
short of this point. Now non-ionizing radiation can still be dangerous,
as it can still generate heat and thus destroy living tissue. But once more we have to consider the power
that the radiation is transmitted at, and as we mentioned before, your cell phone simply
doesn't have the oomph to hurt you or your neighbors. For fun we looked at some of the more popular
conspiracy theories surrounding 5G technology, because on the internet ignorance is in no
short supply. One of our favorites was that 5G technology
was being used as a form of global population control, which we assume means that all previous
methods attempted were complete failures. Everything from GMO crops to vaccines to chemtrails
to dog farts have been claimed by conspiracy theorists at some point or another as being
forms of population control, and yet humanity continues growing despite our apparent best
efforts to prevent this. Either this means that these conspiracy theories
are nonsense, or the government is really, really bad at its job. Another favorite theory is the autism theory,
because apparently blaming the mercury in vaccines for causing autism is slowly going
out of style, so it's time to blame cell phones. First of all, the original mercury used in
vaccines never caused autism because the dose was so small and the body couldn't physically
absorb it, and the new version of mercury they use now is even less harmful. Plus, you can always get a mercury-free vaccine
if you happen to be scared of nonsense. But cell phones causing autism? Well, we're not quite sure how that's supposed
to work as the EM waves given off by radiation are so weak and scientists have confirmed
that electromagnetic radiation is at least 99% free of mercury. Another theory put forth is that 5g technology
uses high frequency waves that are capable of boiling water, and thus this is going to
be used to make everyone on earth sterile. This theory is of course half-right, as yes,
5g technology uses the same high frequency waves your microwave puts out, but as we've
mentioned twice now and really can't stress enough- it's not just frequency you have to
worry about, but power output. Besides, we have it on good authority that
the Zeta Reticuli reptilians who secretly rule the government have no interest in turning
humanity sterile, as it would dramatically lower their delicious human brain supply. Also we're not sure how boiling the water
in the human body would make you sterile. If this were possible it would just make you
dead, which on second thought, we have to admit is a pretty good way of making people
stop having babies. It's clear some people are fearful of 5G technology,
in no small part thanks to a general ignorance of science and the fear associated with the
word radiation. The best cure for this fear is to get informed,
just like you've just been- although you are a pretty smart cookie, you subscribe to The
Infographics Show after all. So if you want to help fight scientific ignorance,
tell a friend the difference between harmful and non-harmful radiation, or just share this
video! But there is a real risk that you do need
to be aware of, a constant one that can seriously impact your life unlike the made up claims
about 5G, and that’s the threat of hackers. You might think it’s just big tech companies

About Me: 
Some of you may know me by my Instagram handle @Fifteenblades. My name is Dr. Rola Rabah. I am a fourth-year Oral & maxillofacial resident completing my 6-year residency to become a dual MD DDS degree Oral surgeon. Follow my channel for weekly videos covering a variety of topics including residency, fashion, and health.

If you have a business inquiry, please reach out to biz.fifteenblades@gmail.com",hi guys my name is doctor willard i am an oral maxillofacial surgery resident and today i am going to share with you my experience getting the covid19 vaccine i got moderna dose one a few days ago and i am really excited to share my vlog about my day-to-day experience with this vaccine and my side effects this is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but that is my own experience with a vaccine you or someone else you know may have a different side effect profile they might react very differently to the vaccine this is just my own personal experience and i wanted to share it with you in case you are curious what someone who is young and healthy in the healthcare field might experience and remember i am a doctor but i am not an expert in infectious diseases i am not an expert in vaccines or virology however i do get all of my information from reputable resources i only give you evidence-based information and i do ask please if you are out there doing your own research which you should it is totally okay to have questions and to ask questions and to do your own research but if you do please make sure that the information you gather is from reputable resources like the cdc i will link below some resources that i personally use in order to get the latest information this is a fast evolving pandemic a fast evolving vaccine and it is totally normal for you to have hesitations however with the right information that's how i was able to come to a decision to take the vaccine and i hope that you will too as a public health request and something that we could do together in order to end this pandemic this video is in no way trying to persuade you to do one thing or the other at the end of the day i want you to have the best information out there and i want you to be able to make a decision you're comfortable with keeping in mind all of the evidence out there i believe in vaccines i believe they are one of the most important things that has happened to medicine and has saved thousands and thousands and thousands of lives um it is something that is going to give us a lot of hope and going to aid in ending this pandemic and so i am utterly excited to have gotten this vaccine and i cannot wait to get my dose too there are two vaccines out there right now in the u.s being administered there is the pfizer vaccine and there's a moderna vaccine clinically they are totally equivalent however there are a few differences between the two for example the dose that you get it's a higher dose with moderna a lower dose with uh the pfizer vaccine you also have differences in the duration between the first and second dose with pfizer you have to wait 21 days to schedule your second dose with moderna you have to wait 28 days to schedule your second dose however both vaccines do require a second dose in order for you to have immunity additionally both vaccines have the same efficacy meaning that they will protect you approximately the same uh amount uh the same percentage uh one is 94.1 that is the madonna vaccine and the pfizer vaccine is 95 effective and so these vaccines are highly effective compared to other vaccines out there and other vaccines that we use every year and so this research that has gone into these vaccines acts absolutely incredible i'm just astounded by the research the studies that were done which i will also link and share below and everything surrounding the rollout of this vaccine has been absolutely astonishing and i'm so so so so excited and proud to be part of the first group who has gotten this vaccine based on recommendations our hospital got the first batch of vaccines and distributed it to the most high-risk individuals and are still distributing it every single day and so i was actually placed in category one as you know i'm an omfs resident and so everything we do in the mouth is highly aerosolizing and so um healthcare workers who were working with patients and were going to be at high risk of being round covered patients got the vaccine first and they were staggered in order to monitor for symptoms and side effects and once you got your invitation to schedule your vaccine you scheduled your vaccine you went and got it and then you scheduled your second dose um the understanding is anyone that has gotten a first dose will definitely get the second dose that's how the vaccines are being distributed and so without further ado i'm going to show you in a vlog style so it's less formal what my experience has been getting the vaccine remember this is dose one so if you are interested i will do a vlog about my experience getting dose 2. if you are interested don't forget to let me know below and before you go anywhere please make sure you subscribe to this channel follow me on instagram at 15 blades and like and comment below hey guys so i am walking to the hospital to get my covert vaccine this is dose one of two i am really feeling all sorts of emotions excitement relief um anxious all sorts of things but i'm heading there now done done first shot done excited hey guys i just got my shot i am feeling like a million bucks um you know during the entire pandemic i just walked to the hospital every day with this profound fear that i was going to bring kovid home to my loved ones but i knew i had a commitment i had a job i was dedicated i wanted to help people so i still went every single day put on a ton of ppe and worked through it all but today just feels different it feels like hope is here the beginning of the end and so i can't even describe this feeling that i have i'm just ecstatic really really truly ecstatic and the entire process was really easy um i just answered a couple questions about whether or not i've ever had covet my symptoms um anything like that any allergies that i know i've had before with other vaccines or other medications they looked at my medical record and my medications really quickly um and then once all of that was set i got my cdc card with my vaccination record they wrote down the vaccine number and i got my first dose of moderna and honestly i did not feel it at all like if i wasn't holding my phone recording the footage for you guys i would have had no idea that the nurse was done with the injection because it was so painless the entire process was really seamless afterwards i sat down in the observation unit for about 15 minutes because they wanted to make sure that i didn't have any sort of reaction most people that were sitting in there did not have anything at all nothing that i saw and we all just kind of left and went on with our day and i made an appointment in 28 days to get my second dose of the vaccine so that's all set and i am like so excited for it you guys i know i've said that a thousand times but truly truly this is an incredible feeling and so far everything feels amazing um no symptoms at all after the vaccine i had no symptoms whatsoever didn't feel faint didn't feel um any sort of symptoms my arm is not sore at all and so i'm gonna go on with my day monitor my symptoms today and then tomorrow i will let you know how i feel good morning everyone so it is the morning after my covid vaccine dose one of two and i'm feeling pretty good i have to say the only symptom i really had yesterday um was a little bit of a sore arm and this morning that sore arm went from like zero to a hundred so my arm is quite sore it's this one i can't even like lift it past my shoulder um typically whenever i get vaccines i get some soreness at the site of injection and so i'm not super surprised because it happens to me every year with the flu vaccine and i remember once i had like typhoid vaccine and it was really painful and so this is pretty sore probably more sore than when i get the flu vaccine but that's pretty much it other than that i feel pretty good i'm headed into the hospital right now to go on with my work day i will keep you updated and let you know how it goes as the day goes on because technically i don't really hit 24 hours for another six to eight hours and so we'll see how i feel after 24 hours but so far so good i'll keep you posted hey guys so it's about 2 30 p.m and i ended up coming home a little bit early i am starting to feel really fatigued um no other symptoms just really tired like i felt like my body was kind of achy and i was really sleepy that's not usually the case for me especially this time of day and so i did have one more case of anesthesia left but the crna was that i was with was like you know what just go home get some rest you might as well and normally i blow it off and be like no i'm totally fine but i just really felt like i needed to get into bed and just turn off the lights and take a nap my body just feels exhausted like i i went and had a really huge workout and got no sleep and that kind of day after feeling um that's pretty much my only symptom and then this awfully sore arm like my arm is so sore i was intubating in my first case and i was having like a hard time doing it because my arm was so sore um but other than that i really didn't have any other symptoms i actually when i was in the recovery room i ended up taking my temperature just to make sure that i didn't have a low grade temp or anything um and i didn't i was normal temperature i took my blood pressure and it was totally normal i really don't have any other symptoms i don't feel nauseous i don't have any headaches no abdominal pain nothing really other than the sore arm and just feeling really fatigued really tired and wanting to take a nap and so you know it is early i'm going to just not settle an alarm i'm going to hop into bed um and take a nap and see if i feel better when i wake up and just keep moderating my symptoms and i'll let you guys know hey guys so it's about um four o'clock and um i didn't set an alarm or anything i just woke up naturally i'm not really a nap taker but i do feel better i think that nap did wonders for my body i'm still feeling kind of achy um arm's still sore but overall i'm feeling a little bit better so i think my plan is just to go to the living room watch some netflix drink some hot tea and just take it easy for the rest of the day and i'll let you guys know how i feel tomorrow hey guys it is officially day three after i got my dose one of the moderna covid vaccine and i am feeling like a thousand times better my sore arm is so much better it is still a tiny bit sore but that's about it not feeling fatigued anymore no more body aches no symptoms whatsoever i went to work did a full day of cases today came back home and i am energized back to normal everything feels great so really my symptoms um there were no symptoms the day of the vaccine most of my symptoms were on day two 24 hours after i had the vaccine just a little bit of fatigue body aches um and definitely a sore arm aside from that i was totally good to go the day after and really if i didn't have such a relaxed schedule on day two of the vaccine i could have definitely just worked through it it really my symptoms felt like um you know a bad day after a gym or you know a day after getting not a lot of sleep so it wasn't anything severe wasn't anything that was gonna going to throw me into bed um probably could have worked right through it but because i had a chill day i ended up coming home and taking um the rest of the day to just relax and so that was my entire experience with the vaccine and those were all of my symptoms truthfully and so hope this is helpful for you guys and i hope that with this information you can kind of do your own research and talk to other people see what their experience has been this is a really really interesting time in history the pandemic is something that has really shaken the entire world and the fact that we've come up with a vaccine one year later is absolutely incredible i'm so proud of science i believe in science i believe in this vaccine which is why i went and scheduled my vaccine as soon as i was able to but remember you guys no matter what um news is out there do your due diligence make sure that you're getting your information from legitimate resources um that means people who are experts in this field even myself i'm a doctor and i'm not an expert in vaccines i'm not an expert in viruses i'm not an expert in infectious diseases but i do know where to get good information from i do know who to trust and who to listen to and bad information out there is going to really hurt our country it's going to hurt your neighbors it's going to hurt your family so make sure that you are listening to trustworthy resources trustworthy information and if you're following influences on social media pick out the information that is logical and once you do go and do your own research as well don't just stop there make sure you take everything with a grain of salt and only after you do really good research from valuable resources i will link below some official resources for you to find out more information about the covid vaccine and coronavirus in general um make sure that you make your decisions based on that and on that alone it's not based on emotion it's not a based on what blogger has said what and it's certainly not based on what politician has said what this is not political this is medicine this is science and this is how we are going to combat this disease and how we are going to move forward together as a community thank you so much for tuning in you guys don't forget to subscribe to this channel like this video comment below let me know if you've gotten the coven vaccine and what your symptoms were like remember everybody's totally different and so just because i experienced these symptoms does not mean you're gonna experience them you might have different symptoms based on your body and your reaction to vaccines this is just my own personal experience so understand that and take that information and use it as you please thank you so much you guys don't forget

CNBC’s Uptin Saiidi explains how the city overcame the pandemic with minimal restrictions.

https://twitter.com/CNBCi","I’m walking through one of Hong Kong’s major malls. It’s home of iconic staples,
ranging from Starbucks to Apple, none of which have had to close at all
as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Throughout the city, gyms and nightclubs
are fully open. Hong Kong reported its first confirmed case
of Covid-19 on January 22nd. While the city did go through phased closures
affecting government offices, schools, gyms and bars, other services were unaffected, such as
dine-in service at restaurants, malls, and trains. Despite its laissez-faire approach, Hong Kong
has kept its fatality and infection rates low compared to other densely packed cities. The city, which has a population of 7.5 million people, only recorded around 1,200 cases toward the end of June. Let’s compare that to Singapore, another
major city in Asia. While both cities recorded similar infection rates
at the start, Singapore experienced a surge amid an outbreak in migrant worker housing quarters,
causing the city-state to enact lockdown measures. In contrast, Hong Kong had consecutive weeks
of zero new cases. By all accounts, Hong Kong’s situation
could have been bad. It’s one of the world’s most dense cities,
public transit is often packed, there are even direct flights and trains from Wuhan. In fact, more than 2.5 million people arrived here
from Mainland China in January alone. So how exactly did Hong Kong do it? Let’s look at five factors that resulted in the city
defeating Covid-19 while avoiding a lockdown. At the end of January, most people you saw
walking through streets like this were already wearing face masks and it wasn’t because
the government required it, but because people here remember all too well
what happened in 2003. We had never experienced something like that at that time,  but because of our experience during SARS, the Hong Kong people are
much more alert. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 
or SARS, affected the city particularly hard. Leah was in high school then
and remembers it all too well. When I was in school, the teachers were
taking our temperatures and we were wearing masks all the time. That’s why, today, the Hong Kong people are much more
diligent when facing the coronavirus outbreak, where we know what to do, because we already had
an experience of what could happen if we don’t take these safety measures. The outbreak was first identified in 2002 and eventually
came to infect nearly 1,800 people in Hong Kong. Hong Kong bore the brunt of the outbreak after
mainland China, with nearly 300 fatalities in the city. Following the health crisis, Hong Kong’s
government created the Center for Health Protection, which specializes in disease prevention and control. The public really responded, and so in most
places in the city, you could really see that people were wearing masks. That’s Professor Fukuda. He previously worked
at the Wold Health Organization and is now the director of the School of Public Health
at the University of Hong Kong. When they first heard about cases occurring
in mainland China, people took it seriously. If you can get people and the government to work
together, it’s an amazingly powerful combination. In late January, Hong Kong closed
nine of its 12 border checkpoints, leaving the remaining three open
to facilitate the flow of goods. As the situation evolved, the city banned all
non-residents from entering, starting on March 25. By early April, there were only about 100
daily visitor arrivals, and those who were arriving would have to undergo a strict 14-day quarantine. This one is the bracelet they will put on
you as soon as you land in Hong Kong. The wristband belongs to Marco, an Italian who has
been living and working in Hong Kong for 6 years. He flew from his hometown in Italy
back to Hong Kong on May 10th, where he was immediately tested for Covid-19 and, despite his negative test results, he was still required to spend 14 days
in quarantine at home. The wristband allows officials to
track his location at all times. I have to sleep, I have to shower, I have
to cook, I have to do everything with this. After returning to his apartment following
the test, he had to physically walk around the house so the government could track his
home’s coordinates. I cannot go downstairs or outside,
otherwise I think it will ring. Actually, I don’t want to try because the fine would be
HK$25,000  and six months jail. Besides the wristband, Marco has even received
sporadic calls from government officials on WhatsApp, checking in on him. As infection levels plunged, the city gradually eased
some of its border controls at the end of April. After testing negative for Covid-19 in Hong Kong,
Marco was asked to write down the license plate of the taxicab which brought him back
home. This allows authorities to contact the taxi driver
in case Marco tested positive later. Health officials announced a number of confirmed
cases were likely contracted at this bar behind me located in the heart of the city’s nightlife
district. Announcements like this one are all part of its
extensive efforts known as contact tracing. Every case undergoes contract tracing
to try to limit the spread of it. Anybody who has had contact with a confirmed case
is also instructed to self-isolate. In fact, the Hong Kong government has an interactive
map online showing detailed information about all the confirmed cases in the city such as
their residence and how they were infected. For example, a 29-year old male who tested positive
on March 19, visited this building just three three days earlier. All this information is in the public domain. Sure enough, this ended up being the same
gym that I go to and the company sent out an email confirming that a member had in fact
tested positive and disclosed which locations and times he had visited in the previous few weeks. The gym also announced it would 
temporarily shut its doors. This is all to say every case here is heavily
investigated. Another factor which likely helped combat
Covid-19 here is the fact that the city has a centralized government. Its relatively small population means that
it is easier for the local government to monitor and control the movement of its people as opposed
to how it is for bigger cities or countries. For example, the U.S. has had
different responsesto the pandemic at a federal, state-, city- and county-level 
amid varying regulations, making a coordinated approach tricky. The final factor that helped Hong Kong combat
Covid-19 could come down to cultural habits. There’s a very high consciousness about
not wanting to affect other people and not wanting to put them at  risk.
So when the public says, we’re part of the reason why things are going well,
it is absolutely true. Professor Fukuda has lived in both the U.S.
and Asia and thinks the cultural outlook has played a large role in the way the outbreak
has been contained in a place like Hong Kong. In Asia, there is a very significant degree
of concern about other people, about taking care of each other. But what I do see is that in the States, it has really exposed the are big cultural differences in the country. So whether you are in the rural areas or in the cities,
whether you are in red states or blue states. Whereas in Hong Kong, if anything, the outbreak
has brought people close together. ",True,False,False,False

Got a question for us to answer? Let us know in the comments - we’d love to explore more of your questions! Share, like, and subscribe for more videos to come! Over and out.","Oh! Hey there, Brainiacs. Well it’s week...who even knows of quarantine,
and you’ve probably already read every article and watched every video you could find about
the coronavirus. Most of those have focused on what coronavirus
is doing to our society, our economy, and our lungs. But as a neuroscientist sitting here in at
home, what I’m most curious about is: what is it doing to our brains? By now we’ve all got the symptoms of COVID19
memorized: dry cough, fatigue, and a fever. You might even know about some of the more
obscure symptoms, like a sore throat, diarrhea, and aches and pains. We’re learning more every day about this
virus, and working out new ways to combat it in our communities. Most of what we hear about the effects of
COVID19 are about what it can do to our respiratory system. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the official
name of the virus itself, seems to enter the body via the nose or mouth, binding onto cells
using the cell-surface receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2. The virus injects its genetic material, called
RNA, into the cells and hijacks their machinery to make more copies of itself, which go on
to attack more cells. Eventually, the virus can make its way down
the throat to the lungs, where it takes up residence and wreaks even more havoc. In the tiny air sacs where oxygen gets absorbed
into the bloodstream, called the alveoli, the fight between your immune system and the
virus can cause inflammation, cell death, and excess fluid, a combo that leads to pneumonia. Sometimes, when the infection is really bad,
patients end up with acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, when their lungs are so
clogged up that their bodies aren’t able to absorb enough oxygen and they really struggle
to breathe. This is usually when a person ends up requiring
ventilation to support their breathing - and even that doesn’t always work. But the danger isn’t only to your lungs
- it's to your whole body, including your brain. As the number of COVID19 cases climbs, doctors
and scientists have noted more and more symptoms linked to the central nervous systems - severe
headaches, for one, and loss of sense of taste and smell for another. Other reports include seizures and strokes,
and a recent case report even identified a COVID19 patient suffering from acute necrotizing
hemorrhagic encephalopathy, where the inflammation in her brain led to memory loss and disorientation. So what’s going on here? Well, again, since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus,
we’re not entirely sure. A lot of this hinges on whether or not the
virus can cross the blood brain barrier. Because the brain is so fragile and easily
damaged, it’s evolved a special set of blood vessels that are extra-effective at keeping
most things, like foreign pathogens, out of the brain. It’s called the blood brain barrier and
you can watch a whole video we made on that by clicking in the corner or checking out
the description. So the blood brain barrier is great for preventing
infection, but also bad for getting drugs into the system to treat any infections that
make it through. Case studies on patients have found conflicting
evidence as to whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can cross the blood brain barrier, but some preliminary
research in China seems to indicate that it can. And like anything that causes inflammation
in the brain, that’s bad news bears. Inflammation in the brain can cause a whole
host of problems, most notably swelling, or encephalitis. That swelling puts pressure on the brain,
causing everything from mild, flu-like symptoms and headaches on up to seizures, hallucinations,
paralysis, and loss of consciousness. Viruses like the flu or other coronaviruses
can also kill brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which wrap around neurons and act as insulation
to help them send signals. When oligodendrocytes die, this results in
demyelination of neurons, which can lead to muscle weakness, vision problems, pain, and
changes in sensation, among other things. Viral infections can also activate the brain’s
immune cells, called microglia, and make them attack the brain’s healthy tissue when they
shouldn’t be. So can SARS-CoV-2 do all of that? Well...we don’t know. We’re still trying to get a handle on what,
exactly, this virus does to the body, and to the brain. So far, it doesn’t seem like neurological
issues are /primary/ warning signs of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but some case reports indicate
that these symptoms, especially headaches, can show up days before the dry cough or fever,
meaning they might be good indicators for when a patient should be isolated and tested
for the virus. But, even if SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t primarily
attack the brain, that doesn’t mean we won’t see a wave of psychiatric and neurological
issues following this pandemic. Researchers at UC San Diego published a paper
in April of 2020, just a couple of months after the pandemic began, to warn the scientific
and medical community that patients who have been exposed to or recovered from COVID19
should be carefully monitored for neurological issues going forward. Based on past influenza pandemics, like the
one in 1918, they say that we should be on the lookout for possible increases in cases
of insomnia, anxiety, and depression, in addition to the risks we’ve already mentioned. And all of this doesn’t even touch on the
ways in which physical isolation, the anxiety of living in a pandemic, worrying about our
loved ones and our health, and the stress of financial uncertainty can all independently
cause serious mental strain. We’re still learning what the long term
effects of this virus will be - and not just on our brains, but on...everything. But this isn’t all doom and gloom! Thanks to technology, we’re better connected
with each other than we ever have been in the past; we’re able to FaceTime with our
grandmas, play video games with our friends, and swap favorite sourdough recipes with our
internet communities. There have been some incredible acts of generosity
and kindness, and sharing our vulnerabilities and fears can help get them out in the open,
giving our support system a chance to prop us up when we need it most. If you’re having a hard time with social
distancing, Micah made a video not that long ago about how to better deal with it. Please, please take this virus seriously. It’s a very scary and stressful time, and
it’s understandable that we’re all feeling impatient for things to go back to normal. I’m sad that I don’t get to spend time
on the beach, or visit with my friends, or go camping or hiking. But I know that this virus is very real, and
very dangerous, and I’ll stay at home to protect myself and those around me. I hope you will, too. How are you doing, Brainiacs? What have you been spending your time on? If you’re one of the cool people still watching,
drop a comment with your favorite sourdough recipe...or any bread recipe I suppose! Just comment
something about bread. That’ll really confuse everybody else. Thanks for watching this episode! Until our next transmission, I’m Alie Astrocyte. Over and out. ",True,False,False,False

#neuroplasticity #mindfulness #selfdevelopment #singaporemindfulnessconference #askadoctor #healthtalk #virtualconference #virtualworkshops #brahmcentre #selfimprovement #selfhelp #smc2020 #freewebinar #transformation #mindfulnessjourney",thank you julian again and thank you brahm center for the invitation uh to share our mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia so for today i will be giving a brief overview of insomnia and the goals for its treatment followed by a session to session description of the key features of the mindfulness based therapy for insomnia and i will finish this discussion with the relevant outcomes of the therapy as julia mentioned earlier we had done some research so i'll be presenting some of that results as well as discuss some of the possible mechanisms for how this therapy is successful at helping address insomnia okay so insomnia is diagnosed if you experience difficulty falling asleep difficulty staying asleep during the night or if you wake up too early any or all of which resulted results in you feeling not refreshed during the day and making it hard for you to function if these difficulties occur at least three times a week or more and last for three months or more you would meet the diagnosis of insomnia now insomnia may be caused by physiological or biological factors as well as psychological factors that make it more likely for you not to be able to follow stay asleep easily for example you're a light sleeper you stay up at night thinking about the next day environmental factors such as how dark quiet and cool your room is where you sleep may also impact the quality of your sleep behaviors which includes habits such as using your phone while lying down in bed and having heavy meals before sleep have also been shown to affect sleep any one of these or all of these factors may trigger a sleepless nights and when it persists long enough may result in insomnia dr victor did a good example using a case study of how these four factors applied to his uh colleague and friend suen so what's the goal of any insomnia treatment the goal of the insomnia treatment is to restore your sleep processes such that you build an urge to sleep and a need to sleep during the day that facilitates you falling easily to sleep during the night and that way you can be more awake and alert during the day successful treatments at achieving these goals have three elements one they help the individual form new habits in new environments that are conditioned to promote sleep they teach skills that help one to relax the mind and body in preparation for sleep and sleep naturally occurs when one is relaxed and when there is a sufficient sleep urge and need and three to address any myths that you may have developed as a result of the sleepless nights for example i must sleep a minimum of eight hours a day or without sleep i'm not going to be function and this is going to be catastrophic for the rest of my day so many of the treatments can be delivered one-on-one as dr victor has highlighted or they can be done in a group setting they both research has shown that both require a minimum of four sessions to start to prove to be effective and while both one-on-one and group are effective group has the added advantage of learning from one another so in a group participants can share learn and support one another through their experiences so it's not all on the facilitator of the therapist but rather it's a group experience in learning from one another okay so now i'm going to introduce mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia and this was developed actually by dr jason ong uh who is a sleep psychologist with the northwestern medical group in the usa and we were very fortunate that he came over and he taught us this therapy and then we were able to deliver it to a group of 120 people um of course in groups of 10 to 12 people at a time so the first thing is that mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia or mbti it employs the attitudes of mindfulness towards sleep now some of you may be familiar with these attitudes and some of you this may be the first time but i'm going to share how this will apply towards sleep beginner's mind or to have curiosity remember that each night is a new night be open try something different uh what you may have been doing is not working well and that's okay we're going to try something different and see this one will work non-striving so sleep is a process that cannot be forced but instead should be allowed to unfold so remember the example of i need to go to bed at this time i need to have eight hours of sleep you know and then you're lying there in bed wondering why you still cannot sleep you've done everything right but you're still not falling asleep so at this point it's more about being able to take a break realize it's not working and then if it happens wonderful so non-striving letting go attachment to sleep or your ideal sleep needs usually leads to worry about the consequences of sleepiness this is counterproductive and inconsistent so just allowing whatever happened during the day allowing the fact that you're not sleeping right now to let go of it so that when you are able to sleep it will come and you can fall asleep as needed non-judging it is automatically uh it is easy to automatically the judge the state of being awake as negative and especially if you do not sleep well for several nights however when you get judgmental you get frustrated you get angry this makes it then harder to fall asleep so by trying to not be judgmental we can change our relation to sleep and this way it might be easier for us to fall asleep acceptance recognizing and accepting your current state is an important step first step in choosing how you want to respond to your experience so if you can accept that you're not in a state of sleepiness or that sleep is not going to come soon why not get out of bed many people have trouble sleeping avoid getting out of bed but unfortunately the more you stay in bed the more you're conditioned yourself to thinking that being in bed does not help one way or the other and as dr kwok said that now seems to be a torturous environment going to sleep being a torturous experience sorry someone has raised their hand okay may i understand what raising hand means okay sorry then we have trust trust your sleep system and let it work for you trust that your mind and body can self-regulate and self-correct for whatever sleep you lost the nights before so creating sleep debt is also okay because you create that sleep urge you have that sleep pressure so two or three days i'm not having good sleep but if you build with all the other techniques that i will be sharing with you later you can then have good sleep perhaps the fourth night or the fifth night and patience be patient it is unlikely that both the quality and quantity of your sleep will be optimal right away as i said earlier research has shown that it takes about four sessions at minimum to start to prove to be effective so be patient with the process now the thing about mbti as i mentioned earlier it's a group-based intervention that also works on changing your habits and environment teaching you skills to promote a relaxed state of mind and body as well as challenge your thoughts feelings and beliefs about sleep and as i can show you this is the outline of the eight session program and it's usually conducted on a weekly basis so here we have all the mindfulness practices that some of you may be familiar here are the psycho education elements and here we have all the other behavioral strategies that we teach and some of you may have heard these terms already in doctor clark's lecture because sleep hygiene discussing relationship with sleep this is commonly found in the gold standard treatment which is cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia and what mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia does is to build upon it with an attitude of mindfulness okay so the first session we have the mindfulness breath practice and we have models of insomnia so mindful breath practice is to introduce the group members to mindfulness its concepts like the seven attitudes as this pertains to sleep and its practice group members are also provided psycho education about insomnia so it is important to know that there are three factors associated with one having insomnia we call them the predisposing precipitating and perpetuating factors the precipitating factors increases the likelihood of one getting insomnia and this could be physiological reasons like parkinson's disease uh thyroid condition or maybe your sensitivities to certain medication while the precipitating or triggering factors is what usually creates the first instance of sleepless night now if you just started to have sleepless night it doesn't mean that it's going to persist unfortunately for some of us we start to have thoughts about it have anxiety around it change our behaviors such that it perpetuates the phenomena of inside uh phenomena of insomnia for three months or longer while the predisposing factors are often biological uh or also you know if you're psychological if you tend to describe yourself as an anxious person or easily stressed person or someone has difficulty with processing anger there's also precipitating factors like a thyroid problem or psychological factors like grief from the loss of a loved one or anxiety over a stressful situation work and even a change in environmental condition meaning you moved house this jet lag there's change it works in your shift all of this can precipitate the first few nights of difficulty sleeping and as i said earlier in overtime sometimes in order to manage these difficulties we may adopt unhelpful thoughts beliefs and behaviors that cause these sleepless nights to persist longer and after three months we feel helpless and we feel that we cannot function and it causes us to stress resulting in us having insomnia for the second session we start talking about stepping out of autopilot autopilot being that you know we switch on and we just go on without being aware of what we're doing what we're saying what we're feeling and mindfulness is about coming out of autopilot so with the second session we introduce a new practice which is the body scan practice we teach a little bit about sleeplessness and wakefulness and we bring up sleep hygiene as dr kwok highlighted earlier so the body scan practice encourages attentiveness to one's experience of one's body the improved understanding promotes recognition of when you're sleeping when you're fatigued and when you're awake and the body scan is also a practice that one can perform lying down in bed before sleep unlike the other practices which involve you to be out of bed and preferably not to do it prior to sleep because the more practice of mindfulness actually the more awake and alert you can be in fact just the practice of body scan alone on a daily basis after six weeks with adolescents helped improve their sleep so as i said earlier this is sleep hygiene so here we bring in sleep hygiene and we encourage the members of the group to think about what behaviors that they can change and together with the body scan to practice it on a daily basis the third session we really want to go into the idea of sleepiness and wakefulness we also teach now mindfulness around movement so it's another way we can reconnect with our bodies but this time instead of just lying down and being stationary we do it with movement and a behavioral practice that we have to change a habit is sleep consolidation so sleepiness and wakefulness falling asleep is easiest when we are sleeping however many confuse feeling tired and fatigued with sleepiness when we are sleepy we are barely able to keep our eyes open and we find ourselves yawning easily some of you may feel like why is it when i go to sleep at night when i go to bed i'm wide awake but then when i sit at the television like an hour before i'm just nodding off and falling so that's the point at which you're feeling sleepy when we are fatigued or tired our bodies may feel weak but our minds are still alert so the body scan practice helps us to appreciate this difference one should go to bed when sleepy and thus likely fall asleep within 15 to 20 minutes if you are fatigued then one should work towards relaxing one state of mind and body so what is sleep consolidation as the name implies sleep consolidation is trying to ensure that the time we spend in bed is spent mostly being asleep thus we are asked to choose a time to wake up every day as our sleep wake cycle is actually determined by the time we wake up not so much by the time we go to bed which i hope we do when we are sleepy and so here we are aiming to have a sleep efficiency meaning that the total time in bed that is spent asleep is about 85 so if you go to bed for eight hours the hope is that for about six to six point five to seven hours of that you are asleep now we're talking about working with sleeplessness at night in addition to waking up at a consistent time we now encourage members to only go to bed and stay in bed when sleepy so remember sleepy means that when you go to bed you will fall asleep within 15 to 20 minutes it is also important to recognize when we are not sleepy and therefore unable to go to bed and allow to bring ourselves some compassion and acceptance of this phenomenon stimulus control is really about conditioning yourself hoping to recondition that you do not no longer see the bed as a torture a torture machine where i know when i go to bed i cannot sleep but rather to rebuild back that sense of when i'm lying down feeling myself in my bed feeling the covers on me within 15-20 minutes there's assurance that i will fall asleep remember what i said earlier about patience this does not happen immediately we teach one week of sleep consolidation and then together with the sleep reconsolidation we include stimulus control and we adjust this continuously throughout the eight weeks because we understand that it takes about anywhere from four to eight weeks before our body reconditions itself the fifth session is the territory of insomnia again we continue with formal practice or movement practices and we also do some psycho education about the territory of insomnia dr victor earlier said that we've come to appreciate insomnia it's a 24-hour problem right it highlights two aspects of insomnia the first is that it is a condition that not only impacts one at bedtime but rather starts to affect one just before going to bed and even the day after so perhaps at bedtime you're asking will i fall asleep quickly enough at night time even before you have thought about bed you're already asking yourself will i get enough sleep tonight and then when you wait for the day will i manage to get through the day feeling like this aka not rested the second aspect highlights how something that may become insomnia starts first with just our sleep disturbances the difficulty falling asleep the difficulty staying asleep the not feeling rested in the daytime followed by changes in behavior and over time changes in thoughts beliefs and attitudes around sleep in bringing attention to this it is important to highlight being curious open and accepting of our difficulties to fall asleep with compassion so here is where we come to accepting and letting go where we introduce another practice called the three-minute breathing space and we also look into our thoughts and feelings around sleep the three-minute breathing practice was actually created for mindfulness-based therapy for depression but dr yong felt it was appropriate here and it was to allow members to use at any time in any situation to mitigate the factors that may be contributing to their sleep difficulties for example managing stressful situations during the day when they let the energy addressing thoughts and feelings that are affecting the ability to rest and affecting their ability to fall asleep also important it allows them to become more aware of their thoughts and feelings as they may be having during the course of the day and that will also inform their ability to sleep so sorry when we were talking about revisiting the relationship with sleep we talked about the relationships with sleep in terms of thoughts and beliefs and attitudes as well as doing a nurturing and depleting exercise and this sort of joins in with the territory of insomnia so recognizing that once activities during the day may impact one's ability to fall and stay asleep this exercise encourages members to review their day-to-day activities and its impact on their energy level ideally we would want to balance of depleting and nurturing activities as too much depleting activities may result in feeling fatigued and tiredness this activity also helps highlight to members how they may organize their day based on the ability to have a good night's rest or not so if you are having a day where you didn't sleep so well the night before you had three nights where you didn't sleep so well you're really fatigued then you're going to be more attentive to trying to do more neutral or more nurturing activities before you engage in further depleting activities what are depleting activities any activity that you do that drains you of energy there's no fixed answer here for example for me checking my email is a depleting activity where for some it's a neutral activity and for others it may be an energizing activity so no one activity is depleting to all people it really is about yourself in your own reflection when we want to revisit the relationship with sleep during the seventh session the activity of accepting and letting go most importantly the compassion is emphasized so this includes our relationship with our sleep our beliefs our attitudes if you remember earlier dr put up a spreadsheet where people had a thought and how they felt about the thought and you know what this thought means to them so that they can challenge the thought what mindfulness would also want us to look at that thought recognize that these thoughts are temporary you know watch them as though they are trained that came into your station and you don't have to necessarily engage in them you don't have to get on to that frame and you can watch it go off um go on oh just watch them as though clouds are passing by so here we have uh the relationship with sleep and what i want to highlight is examples of how it can change like here we have attention and emotional biases towards sleep so for example rather than being attentive towards sleep-seeking thoughts and behavior i must sleep eight hours tonight i have to go to bed by 11 pm to get enough sleep there's an understanding that sleep is guided by being more accepting of my bodily states of sleepiness and trusting in that the last session is the action plan it serves as a review and an opportunity to prepare members for the coming days weeks and months after the program has completed the action plan has members recall the sleep related elements they have learned across the eight sessions and identify the actions they found helpful and most able to continue to follow in the coming days weeks and months on their own members are encouraged to write this down to help remind them of their work and effort thus far so as mentioned earlier dr julian lim and myself we engaged in a research study and so we will be sharing some of the research findings of this study that was done with 120 participants in total 60 participants received mbti and another one received an active control that just taught them sleep hygiene exercise and education we collected two types of data we collected subjective data which is based on self-report questionnaires that highlight the respondent's perception of the experience and objective results that are usually measured with tools which in this case is actigraphy well it's a more accurate form of a fitbit that you may be already wearing as i saw from some of the q and a discussing your fitbit results the following slides will illustrate its findings in graph format so the first thing we want to show as this is for only those who did mbti is that after they received the eight-week course their scores on five scales of mindfulness the ability to observe describe be aware be non-judgmental and non-reactive increase significantly we also have pre-sleep arousal somatic and pre-sleep arousal cognitive so pre-sleep arousal is what are the things that are keeping you up at night is it somatic or physiological sensations or cognitive you know you're thinking you're worrying and for both mbti and cognitive what we can see is that there's a steady decline from pre to halfway at week four to post meaning right at the end of eight sessions and this on predicated the caveat being that these individuals continue to practice their mindfulness after the end of the program six months later further decrease in their pre-sleep arousal one of the explanations for this is could be the reduction in their dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes associated with sleep which was measured on a 30 item scale that had people record how true they had these belief attitudes towards sleep and consequently they had improvements in their mood and improvements in the anxiety so sleep and mood and anxiety kind of play amongst each other the less sleep you have the poorer your mood the more anxious you can be but similarly the more anxious you are and the lower your moon can also impact your sleep so either way doing the mindfulness-based treatment for anxiety reduce their mood for insomnia reduce their mood and reduce their anxiety and this is the actography data but what i want to highlight is that they spent greater total sleep time in bed increased and the amount of time that they were awake after sleep on set was decreased that means their sleep efficiency if you calculate total time in bed and the amount of time a sleep improved after the six after the eight week program finally i want to highlight the difference between treatment response and treatment remission so treatment response describes what is the immediate effect after the treatment so after the eight weeks what was the response and we can see this is between mbsr and mbti this was a study done by jason ong as i highlighted earlier and he wanted to test between mbsr and mbti and what we found is that the it clinically improved from the initial onset of the illness here there's an improvement in insomnia a reduction in symptoms so blue is the insomnia program red is the stress program and now remission means that this person has been symptom-free long enough where they now feel no longer distressed and they've returned to pre-insomnia well-being and we see that the remission for mbti is greater than for nbsr most importantly that this persists after six months from the end of treatment so why how does this work well one of the mechanisms for the robust response and remission of insomnia with mbti is the cultivating of adaptive attitudes with the practice of mindfulness and bringing these concepts to bear on insomnia mindfulness involves developing mental awareness and a flexible as well as adaptive response and then the acceptance of one's experience and this has been shown to improve sleep so you fall asleep faster and you stay asleep longer and there's less waking during the night the other thing i wanted to highlight as we talked about earlier was matter awareness together with acceptance and if necessary letting go over time brings a shift in values beliefs and attitudes that shape our thoughts feelings and behaviors from a male adaptive ones to more adaptive ones so i hope this presentation has illuminated the use of mindfulness as a form of therapy for the management of sleep difficulties namely insomnia and which was creatively organized in a structured treatment by dr jason ong and has proven effective here in singapore so this was a collaborative effort by the awake lab which is the lab that dr julian does in my lab at sgh and the singh health sleep disorder center at sgh on that note thank you very much and i give it over to you now julian

factories emily is one of 161 kid influences tracked by influencer marketing agencies in singapore her career is managed by digital marketing and production company night owl cinematics or noc this room will be white i should be playing up to you i think it'll be white emily is noc's youngest influencer when companies come calling the agency assesses their needs and matches her with the brands that best suit her usually when brands approach them they will help us get the details and like what we need to do and then what are they looking for and then the brief and then they will let us know

relieved when people see me because it means the video was good wow this the first feels very soft emily may look like she's only opening a gift but actually what she's doing is selling you a toothbrush unboxing videos give viewers a sense of anticipation excitement surprise and delight and that's what brands want to leverage on i think what attracts the client is family is very authentic we don't fake it i post organic posts for emily playing with cousins reading books going shopping even just as simple as her watching tv people feel very happy to see family goofing around doing her silly stuff it's very good although kids under 13 are banned from setting up social media accounts studies reveal that as many as twenty percent of children as young as six years old are bullied online zemly is no exception mom karine handles her social media accounts to shield her daughter as far as possible [Music] i just ignore the main comments if i respond it will just let them achieve the goal of grabbing our attention there is this one follower when we post photos right his private message will be oh i like your armpit and then for our parents to see such a message i it makes me feel very very uncomfortable i feel very upset when they leave nasty comments because when i do videos i know i did my best in the video i can't think of anyone who would do that my mom helps me manage my instagram so no time when i grow up i know more about instagram i know more about social media i can take care of my own account so i'll say it [Music] but in a world where young and cute as king growing up is about to bring a new set of troubles for our kid influences haley and finley are among the top kid influences in singapore since the age of three haley has been selling everything from toys to luxury apparel for retailers from australia the uk and even the united states all on instagram if it's like a clothing shop that sells both girl and boy clothing haley and finley are just nice for that it's perfect for them [Music] each year through their social media posts the siblings and their fellow influences persuade close to 7 out of 10 kids to get their parents to buy a product they saw online there are so many toys including giant and surprise a lot of companies will look at the followers and the engagement that we have my children are quite cooperative but sometimes having to post within a stipulated amount of time does invoke some stress on me and on the children sometimes we shoot on weekends and hotly days i have no time to play with finley and the family i still enjoy doing it because i get free clothes and vouchers these two are the first one i picked it has like glitter and stars and it's like a princess most of the kid influencers parents charge a fee based on the number of followers and the engagement for one posting i can charge as little as fifty dollars or a hundred dollars but when we do get any cash it goes straight into their bank accounts i'm quite happy that they get these opportunities especially haley as she grew up doing this she became a little bit more confident being sure of herself knowing how to carry herself we do get a lot of things that are given to us like clothes toys wow five-year-old finley has just received a delivery of free toys why did they give you free toys show people show people yeah we need to show people toys to sell the toys finley is in kindergarten one this year in terms of brands that look out for kids at a particular age group finley may be more advantageous now at his age because finney being the younger one then he would naturally be the cuter one and then he might get a little bit more collaborations than haley four five six seven oh yeah i get to go turn we don't compete on the shoots because we only compete on games you know like board games and snake and ladder and i always win [Music] [Music] steps [Music] what happened with a following of 18 000 combined on instagram and tick tock popularity is also attracting internet trolls if someone is bullying you reach out to a trusted family members like me or teachers for help like menopause yeah never agree to do something or share anything that makes you uncomfortable every day single mom karine balances a full-time job as administrator in a preschool and takes care of her young daughter she's been doing it alone since emily was just six months old what did i say before what should you do you say a lot of times then when you want to start listening always pack after you're done i can she understand that every time afterward i'm very tired so she will also do her part to make my life easier she'll scoot me but it's for my own benefit she wants the best in me so she's a very good mother very good she said i hope you're my mom bye but when she's doing her job she is my boss because i help her with water i bring her food i do her hair do her outfit and everything [Music] put your hand in the bucket family receives offers of free toys books and meals almost every week they are all hoping to entice emily to endorse their product on instagram and tick tock i don't think that emily will develop the attitude of like always wanting free stuff it's not free per se it's more of like we help them to let more people know how good the product is i'm a mom who will let her know what is the right attitude when it comes to different aspects in life i think that it's more important than letting her think that everything is free and she just have to just be there and get free things which one you like you like the one you and your mommy yes i love it the money that she earns are all purely for her saving that she can use maybe in the future i want to save up more money so i can pay the bills when maybe i'm 18 years old how about my family for the future it's not easy to create content because sometimes i have to find my own concept i feel tired but happy [Music] when circuit breaker came it's a bit sad because like then like cut down photos of it happened we had a few collaborations put on hold even if it's just like clothing that did not happen anymore the circuit breaker could not have come at a worse time for haley [Music] in the kid influencer world of online marketing haley at the tender age of seven is on the cusp of becoming obsolete [Music] brother sister duel hayley and finley young are among singapore's top kid influences but these days there isn't much to do covet 19 has slammed the brakes on many upcoming projects it couldn't come at a worse time at seven years old haley may already be reaching her peak as brands that want to collaborate start to dwindle i wish that i could have more offers but if i don't have to shoot i can spend time with my family i'm okay with finley modeling more and i have less [Music] [Music] it's past a certain age she does not appeal to their target audience anymore i noticed the decline when haley was about six i'm also slowing down on the offers that we accept because she is already in primary school and usually brands prefer like younger cuter kids [Music] with her audience numbers dropping and her brand collaborations falling hayley's earnings have also cut in half i think it will be a natural step for us to prepare that eventually she will not be doing this anymore shooting does give her some confidence so then this will be channeled into other areas since she has her ballet classes where she's able to express herself if philly continues modeling without haley i think that's okay no i don't want to do the rest because i want to be a bus driver so this is my craft table and it's super messy so i'm gonna pack it up right now i want kids to do good deeds so that when people need help they just have to ask the kids and it won't be very troublesome and the tape goes here yeah i think it's tidy enough i think it's good to tidy it feels more open yeah i enjoy it younger kids nowadays is so easily influenced by media by friends by surrounding it helps you be more organized so i think we shouldn't just follow trent instead i would hope that people who is following her take something good out of her and and learn it [Music] so how's the work what is hiring i know going to the infant is always tired especially when we get so early yeah content creation isn't just because of the money and fame to me i do it because i like to do it i do believe that with great power comes with great responsibility i would say to other children who wants to be content creators to follow their dreams [Music] i don't want to grow up doing this because when i grow up i want to be a teacher and i want to be a bus driver mommy didn't start our instagram because she wanted to be us to be popular people are happy when they see us on instagram because they're very cute and they like our clothes our shoes and our poses pig's house if they eventually choose to go down that path i mean so be it but i just want them to be any regular singaporean they are able to contribute to society they are able to have good jobs be able to have a close relationship with their families

Psalm 91 is a psalm about those of us who dwell in the secret place of the Most High, which is in Christ! As believers, when fear or anxious thoughts creep in, it is the Word of God through this Psalm that will rescue you from those worries and reassure you of the Lord’s divine protection over your life and the lives of your loved ones.

Whatever trappings the devil might have for you, the Lord will surely deliver you from them. Even for the pestilences that you don’t even know exist around you (i.e. asymptomatic cases of COVID-19), God has promised in His Word that He will protect you, and you need not fear.

Let us start memorizing Psalm 91.  You can even take time as a family and make it a fun activity to memorize this psalm together. We believe that you will see God’s divine protection in action as you and your loved ones meditate on His Word!

of the pandemic that is upon us,
it's vital that we memorize— not just read through
once in a while but really memorize
and meditate on Psalm 91. I really believe Psalm 91
has all the fingerprints of God for such a time as this. Even in America. Alright? Psalm 91:1—
""He who dwells"" ""in the secret place
of the Most High"" ""shall abide.” 911 is the emergency
call number in America. And it so happens that
Psalm 91 is a psalm of protection. And it's a New Testament psalm
even though it was uttered many years ago. Some believe it was by David,
some believed by Moses. I believe it was David. But nonetheless,
you will find that that psalm is so relevant to 
the times that we live in. Amen. It opens up by saying:
“He who dwells in"" ""the secret place of
the Most High will abide"" ""under the shadow
of the Almighty.” And it talks about how:
“Surely He shall"" ""deliver you from the
snare of the fowler."" Surely, not maybe. ""Surely He will deliver you
from the snare of the fowler.” Any trappings that the
devil has in the future, God has promised
that He will deliver you. Surely He will deliver you. So as we meditate on this psalm—
you know, it's going to rescue us from
fear, worry, and anxiety during this time,
during this pandemic. Just the other day,
I was listening to the news and just
for a moment, anxiety rose in my heart
because I heard how the asymptomatic cases—
where people who don't show symptoms in their bodies
but have the virus— they are going around and
you know, I’m talking about not Singapore, 
but around the world. And they are
on the increase. It seems like there are
more and more asymptomatic cases
and it sort of like— fear rose in my heart. Or just a little fleeting fear
rose in my heart. And then the verse from Psalm 91
came to my rescue. It says: “You will
not be afraid of the"" ""terror by night
nor for the arrow"" ""that flies by day.” And listen. “You shall not be afraid
of the pestilence that"" ""walks in darkness.” Now, for the “pestilence that
walks in darkness”, you don't even know
it exists. Amen. It's walking in darkness. You don't even know
it's there. It's in darkness, right? It's walking in darkness. That to me is the
asymptomatic cases. Amen. Amen. And even for the
asymptomatic cases, God will deliver you from it. Amen. Praise the Lord. So I want to encourage
you to memorize Psalm 91. Get your kids to
memorize Psalm 91. You know, the other day,
I was reading a story of a true story of a man,
a Colonel from the British regimen who served
during World War One. This is World War One
that lasted for four years. His name is Colonel Whittlesey
and he was in charge of a British regimen
in the front lines. So for four years,
he served in the front line, with his regimen. And a regimen
is about few hundred men. But what he did was
he's a devout Christian and he had his men
carry with them a card or something
that had Psalm 91 on it. He made them memorize it. And not only that,
he made them quote it every day. They had to quote it
at least once. Amen. Memorize it and quote it
by memory or declare it as they read it. But they are to memorize it. And they will do it every day. They'll recite it. In the cause of these
four years of World War One,
there's not a single casualty in his regimen. You know,
“a thousand may fall"" ""at your side and
ten thousand"" ""at your right hand,
but it shall not"" ""come near you.” The promise in Psalm 91. So let’s get our children
to memorize Psalm 91. Amen. Get them to memorize it. It's not that long. You can memorize it. And during times like
what I experienced just now, the fear
that rose in my heart when I heard that news,
and straight away, the word of God comes,
it rises up and banishes that fear by saying that
“You will not"" ""be afraid of the pestilence
that walks in darkness.” Here is my
eight-year old son, Justin, reciting
Psalm 91 from memory. He who dwells
in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord,
“He is my refuge"" ""and my fortress;
My God, in Him"" ""I will trust.” Surely He shall deliver you
from the snare of the fowler And from the
perilous pestilence. He shall cover you
with His feathers, And under His wings
you shall take refuge; His truth shall be
your shield and buckler. You shall not be afraid
of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow
that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence
that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction
that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may
fall at your side, And ten thousand
at your right hand; But it shall not
come near you. Only with your eyes
shall you look, And see the
reward of the wicked. Because you have made
the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High,
your dwelling place, No evil shall befall you,
Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;
For He shall give His angels charge over you,
To keep you in all your ways. In their hands they
shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot
against a stone. You shall tread upon
the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent
you shall trample underfoot. “Because he has set his love
upon Me, therefore"" ""I will deliver him;
I will set him on high,"" ""because he has
known My name."" ""He shall call upon Me,
and I will answer him;"" ""I will be with him in trouble;
I will deliver him and honor him."" ""With long life I will satisfy him,
And show him My salvation.” Amen. Praise God. Amen. So let's get our children
to memorize Psalm 91. And I want to encourage you
yourself to memorize Psalm 91. And it's amazing how
at the right time, you know—you hear a report
saying that more people are dying young or you know,
the age span for people in this part of the world
is around— straight away,
the word of God will come to you and say:
“With long life"" ""will I satisfy him.” So the criteria for a long life
is based on your satisfaction. “With long life
will I satisfy him.” If he's not satisfied at 70,
he can go on to 80. If he's not satisfied at 80
he can go on to 90. If he’s not satisfied at 90
he can go on to— Hey, go all the way
to where Moses was at 120. The Bible says when
Moses died, his eyes was not dim
nor his natural force abated. ",True,False,False,False

Post-vaccine symptoms are typically mild and resolve quickly without the need to use any medication.

Common COVID-19 vaccine side effects include:

Redness or soreness at injection site.
Muscle aches.
Fatigue.
Headache.
Fever or chills.
For some people, the second dose in a COVID-19 vaccine series is causing a stronger reaction and more side effects than the initial dose. The same was true during clinical trials.

Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that is undergoing clinical trials as a potential COVID-19 treatment. Singapore is taking part in the global Phase III trial, and the participants include the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), National University Hospital (NUH) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Associate Professor David Lye from the Infectious Disease Research and Training Office at NCID shared more about remdesivir trial.

treat those still battling the infection two people infected with the novel coronavirus completely recovered after receiving infusions of blood plasma from survivors but experts are still cautious about the effectiveness of the treatment South Korean officials are expected to announce guidelines on using plasma therapy for virus patients there aren't any approved treatments for Cobra 19 but those who are those are for other diseases are being studied to see if they can be used researchers are also experimenting with new treatments remedies aveer is an antiviral drug that is undergoing clinical trials as a potential covert 19 treatment Singapore is taking part in the global phase 3 trial to see if the drug is effective in treating patients and the participants include Singapore's National Centre for infectious diseases together with the National University Hospital and Singapore General Hospital recruitment of patients for the trial started in mid-february Japan's National Center for Global Health and medicine and the US National Institutes of Health are partners in the trial now for a closer look were dried by associate professor David live from the infectious disease research and training office at NCI d thank you very much a professor live for joining us so let's look at this room de severe drug it's new is actually used for treating Ebola so tell us more about this drug and the test so it is not exactly new as you know it was developed for Ebola it was trial in four or five years ago and it failed as an Ebola drug and because of the ongoing Middle East corona virus it was actually tested in the laboratory and in animal models and was found to be actually fairly very effective in fact it was the most effective drug in the laboratory and in the mouse model so when when the copy not in hit us we were looking around for what clinical trials we can run and like most other experts this is the drug that we felt is a most promising so well how it works is essentially by inhibiting how the virus replicates so you've really got to give it when there's through the virus in your body and however it was actually very difficult to get into this drug and there's the reason for that at the start of the academic when you were first hit Kovac nineteen the the outbreak was mainly in China and this drop was not and is not in commercial production so the company basically provided China with most of the drugs and was very difficult to get onto it we were very lucky we have the mastic foundation we have economic develop in our get in touch it give you the company that makes it and we're able to nourish rouse so at this stage and we were quite lucky because of course at the start of the epidemic there weren't that many sick patients but as we know now as we every pass a thousand map we have more and more people getting sicker in intensive care and this drop has has so far been tested in 21 patients who are sick enough to be in intensive care in single professor like how many patients are you actually targeting to recruit in Singapore and altogether internationally the photo force so this particular drug is tested in two trials internationally a moderate drought for 600 patients and a severe trial for corner patients in fact as of about last week the severe trial completed recruitment worldwide we're able to get extension for access to these drugs for our patients so so far we have recruited 21 patients in the severe arm we were allowed initiate 25 but will now extend it to 69 so I'm very delighted I just got a news two days ago that we can continue to get access to this trap for sick patients in Singapore current 19 so that is indeed good news but professor Lee how are these patients selected how do you go about choosing who gets this drug so this time randomized control trial so they have very fixed right we're very clear criteria is not like anyone can get onto it and we also know that because we have been following our patients for for 11 weeks now about 40% our patients remain very well these are not the people than any treatment but about 50 just over 50% of patients will develop lung infections we call pneumonia and about half of these patients will develop a fairly severe pneumonia within oxygen so essentially this trial that gilja runs two trials the modern arm requires the presence of pneumonia and the severe trial requires the use of oxygen so and it has the usual criteria where the patients keep concerned myself good kidney good liver function luckily for this infection most patients only have lung failure from the pneumonia so we have been able to get most wishes and need him onto the trucks now these trials have not been going on for very long but can you share some of the preliminary observations so far now did the final results are not out yet but I've asked my colleagues who are helping this trial in Singapore General in Mission Hospital as well in my Convention Center ID because the key extra is actually open label that means the doctors know which arm the patient is allocated to all of my colleagues felt that the drug seems to work very well the patients improve very quickly those who oxygen also got off too quickly but a caution about about this observation because in the randomized control trial you only know the final result when all the data are analyzed and that is that is the time you'll know the answer we probably will know the answer in about slightly more than a month that's my estimate I can't keep up the good work thanks for speaking

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",on may 19th singapore started rolling out his covet 19 vaccination program to those under the age of 45. by the end of the year every eligible citizen and resident will be able to get vaccinated but these recent reports have made many of us question how effective the vaccines really are the patient had been fully vaccinated since early march but he tested positive three days ago in routine testing the 11 additional cases are linked to the first case at tantop singh hospital a fully vaccinated nurse i'm getting my first shot in a few days and i'm giving you an insight into my vaccination journey i'll be keeping tabs on how the jabs affect me and finding out all you need to know about the efficacy of the vaccines i'm here at the bonavista community club for the first dose of my coveted 19 vaccine to be honest i am very very nervous because i've heard so much about the possible side effects but i'm going to do this so come along before my shot i'm asked to declare any known allergies if i'm on certain medications and whether i've had a fever in the past 24 hours i'll be getting a dose of the moderna vaccine are you reading yeah on a count of three one two and three breathing without breaking it down very good it went in but it's not quite over yet immediately after the jab i'm ushered to a waiting area where i'm told i'll have to be observed for half an hour in case of severe allergic reactions that wasn't too bad when the needle first went in i have to say it was a little bit painful but i am so glad that so far it's been less than five minutes i don't have seemingly any severe reactions but i do want to know what to expect and i know that there's a doctor on site so i'm going to try and speak to him hi doc hey how do you have a quick chat for sure yeah yeah so what kind of symptoms are you monitoring for during this first half hour so for this 30 minutes um it has been recommended that we look for all the possible allergies that can happen after vaccination that can range from you know the scattered rash the occasional rash swelling of the eyelids and also the severe ones like breathlessness and shock that we call anaphylaxis have you had to attend to anyone so far well for the severe allergic reactions unfortunately zero no but we do see the occasional rash and sometimes swelling of the eyelids or even lips so what causes allergic reactions in both the pfizer bioentech and moderna vaccines one ingredient could be the main culprit polyethylene glycol it's a compound that helps to stabilize the vaccines it's commonly used in drugs and cosmetics and has been known to trigger allergies in some people so far so good for those of us being held for observation but we've been told to expect side effects like muscle aches fever and fatigue even after we go home okay so i've got the appointment card for my second job in 28 days as of now okay i should have done that but there was a bit of an ap feeling but i still feel good but i think i should take anything for granted i'm gonna head home and restart so far more than 1.2 million people here have been fully vaccinated vaccines work by giving your immune system a preview of a virus so it can learn how to fight it before encountering it there are a few ways to do this the two vaccines approved for use in singapore developed by pfizer bioentec and moderna both use what's called mrna technology here's how it works the coronavirus has a spike protein on its surface which enables it to enter our cells and infect us mrna vaccines carry instructions on how to make this protein which is harmless without the attached virus once injected into our body our cells start pumping out these proteins triggering our immune system which learns how to identify and eliminate these foreign invaders our immune system then stores the cells as part of its memory which it can rapidly recall to fight off the virus if we are ever infected by it with both the pfizer bio and tech and modern vaccines offered in singapore i want to know if one is better than the other so i've arranged to speak to professor wein young the co-developer of a covet 19 vaccine that is currently undergoing clinical trials my friends keep saying which vaccine should i choose what are the real differences between the two vaccines essentially there's not much difference efficacy of both vaccine is about the same it's about 95 the fisa vaccine is two doses 21 days apart the modern vaccine also requires two doses 28 days apart the main difference is that the dose of the two vaccines are different so pfizer is 30 micrograms a modena is 100 micrograms so i took a modern vaccine does that mean that it is three times more potent than the fisa vaccine no yeah it does not the difference in the dose is a very practical issue because they had to make a guesswork as to where the sweet spot for the dose of the vaccine is going to be pfizer narrow it down to 30 more than it narrowed down to a hundred i think in reality it's somewhere in between so what explains the gap between pfizer and modern the 21 days and the 28 days and does it matter it doesn't matter by and large the rule of thumb is that about a month apart is about right if you stretch it out a bit more in terms of the effect to of the vaccination it actually could be even better because you're giving the immune system time to learn the problem though is that people tend to forget to come back if you stretch it out what about side effects then does it mean that if it's a higher dosage you are going to get more side effects it does look that way at least in the phase three trial data where especially on a second dose the reaction to the side effects like tiredness the rate of fever and all that appears to be more common in the modern vaccine compared to the physical vaccine but we cannot be sure that it's entirely due to those what causes side effects to begin with is our immune response to the vaccine the side effects is in some way a good sign that your immune system is reacting to the vaccine right but for those who did not experience any side effects the data is showing that you are still getting a good immune response for a couple of hours last night i didn't feel anything that was unusual so i thought i got lucky and then four hours later wham the soreness set in in the upper arm area near the injection site it got uncomfortable enough that i lost some sleep in the middle of the night but otherwise this morning i was able to get up go to work no problem my arm i still can't lift something heavy but other than that no side effects i'm not the only one experiencing some discomfort after the first dose it has been 12 hours since i got my first dose of visor at 8 30 am this morning the left arm feels a little sore right here it feels like after a baby workout kind of muscle soreness and in the afternoon i felt a little tired so i took a nap after my first dose i experienced muscle aids on my left arm chills and the body for about two days for the first dosage three days basically i have muscle ache fever as of april about 20 percent of the population had received the full dose of the covet 19 vaccine but still community cases have been on the right and some of them are fully vaccinated how effective are our vaccines now what we're seeing are actually mutants mutants which are quite different from the original strand i've discovered that the side effects many of us experience from the covet 19 vaccine such as body eggs and fatigue are actually normal immune system responses and therefore nothing to worry about but some people say they experienced severe allergic reactions that landed them in the hospital this man posted a video of his soul and palm which he says lasted for 10 days after the vaccine while this person claims to have broken out in hives for a week after the jab doctors told him it was likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine as of april 18 there were 95 reports of suspected serious vaccine reactions out of the more than 2.2 million doses administered that's a mere 0.004 percent the reports include breathing difficulty fast heart rate and anaphylaxis a rare and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction so getting vaccinated isn't totally risk-free but thankfully severe reactions do seem pretty rare but there's been a recent resurgence of community cases the authorities are still encouraging people to be vaccinated despite an increase in number of vaccinated individuals getting infected and some of them had already been fully vaccinated vaccination doesn't provide 100 protection to find out how effective the vaccines really are i've arranged to speak to dr lyon nam dr leong has had hands-on experience managing several disease outbreaks including the sars outbreak in 2003. okay dr leong why are we still seeing people who get infected after they have been vaccinated now what we're seeing are actually mutants mutants which are quite different from the original strand in fact it's like the syllabus that has been changed so now when i used to score 95 marks with this standard syllabus exams i do worse off because i is a totally different mutant it's a totally different syllabus but even if we went back to the original stream the efficacy was only 95 which means while the 100 people there are five of them will still end up with an illness but we understand that to be mild what i'm hearing a lot is people around me saying that you see you see you get vaccinated you still can get infected so what is the point of getting vaccinated vaccination changes from severe disease to mouth disease and from mild disease to a asymmetric disease so our responsibility is not just about not falling sick with coveting but it's also preventing the severe forms which require oxygen or requires intensive care because eventually you don't want to destroy your hospital and your healthcare system how long will my protection last overall about 30 percent of us will have very long-lasting antibodies that will cope and the other 70 percent won't have enough antibodies you'll fall with time or they never mount adequately and in those cases all the more you need to remind the immune system by going for a booster vaccine when you see the 30 percent whose immunity or protection may last for a long time what kind of time frame are we looking at we're talking about years at the least eventually i suspect we will all have to do a blood test for antibody levels when the antibody levels fall to a certain low level we probably have to go for vaccination again wow how exactly do booster shots work booster shots work by jolting the memory of the immune system antibody levels fall but when you do a booster shot you shoot the levels very very high in fact superman high when that happens you'll be able to fight the virus even if it was a mutant are the booster shots interchangeable meaning if i start off with moderna i can take a pfizer booster if you think about the size of vaccinology you should be fine because you are stimulating the same protein again the same spike protein one good possible outcome is this we may be able to find good matches of different vaccines that will even exceed what we'll be getting all along with the traditional two doses of the same vaccine with my second job coming up i want to make sure i'm as prepared as i can be i've been getting a lot of advice from exercising the day before to popping a painkiller before the shot to prevent side effects i wonder if this is all true this one is my mom's favorite piece of advice drink plenty of water after the injection it will help true or false i've been learning about the efficacy of the covet 19 vaccines and it turns out the vaccines don't offer the same level of protection for everyone my second job is tomorrow and i want to make sure that my immune system is in top shape now i read somewhere that exercising the day before the injection is supposed to boost the effectiveness of the vaccine and i've also heard and read about so many tips to manage the side effects [Music] to help me separate fact from fiction is dr singh sian cho who provides medical support at some of the vaccine centers around sir good singapore see you thanks for your time exercising the day before my jab will boost my immunity and the efficacy of the vaccine true or false false the main reason is because some people when they do too much exercise the following day they may experience some discomfort from the strenuous exercise and that actually makes the immune system even worse than usual i personally experience quite a bit of saunas on my arm i was told that if i moved my arm a lot it actually helps true or false um that is actually true keeping the arm mobile helps to improve the blood circulation of the arm and prevents the joints from stiffening this one is my mom's favorite piece of advice drink plenty of water after the injection it will help true or false um it is true in false okay apologies to mommy why we do advise a light snack and adequate hydration before the vaccine and adequate hydration after the vaccine but sometimes over hydration may cause swelling may cause a bloatedness to some people who are not so mobile it can even cause water retention so we advise to just eat and drink as what one would normally do not necessarily have to do in excess alcohol can affect my immune response this question is a little bit complicated to answer chronic alcoholism definitely will affect one's uh immune system and it will dampen a person's immunity but having a glass or two alcohol wouldn't affect a person's immunity or the vaccine's efficacy will popping's paracetamol before the jab help no it wouldn't the reason being is because we don't recommend taking medication without symptoms for those who really want to maximize the efficacy of the vaccine is there anything we can do yeah regular exercise and balance healthy diet and most importantly is adequate sleep that would be the best advice to anyone to boost the efficacy of the vaccine even just one night of good sleep the day before can really helps to boost one's immunity okay this is it day of jab number two i got enough sleep i had been exercising and eating normally so i think i'm all good i can't wait for it actually i just want to get it over and done with thank you it's finally time for my second jab and i think i'm as prepared as i'll ever be okay so my arm was very very sore it lasted for about two days there was no fever so if i reported any unusual symptoms that might indicate an allergy like bad rashes or breathing difficulty i would be stopped from taking my second job but i've been given the all clear you wanna watch your grade yeah [Music] one two and three [Music] okay maybe watching the needle going wasn't such a good idea still it hurts a little less the second time around all right ma'am so resonation is done thank you so much and congratulations on your second vaccination thank you thank you so much yes thank you i'm counting down to my 30 minutes and then i'm gonna call home and tell the kids mama's fine it's been about 24 hours since my second injection all day today i had chills body eggs and felt extremely lethargic right now i feel like i've got a bit of my energy back so hopefully i can be back to normal by tomorrow now that i'm fully vaccinated i want to know if there are things i can do now that i couldn't before it seems i can now skip pre-testing for events that require them like weddings and performances i might even be able to travel to certain countries soon without the need for quarantine but i wonder at which point will we reach herd immunity that is enough people around us vaccinated and protected against covet 19 and once we get there will we get back some sense of normalcy to our lives for some answers i am darling professor suliya thank you for talking to us again the former clinical director for the national center for infectious diseases what is the magic number that we are looking at to achieve herd immunity at humidity we mean that those who are not vaccinated will still be indirectly protected because the people around them are vaccinated so they act like a kind of shield right initially we found out that third immunity can be reached if 70 percent of a population can be vaccinated but with the new variants they are more transmissible i think many experts around the world think that it should be about 80 but even then i will have to caution you that her immunity doesn't mean that the disease will go away or there will be no cases prof i think many of us are looking forward to the past whereby we need not have uh social distancing we can meet as many friends as we want and we don't have to wear masks is that likely to happen it's like looking into the crystal ball so we aren't really very sure but um personally i don't see this happening for the next three to four years at least to achieve 80 vaccination of the population the countries around us will still not be anywhere near that so that means travel will still be limited for the large part [Music] my own experience with the covet 19 vaccine was thankfully uneventful but i've learned that getting vaccinated may not make you completely immune but it does make you less likely to get severely ill or have symptoms should you get infected now for the next few years getting blood tests to monitor our antibody levels and getting booster jabs may become the norm even after we've been vaccinated but it's the right thing to do to help protect those around us ,True,False,False,False
165,qNoG1IntTF8,Scripps Research,Repurposing existing drugs for coronavirus: Scripps Research COVID-19 updates,2020-03-19T19:37:00Z,"Scripps Research teams are looking for anti-viral drugs that could be given to people already exposed to the novel coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. One priority is to test already approved drugs, or drugs with significant safety data in humans available, which could be made available to treat coronavirus patients on a much quicker timescale than new therapies. To do this, Calibr—the drug development division of Scripps Research—is leveraging a unique resource, the ReFRAME drug repurposing collection. With support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Calibr compiled ReFRAME, the world’s leading collection of known drugs, comprising over 14,000 compounds that have been approved by the FDA for other diseases or have been extensively tested for human safety.","We put the ReFRAME drug collection
together to basically be able to take all of the molecules that have been
dosed safely in humans and make them available for screening to  variety of
different collaborators both within the Scripps Research environment, both in
Florida, here in La Jolla, but also broadly across the whole world to be
tested on a variety of different assays particularly those of neglected tropical
diseases and infectious diseases. It's 14,000 compounds and we're actually
adding compounds every day to this collection of which nearly 7,000 of
those molecules are ones that we actually synthesized ourselves and put
into the collection to make available for folks to screen. We actually sent off our first compound
collection to a coronavirus collaborating lab on the 24th of January.
We're actually just starting to get screening data from those collections
and following up on confirming those hits moving potentially some of them
into animal models of disease that give us a better sense of could these be
potentially useful in humans. And, then in parallel also working to figure
out ways, if those compounds are promising, to move them quickly into
clinical trials with material that we can use. A lot of drugs have actually
been discovered by this idea of repurposing. As a matter of fact the use
of AZT during another large viral outbreak that happened 30-40 years ago in HIV was actually discovered from screening cancer drugs that the NIH had
at that time. And there are many, many examples since then not just in viral
diseases but in other indications. So, we see great purpose in taking drugs that
we already know a lot about. We know about their safety. We know about how
well they work on certain things, how well they may be tolerated in humans, how to synthesize them and manufacture them on scale. We know all of those elements
so the ability to go from a very early discovery to actually impacting patients is
much shorter using the drug repurposing approach. So one of the really key aspects about
Scripps Research is that we can go from early biology of understanding the virus,
understanding the epidemiology of that virus at Scripps Research working
closely with folks at Calibr like myself and others really involved in
kind of drug development and how can we take hits and quickly move them forward
into clinical development. The ecosystem of Scripps Research is
exceptionally exciting to be able to take something that's obviously of great
public health importance and be able to have an impact in patients. ",True,False,True,False

One drug of interest is remdesivir, a decade old drug intended to treat hepatitis. It was never a great success for that, but it may be helpful in treating coronaviruses. One thing that is established is that it is safe for use in humans, which is a HUGE regulatory hurdle. If it turns out to be effective, we already know it is safe.

#healthcaretriage #coronavirus #covid19","there are several drugs under investigation for the treatment of kovat 19 Bertram disappears probably received the most attention a few of you asked us to talk about it and we aim to please so that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage Ram disappear is a broad spectrum any viral developed by Gilead Sciences the United States pharmaceutical company and was not actually created in response to Cove in nineteen it was developed just over a decade ago as a potential treatment for hepatitis C and was later tested as a potential treatment for a bola while it was essentially a bust in both cases all the work to find that out also led to us finding out to other things relevant to the current pandemic REM disappears the potential worked against coronaviruses and it's safe to use in humans we know that it works by targeting a biological mechanism that some virus is used to replicate themselves inside the human body that's why it has potential to work against more than one virus because it doesn't directly affect any given virus just the means by which that virus tries to take over research conducted in the last five years has demonstrated the ability of REM desapear to block corona viruses from replicating in animals a study out just this year demonstrates its ability to reduce disease severity viral replication and lung damage and monkeys infected with MERS another corona virus we saw back in 2012 knowing all this saves us so much time in the drug development process we've got a readily available and safe drug with definite potential but that of course doesn't guarantee success remember basic lab research and proof of principle work in animal models are required steps for all drugs to move on to clinical trials where many of them fail there's been a flurry of data and we picked out three sets that appear to be responsible for most of the chatter one set comes from the maker of the drug Gilead who's conducting a study with around 6,000 patients from all over the world so far the data suggests that patients who are moderately ill meaning they require hospitalization but not ventilation recover more quickly on REM disappear than those receiving standard care there isn't much else to say here because we don't yet have access to all the data or all the information about the study all we know is the limited information released by Gilead so far who stated in a press release that they will submit the full dataset for publication we do know that a placebo was not given in the study so both patients and doctors knew who was getting the drug and who wasn't this of course introduces a slew of confounds so even with a full dataset we'd be feeling pretty cautious the next set of data getting a fair amount of attention came from a study published in The Lancet on April 29th it was a randomized controlled trial of 237 adults who received a 10-day course of REM desappear or placebo within 12 days of symptom onset the results do not indicate statistically significant differences in time to clinical improvement in patients receiving the drug there was some indication of decreased recovery time in patients treated sooner after symptom onset but larger studies would be required to establish an effect because this study was somewhat underpowered unfortunately well for this study anyway kovat infections were brought under control in China where the study was being conducted before researchers can meet their intended sample size fortunately we do have some data from a similar but larger study from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases this study was also a randomized controlled trial and included over 1,000 adult participants from sites in the United States Europe in Asia preliminary results were published on May 22nd and indicated that individuals receiving a 10-day course of REM desappear had a median recovery time that was four days shorter than those receiving a saline placebo some data also indicate that the drug may be more effective the earlier its given this makes intuitive sense given that the drug works to halt viral replication its utility would likely decrease if it's given after the virus has already had the chance to significantly replicate at that point were contending with other issues including things like potentially problematic inflammation from the immune systems response to the virus lastly and importantly the data also indicate no significant difference in mortality rates between the drug and placebo groups so at the moment like it might be helpful in reducing recovery time under specific circumstances but it can't be the only tool in our kovat toolbox in Eli Lilly trials begun testing an antibody drug developed specifically for kovat and other trials of looking at the potential of various drug combinations for example one is currently underway to examine the effect of REM disappear alone versus REM desappear combined with an anti-inflammatory so there you have it the latest data on REM disappear it shouldn't surprise you that this like most things doesn't appear to be a silver bullet it has treatment potential but we need more information including on potential side-effects for now the drug has been approved for emergency use in the United States Japan and India the data should continue to pour in and we'll continue to keep an eye on it and on data for other treatments keeping you updated as we go Paige enjoy this episode you should check out last week's episode talking about coronavirus

170,-rNe9M0A2gQ,UC San Francisco (UCSF),Remdesivir - potential drug for COVID-19 shows promise,2020-05-14T18:21:18Z,"Correction: Additional footage provided by The Authoritative Source - covid19.theauthoritativesource.com



Nearly four months since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the United States, a glimmer of hope has emerged for treating the disease.


Early clinical trial results for the anti-viral drug remdesivir have offered hope. The drug appeared to help patients recover faster, from 15 days to 11 days. That earned remdesivir an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA, allowing it to be used more broadly outside of clinical trials.


Annie Luetkemeyer, MD of the UCSF School of Medicine breaks down the findings regarding remdesivir.","- Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Lindsey Criswell, the
vice chancellor of Research. I'd to welcome you to
the third of a series of COVID-19-related research town halls, sponsored by the Office of Research. Today's event will focus
on COVID-19 research underway within Quantitative
Biosciences Institute, or QBI, at UCSF, and as with the previous
Office of Research town halls, a recording of this event, along with the answers to
the questions submitted, will be available at the
Office of Research website. Please also note that another town hall is planned for tomorrow at four o'clock. That will be our third
in a series of events co-hosted with the Academic
Senate that focus on research operations during
the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you will all be joining us tomorrow for that town hall. And now I'm going to turn
things over to David Morgan, our vice dean for Research
for the School of Medicine, who will moderate today's town hall. Thanks, David. - Okay. Hello everyone and welcome. We have a very special
event for you today. We're gonna hear about
a lot of really exciting new discoveries in the science
of COVID-2 and COVID-19 from the Quantitative
Biosciences Institute. I think many of you know
that a lot of labs at UCSF have pivoted recently
to COVID-19 research, especially since the shutdown occurred in the last couple of months. But I don't think any lab,
not quite as early as start as the lab of Nevan Krogan, who started working on this problem probably in a roundabout late January. And so they've been working on the virus, the infection process
and potential treatments for about three or four months now. And so we're gonna hear
about a lot of their exciting recent developments in that area. So, as the first slide showed, we're going to hold all questions until the end of all the talks. We have five talks, as you can see here. We're gonna keep our eye on
the question and answer box in the Zoom video. And then at the end, I will get together with Kevan Shokat, we'll moderate the
question period at the end. So, without further ado,
here is Nevan Krogan, director of the Quantitative
Biosciences Institute to start the show, Nevan. - Great. Thank you, Dave and Lindsay
for coordinating this. We are delighted to be telling
you about some of the ongoing research at the Quantitative
Biosciences Institute, which is in the school
of pharmacy here at UCSF. In particular the efforts of the QCRG, the QBI Coronavirus or
COVID-19 Research Group. And as Dave said, this is a
group that has come together a couple of months ago. Initially it was 22 laboratories
and since its inception at the end of February,
it's actually expanded now to over 41 groups at UCSF, encompassing essentially
hundreds of different scientists. And the group has gotten so large, we've actually had to now split
it into different subgroups. There's now 10 different
subgroups associated with QCRG focused on different technologies or approaches as well as
different biological areas. And you're gonna hear talks
from four different subgroups. The first hear from Davide Ruggero, it's focused on translation. And then Brian Schoichet
who along with Kevan Schokat runs the drug discovery subgroup. And then Kliment Verba
is gonna give an update on the structural biology work. He runs this subgroup with Oren Rosenberg. And then Shaeri Mukherjee
at the end will talk about the efforts with respect
to approaching trafficking. And if anyone's interested in joining any of these subgroups, please reach out to
these different leaders. And if you'd like to
form your own subgroups, please reach out to us. There's actually a couple of new subgroups that are gonna be forming
in the near future. And at QBI we're really
about collaboration over the last three, four years. And in this example, it's no different. The work you're gonna hear
about today was done jointly at QBI UCSF with Mount Sinai and the Institut Pasteur in
Paris that it involves a number of other groups really around the world. And for me it has been a
great honor and pleasure to be involved in this
really collaborative effort that's going on over
the last three months. And I'm looking forward
for more collaborations ultimately in the future. And I think as Dave alluded
to this is one of the projects that came out of the QCRG. It was published a few days ago, and this is what I'm gonna
be briefly talking about. It's the A SARS CoV-2 to
protein interaction map that we generated and how
we used it to identify drugs and compounds that we're
trying to repurpose to see if they're useful in terms
of fighting off COVID-19. There's over 120 authors on
this paper and over 35 groups I think represented from around the world. And I know a lot of people
are focusing their attention on trying to get drugs
or compounds to target the viral proteins themselves,
which is a great strategy. In this paper we took a
little different approach, and ultimately we're
trying to target the host, target the human proteins
that the virus needs in order to infect ourselves. And there's advantages to that. You don't have to worry
so much about resistance 'cause we don't mutate as
fast as the different viruses. And ultimately as we and others have shown is that it's similar
human genes and proteins that are being hijacked
by different viruses. Not even in the same
family as these viruses. So, ultimately the vision would
be if we've got a strategy, a whole structured strategy for COVID-19, it would work for COVID-22, COVID-24, and even other viruses. There's obviously a disadvantage here. You have to worry about toxicity, But we initially focused our
attention on FDA approved drugs and compounds that are in clinical trials that are past the toxicity stage, so that the logic would be
that we wouldn't have to worry so much about toxicity. So, there's a close to 30 genes associated with the SARS CoV-2 virus compared to over 20,000 in our cells. And so the virus itself obviously can't live without our cells. It needs our cells, our genes,
our proteins in order to live and replicate and infect our our bodies. And the vision here is, well,
let's find all the human proteins that the virus
needs in order to infect us. So, we carried on a
project where we identified over 300 proteins, which we
think are enriched four proteins that the virus does need. And then we use this set to identify 69 different drugs and compounds. And just a little bit more
detail on the experiment itself. We used mass spectrometry after
affinity take purification aspect to generate this map, which you gonna hear a
little bit about today. And this map is now fueling
more hypothesis driven research in the world that biochemistry,
structural biology, chemical biology and bioinformatics. And one of our goals
is to try to integrate all this information together
to find the key nodes or pathways or proteins in
our cells that the virus needs so that we can pharmacologically
or genetically inhibit them and then carry out infection experiments. And then this data in a reader
of weight would then help re-inform this experimental
and computational pipeline. So, here's a list of
the genes that we think are associated with the virus. There's some debate about
some of these genes. We tried to be all in a
comprehensive, at least initially. So there's 16 different
nonstructural proteins, four structural proteins and then a number of very
interesting accessory proteins. And what we did, and this is
what we've done in the past with many other viruses,
put affinity tags on them, express them at least initially
here in HEK293T cells, purify these proteins, analyze the material by mass spectrometry, and then use algorithms that
we've developed to come up with a high confidence SARS-CoV-2 human protein protein interaction map. And I think the QCRG was
the first group in the world that actually had cloned
out each one of these genes. And when we initially
released our paper in bioRxiv, we tweeted out to the world and we said, ""All right, whoever wants these plasmids, ""we'll send them to you for free. ""No MTAs, please feel free to distribute."" And Dave Gordon and his crew with few CRG sent out to 318 different
labs in 38 countries, this set of a plasmid. I think that the plasmid
went around the world a lot faster than the virus did. So, we're really excited that
we're able to help expedite SARS-2 research around the
world in this particular way. So, here's the map that was generated and published a few days ago. So it's 332 SARS-CoV-2 human
protein protein interactions, including 69 different
druggable host factors. The diamonds here are the SARS-2 proteins. The circles here are the human proteins. If it's an orange, we
think it's a drug target. And I'd like to say we
collaborated with the ZOIC Labs who generated a very interactive
way to peruse this data. So, I think it's really
cool how you can look at this information in a
number of different ways. So, I'd encourage you
to look at this website that's affiliated with the
paper if you're interested in looking deeper at
some of this information. So, then this map was looked
at by some really great chemical biologists at UCSF Kevan Shokat and Brian Schoichet and and others. And they identified 69
different drugs and compounds. And ultimately with collaborators, we tested about two thirds of
these in virological assays in a couple of different
places in the world. At the time unfortunately, we didn't have the virus
propagating in UCSF. There's been some great work being done by a number of people now including Melanie Ott Gladstone lab who
now has the virus propagating, and we're starting to work with her. But there's been two
collaborators that we've been working with over the last
few months to test these drugs and compounds including the
Institute pasture in Paris in particular, Marco Vignuzzi. He was born in Italy,
but raised in Canada. Therefore he's a really
great collaborator. And then also Olivia Schwartz
and Christophe D'Enfert. This has been a relationship
that QBI had started with the Pasteur Institut
several years ago, and it really bore fruit here
in this particular pandemic. And then we're also
collaborating very closely with a good friend of mine
and Adolfo Garcia-Sastre really one of the best
colleges in the world at the Department of Microbiology
at Mount Sinai in New York. And we've actually got a
lot of support to carry out this research from a number
of different entities. We've actually been working
with the French consulate here in San Francisco. QBI is having a couple events with them. And in order to make sure
that these drugs and compounds got to the Pasteur Institut in Paris, the French embassy actually got involved to make sure that FedEx was sending these compounds to Paris. And then we have Todd here. This guy's one of the heroes
of the story from FedEx. He was coming in and shipping
out these drugs and compounds to New York and Paris and
shipping out all these plasmids. Actually we have his name
in the acknowledgements of the paper, that's well deserved. And then we were able to send
these drugs and compounds to Pasteur and they
were able to test them. And just very briefly, just
to go through the assays, you're gonna hear about
some of the results from Brian and Davide. So, we're using Vero6 cells. These are African green monkey cells. There's now some better
human cells that can be used, but initially at the time
they weren't available. So we initially used vero6 cells, and we're growing up the cells, were adding drugs two
hours before we infect. There's two different MOIs. One, the York MOIs is a little bit lower than what we see in Paris. The experiments it goes on
now for a couple of days. We kill everything with formaldehyde. And then in New York, what
they're doing is using an antibody against NP is the
readout in a microscopy set up, And then looking at viral
titers with the TCID 50 assay. In Paris, they're not
looking at the protein, they're looking at the RNA and they have an RT-PCR experiment. And they're combining that
also with a plaque assay. So, it's similar assays, but different. And it was very reassuring
that we were seeing the same results in two different labs ultimately in two different continents. And in total, this is what
they initially screened for, is about 40 each and the total. If you look at collectively
47 of the drugs and compounds were tested in total. And the first vignette
you're gonna hear about is from David Ruggero, the
connection to translation. And just to show you here on this map, we found a number of connections
with some very interesting factors linked to mRNA
translation regulation. and Davide is gonna to take it over now and talk about some of that work. - Okay, great. Thank you, Nevan. So, I wanna start
actually with this slide. As many of you know, many
virus, including the CoV-2 virus when entering the cells
seek massive production of viral proteins. Actually they just form
the cells in a factory for viral production. This is achieved through
hijacking a specific component of the translation of
machinery in order to translate their own vital and mRNA at the expense of the actually host and mRNA. And I actually didn't make these slides, and I put the stock, but
often the use of this slide even if I'm not a biologist. More to illustrate
actually a similar paradigm that occurred in cancer. Whether we realize that
a key Oncogenic liaisons, also in cancer cell hijacked
like a specific component of the translational machinery
to change the translation or efficiency of the specific
mRNAs that very important for tumor progression
or tumor translation. And actually we call now this Onco-mRNAs. And I'm gonna talk to the, It's actually the two words met one day, but actually as you can
see this selection now, there's an important lesson
to learn because what we are actually acceptably learning
in the cancer context this can be applicable for, of course, for the pandemic that to
be out of facing right now. And indeed the based on
the beautiful and the virus Exosome interacting
characterized in the Kroghan lab, you can see that the key
vital proteins, in red, again interacted with
many factor that belonged to the transmission machinery, including the factoring
part of ribosome biogenesis or the factor that are important to initiate the translation. These are known as the
translation incision factor. And I wanna highlight that
the never know the dimension of specifically this factor
that's called the elF4H. That is a factor that
stimulate like the activity of an (mumbles) helicase important for capita dependent translation. So, perhaps the reason why
indeed like the CoV-2 virus hijack mainly translation
factor because again, as I said that like lie
when entering the cells, this is an a plus friend of the virus, the first thing has to do is massively translate their own mRNA. And all the mRNA of the virus are capped. So they have like, this
is like the cap of mRNA, and the translation of this (mumbles) mRNA according to the capping
in the translation. But what's intriguing is
actually the structure of the (mumbles) that
is here of this virus. As you can see, this is the... sorry, this is like a is
a structure that has been basically characterized in
the dust lab of Stanford. As you can see that it's
like a lot of RPN loops, and usually this RPN loops
act as a translational barrier because the ribosome cannot
scan before to reach the AUG. So, the virus must rely on
not in the (mumbles) helicase to unwind this 5UTR. But the structure for UTR
don't therefore derive sone efficiency to initiate a translation of the vitamin in mRNA. So, I already mentioned
elF4H that the protein that actually interacted with
the specific viral protein. But what I wanna highlight
here is that the fact that elF4H is part of this
complex known also for elF4F and this is a key. But I think complex that include the elF4A that is the RNA helicase. elF4E that is the major
cap-binding protein as well as to this protein. and this complex is really
important to basically recruit the ribosome on
the 5UTR of the same RNA. And then with the help of,
again, the helicase activity elF4E, so this 5UTR is melting down, and now the ribosome reach of
the UTR Scaffold translation. So, of course the idea
here is that perhaps elF4A can be a point of vulnerability
for this CoV-2 virus, and indeed that for other
corona virus there's been some person in the literature
where the inhibitory for elF4A not necessarily very
strong has a good activity, I guess, like this
coronavirus so like tighter as well as also other compounds
that targets this elF4F complex also they have
an antiviral effect. But this is our two compounds. This is our two clinical compounds. So, based on this data,
based on our own data, so, we of course societal
rational to collaborate with the effect of therapeutics. That is the first biotech
dedicated to develop for the first clinical compounds to target translation control in cancer. And I want to highlight
like cannot specifically these compounds known as zotafitin, this is the best in class,
the first clinical compounds that target like this elF4A RNA Helicase. And this is zotatifin is
already in phase one and two for solid cancer for the patients, exactly for cancer patients. So, as my colleague already mentioned, we send it to Mount Sinai or Paris, we send Zotatifin as well
as the other compound drug that target compensation of
translation such like this two. As well as we also basically Jack Taunton, also send this great compounds. This is is a new compound,
very interest compounds that's been generated in the
Jack Taunton Lab, in UCSF, is not necessarily Ternatin4. This compound that doesn't
target initiation target in other factor is called the eEF1A. That is an elongation
factor that is important for the elongation of the
like of course the translation as well as is important
perhaps for the frame shift that the virus undergo in
order to change the frame and produce some different vital proteins. And also important to
highlight that there is another compound that the structure is completely different from Ternatin. This is like it's a different compound, but targets also eEF1A,
in medicine is a compound that is in clinical trial for
multiple myeloma in Australia as well as for COVID-19 patients in Spain. And I also wanna highlight
another important aspect of this research, and
often like people ask the question, ""Oh, but
targeting translation, ""this can be detrimental
for host normal cells."" And actually what we learned
throughout the years, that two master genetics that
often this translation factors are not a skippy factor
that actually are in access in the cells because you
can reduce for example, elF4E or you can use elF4A. This mice are completely normal. You can go even below to 50% and this mice are still completely normal, but actually more protected
to actually develop for tumor. So, they're saying of course
this concept phase for us is to think about this
drug report personnel to target to COVID, of course, 2-viral. And this is perhaps the
most important slide where the (mumbles) like many compounds that Nevan have already mentioned. So, these are two compounds stood out so they're not in four, again, the target the elongation
start and that targeted the RNA elF4A helicase. And this is the two acid,
and Nevan already mentioned in New York and Paris. So check of course, acid
for viral production either for assessing their viral protein or for the virus RNA genome. As you can see from like them
red the curve in both cases, in two independent labs show
that the nanomolar digits these two compounds is
a very potent antiviral of course effect. For few compounds, this in
New York that has been also testing including Zotatifin,
so it's been also tested for reducing the virus
titer that it was produced by infected like cells, as you can see, that also in this case zotatifin has very potent antiviral effect. Like reducing like viral
titer almost like to zero. So, what I want to
actually a non molar digits that is even lower than this assay. And I wanna end off here,
but of course again, highlighted the fact that the zotatifin is already in a human, is already in clinical trial for cancer. So we are working harder
with the QBI also to bring it so that it can also be in the clinic for the COVID-19 patients. And I also end up to show exactly the QCGR translation subgroup encapsulated in the beautiful ribosome. They're great. This is a great group, but
the majority uses UCSF. A few of them and also
from the Burke Institute that actually we had a meeting
routinely to understand how CoV-2 translational
work and how we can target. And the thanks for your attention. - [Nevan] All right, thank
you Davide, fantastic. Next up is Brian Schoichet,
who is gonna be talking about a couple of receptors
QCRG have been working on. Very exciting receptors
'cause they're very druggable. So, Brian. - Okay. I hope you can see my screen. This is a figure you've seen
before, at least partly. So there's both the chemistry team here, the PIs and our collaborators
who are more on the biology, and our structural biology. And of course none of those
people do any of the work. The work is really done by the fabulous students and postdocs in the labs. And I wish I could go through
their names more carefully. So, I think you've seen a
version of this slide as well. This is a subset of the targets. The 332 targets that
the proteomics reveals. And it focuses on those of the
targets that can be drugged. And one of the startling
things for me from this project so far, well, one of them is
just how many human proteins are subverted by the virus. And then the other thing
is how big a subset it is of those human proteins that
either have drugs available for them or have really good
preclinical molecules for them. And sometimes mechanism of
action drugs, or drugs that hit those targets as their
primary mechanism of action. But sometimes there molecules
that hit the targets as a side effect or an
unintended consequence. So overall we looked at 1600 FDA drugs. A much larger... There's not that many FDA drugs. That's something that's sort
of surprising to people. There's only about 1800. We looked at about 20,000
investigational new drugs molecules that have been in people, but are not approved for use, and about 4,000 PROMOs,
so preclinical molecules. And ultimately 29 drugs, 12
molecules that are in the clinic and 28 preclinical molecules
were tested against 63 targets. Not all of them have been tested yet, but they're being tested. So, Davide mentioned the activity, the really fabulous activity
of the protein biogenesis inhibitors like zotatifin and
that it was a target class that had some precedents as he showed you. Last expected on on two counts
were molecules targeting the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. They were, I think unexpected to us for several reasons. One is sigma-1 and sigma-2 have not been widely implicated in antiviral biology. Once we knew about them
when we went to look through the literature,
there is actually precedent, especially for sigma-1 being involved in a viral lifestyle. And the other thing is
though, these are receptors, they're sort of dark
horses in pharmacology, and have been for 40 years. The functions of these receptors is still murky, especially the sigma-2. Sigma-1 is now widely
thought to be involved in cell stress response. But even there, the mechanisms
are still really being teased apart, and what it
might do as a drug target is still kind of murky. But the great thing
about both receptors is they find a lot of cationic
hydrophobic molecules. And cationic hydrophobic
molecule means a lot of drugs. And so we've been able to
find molecules that bind to those targets fairly
tightly, and sure enough, are antiviral in the assays
run in New York and Paris by Adolfo and Marco that
Nevan took you through. And so these are a few
of them that were found and published in the paper. The IC50s range from about 215
nanomolar to 20 micromolar. These are here on the right
are these viral titer assays that Davide also took you through. The top one is PB-28, which
is a preclinical molecule that's potent on actually
both sigma receptors. With it got an IC 50 of about... sorry, in IC 90 about a 280 nanomolar. And then the the bottom
one is hydroxy chloroquine, which sort of a notorious
molecule now for Coronavirus, and it's substantially
worse in the TCID assays. This is I think my last,
no, almost my last slide. So, it's interesting to
counterpoint these observations with the activity of
Remdesivir in the same assay. This is being published on bioRxiv, and then was redone actually. So the numbers agreed pretty well. It's definitely antiviral,
but it's not super strong, and you can compare it
to some of the other sigma active ligans, the
best of which are binding in the 250 nanomolar range. Sorry, now binding are
active against the targets in the 250 nanomolar range. And then finally there's dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is ubiquitous
in cough medications. It's an antitussive. You basically can't buy a cough
medication that doesn't have dextromethorphan in it in the U.S unless you're getting one with coding. And dextromethorphan is unlike
many of these other molecules is actually a sigma-1 agonist. It's lots to activate
the sigma-1 receptor, and sure enough it
shows pro viral effects, and that the red line
is the viral activity. So you can see us actually the
PF use, the log PF are going up without affecting the cell viability. So, that's actually a little bit alarming, but maybe consistent with the mechanism. And and then maybe the last
thing to say on this topic is that there's a really
broad range of molecules that we found in terms of
their primary mechanisms and targets that are
antiviral in these assays. And the thing that unifies
them is they all hit the sigma receptor. So, I think I'm out of time,
so I won't dwell on this. The other approach we're
taking in collaboration with a lot of people on this
call is looking for target, starting with the target and
looking for new novel ligand. So this is a docking approach. The downside of this is
that it takes a lot longer. The first campaign we
started was in early February for the major protease and collaboration with Charlie Craig's lab and that's take, we're just now getting the compounds in, so it takes about three
months from start to finish, but the advantage of this is can really get a novel chemical matter. So we're looking forward to
testing those things too. So, I'll stop here. - [Nevan] Okay, fantastic. Brian, thank you so much. So next up is Kliment Verba, QBI fellow. He, along with Oren
Rosenberg have been in charge of the structural biology QCRG subgroup, and he's gonna tell you about
some very exciting pipelines that they have been setting up, along with some very
exciting antibody studies as well that are being
done in his subgroup. So go ahead, Klim. I think Klim, you're on mute. - One second. Can everyone see my screen and hear me? - Yeah, go ahead. - Yeah. Right, so our group as part
of QCRG has been tasked really with bringing the molecular details to this picture. So, this is a part of the PMS dataset. And the idea is that if
you want to really design a small molecule inhibitors or biologics, we really want to understand, how do the active sites of
the viral proteins look like? How do the proteins come
together so that we can seize those interfaces and
potentially design therapeutics to break them apart. With experts from a structural biologist, scientists from around the
world, we now have structures for some of the viral proteins
feature indicated here. But the key point is
that most of them by far has not been visualized at all. And so we're really ends the ones, many of them are membrane proteins, which are involved with
three modelings and membranes in the host cells and human cells. And we really have no idea
how those proteins look like, how they work. And furthermore, even
sort of a darker space or darker space for us is
how do this protein complexes between virus protein and host proteins look like once they come together. And without, again,
seeing those interfaces, it's very hard to come up with ways of breaking those interactions apart. And so Nevan tasked Oren Rosenberg, a professor here at UCSF
and me was trying to have a cohesive structural biology efforts really bringing some
clarity to this picture. And early on during our discussions it became clear is that the canonical way of doing structural biology where each lab grab a one or two of his
targets and then go after them was not really going to cut it, if you really want to go
after this in a major way. And so we thought, why not
set this up as a consortium where we make a call to the
structural biology community at UCSF and say, ""Hey, if
you wanna be part of this, ""if you wanna contribute, please come join ""and then we'll work together on this. ""And we'll just prioritize target ""and we'll be one big effort
rather than splitting it apart ""between different many different labs."" And so the amazing thing
is when we made the calls, the community responded and it has been with amazing enthusiasm. And so within days we had
over 60 volunteers, which are, graduate students, postdocs
(mumbles) scientists from 18 labs at UCSF who came
forward and say, basically, ""Hey, I wanna be part of this. ""How can I help?"" And so, and I wanna know
that without the buy in, not just from the community,
but advisor faculty at UCSF, this would not have been possible. So, I think there's
something unique too here is that we can really
come together like this. And just put some
pictures, faces the names here is a screenshot of our
Friday meeting from last week. And this is just some
people in the consortium. So, we formed this QCRG
structural biology consortium. Once we had this many people,
the question was how do we organize really to
have an efficient way of going forward. And first thing we did was we formed sort of leadership
community, faculty at UCSF who are really experienced
and wise to really help us strategize the best way of doing this. And what came out of that
at the end of it is breaking the effort up into lab groups,
which are really broken up by functional groups, nodes to some extent. And this is very akin to what you would do in an industry setting. And so we have groups focused
on expressing proteins in the mammalian of bacterial systems. Then we pass those proteins
to purification group and then the other groups which
do crystallography (mumbles) and data processing. And the key point is all
this groups are interlocked. It's not that one lab does
one saying it was the other. It's really the knowledge
just flows together and we figure out the best
way to do it as a community. And the way we set this up is each group has a faculty mentor. One to see faculty mentors for each group. And the next is actually
team leads who are either graduate students or postdocs
who sort of have more control of our everyday operations
of each of these groups. And the group size between 15 to 30 people depending on what they're doing. And so now that we have the
set up, what is it that we actually want to accomplish? What are our goals? And so we really have
a three prong approach. The first part, depicted
here is really going after the viral proteins to predominantly,
and really the focus is to enable a small molecule drug design. And so we already have
all the viral proteins for expression and Nikolai and we're going through
them are currently, and we already have a number of crystals for some of the viral proteins. And so the idea here
is that by using things like fragment based, drug
design, drugs screening, and then computational drug design and visualizing those compounds found we can help that effort. The second prong, the second
part of their approach is really following up
strongly on the APMS and also actually on the functional data which will be coming in here. And so we narrowed down
this host proteins, which virus hijacks. We narrowed them down from
over 300 stories to about 60, which we think is the most
promising one based on the biochemistry and the biological data. And we set up this sophisticated
system of approaching tags, expression purification,
who will be able to really very rapidly screen for one
to five protein complexes, scales them up and
either do a purification and go to prior electromicroscopy,
if it's amenable, go to crystallography or even
uses novel affinity grids from the argo group and skip
simplification altogether and just go straight into the prior, yeah. And then the last part of it
is really is working together with groups here at UCSF
for a focus of developing antibodies towards wild proteins, predominantly turns we
focused on spike protein with leveraging our consortium
strengths as expression. Purification and structural
biology to enable them to just design better antibodies. And so, broadly altogether,
just to recap again as a plans, the goal is a three prong approach. On the left side is the idea
is to enable this rapid cycle. The turnover between the
chemists, the bioinformaticians and the structural biologists where we get poor hits for the target, we get a structure was it, we
visualize and we see how we can improve it based on the structure. We synthesize a new
candidate, and we repeat. The second one is focused on
something Nevan talked about is in the middle is
host directed therapies. And those are really exciting
because we can uncover competing new modalities of
being able to target these ones and frankly, again, as Nevan pointed out, because a lot of these are conservative could be cross virus too. And last is the antibody effort we think that we can destruct. Biology can play a major role
in being able to design more rationally higher identity
specificity antibodies, which could actually end
up being in the clinic and not too far future. And so we started out
about three weeks ago, and due to the incredible
dedication and hard work of the consortium members, we already have crystals for
a number of viral proteins. We already have a highest
resolution structure for one of the viral proteins. And that's on the left
and the bottom left panel, and then on the right we have,
you can see this gray box, the top quadrant is a
cry young roll micrograph of a spike at the domain
with with antibodies found and is being processed as we speak. And then on the bottom
is actually something we just got today is the
first volume spike structure from the consortium at
betters in swing hamstrings. And again, these
structures have been solved by other people before,
but this is an incredibly important foundation
on which we can build. And we are already
building right as we speak, so there's lots more to come. And that's about it. - [Nevan] All right, fantastic, Klim. Thank you very much. Very good, great stuff. So, our last speaker of for
today is Shaeri Mukherjee. She's leading up to protein
trafficking subgroup. And obviously protein trafficking
is a process that's being hijacked and utilized by
the virus and other viruses. And she's been doing a fantastic
job extracting mechanistic insight from this biological process. So, go ahead Shaeri - Can you see my slides? - I can see you, but not your slides. - Oh. - I think you have to share your screen. Yeah, we can see your slides now. - Good. Thanks Nevan. So, our group is mostly
interested in protein trafficking, and I would like to
start off by my thanking the uprooting trafficking group. And here I've listed some
of the PIs who participated in our Zoom calls and also the
trainees who have exchanged ideas and thoughts
about how we can proceed with understanding how the coronavirus co-ops the protein trafficking pathways. So, here I'm showing you
an intracellular snapshot of the coronavirus life-cycle. And there are two nodes of intersection with the Coronavirus, with
the host trafficking pathways that we are mostly interested in. The first is when the spike
protein binds to the receptor of the host called ACE2, and this causes
internalization of the virus. And then the second is when
the virus has to assemble and egress out of the host cell. And more and more data is
starting to emerge that suggests that this assembly of the virus
takes place on the surface of a host cell organelles such
as the urgec and the golgi. Interestingly, when we looked
at the post translational modifications of several wild proteins, we notice that several of
them showed or linked or inlet glycosylation as well as liquidation, such as farmetilization. And this suggested to us
that the virus did enter the secretory organelles
because these enzymes are found in the lumen of the secretory organelles. And very excitingly, a recent
paper in science that came out just a few days ago
showed EM of SARS-CoV-2 replication in organoids. And I was really excited
about how the golgi looked in these images because you
could see the viral particles on the rim of the golgi, and the golgi appeared really swollen. And this suggested to me
that there might be an influx of protein and lipid
trafficking through the golgi. And it would be very interesting
to study how the virus co-ops this trafficking
pathways to maybe help it egress out of the host cell. Now, from the interactive
studies, when we analyze the hits, we found that roughly 40%
of protein interactors were localized or function
in the secretory pathway. And 20 out of the 26 viral
proteins interact with at least one secretory pathway protein. And this suggested to us that
the virus is really co-opting the whole secretory pathway. And to understand these
interactions might give us better understanding of the life
cycle of the coronavirus as well as figuring out how we can stop it from egressing out of the cell. Now how do we start from 132 proteins, and where do we even begin? So we thought instead of just
looking only for the host proteins and seeing if they
have interesting functions, we could also start by
looking at the viral proteins and seeing if they have
something interesting that would point to a function. And the protein that we got very excited about is Orf8 in SARS-CoV-2. And this is a genome-wide
comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 genome shown here in blue
versus several bad coronavirus genomes as well as the SARS-CoV
genome from 2003 epidemic. And you can see here that this
is where the off Orf8 lies. And these spikes show
a fast evolving region suggesting many changes
happening in this region. And this is the spike
region also showing changes. This is expected because
it's a surface protein, but this sounded really curious
what's happening to Orf8. And if we compare the
two with the SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-CoV from 2003,
it's only 30% conserved. And interestingly in the 2003 epidemic Orf8 originally encoded
a single polypeptide. But at the later stage of the epidemic, it underwent a 29 nucleotide deletion, which split Orf8 into
two Orfs of 8A and 8B. And later on it was shown
that just this step alone led to the attenuation of the
virus replication in cells. So what's happening to Orf8
in the current pandemic? So good news is that even
in this current pandemic, we have evidence that there is
a propensity of communicating this pot and a complete deletion of Orf8 was not noticed in a
genome sequences of eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. So what's known about Orf8
is that it seems to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum
and induce ER stress. This is something that we
normally study in the lab, so we could use our expertise
to understand Orf8 is doing because even now the function
of Orf8 still remains unknown. So digging deep into the literature and finding out what Orf8 could be doing. We found a very interesting
paper and this showed, this paper showed that Orf8 actually has an immunoglobulin domain,
which is shared in another protein called Orf7a, but this
is the immunoglobulin domain that is in Orf7 and
this is what is in Orf8. And you can notice here that
there is an extra bit of unique insert that is seen in Orf8
that is absent in Orf7. And this is modeled here, shown here in orange is the insert. And you'll see here there's
a Leu84 that seems to be the most variable position
across 54 closely related SARS-CoV genomes. And these are bad Corona viruses. The top one is the SARS-CoV-2 and the bottom is the SARS-CoV from 2003. So, the other interesting
difference was that Orf7 had a transmembrane domain
attached to it after the immunoglobulin domain,
whereas the Orf8 does not. And interestingly, when the
Orf8 split into two proteins in the 2003 later part of the endemic, this two proteins were
still could be linked by a die cell fight bridge
suggesting that it would still be active, maybe not as active as Orf8. So, what is known about
Orf7 is that it binds to the cell restriction factor BST-2 and inhibits its glycosylation. And this impaired BST-2 with
tethering the plasma membrane impaired antiviral response. So we are interested in
understanding how Orf8 differs from Orf7 in the
sense that because it doesn't have a transmembrane
domain can it be secreted out of the cell and
does that modify the way the immune response happens? We are also interested in studying the ER because from the interim
studies you can see several endoplasmic reticulum proteins
including stress response protein and ER degradation
pathway are hit. And interestingly, we also found hit from the ER membrane complex subunit EMC-1 which has been known to
play a role in the spread of flaming viruses such
as Zika and West Nile. So if this interaction is real,
it would be very interesting to understand the
function of Orf in the ER, of Orf8 in the ER. And finally, I would like to
also highlight another protein in the virus NSP13. Why we are excited about NSP13
is because not only did it bind to the golgi
proteins and coiled-coiled structural tethering proteins, including proteins that
have gripped domains, it also bound to the protein
Kinase A, signaling complex. And by complex I mean that it bound to not only the catalytic and
regulatory subunit of PKA, but also the scaffolding protein AKAP9 as well as the protein that turns it off, which is the phosphodiesterase or PDE. So, we think that this
protein might be co-opting PKA signaling at the golgi to
promote virus parting and spread. And this could change the way
the microtubule is nucleated. The other interesting aspect of NSB13 is that it was found to bind to GCC185. This particular golgi binds
to 16 different Rab proteins. And Rab GTPases are known to play a role in membrane trafficking. So this would be very exciting to study because the phenotype
of the golgi swelling and the fact that there could
be increased trafficking could be explained if this
protein was somehow activating also a Rab GPS function. So, Brunno Goud who is a Curie Institute an expert of Rab reached out to us, and we are currently collaborating
to find that function. In addition, it's good
news that PKA and PDE are both druggable targets. In a recent study showed
that PDE is actually can inhibit Corona viruses in retro. So with that I'd like to thank Nevan and the rest of the crew at QCRG as well as my two brilliant
postdocs, Advait and Julia. Advait is working on NSP13
and Julia is working on Orf8 along with Albert in Melanie's lab and also our collaborators
in U.K and Curie. Thank you. - [Nevan] Thanks Shaeri. Awesome. Great stuff. I just have just a couple,
two wrap up slides here, just to make a point here that
QBI we've really been crying over last several years
to break down silos. And I know this has
been a terrible tragedy, this particular pandemic,
but a silver lining for me is to see scientists
really around the world coming together in an unprecedented way. These silos have really been broken down across laboratories, across
different institutions, between academia and
pharmaceutical companies, in a really unprecedented way. And my question is, why
can't we do this normally? Look how fast science can move. And to me, the problem with
science is it's too siloed. So the question is, can we
set up an infrastructure, really a new paradigm on how to do science so that we're better prepared
for COVID-24, COVID-26 what other other virus we want to work on or just working on any
disease for that matter. So, I would encourage the
community to really think along these lines going forward. so we talked to you about the discovery research, a component. We're really gonna be
pushing hard now to connect to other entities at UCSF,
including the immunological world and the clinical world. Hopefully the next QCRG town hall, we'll talk about some of our
connections to these worlds. We're really excited to push
or translate some of our findings into the clinical
world and we're having number of discussions with
different clinicians at UCSF. So stay tuned to that. And this is my last slide. We have a lot more
information on our website if you'd like to go and look
about the COVID-19 research. So, I'll stop there and then I'll let Kayvon and Dave moderate questions. - Okay. I'll take care of a couple of these, and Kayvon you're welcome to
join in when you feel like it. The first one was came from Dave Egad and it's directed mostly to
Davide who was talking about these various anti translational
compounds and David Egad is curious to know how
toxic those compounds are. 'Cause they looked a little
rough on the cell viability assays that you showed. So what do we know about their toxicity in those a cell-based assays? - Yes, thanks for the question. I didn't go through in
the detail at that time. It's not cytostatic, so
it doesn't kill the cells. There is a cytostatic effect on the cells and the reason it's because the
cells are immortalized cells and obviously they have non normal cells and actually the viral
cells they have a mutation in a negative regulator soul cycle. So, they are really addicted
to proliferate more. And both of the compounds
are actually a target. Also the transmission of a key
mRNA porter for cell cycle. In the primary cells actually the cell specific to these compounds
they're not toxic. Ternatin as well as
zotatifin has been also used already then in mouse models. Zotatifin is already in the human. So, I think it's the one already answered the question of toxicity. And also ternatin reject totally. We actually recently added
like very interesting data in the mouse model that the block tumor in a specific dose there
is no so much toxicity. - [David] Okay. Thank you very much, sir. Next, there's a couple of
questions here that are both probably for Brian Schoichet. And they're all about the
sigma R-1 and R-2 receptors. Anita Seal is curious
to know which cell types express these particular receptors, which obviously has an implication
for various other issues. And Sarah Kang is asking
a related question, which is what is the role
of the sigma-1 receptor and has it been implicated
in the infection by any other viruses? - Okay, great question. So, that the sigma receptors
are most well known best characterized
neuronly, neuronal cells. That's where most of the
work has been done on them, but they're expressed, I
mean, tissue wise for sure, they're expressed pretty ubiquitously, certainly in the lungs, for instance. As to the role of the sigma-1 receptor and whether it's implicated
in other virus infections. It has a role in still
cell stress response. It's thought to be active on activation. It forms a tremor in the inactive state. I only have two hands. This is a new discovery. It forms a tremor in the inactive state, and then it's thought to monitorize. There's good evidence for that. And when it gets activated and
then it acts as a chaperone when the cells are under stress. There's actually good human
genetics that it's important for neuron development. And then as to whether
it's being implicated in other viral infections? Yes, it has. Is not a large literature on
it, but both knock-down studies have shown that it is involved,
you knock down the sigma-1 receptor and viral infectivity will drop. Not, it's not being done for SARS-2, but I think for HCV and one
other virus that I'm forgetting, but these are results
over the last decade. So there is some actually mechanistic and very logical reason
to believe that of courses is pharmacology can be involved in... can be subverted by viruses generally. - Okay. I have another
question on the topic of drugs. Maybe Brian can do this or
maybe Nevan could do this. And that's from David Earl
curious to know if you've begun to look for synergy between drugs. We've seen a lot of single
drugs in actions so are you starting to combine them to see
what effect that might have? - I think everybody saw me texting out that I was gonna answer David's question, so maybe I can take a shot at it. So, I mean, it's a great question. There's actually ongoing tests
both in Paris and New York adding one of the sigma-1 or
2 are the most promising one, the modulator with some of
these translational inhibitors, putting them together and
seeing what effects they have. Obviously, you got to
worry about toxicity, but then also remdesivir
combined with these. So just like with HIV, the cocktail was the big breakthrough. And I personally think
a common trial strategy holds a lot of promise. Maybe combining this remdesivir
with one of our drugs or another drug that hits a host factor that somebody else discovers. But then the big question is the results that we see in the laboratory, do they translate into humans? I don't know, going forward. I just wanted to answer, add something to Brian's last comment. It was influenza, actually
Brian that was connected to sigma-1. There was a genome wide RNE ice screen that connected Sigma-1 to influenza. So there's a connection there as well. So, that's my response to David. I don't know, Brian, if you
have anything to add to that. - No, I think that's a... Yeah, so it's influence and HCV, right? HCVL is also? - Yeah, Kayvon found that connection. - Nevan also Mary Selleck is
asking when we do the combos, do we think that orthogonal
targets will be better or sort of in pathway might be better? That idea of where synergy
might pick us found? - Yeah, that's a good question. I guess it's related to
genetic interactions, right? I mean, it depends on
how much of one pathway is ultimately perturbed. My thinking would be if you
had two different pathways, that would be a better approach. But you may have to worry
about toxicity there. So, it's a great question, and more data needs to be collected. - I'll try and take this next one. There's a fairly complex
question here from Cynthia Chu. So, are there microscopy
data for cells treated with the Sigma ligand hits? From Nevan's HPMS data set,
the Sigma receptor interacts with NSP-6 which is part
of a complex that forms a double membrane vesicles
seen in infected cells. So the question is whether
any of those compounds that affect the Sigma
receptor might actually affect the membrane structures
of the secretory pathway. I don't imagine that
you've gotten that far yet, but is there, is there a plan to do so? - Yeah, definitely. Actually, this morning we
just got some microscopy data from a collaborator in Germany
looking at certain kinases that are being mis-localized
in the context of infection. So I mean, yeah, that's
a fantastic question is, especially in the context
of some of these drugs seen where some of these
viral proteins are going or just see what's happening
with the biology of the cell. There's a lot of work to do going forward. - One last question about drugs again, they're always about drugs
that from an anonymous attendee who is curious to know, I suspect
I know the answer to this, but the question is whether
you can actually use plasma from a drug treated
human to test the effect of that on another patient. This sounds like a unusual idea. Is there any thoughts along those lines? Maybe Nevan, you should try that one. - I think... [Nevan] Oh, Davide, go ahead. - No, I think this already... So, the question, if a
plasma from already infected patients, if they can be used. So these are the question
or in combination with the drugs? 'cause this has been-- - I think with the combination with drugs. Yeah, so it looks like
the idea of being... yeah, if that anonymous
attendee wants to clarify the question, go ahead
and put it in the Q&A. but it looks like they're referring to plasma from drug treated people. - Right, because that one
has been already started to be used in the UK, in Italy. So, using the plasma from
infected people actually of course as enriched
in principle of course of an antibiotic against the virus. But of course it can
be an interesting idea to also combine also with
some of the compounds that we described today. So, it can be interesting to think about. - Okay. We've got one more question
that just popped in from Lisa for Klim. If they have plans to
look at the mutation, the recently discovered
mutation in spike protein, the D-614 gene mutation that
I guess was just associated with increased violence. We were actually talking about
this before this webinar. Is there any local lead, that structure worth looking at? - Yeah absolutely, actually. I was just looking at it
right before this meeting and it seems like it might
be at the interface between the spike as a tremor, so you might be at the
interface between the monomers, but parts of the structure
I was looking at, there was a piece of it
which was disordered. So we don't really see that
as part of acid packing or forming like a soul
bridge or something. But absolutely we should really look at it and see maybe, especially
with the antibody efforts, maybe the difference is there. It's in the plan, it's in the pipeline. - Okay. Oh no, a provocative
question has just shown up. It might be related to something
Nevan said in the newspaper actually (laughs) which
is can Brian Schoichet comment on the dextromethorphan issue in common flu and cold medication? Should you be taking that
medication at this point? - Yep Brian, go ahead. - (laughs) I was gonna
defer to Nevan on this. - The only thing you could be sued for. - Yeah, Well I'm sure the
institution will protect me, Dave. (laughs) So it's a little bit worrying, right? Dextromethorphan looks pro
viral, reliably pro viral. That experiment was done more than once. What it means in terms of human health, I'd be very cautious to say,
but I think it does merit a careful controlled trial. Whether that's ethical
or not, I'm not sure. But I think the signal is... So, there's a mechanistic reason, and there's empirical evidence. And you put those two together and it's enough to pay attention to. Yeah, that's my answer. - Perfect, thank you. I think we've reached
the end of the questions, and we've reached 4:03. So, perhaps we could wrap this up. Obviously everyone out there
in the audience is welcome to email all these folks
anytime with further questions and I'm sure they'd love to answer them. So, please do that. And thanks again for all
the wonderful presentations. Nevan, did you want to say one last word or are you good to go? - Yup, sure. No, that's fantastic. And we look forward to
ongoing QCRG town halls and with other entities at UCSF, including the clinical worlds
and the immunological worlds. We're very excited about that. - Great. Okay, thanks everyone for attending, we'll see you next time. And as Lindsey mentioned,
there is another town hall tomorrow as well on operational issues about how research is going at UCSF. So, we'll see you there. Take care of everyone. ",True,False,False,False
171,HirsHt-PLCA,CNA Insider,COVID-19 Crisis In Indonesia: How Will The Poor Recover? | Insight | Poverty In Asia,2020-09-23T12:00:05Z,"It's been described as the worst economic downturn in Indonesia since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. COVID-19 has brought the Indonesian economy to its knees. It has also reversed decades of progress in poverty alleviation in Southeast Asia's largest economy. More than 6 million jobs have been lost and 5 million more Indonesians have now fallen into poverty as a result of the pandemic. Will COVID-19 outbreak trigger another major economic crisis in Indonesia and push millions of Indonesians into extreme poverty? Will Indonesia see the repeat of the 1998 financial crisis as well as the political turmoil that gripped the nation soon after? Can Indonesia survive the challenge and recover from the devastating impact of the pandemic?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",it's been described as the worst economic downturn since the 1998 asian financial crisis covert 19 has brought the indonesian economy to its knees it has also reversed decades of progress in southeast asia's largest economy more than 6 million jobs have been lost and 5 million more indonesians have fallen into poverty we're talking about the poor that they will take the heaviest burden from the crisis will cover 19 outbreak trigger another asian financial crisis and push millions of indonesians into extreme poverty can indonesia survive the challenge and recover from the devastating impact of the pandemic it's 10 a.m in jakarta indonesia's bustling capital of more than 10 million people 30 year old food seller hissam masruri is busy cleaning raw chickens in this crowded neighborhood in the western part of the city helping his wife titin has become part of his daily routine now especially since the pandemic began five months ago it's one way of earning an extra income for the family the couple is selling ayam geprek it's a popular grilled chicken dish eaten with rice and spicy condiments made of red chilies despite working for 18 hours a day hissam barely makes enough money to support his small family especially during the pandemic can't afford to give up his old job as an app-based motorcycle taxi driver popularly known as ojek in indonesia that's because the family cannot live off on just one source of income since covert 19 wreaked havoc on the economy he doesn't get enough passengers to ferry them around the city center the bulk of his regular customers have either been laid off or told to work from home foreign hissam lives with his wife and their six-year-old boy in a rented room measuring 2.5 by 3 meters his parents occupy a room next door debt collectors often come knocking at his door demanding money that he still owes a bank after his garment business collapsed two years ago he was recently forced to sell his television set to help repay the debt on top of his monthly expenses running his grilled chicken business he still has to pay his rent electricity bills as well as his son's education he now has run out of things to sell to help cover his debts hello foreign according to the indonesian government the national poverty line is set around 31 us dollars per capita per month or about a dollar a day the restrictions on movements and other social distancing measures have killed businesses indonesia's gdp plunged 5.32 in the second quarter its first contraction in more than 20 years the figure is worse than the government's initial estimate of 4.3 percent and despite the allocation of about 700 trillion rupiah or 48 billion u.s dollars worth of stimulus measures they're barely enough to cover the needs of the people at least 5 million more people have now fallen below the poverty line as a result of the pandemic the poverty incidence may increase from currently 9.34 to 11.3 to 12.8 depending on the covet scenario so that would that would mean at least an additional five million uh people may go below the poverty line and another concern is the large number of informal workers in indonesia that a lot of people may be pushed from formal employment into informal employment and and again that will make them increasingly vulnerable only two years ago indonesia made history when it successfully reduced poverty rate to a single digit for the first time since independence in 1945 it cut the poverty rate by half since 1999 to 9.4 percent in 2019 but now the indonesian economy is creaking again under the weight of covet 19. the country's impressive poverty eradication effort has been pushed back by at least a decade the government has forecast full year growth of 1 at best this year or a full year contraction of 0.4 percent at worse this compares with 5.02 growth last year less people are working and for quite some times all of the object driver motorcycle taxi drivers disappearing from jakarta but now they are coming back especially after ideal victory there's a lot of people right now just hanging out on the street side uh have no job i think that in the last 20 years the growing number of middle class and especially the people who are living the poverty and then go into the lower middle class status which is around 55 million uh people but these are the segments of society the most vulnerable i think the risk for them to just go back to poverty is very high the world bank has warned that cobit 19 could push up to a 100 million people around the world into extreme poverty in indonesia if the poverty rate rises to as high as 13 as forecast an additional 5 million people will fall into poverty there's a lot of uncertainty there's a lot of uncertainty about how long this pandemic is going to last there's a lot of uncertainty about the impact on on the economy to what extent there will be new social distancing measures imposed to what extent there will be an impact on tourism revenues on you know commodity prices so yeah there is a lot of uncertainty and there are risks on lombarda a dry island around 2600 kilometers east of jakarta there are some 14 000 people who eke out a living as farmers and fishermen but life has become much harder for them since the outbreak began five months ago the covert 19 pandemic has restricted movements of people from nearby islands making it difficult for them to sell fresh fish meat produce and other perishable goods to their customers 48 year old fajaria jari is able to sell around one us dollar worth of fish on a good day but that's no longer the case today since the pandemic scares away many people from her store with the closure restaurants and shopping malls as a result of the social distancing measures the demand for fish has also plunged drastically and that has caused concerns among fishermen due to the southern dip in their incomes so to supplement her meager income she and dozens of other women on the island continue the tradition of weaving lambata's famous e-card textiles the women also grow cotton a raw material for weaving for future investment but selling the textiles to collectors outside the remote island is challenging because of the high transport costs back in jakarta hisam and his wife are getting ready to sell their grilled chicken hoping that today will be a lot better than the day before with so many indonesians struggling to overcome the crisis at the moment what will their future look like will the situation become a lot worse before it gets better and is the country that survived the asian financial crisis in 1998 better prepared to tackle the challenge this time round may 1998 it's regarded as one of the worst time periods in indonesian history indonesia was then caught up in a male strum of the asian financial crisis its currency the rupiah lost 80 percent of its value growth contracted by 14 inflation soared to over 65 percent public anger soon boiled over and jakarta descended into chaos and turmoil as indonesians vented their rage over soaring prices of basic essentials and rampant corruption more than 1 000 people were killed in the unrest it also forced the resignation of president suharto after more than three decades in power 20 years on indonesians still remember how the crisis plunged the nation into one of its darkest days in history turrican was a bajaj driver during indonesia's dark days in 1998. at 56 he still drives a three-wheel taxi to earn a living ironically in spite of the violence and turmoil in the days leading to the fall of president suharto he still feels that the current crisis is far worse than what he had experienced back in 1998. knows the streets of jakarta like the back of his hand he's been driving bajaj since 1994 taking passengers through the back streets to avoid the city's notorious traffic jams to support his wife son and grandson torikim has no choice but to continue transporting commuters in his old motorized rickshaw even though he's constantly in pain his right index finger was punctured by a wood splinter while he was making a small wooden table at his house the infected area has now become sore and stolen but to him the physical pain is nothing compared to what he's mentally going through now thorikim considers himself lucky if he can get 350 000 rupiah or around 24 u.s dollars a week it's nowhere near his weekly income of up to 1.8 million rupiah which he used to get before the pandemic foreign the social and economic upheaval in 1998 is a painful chapter in indonesia's history the crisis plunged more than 15 million people into poverty indonesia once the darling of investors went bankrupt large-scale riots also broke out in other cities such as medan and solo but today the current government is determined to ensure that history will not repeat itself ever again the country's also financially more stable compared to 20 years ago the economy is not collapsing right now while in 1998 it was the asian financial crisis was much more severe um especially due to the collapse of the rupiah exchange rate which yeah which caused a lot of trouble back in 1998 and a major difference between now and then is the way indonesia went into the crisis so the buffers currently are stronger economic policies are more focused on macro stability and on financial stability the exchange rate is more flexible and there's more transparency so the authorities have come quite a long way over the past decades in making the economy more resilient learning from the asian financial crisis president jocobi dodo has expanded social safety nets to protect indonesians from the economic shocks it includes cash transfers to the poor under the family hope program and health insurance system the beneficiaries of the staple food program has also been expanded to cover 20 million poor indonesians during the pandemic social protection financial support as well as credit assistance have also been extended to state-owned firms and small private enterprises but are the measures sufficient to deal with the impact of the major public health catastrophe indonesia's finance minister sri muliani indrawati says that the government has been doing what it can to alleviate the sufferings of ordinary indonesians first this year because of this pocket situation which is affecting both the revenue as well as the spending we are widening our deficit which is traditionally or legally we are only allowed to have a maximum 30 percent of gdp with the special law which is passed as lead by the parliament we are allowed to have more than three percent of gpp and this year we are expecting to have 6.3 deficit and that is to cover almost 700 trillion additional spending for the coffee related including for the economic recovery as i explained earlier now for this because of the very steep increase on the deficit we have to discuss on how we are going to finance so the government responded swiftly with a number of measures with their relief measures which includes direct cash transfers food supplies guarantees tax incentives and the total amount of all this is 4.4 of gdp which is quite a lot that will help mitigate the impact of the shock but it won't offset fully uh the impact of of this shock so but i don't think that's possible in in any country in the world nor here the government's response for the recovery has been quite strong the design of the recovery program we have looked at it very carefully is is really in line with international good practice what the trick will be however is to implement these measures uh in a speedy manner the pass for the poor direct cassidy poor which is uh around 600 thousand thousands a month it's equal to 60 singaporean dollars a month for the people who live below the property line i mean who earn less than two dollars a day and by doing this government hope that it will inject the cash into the economy so far many indonesians have displayed enough resilience to weather the economic impact in surabaya indonesia's second largest city a traditional mass dance troupe called ryok has stopped performing for months due to the pandemic they are now running out of money social distancing measures coupled with public fear of coronavirus infection have led to the cancellation of many events monitoring foreign a riot troupe usually performs in public cultural and private events they rely solely on the money from the organizers in normal times they can receive up to 1 350 us dollars a month before the pandemic the money will then be divided among members of the troop sujiyanto has been with the same troop since he was six he's now 57 unlike before he's now really struggling to make ends meet in order to survive and support his family sergianto has had to sell his tv set and pawn the family's jewelry to help cover his daily expenses his savings have dwindled to almost nothing nowadays you know there's always been this debate on you know how much longer should we lock down you know you're also killing people by killing the economy and so on um my take on it is actually first first and foremost uh the economy itself is actually supposed to be for the people right economy in itself is kind of a process so that a society can function if there seems to be a contradiction between curing the economy and curing the people then this contradiction actually indicates a problem in the ways in which the economy is designed in the first place the government says it is trying its best to ensure the country survives the pandemic but has it done enough to help the poor from falling deeper into the abyss surabaya the provincial capital of east java is also one of the nation's major cities hardest hit by the pandemic is java now has the second highest number of infections after jakarta with more than 37 000 cases and over 2 700 deaths the grim scenario has forced the government to implement a large-scale social restriction policy to help stem the spread of their disease it was only a couple of months ago that 39 year old beautician lilik ismawati lost her job as a cosmetic sales assistant in one of surabaya's glitzy shopping malls without customers regularly patronizing the shop it's simply impossible for employer to sustain the business in the end he was forced to reduce the number of staff to the barest minimum in order to contain costs lilik who lives in surabaya with her husband and their two young sons were among those who had to go despite the loss of her income of around 230 us dollars a month lilik has not lost hope has learned how to make it chirang from her sister the snack is very popular among indonesians it's made of a mixture of tapioca flour garlic chopped spring onions and a pinch of pepper her husband mohammed muniev helps her promote the snack online and deliver them directly to their customers munit himself has had to take a massive pay cut from his regular job as an employee of a private company he's now required to come to the office only once a week on a busy day the couple can earn up to 14 us dollars it's a tough business to begin with but they're grateful for it as it helps to put food on the table but the reality is the government has set aside trillions of rupiah to help the poor during the pandemic less than half of the money has been used so far analysts have put the blame on bureaucratic red tape inadequate data of applicants and the country's sheer size for the slow distribution of aid the the government rightly is and must be very worried as we all are in fact all governments around the world are very much worried right now and are struggling to to come up with responses the indonesian government has very rapidly responded as you know they uh the government has set up a response and economic mitigation and recovery uh package which focuses on health uh focuses on people and it focuses on businesses so um this was a came very quickly it was um well done it's difficult for us to track how much expect exactly has been spent so far but we do expect deficits fiscal deficit of close to six percent of gdp um but we we see the challenges of the government to yeah to reach all the people who need relief and to spend all the money that has been allocated so far indonesia has allocated around 200 trillion rupiah or around 14 billion us dollars similar package for social assistance it is part of nearly 700 trillion rupiah or 48 billion us dollars which have been set aside to safeguard the economy during the pandemic the social assistant package includes direct cash transfers of around 40 us dollars a month as well as direct handouts in the form of basic food items to the poor the government has begun paying 13-month salaries amounting to nearly 2 billion us dollars to civil servants and state pensioners the main objective is to revive consumer spending boost sluggish demand and prevent the country from sliding into recession emil dadak is the vice governor of east java he said the government is pulling out all the stops to make sure the assistance reached the poor of course the fact is we need to quickly ensure that they they have enough uh you know means to sustain their life and by that i'm saying as simple as ensuring that we support them with cash support or even food support for those that are most affected and most vulnerable those 40 of the population in indonesia are then included in this dataset we are really maximizing all the resources coming from within that is government-owned resources for example our sovereign wealth fund for education or any other fund which is managed by the government they have become one of the source uh which is uh provided for this deficit financing in addition to that we also use our bilateral and multilateral support which is also they are providing more room for us to borrow for example world bank adb aig and also from some bilateral government and we issue bonds both globally and domestically while east java is predominantly urban with the manufacturing sector contributing to around 30 percent of the local economy has proven to be resilient during the crisis it's growing at around two percent in the second quarter while other sectors suffered steep declines in the remote toraja highlands on the island of sulawesi the death of the tourism industry has encouraged some locals to return to agriculture and rebuild their lives all over again yourself pali limbaugh is one of them before the pandemic the 57 year old ran a guest house and managed local tours in the city center but he decided to return to his hometown and tend to the family's rice fields soon after he lost his job he wants to make sure the family has enough food to eat during the lockdown tobacco yourself's monthly income has dropped by more than 70 percent to 2 million rupiah or around 137 us dollars since the pandemic began he's selling basic essentials such as rice sugar and cooking oil to make ends meet but the harsh reality is there are other people who are less fortunate than him they might have lost their incomes from the uh tourism but if if we look at whether they are able to fulfill their basic needs it seems that they they can still fulfill their basic needs they might not get the money but they managed to fulfill their needs the economic impact of kobe 19 is not just on indonesia it's actually worldwide so in southeast asia indonesia malaysia the philippines and thailand are already predicted to have negative economic growth this prediction means there will be many jobs lost if they are not lost already for many indonesians who have lost their jobs and main source of income because of the crisis their main and perhaps only hope for survival is cash assistance from the government whether in urban or rural areas the situation that the poor are in are equally dire just like snack maker lilik ismawati in surabaya or three-wheeled taxi driver torikim they have yet to receive any help from the government foreign for indonesia is a big country with 200 million people even our social safety net program which is covering 20 million poorest family in indonesia they are not always capturing all the real poor people there is always an exclusion inclusion error those the exclusion is mean those who are supposed to be in this database they are not yet in that database our challenge is that since 2015 the updating of the full family data has been delegated to the local government and unfortunately not all local government updating those data until this topic then hit in 2020 indonesia is running against time to save millions of citizens who depend on the government to survive the pandemic but what more can the government do to help cushion the economic impact of the pandemic especially on the poor and the vulnerable segments of the population since the pandemic began early this year more than six million indonesians have lost their jobs tens of millions of people are also facing the risk of losing their main source of livelihoods as a result of the strict social distancing measures many of the poor who work mostly in the informal sectors are worried and have strong doubts over the future what happens if they fall ill what if they're evicted from their houses for not paying their rent and will they face the prospect of hunger and starvation when their incomes dry up leader of the traditional javanese dance troupe ryok mr sujiyanto has had to sell off almost all of his personal belongings so that his family has something to eat after the pandemic killed off his main source of income foreign stories of hunger poverty and joblessness have now become a common thread that link many of the more vulnerable segments of the population in indonesia these days bajaj driver turikim for example has been in physical pain for more than a month now the injury to his index finger has become worse but until today he has not seen a doctor to tend to his wound he can't even afford to pay for his daily needs let alone seek we foreign indonesia has raised a record of 18 trillion rupiah or around 1.2 billion us dollars from retail bond sales it has also secured some 9.9 billion dollars from global bonds since the beginning of this year to help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak the move is also part of its continuous efforts to pluck millions of indonesians from poverty and reverse the impact of the health crisis so the sort of prudent fiscal policies of past years basically uh allows for the room to spend on relief measures uh in the current situation in 2020 um so and and that's what the government is doing so the government spends uh i think close to 4.4.4 of gdp uh in terms of relief measures um and it so and and the the prudence fiscal policies of the past basically uh provide room to do so now in august this year president joko widodo unveiled a budget worth 185 billion us dollars for the year 2021 to put the economy back on track through increased spending the government has also set aside some 420 trillion rupiah or 28 billion u.s dollars as a form of a social safety net for the poor about 170 trillion rupiah or 11 billion us dollars have also been allocated to meet the growing demands for healthcare services these kinds of ad hoc interventions to the health systems right it actually indicates that there is a problem in designing the economy that the the the healthcare has always been has not been a priority yeah we can see how many uh how many hospitals are there outside java and what is the quality there and so how much has it been uh this is basically just basic needs right provision of basic needs if we go back to the definition of poverty again how would we expect that uh the areas uh that with high incidences of poverty uh would be able to get the opportunity to fulfill this healthcare needs if the facilities are not sufficient bajaj driver torikim can only hope that help will come sooner rather than later he also would like to see a sense of normality returning to the streets of jakarta to help ease his financial burdens for foreign such as fried chicken seller and grab driver his son masruri he can't wait for the return of the good old days covet 19 and the subsequent lockdowns have exacted a heavy toll on the lives of many people including his family they believe that reopening the economy will help relief their financial burden and allow them to get back on their feet again foreign foreign with the economy expected to contract this year it remains uncertain if growth will bounce back in the short term jokobi dodo says covet 19 cases will peak in september and that will have a negative impact on growth for the rest of the year the economy is expected to pick up again next year but only if the pandemic is over i think they are still within 0 into minus 0.5 but it could be deeper into minus 1 to 0 but this is really depend on the fourth quarter that we are aiming to have a better recovery and then for next year we've already discussed with the parliament and the growth estimation is between 4.5 to 5.5 until today many indonesians are hoping that the various social restriction measures will be lifted soon but the stark reality is many of them are now left disappointed just last week the government announced that the capital city jakarta will have to endure another round of strict restrictions due to the rising covet 19 cases the impact of such measures on the livelihoods of ordinary indonesians will be hard to imagine food seller and grab driver hissam masruri feels that he has little choice now but to go along with the new tough measures and persevere for as long as he can however tough it may be for him and his family says foreign 19 pandemic has deepened the social and economic divisions within the society the poor were already struggling to eke out a living before the start of the outbreak but now they're finding it a lot harder to break their poverty cycle due to the sudden loss of income and livelihoods in the wake of the pandemic many of them are hoping and praying that brighter days will return and that difficult times will soon pass preferably a lot sooner rather than later this is really a very hard situation for all i think regardless where is your social physician or economic decision because hobbit is indiscriminate i think you can always like you are affected in many different way it could be your family it could be your job it could be many things so it's really a very hard situation for all the government will do their best in order for us to be able to continue to support the people life the strength and the resiliency of the indonesian people is actually on their ability to adapt and adjust of course maybe on the one side we don't have a social protection which is formal and legalized but that's also creating a strength in the form of people solidarity is actually appear and can be seen in many different ways you

I still can get anyone I want! Seriously? You're still doing it. What do you think? Try this! What's this? My secret weapon. San Ti Niu Bian. Powerful, you know! Really? You try! You won't regret. You want more? No... I cannot take it anymore. Poh San! Poh San! -Pa!
-Poh San! Sorry ma'am, you can't go in. But he's my father! Please, ma'am. What's wrong with my husband? We're not sure yet.
Please wait at the waiting area. Come with me. Doctor, this was found
in the patient's pocket. It could be a drug, have it tested. Yes, doctor. We could be looking at drug poisoning. Extract samples of the patient's
blood and urine, and send them to H.S.A
(Health Sciences Authority) for analysis. Hello, this is the Pharmaceutical Lab
of the Health Sciences Authority. We received the samples you sent. Could you please tell us
the clinical symptoms of the patient? The patient arrived unconscious.
We would like you to check for drug poisoning. Are there any particular substances
you will like the lab to focus on testing? Yes, the patient's blood sugar is low. Please check for chemicals
that could be the cause. Do you have results for the specimens
we sent in for testing? Yes. We detected presence of
Glibenclamide in the patient's blood, and also the metabolite
in the patientâ€™s urine. OK, thank you. Ma, donâ€™t worry. Pa will be okay. Doctor, how is my husband? Heâ€™s resting comfortably,
we are monitoring his situation very closely. Does your father have diabetes? Ma? My husband has high blood pressure
but not diabetes. How is he? Well, his blood pressure and
his sugar level are dangerously low. These are symptoms of someone who has taken
an overdose of an anti-diabetic medicine. But my husband is not a diabetic. The drug that was found on your husband
contained Sildenafil, which is a drug used for treating
erectile dysfunction, as well as Glibenclamide. Doctor, are you saying that my father
has been taking some kind of sex drugs? Yes, I'm afraid so. Sildenafil would be a medication used for
treating certain male ailments. The drug that we found on your father
contained Sildenafil, as well as Glibenclamide. So, what he took
might have been adulterated. So, what you're saying is
the medicine isn't legal? Yes, Iâ€™m afraid
it was an illegal sex drug. Is he going to be okay? Right now, he's unconscious.
We are monitoring his situation very closely. We have a few cases like this
and weâ€™re doing our very best for him. Doctor, you mentioned there were other cases.
How common is this type of poisoning? Well, just two hours ago, we had another male patient who we suspect
was also taking similar illegal sex drugs. From the reconstructed story
you had just seen, the use of illegal sex drugs is dangerous
and can lead to serious health problems. The Health Sciences Authority has received
many reports of serious adverse effects associated with the consumption of
illegal sex drugs, including reports of epileptic fits,
stroke, and coma. 341 cases were reported
between 2008 and March 2012. 26 persons fell into coma,
out of which 11 died. Those who recovered from the coma suffered
serious brain damage with permanent disabilities. The cases that come to us
are usually people who develop side effects of
taking this sex enhancement drugs that have been adulterated. There were quite a number of cases
who came in by the ambulance, they were comatose and unconscious and they had fits
and they had very low sugar levels. Even after we gave them sugar supplement
through the drip, they did not recover completely. So these people due to
the prolong duration of low sugar, suffered something like a stroke
so they were in a vegetative state. Despite prolonged treatment
they succumbed to their illness. Recently, we've launched
a public education campaign to raise the awareness of... the dangers of illegal health products. In addition to our media advisories, we have placed advertisements
in the newspapers, at bus stops, on buses and M.R.T.s. We've also engaged the social media
to help us propagate the message. Illegal health products come in
different forms and packaging. It's difficult for the consumer to tell
what is real and what is illegal. To stay safe, don't buy medicines or
ealth products from dubious sources such as makeshift stalls, roadside stalls,
peddlers or hawkers or even well-meaning friends and relatives
who bought the products from overseas. If you need medications or if you have a medical condition, go and see a doctor who will prescribe you with the appropriate medicine. The Enforcement Division of the Health Sciences
Authority is always on the lookout for peddlers of illegal health products. What you are about to see is
a raid carried out by enforcement officers to nab illegal sex drugs peddlers. Okay, Team 1, green blouse,
black pants, short hair, female. Team 1 is the front car right? Newspaper Stand? Go, go, go, go, go! Raids, such as the one
you have just seen, are regularly carried out
by the Health Sciences Authority. Anyone caught selling erectile dysfunctional drugs
or sex drugs as they are commonly known, without a license, faces a punishment of
up to 2 years imprisonment, or a fine not exceeding $10,000,
or both. After the break,
costly hugs for elderly men. Handsome, I can get you
a very beautiful girl, you want? No! I don't do this sort of thing. You, you go away! Go! Go away! Kiong, I thought you are going to take the car?
What are you doing here? I... I left my wallet... Where? Where did you put it? I don't know... Who took it? The victim filed a police report. Police advisories were then put up
at void decks of HDB flats and public places, to alert the public, especially elderly men,
to look out for a female pick-pocket. The suspect is a woman in her late forties
and early fifties, with shoulder-length hair. Her Modus Operandi was to distract
her victims, elderly men, by touching or hugging them
and at the same time, pick their pockets. Who are you? I can be your friend,
let's go have a drink? No, I don't think so. Thank you. Incidents with similar MO (Modus Operandi)
were reported at Jurong East, Bedok South Road, Redhill Close,
Bangkit Road and Marine Terrace. Mister! I lost my key
and I can't get into my flat! Huh? My elderly mother is alone
and she's very sick! Please... help me! Where do you live? I live at Block 54, 11th floor. What is your name? Huh? You can call me Ah Ying.
What's yours? I'm Ah Teng. Ah Teng! Hey! What are you trying to do? You don't like? What are you trying to do? No... no... no... go away!
Go away! Please let me go!
Let me go! Go away! You crazy! Go away! Hey! This is only the 6th floor!
Where are you going? There's CCTV in this lift.
The incident would have been captured. Okay, good. Let's get the recording
from the town council. Yes! That's me. And do you know what they're saying about me
in the coffee shop there? What's that? Dirty old man! They said I tried to
take advantage of her! But sheâ€™s the one who came to me,
not the other way round! We're not trying to accuse you. All we need from you is to verify the woman
you were with in the lift. Will you help us? Okay, sure! With the image from the CCTV and an analysis of previous convictions of
female pick pockets with similar modus operandi, a Photo Identification session
was carried out. That's the one! Thatâ€™s her! You sure? She was so close to me
when she stole my money. I'm very sure it's her. The suspect was Tan Yoke Lan. In 1999, Tan Yoke Lan was sentenced to
11 yearsâ€™ preventive detention for stealing from eleven men
aged between 52 and 81. Altogether, she had been in and out of prison
a total of eight times since 1984. Good afternoon, maâ€™am.
How may I help you? Iâ€¦ I wish to give myself up. My name... Tan Yoke Lan! This is the police, open up! I wish to give myself up. Tan Yoke Lan! Hello? Okay, thanks. Guess what? What? She surrendered herself. Was someone helping you
when you committed those offences? No. I was alone. Why did you do it? I never finish school,
I donâ€™t even have a proper job before. What else can I do for myself? Life outside is so tough. Since I'm good at what I'm doing,
I just do anything that I can survive. Your victims are all elderly men. Why? Why? Because they are easy target. They become weak
when they see a pretty woman! How did you spend the money? I spent it on food, clothes... since I have no one else to give the money to,
so I spent it all on myself. Oh, I like to buy earrings. Why did you surrender? Because I saw my face
in the newspaper! I know the police are looking for me! Where can I hide? It's so embarrassing... It's so embarrassing... Tan Yoke Lan was found guilty of
eleven counts of theft. She was sentenced to
12 years' preventive detention. The Police meticulously sieved through similar
past cases to narrow down the list of suspects. The Police crime alerts and news reports
with the culpritâ€™s picture proved instrumental in her surrender. Be wary when a stranger
bumps into you. More so for elderly persons,
when a stranger suddenly hugs you. If that happens, check your valuables immediately
to make sure nothing has been stolen. We've come to the end of Crimewatch. If you have any feedback,
do feel free to drop us an e-mail. I'm DSP Julius Lim, signing off. ",False,False,True,False

Drugs used for COVID-19 / Treatment of COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease as per the latest Guidelines 

Remdesivir, Chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ritonavir  and Tocilizumab for COVID-19

Remdesivir
Remdesivir is an investigational intravenous drug with broad antiviral activity that inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription and has in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in-vitro and in-vivo activity against related betacoronaviruses .
Blocks RNA-dependent polymerases
Several randomized trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir for moderate or severe COVID-19
Its clinical efficacy is not well understood.
https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656?term=remdesivir&draw=2&rank=1
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions. Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2
Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, although hydroxychloroquine appears to have more potent antiviral activity .
Use of chloroquine is included in treatment guidelines from China's National Health Commission and was reportedly associated with reduced progression of disease and decreased duration of symptoms . However, primary data supporting these claims have not been published .
Other published clinical data on either of these agents are limited. In an open-label study of 36 patients with COVID-19, use of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) was associated with a higher rate of undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal specimens at day 6 compared with no specific treatment (70 versus 12.5 percent) . In this study, the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine appeared to have additional benefit, but there are methodologic concerns about the control groups for the study, and the biologic basis for using azithromycin in this setting is unclear. 


Clinical trails explains that
https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04321993?cond=covid19&draw=3&rank=19
Treatment of Moderate to Severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Hospitalized Patients
Estimated Study Completion Date  : July 2021
• Lopinavir/ritonavir
• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate
• Baricitinib (janus kinase inhibitor)
• Sarilumab (anti-IL-6 receptor)
Tocilizumab – Treatment guidelines from China's National Health Commission include the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab for patients with severe COVID-19 and elevated IL-6 levels; the agent is being evaluated in a clinical trial
Tocilizumab is under investigation for COVID-19 Pneumonia - Drug: Tocilizumab Injection , present in Phase 2 clinical trials
Inhibition of IL-6 receptors by tocilizumab leads to a reduction in cytokine and acute phase reactant 

https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04317092?cond=covid19&draw=2&rank=9

Lopinavir-ritonavir – Lopinavir-ritonavir appears to have little to no role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily been used for HIV infection, has in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV and appears to have some activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies . However, there was no difference in time to clinical improvement or mortality at 28 days in a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19 given lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days in addition to standard care versus those who received standard of care alone

#covid19treatment #drugsusedincovid19 #treatmentforcovid19 #treatmentforcoronavirusdisease #coronavirusdiseasetreatment #medicineforcovid19 #drugsusedincovid19patients #covid19treatment",[Music] so during this crisis time mainly because of the pandemic of in nineteen everyone are worried mainly about what are the treatment options which are available for the cove in nineteen as of today we don't have any drug which we can say it as a drug of choice for the cove in nineteen or approved drugs recommended by the Food and Drug Administration that is FDA but there are certain drugs which are been used by the licensed to physicians mainly to treat the cove in nineteen patients as of now we do not have any other drugs as percy to say that these are the drugs which has to be used for certain type of patients so what are the drugs which are floating around in the social media as well as what are the drugs which are recommended by the clinicians even though these trucks have not approved officially by the fda the first one is the rum deceiver chloroquine hydroxychloroquine low p nevere ritonavir and totally zoo map so these are the drugs right now we are using for the patients who are suffering from Co V nineteen so none of these drugs are mainly used as of no for the perfe lactic treatment of the Co V 19 but they are used once the patient get infected by this novel coronavirus or suffering from the disease called a scurvy nineteen so first let me talk about the rum disappear so this room dis aware is still under the trial it is an investigational intravenous drug which has a broader antiviral activity that inhibits the viral replication by means of premature termination of RNA transcription and this dog has an retroactivity I the sauce co2 which is called as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - we will call this as come in 19 and also in vitro and in vivo activity against related beta corona viruses so this is the drug actually blocks rna-dependent polymerizes and there are several randomized trials which are in the process or we can say underway to evaluate the efficacy of the rundas aware for moderate or severe curve in 19 but as of today its clinical efficacy is not well understood so this is under the clinical trials in the description of this video you can clearly go back to the link of the clinical trials and you can see at what stage this drug is under the clinical trials and coming to the another drug generally we use these as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are the oral prescription drugs that have been used for the treatment of malaria as well as for certain inflammatory conditions and especially when you talk about chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemo prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis system igloo pizzette mitosis called as SLE and porphyria cutanea tarda so both of the drugs have in vitro activity against Tsarskoe and SARS co2 source code is also called a source Co 1 which means severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 which was the old strain and the new strain what we are calling at present the pandemic one is called a source co2 which is responsible for the development of Cobie 19 and also for other corona viruses so with the hydroxychloroquine having a relatively higher potency against Disko with 19 patients when compared to that of the chloroquine but when we see both of the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to inhibitor source go to in vitro although hydroxychloroquine as I already mentioned appeared to have potent antiviral activity and the use of chloroquine is especially included in treatment guidelines from the China National Health Commission and was reportedly associated with the reduce to progression of the disease and decreased a duration of symptoms however the primary data supporting these claims have not been published in any of the articles but other published clinical data on either of these agents are pretty limited but in an open-label study among 36 patients with a Kebede 19 the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a higher rate of undetectable source code to RNA on nasopharyngeal specimens at day six compared with no specific treatment so in this particular clinical study the use of azithromycin in combination with the hydroxychloroquine appeared to have a much more additional beneficial effects on these patients but there are methodological concerns about the control groups for the study and the biological basis for using ozzie through Meissen in the setting is pretty and clear as of date so despite we are having a pretty much limited clinical data given the relative safety of the short term use of hydroxychloroquine the lack of unknown effective interventions and in the in vitro antiviral activity some clinicians think that it is reasonable to use hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with severe or risk of severe infection by the co-lead 19 and if they are not eligible for other clinical trials and also the possibility of the drug toxicity especially when we use this combination we may develop the patients may develop QT prolongation and retinal toxicity these two important toxicities can be considered prior to the using of hydroxychloroquine particularly in the individuals who may be more susceptible to these effects and there are also no currently available data from the randomized to clinical trials to inform that the clinical guidance on the use dosing and ear of the hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis of the treatment of the Novell corona virus 19 infection although the optimal dosing and the duration of the hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of Corbett 19 are unknown and some of the u.s. clinicians have reported the different hydrology chloroquine dosages such as 400 milligrams twice on a day 1 then daily for five days and 400 milligrams twice on day one than 200 milligrams twice for four days and then 600 milligrams twice on day one then 400 milligrams daily on days to defy like this we have various clinical trials which has been prescribed over here so whenever during the prescription they will mention 400 milligrams B ID bid so on the prescription whenever you say build which means twice 2 times n a it is an abbreviation for B sin die which is in Latin terminology means twice a day so in the description again you can see the clinical trials link where you can clearly see what is the status of the chloroquine as well as hydroxychloroquine on these randomized trials and the treatment of moderate to severe coronavirus disease in hospitalized patients so especially for these individuals there are several drugs which have been using and also currently underused that is low P nevere ritonavir as I already mentioned about hydroxychloroquine sulfate and bars to name that is Janus kinase inhibitor and sorry Lou mob which is anti interleukin 6 receptor or we can say aunt interleukin 6 . we can say out of all these totally assumable which is most widely used by the clinicians but the treatment guidelines from the China's National Health Commission include the interleukin 6 inhibitor that is totally xooma for the patients with severe Kubik 19 and elevated interleukin 6 levels and this agent is being evaluated in the clinical trial and as totally zoo map is still under the investigation for the co 819 pneumonia and the drug is actually given by the form of injection and at present it is under Phase two clinical trials and inhibition of this particular interleukin 6 receptors might Ursula Zuma leads to the reduction in cytokine as well as acute phase reactant that may have a beneficial effect in disco beat 19 patients so the link description you can see in the description box of this video you can see the status of the clinical trials because why I have given the link description for each and every drug because you can see all these drugs which have not approved by the FDA but can be used in the treatment settings because you don't have any treatment options which are available but all the drugs are still under investigation 'el trials loopy Naveed and ritonavir so these loci nevere and ritonavir appears to have little to no role in the treatment of the source curve to infection that is co v 19 but this combined Proteus inhibitor which has primarily been used for HIV infection has in vitro activity against a Tsarskoe one and appears to have some activity against murska which is Middle East respiratory syndrome in animal studies but however there was no difference in time to clinical improvement or mortality at the 28 days in a randomized trial among the 199 patients with a severe Coheed 19 given low pinna be right to Naveed that is 400 hundred milligrams twice daily for 14 days in addition to the standard case versus those who received standard of care alone so this is the official link in the description what you can see regarding the FDA link you can see regarding the loopy nevere as well as I turn of ear and this loopy nevere and ritonavir did not show promise for the treatment of hospitalized to cope with 19 patients with pneumonia in a recent technical trial in China and this trial was underpowered and Lupino II ritonavir is under investigation in a World Health Organization steady and mainly what is important is all these are the drugs these drugs are used by the clinicians you cannot use these drugs as an individual taking directly from the counter or you cannot use any of these drugs as a prophylactic treatment only when you are at risk or only when you get the infection once you get hospitalized the physicians or the doctors who are in the clinic are going to give you by seeing your aged symptomatology by you seeing the risk factors there are so many things which need to be taken under consideration before giving the treatment so I advise each and every individual do not buy any of the drugs directly from the counter and do not use it as a prophylactic treatment or use it as like individual treatment when you develop go with 19 you have to admit in a hospital and you have to be in current time for 14 days at any cost under the medical supervision and especially to reduce the risk of transmission into the community so all of the individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently practice for a spirit or hygiene that is covered there cough and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals and if possible and face masks are not routinely recommended for asymptomatic individuals to prevent exposure in the community and social distancing is especially advised at present particularly in the location that have the community transmissions so this is what you need to know about what are the treatment options which are available right now for Coheed 19 ,True,False,True,False

be a drug ready to use, we just don't know it yet. Using pre-approved drugs is the best
strategy in the short term to help people as others develop maybe more
sophisticated targeted approaches, say with a vaccine, or with
drugs that target the virus. But that could take months, if not years. Professor Nevan Krogan works with
an international team of scientists that have identified pre-existing
drugs with the potential
to fight the coronavirus. What we've noticed here is
that this virus, in a very
interesting way, is coming in and essentially hijacking all the
major biological processes in the
cell, in a very fascinating way. So it's getting its fingers in pretty
much all the major machinery in our cells. So the virus needs our cells
and our genes and proteins,
in order to live and replicate and infect ourselves. So the question is,
what are those proteins? So we generated this
map, this blueprint where we're essentially, looking
for all the human proteins
connected to virus proteins. We identified 332 of these human
proteins, through this study. And predicted drugs, or compounds that would come and bind to and
inhibit these human proteins. So of the 69 that we predicted
to bind at least one of these
332 proteins, 27 of which are FDA-approved drugs and the
rest are in clinical trials, or
being looked at pre-clinically. The logic here is if we do get
a hit on one of these drugs
we can go and look at one of these drugs in more detail and
then see what other drugs, or
compounds are similar to it. So we can expand our search
space, based on this initial
screen at the end of the day. Which will give us hopefully a
higher likelihood of success. Give us a sense of why it's easier to use
an old drug? I think on average it takes
eight, nine years to get a drug
into a person and a big reason for that length of time is that you
have to go through toxicity trials. But if you focus on drugs, or
compounds, that have already
passed that barrier. You can more quickly expedite a particular
drug, or compound, into a
person to target this virus. And a lot of times that's not
done, this drug repurposing. One of the reasons is,
financially related. Companies have patents for specific
compounds, or drugs and if another company finds that, oh, this drug could
be used for another disease.
Well the original company will get all the financial
benefit from that. So people don't look at
those in that way that much. But of course now everybody just wants to
solve this particular problem. And I would say one of the classic
examples of drug repurposing is Viagra. It was initially used to treat heart pain and then it was realized there were other
beneficial effects associated with it. So we'd been thinking
about this for some time. and obviously now, with
this sense of urgency, it's
really allowed us to expedite this particular vision and test it. ",True,False,True,False

The move came as the Ministry of Health was probing the collapse of a 16-year-old boy six days after his first Pfizer-BioNTech jab, just after a strenuous gym workout.
He was in critical condition at the National University Hospital after a suspected cardiac arrest.

Minister for Education Lawrence Wong, urged vigilance and caution against more infectious strains of the virus and the risk of super spreader events.

The vaccination programme and the continuous review of Singapore’s measures will remain a key focus to keep the infection under control.

He was speaking at a joint interview with Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) Co-chairs.",it's been a year since we you know had this fight against kovite 19. i don't think any words can fully describe what 2020 has been like it's quite surreal to see the world come to a standstill so it's really been an exceptional year challenging exhausting for everyone we've had to put in place some very difficult measures in singapore unprecedented and we are very appreciative that singaporeans have cooperated and taken these measures in their stride so i want to echo what minister ghan said just now to thank all our healthcare and frontline workers who have been working hard round the clock over the whole of last year and are continuing to do so we've had also many uh you know unsung heroes from across all walks of life doing their parts and certainly the tremendous spirit of singaporeans in rallying together showing appreciation for the essential workers for the migrant workers going out of their comfort zone to help people who are in need and people who are vulnerable i think this crisis has certainly brought out the best of singaporeans we are entering 2021 and this new year with more capabilities in tackling covet 19. we are in a much stronger position from that point of view on the other hand the situation remains highly unpredictable there are new more infectious strains out there may even be circulating in our community we don't know and we have seen also community cases creeping up the reality is there is a sense of fatigue among singaporeans with all the safe management measures that they have to comply with that's true any everywhere in the world we are still in a vulnerable position we are it only takes one super spreader event for new cases to emerge in an uncontrollable fashion so we are trying very hard to prevent that from happening and our priorities for this year are twofold number one we will have to continue to accelerate our vaccination program we have already been ramping up when we will go all out to try and get everyone in singapore vaccinated as soon as possible number two we continue to stay vigilant and we continuously update and review our measures and safeguards and where necessary we will make adjustments we must ensure that our measures at the borders as well as our community measures remain tight and effective in keeping the infection under control we have a plan to get everyone vaccinated by the third quarter of this year but between now and the third quarter of this year there are many months and many things can happen during this period so let's stay alert let's stay vigilant let's rally together and complete our mission to defeat kovite 19 together ,True,True,True,True

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",[Music] more than 26 million infected around the world hundreds of thousands have died that's a world war type of scenario world war casualty figures the first case of covet 19 emerges in uhan china in november 2019. in january 2020 singapore confirms its first case of the novel coronavirus the fight against what will become a global pandemic is about to get tougher and last much longer than healthcare workers can even imagine overnight we saw three times more singaporeans coming to our screening center my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited wart we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases i didn't sleep that day how do i feel one word sums it up tired tantoxing hospital is one of singapore's largest multidisciplinary hospitals next door under the sea management is the national center for infectious diseases which officially opened its doors just four months before the biggest public health crisis in the recent history of the city-state over the course of eight months in 2020 both will screen a total of more than 35 000 people for covet 19 and award thousands of infected cases almost every single staff member will be pulled into the war on the virus and it starts like this on the 30th of december there was reports from china that there were clusters of atypical pneumonia happening in muhan and the cost of it is unknown that signals that there could be something unusual happening and it's something that we need to watch closely for dr angela chao heads the department of clinical epidemiology at ncid one of its tasks is to look out for data on infectious disease trends around the world so every day they were monitoring for diseases very closely and receiving influenza and it also tells you where the countries the areas where there are active transmission or even users three days after the news from china singapore begins to screen all inbound travelers from uhan although the cause of the outbreak there is still unclear ttsh and ncid go into full outbreak mode it was never in any point in time in doubt in our mind that it would spare singapore professor leo eason was at the forefront of singapore's fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in the early 2000s which claimed 33 lives two of them were her colleagues at ttsh a very painful experience taught us that our systems need to be ready in the sas aftermath the hospital developed a comprehensive outbreak playbook every staff is assigned a role to play in event of an outbreak and hospital-wide drills are conducted at least once a year planning is an essential part of our state of readiness it makes an outbreak a known unknown realistically speaking dr ang hao who joined the hospital shortly before the sars outbreak now leads its emergency department which is singapore's largest and busiest emergency department has a long established history of running screening for outbreaks during peacetime we already screened partners yellow fever monkey pop ebola plague lassa fever and now kovid 19 this is new working closely with dr ang is dr charmaine manawas who develops the instructions for healthcare staff to screen patients there was a particular period where we had to screen for certain provinces in china so of course everyone isn't versed on where the provinces are so that's why they put the map here once we pick up a travel to these certain countries than they are triage to the fever area four days after screening begins ncid opens its first outbreak award to isolate suspect patients margaret soon is its nursing director with almost 30 years of experience the initial cases definitely is with a lot of anxiety because we know very little we also could tell the staff very little it's a tense period on january 8 chinese officials identify a new coronavirus that's related to sars and mers as the cause of the epidemic a day later its genome is made public scientists in singapore begin their race to develop a test kit among them is a team comprising staff from ttsh and the agency for science technology and research so when the first case arrived we could use our own in-house detection kits to be able to make the diagnosis in china the virus has spread from wuhan to other parts of the hubei province people begin to die from the infection and medical workers are contracting the disease in the line of duty in singapore ttsh isn't taking chances with the safety of its staff its infection control team ensures that everyone from doctors to cleaners is properly trained and equipped to protect themselves [Music] these strict protocols have been meticulously developed over the years by dr brenda aung another sars veteran the role of infection control to limit the spread between patients and also to try and prevent transmission to healthcare workers even contractors are mask fitted [Music] over the rest of january cases emerge elsewhere around asia on january 23rd the same day the chinese government put cities in hupei under lockdown singapore confirms its first case a 66 year old chinese national from uhan who is awarded at the singapore general hospital the day after case number two is confirmed this time at ncid it was actually a tourist from ohan so of course she couldn't quite remember where she's been what she's done finding out where she'd been and who she'd met is the job of dr chao's team in the weeks to come the role of thorough contact tracing will become even more apparent as more is learned about when and how infected persons transmit the virus from the point when they are symptomatic we look back one incubation period so 14 days the history can go back like two three weeks a lot of time to slowly joke their memories to recall where did you go with your daughter you know here i think who have rather active social life that is definitely good it's just it's a bit more challenging when you're trying to do the contact racing um to know exactly where are the places that you went to and what times you went as more close contacts of infected patients are identified the screening load at the emergency department increases ttsh decides to activate the dedicated infectious disease screening center ncid it was a very busy chinese new year for a lot of people not because we were going around celebrating furniture had to be moved in computers had to be set up we actually managed to cut two days off the activation time more nurses are also needed to triage and swap patients we have to draw nurses from various areas including nurses from operating theaters the clinics our nurse educators some of them volunteered actually the whole kang phong is involved so this is my night shift let's go and have a look a nurse at the cardiology department is one of the volunteers we practice and we do the swap on each other i tell you you won't think about do it again so far all confirmed cases here have been travellers from china singapore will restrict entry to all new travelers who've been to mainland china in the last 14 days regardless of nationality but on february 4th the inevitable happens a cluster of infections emerges from a chinese medical hall serving tourists from china the four cases signal the start of communities spread in singapore it also sparks a change in the definition of a suspect case to anyone with recent close contact with travelers from china taxi drivers tour bus drivers people who worked in tourist attractions or hotels and airports casinos they were all flooding in today it was three times more than what we saw the day before the task of making sure they stay ahead of this massive search and demand falls to this place [Music] welcome to the command center of tandoxing hospital this is where we have visibility of the entire operations industry hospital and the national center for infectious diseases this military-inspired command and control center is the first of its kind in a local healthcare facility it's overseen by dr jamie lim the hospital's chief operating officer the screen gives us visibility of the supplies that we have at the screening center how many patients do we have at that point in time we use colors to depict status when it crosses a certain threshold it either turns yellow amber and then the next threshold will be great we don't want to be reactive but we want to be ahead of the signs and sickness on that pivotal night of february 4th c3 system triggered an alarm in a span of 24 hours we open up an additional five words we had to open 100 bids within a day that was really stressful there's just a lot of coordination to making sure that the medications are there lyndon is there but when the bits fill up quickly with suspect cases who present as clinically well the team proposes a new strategy [Music] ncid clinical director sean vasu keeps the health ministry updated regularly we proposed to the ministry a swap and send home strategy where patients who do not in hospital care would receive that diagnostic test an adequate amount of medical leave to go home and self-isolate to the results come out within the next 8-24 hours at home these patients are closely monitored by the surveillance team to see if they develop symptoms those who test positive are brought in straight away by ambulance for admission to ncid we have also trained up our data analysts our biostatisticians pathologists our psychologists they were helping us with phone surveillance soon as the patient load increases as many as 50 staff are roped in to call more than 500 people a day as part of surveillance and contact tracing efforts another team working round the clock in the background is the department of laboratory medicine led by dr patha day we very quickly had to go to 24 7 operation from normal office hours right now i'm labeling the samples that we will be extracting for the next round of extraction they are another crucial link in the chain racing to provide timely confirmation of whether a suspected case has been infected or not even a negative result enables the doctors and nurses to discharge patients and free up beds for the new incoming suspect and confirmed cases almost every half an hour there will be samples coming in my busiest night throughout the night from 8 30 to the next morning 8 30 i didn't even have time to rest it was continuous running of samples [Music] the team uses the test kit developed by scientists from ttsh and a star made available to hospitals on february 6th and it comes none too soon [Music] the next day singapore raises its disease outbreak response system condition to orange alert level the disease spreads easily among people but is contained and not widespread visitors to hospitals will now have to fill in declaration forms and have the temperature taken staff are redeployed here from other departments to make this possible and as a safety measure the hospital cuts down on elective surgeries and closes some clinics i came from a acupuncture clinic a business office health department some staff like dietetic technician collis yap now work twelve hour shifts instead of normal working hours at fps is very draining my family members always remind me why i do this and why is it important thank you very much for coming on a saturday other medical staff are directed to support the screening center and outbreak warts obviously we needed more manpower the whole hospital had to cut down and leave and off days in fact i was planning for my honeymoon but i got cancelled and i came back to ncid to care for my patients but on social media accounts are shared of ambulance drivers and nurses being shunned on public transport and in public areas this paranoia however triggers the unexpected an overwhelming flood of love and encouragement for healthcare workers so we've received a lot of stuff from kids and from the public so this one is from little footprints preschool um look they have the babies uh these are the babies footprints and then the older kids wrote us letters so it's very heartwarming [Music] patients too express their gratitude mrs jung spent most of her 18 days in ncid under intensive care [Music] oh [Music] meanwhile the virus continues to spread in the community and new clusters emerge but the infection rate remains low compared to countries like italy and to some it looks like life could soon return to normal in singapore i suppose to the public that may seem like a loud period but that that silence was very worrying for us [Music] countries other than china go into lockdown and who declares covet 19 a pandemic [Music] we knew that it was a matter of time before we see the second wave we didn't know how big the second wave was going to be so we made a decision with the ministry to set up a tentach just outside the screening center if ever there is an overflow of patients coming in for screening the lab is also trying to ramp up its capacity from 500 to 800 tests a day with more staff and equipment but its efforts are hampered by a global shortage of reagents on march 21st singapore reports its first covet 19 deaths the icu team is no stranger to dealing with mortality but handling death from covet 19 is different what usa is outside the ico world what we see is the reality and the sickle cell patient unfortunately we do lost patients despite every effort we put they still pass on that was very very difficult for the families because none of them could come and see and you had to tell them over the phone what was happening and that your father or mother brother sister was was likely going to die you can imagine this is my love once i would actually want to hold their hand to see a proper go by we do have a relative actually funded during the video call we just feel a bit helpless yeah but we try our best to do what we can to help the patient and the family everybody does that yeah in the icu well spain is now emerging as a new hotspot for covet 19. by march 22nd the death toll worldwide from covet 19 is more than 11 000 and in singapore infection numbers have crept back up mainly from imported cases for the first time ever singapore closes its borders to tourists and short-term visitors the next day dr jamie lim's fears come true we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases we actually had to open tentach until 3 a.m at night with a lot of patients having to wait a little bit longer so that was a struggle i i didn't sleep that day this search in cases is due mainly to students and travelers returning home from countries going into lockdown what's it why suddenly so many patrons yeah then oh yeah we just chong mao we are 80 people if there's a job to do then we just do it ncid immediately enacts its plan to expand the number of bits in the outbreak wards so let's move to 5f okay we will go down to level 2 the capacity here at baseline is 330 bits we can expand the capacity to 586. the rooms in this building are designed in such a way that we can double stack or in some rooms triple stack but many of the bits are also being taken up by infected patients who are recovering well and in the clinical team's view can be cared for outside the hospital setting at the national level the decision is made [Music] there was a turning point in outbreak in terms of our isolation strategy this is where clinical data informs policy we knew that clinical presentation certain demographics about the patient their age and their medical history which means that we can now have younger coveted 19 cases being taken care of in the isolation facilities and most of them would recover without significant complications over a month three more community isolation facilities are set up all these are all like kind of draw plans already increase flexible it may not be already in your drawer plan but you must have a system where it is flexible enough so that it becomes situation based and we can still respond effectively on march 29th a porter who transports patients in ncid is confirmed to have contracted covet 19. an outbreak within its walls would be any hospital's nightmare it happened to ttsh during sars when some 100 staff visitors and patients were infected following exposure to the virus in its warts but this time nearly 20 years later the hospital came prepared to the fight and despite the more infectious nature of covet 19 the stringent measures from personal protection protocols to staff surveillance have prevented disease transmission so far now i can do it again everyone who enters into ncrd wears this tech all patients and staff within ncid wear a real-time tracking device which allows the staff surveillance team to quickly trace people who are in contact with the porter you can just open up all of them so you can actually see all of them have been in contact with every other people it provides granular level of visibility of where each patient is and where each staff is so this is the floor plan it shows this portal's movement history on this date the information helps ncid to identify staff at risk of contracting the virus and to quarantine them to stem a potential hospital cluster you could say this is big brother watching you but just say there's a friendly father hospital observing people again for staff a lot of safety happens as of september 13th 10 staff from ttsh and ncid have contracted covet 19 but none in the course of their work but elsewhere in singapore a time bomb is about to go off the coronavirus has been quietly spreading among migrant workers this was the dormitory with the bangladeshi workers dayden before he tested positive for the virus meanwhile though nowhere at the levels of countries like the us or italy the number of unlinked community cases has crept up on april 3rd prime minister lee sien long announces that singapore will go into circuit breaker mode closing schools and many workplaces we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period because this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus we do not want to wait for a situation where the cases rise sharply and then we get overwhelmed the streets of singapore have never been quieter but the scene at ttsh is very different [Music] each day up to 300 migrant workers come here to be screened the basic difference is that the migrant workers are unable to self-isolate because they live in a dorm we will have to hold them until the swab results are out if the patient is negative then they have to be transferred to a clean dorm if the swab results are positive then they may be admitted or they may be transferred to isolation facility on april 20th singapore sees 1400 new cases of covet 19 the highest numbers so far in a single day the majority of them are migrant workers i remember coming to work and overnight my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited what because we have to increase our capacity just to cope with this increase of infection cases it was then that we saw some of the most sick patients it was a emotional period for me personally because the patients that we see are usually fit young construction workers they had to be hospitalized for quite some time [Music] only i think about my family plus how to say my life i can i can continue my life i also very very my inside very question mark really daily new cases of covet 19 remain high throughout april and ncid warts are almost fully occupied again triggering its plan to expand into ttsh my name is nadia i'm an assistantness creation here in sandboxing and i'm a nurse working in the kobit award this is the first time when we have both covet patients and business as usual patients in the same building the first thing that we have to do is to make sure that the pathways are segregated that includes mapping of the rules and locking down the leaf or the kobe pathway so these are the two areas that is actually designated to nurse our kovid patients so let's go six general awards there are converted into outbreak wards one what is actually allocated to be the clean area the first shift is like you go in right it's not even five minutes you are like wet everywhere and then you feel like so stuffy and then you have this like fainting spells like you cannot breathe so well every cubicle there will be three big exhaust fans this actually to create negative pressure because the cubicle doesn't have an extra glass doors or an extra room finally after eight weeks of circuit breaker the rate of infection starts to slow with the reduced covet 19 patient load the additional outbreak warts at ttsh are no longer needed but for one department there is no easing up in fact our workload on microbiology for pcr has gone up a lot more it's doubled to cope the department hires additional staff and acquires new equipment that simplifies the testing process there's people who need to be cleared to go back to work like school teachers goods delivery drivers essential goods like groceries and so on the emphasis has shifted to screening which is a good thing which is part of reopening covid19 will eventually become the new normal respiratory virus that we will test for every year just as swine flu h1n1 on july 14th the lab makes a mistake a confirmed case of covet 19 has been found to be wrongly diagnosed due to a mix-up of test samples at the tantoxin hospital's laboratory to ensure that a mistake like this doesn't happen again the lab has automated its patient registration process i've got a thousand specimens to process even if we tell them take your time do they know there are patients waiting at the end of this and they want to do their best so we've had to try and manage all of that the psychological as well as the physical demands while the hospital still isn't going back to 100 business as usual it has managed to resume some elective surgeries and open certain clinics other inpatient warts have also continued to run all this while compared to sars when ttsh was designated the central treatment hospital enclosed to all non-sars patients in an outbreak people still come in with a heart attack people still break their leg and they need treatment emergency surgeries will still carry on we run essentially two hospitals tantoxin as the business as usual and ncid as the outbreak center with the same team of doctors nurses and administrators can you just page for me if there is any problem i will be in the office okay um nipping did not really reduce the illness patient ratio either at bau side and also at ncid side we deliberate plan for the ratio to be at one is to four especially because we think that adequate stuffing is important for both patient and staff safety but the months-long fight has taken a mental and emotional toll on staff and the war with covet 19 is a long way from over there's one day my husband actually come back from work having high fever i'm not scared for myself i really scared for my

fantastic job not just during the pandemic you do a fantastic job all day every day i'm tremendously proud of my colleagues they are marvellous they are kind-hearted and you know they they really give

Students from Fairfield Methodist School (Primary) would like to show their gratitude to all the healthcare workers in NUH working on the frontline. Apart from preparing cards and writing personal messages of appreciation, one student, Jacob Neo (Primary 6B), composed a song entitled, “Singapore, Unite as One!”. Despite not having any formal music education outside school, and only having his first try in songwriting in 2019 as part of his learning in the General Music Programme (GMP), he wrote both melody and lyrics in two days! 

Here are the lyrics:

Singapore, Unite as One 
[VERSE 1]

You're shut away,
you're isolated
Cut off,
from civilisation
All alone,
with your hopes and dreams 
Shattered,
no longer free

[PRE-CHORUS]

But I want you to know that
you're not alone
And I want you to feel that
you are at home

[CHORUS]

And the night looms the sun goes down
Day bleeds and light’s just a memory (memory)
The ‘crowns’ are invading us what can we do
This is agony… Yeah!

But we’ll be together through thick and the thin
As one country we’ll fight this virus and win
We’ll fight with our hearts and our minds and our souls
Protecting this island where we call our home

[VERSE 2]

Fearful,  
yet advancing
Fulfilling,
your duty and call
Knowing,
that there’s a purpose
Press on,
stand firm for all

[PRE-CHORUS]

But I want you to know that
you're not alone
And I want you to feel that
you are at home

[CHORUS]

And the night looms the sun goes down
Day bleeds and light’s just a memory (memory)
The ‘crowns’ are invading us what can we do
This is agony… Yeah!

But we’ll be together through thick and the thin
As one country we’ll fight this virus and win
We’ll fight with our hearts and our minds and our souls
Protecting this island where we call our home

[BRIDGE]
 
Singapore, we’ll stay together
Singapore, the time has come 
Singapore, we’ll fight forever
Singapore, Unite as One! 

Singapore, we’ll stay together
Singapore, the time has come
Singapore, we’ll fight forever
Singapore, Unite as One!

[CHORUS]

And the night looms the sun goes down
Day bleeds and light’s just a memory (memory)
The ‘crowns’ are invading us what can we do
This is agony… Yeah!

But we’ll be together through thick and the thin
As one country we’ll fight this virus and win
We’ll fight with our hearts and our minds and our souls
Protecting this island where we call our home

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",it's 2020 and human actions are affecting wildlife more than ever all these forests were just cleared i think some of the animals have been displaced most of the ones that we have assessed were some sort of human induced injuries over the decades reserve singapore has been investing in animal conservation and protecting wildlife outside its compounds he probably wouldn't have survived if there wasn't any intervention there good luck buddy you can do it [Music] this morning acres wildlife rescue service is responding to a call about a young python that's been found at the marina country club [Music] if you just go back maybe two years back in time surrounded by forested areas so all these forests were just cleared so i think some of the animals have been displaced [Music] every month acres rescues about 40 pythons from urban spaces though they used to live in the forest now they're slithering into singapore's canals and drains he's definitely not sniffing out he can give a nasty bite actually but he's pretty calm so far as part of a joint effort to monitor the reticulated python population in singapore kali takes it to the zoo's hospital to be microchipped before it's released pxy today morning we had another baby python from marina country club like most modern zoos around the world wildlife reserve singapore provides treatment to wild animals thank you thank you inside the hospital dr charlene is preparing to microchip another adult python that has been brought in she's one of 10 vets who treats animals in the zoo's collection as well as local wildlife so basically we're keeping this snake supported and we're just restraining just enough for the snake to to not get away and then just scanning the snake for microchip okay so if it's already microchipped then we just note down uh the number the percentage that comes back as recaptures it seems quite consistent so that's actually quite encouraging to know that some of the older ones are still around despite a heavily urbanized landscape singapore is home to a rich biodiversity of over 40 000 wildlife species [Music] but as developments like the cross island mrt line continue to shrink their habitats wild animals are venturing into the garden city for food and finding themselves in danger this is an oriental white eye when he first came in he was only about five grams we had to feed him every one hour or so the chick was found at a local coffee shop a member of the public brought it to the jurong bird parks avian hospital to mother these babies it takes a lot of patience sometimes they get very excited and the food might go into their lungs instead [Music] the bird rescue unit rehabilitates up to 700 orphaned sick and injured birds every year including this baby large-tailed night job it was found alone without its parents within the jurong bird parks compound he was actually very cold and very weak and he probably wouldn't have survived if there wasn't any intervention so they eat insects and they usually lie on the ground in the wild and jump up to get their food so we try to encourage that by offering food from the top to stimulate that natural behavior as it's still a chick gabrina must hand feed the night job but two minutes later the night jar still isn't eating cabrinha has no choice but to start force-feeding night jazz in particular are just so difficult to can raise in captivity it's just difficult for us to mimic how they feed in the wild for now gabriela's priority is to help it gain weight night jars are notoriously difficult to feed in captivity but she's optimistic that the bird will learn to feed itself after it's released back into the wild in the wild they eat moths crickets a lot of flying insects but they rarely eat it for us i think i've only had one adult night jar that ate for us while in captivity and all the rest we did have to force feed them [Music] to help the night jar re-acclimate to the wild gabrina has prepared an outdoor aviary for it we have put in the plants to mimic the world more and also he can hide in there from predators or even when it rains it's some shelter for him at least the night jar will stay outdoors during the day for the next two weeks after which it will be released back into the wild khali and his team have found yet another python this time near a construction site it is severely injured with part of its lower jaw missing kalai suspects the injury may have been caused by humans and he's bringing it to the zoo's hospital for a thorough assessment people need to know what to do when they see a while anymore we need to understand and accept the fact that these animals will enter into our living space they're just trying to coexist good morning dr charlene so yesterday we got this python [Music] most of the ones that we have assessed were some sort of human induced injuries road traffic accidents or have been hit by people having lost its lower jaw it probably has not been eating and it was definitely suffering so i think what we'll do is um we'll go ahead and use an ice so if an animal comes in a condition like this i think that we have the responsibility to be ending the suffering over at the jurong bird park the keepers have decided to keep the oriental white eye as it didn't learn the skills it needs to survive in the wild now it has to learn to get along with its new friends in the aviary [Applause] it's been three months since the young oriental white eye was rescued from a local coffee shop having been separated from its parents it's been hand-reared by hospital vets and is now a full-fledged adult it cannot be introduced back into the group in the world because he didn't develop the social skills that he needs so we actually take the decision to absorb it for the past three days the oriental white eye has been getting to know its new home at the jurong bird park and its new neighbors but from a distance what we are doing here is a soft introduction is to basically gauge the interest of the established birds in this area itself to see if there's any pre-aggression today the soft introduction finally ends but will it accept its new home [Music] as you can see the birds are all mingling with each other the oriental white eye joins over 15 000 animals in singapore's four wildlife parks but while the avery provides a safe haven for birds like it critics like peter say that even the best zoos can't replicate the freedom of wild habitats and for years they've been campaigning against keeping animals in captivity for human edutainment any animal we have with us we always make an effort to match the natural habitat so our tigers have a large water body where they can actually swim they also have large land area to climb up if they want to with many places where we can actually hide food from them so they need to use their sense of smell to go and look for the food so we make up for not having 10 times the space with having enough engaging opportunities for them to actually be stimulated both mentally and physically one of the ways the zoo is refining its approach to housing animals is to mix species in a single exhibit the future is to have exhibits which are almost like a living showcase of what happened in the wild we try to have almost like a mini ecosystem there meaning peace of nature [Applause] so the primary goal is for the animals to have more social interaction more social enrichment with this in mind the zoo introduced otters to the famous orangutan exhibit last year then they brought in two pileated gibbons from the ason zoo in france but one of the zoo's young stars born in orangutan saloma got a little too curious about her new neighbors today saloma's first time in the enclosure with a given [Music] for the first couple of minutes she was like chasing the given having them all together allows us to actually showcase how different species can coexist in the rainforest they will interact they can share feeding they can share foraging they can play together this is much closer to what they would actually experience in the world [Music] this is noah the only sri lankan leopard living at the singapore zoo there are fewer than a thousand of her kind left in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching at nine years old noah is at her prime and the zoo wants to find her a mate as part of their conservation efforts to protect her endangered species there are about 90 sri lankan leopards under human care and then all of them are individually profiled in the start book the most important criteria that we're looking for is his genetic value if he has any descendants we need to have a diverse population under human care as a safeguard towards any catastrophic event that may happen to the leopards in a while i believe we found the perfect candidate for our female nuwa he is a male named raja from raghunan zoo jakarta indonesia he have not reproduced at all and he is already nearing the end of its reproductive lifespan when he dies his entire gene bloodline will be will be lost [Music] because of the global pandemic raja's travel to singapore faced complications his arrival was delayed by three months raja finally arrived at the singapore zoo in july but at 14 years old he's already nearing the end of his reproductive life the zoo's vets have collected his seminal fluid in case artificial insemination is ever needed we will always go for natural meeting first that's the easiest way raja has very good quality of semen under examination and now we just hope he will know what to do when he's mixed with the female [Music] a big male should be anywhere from 70 75 kilograms raja is about 95 at present him being fat is going to affect how fit is going to be when it comes to natural meeting and we'll put him on a training program to get him into the right condition the keepers are helping raja to get ready for his first date with noah now they must wait and see if their efforts will pay off [Applause] over the last decade wildlife reserve singapore has funded over 90 wildlife conservation projects like this one at the thompson nature park for four years primatologist andy young has been fighting to save a local endangered species that most singaporeans have never seen this is what we're looking out for it's called the raffles banded langer it is a monkey that is mostly black in color but it has white color bands on the chest and also on the inside of the lakes they are critically endangered because we are talking about 67 in singapore and probably about 200 or 250 in malaysia a hundred years ago troops of banded langers were easily spotted all across singapore from tampanese to tuas but the clearing of forests has forced the elusive tree dwelling monkeys to retreat into the central catchment nature reserve during our field observations we'll record what kind of food do they eat so if they're eating fruits or leaves of a certain plant species we can then work with the national parks board to look at ways to perhaps restore the habitat with all these food plants [Music] i think maybe we can set up here it has a pretty good view what do you think yeah okay if the language were to come out to the ground they might be looking for food so it's also a good indicator of whether this habitat is important over the last four years andy and her cameras have gathered invaluable information about the raffles banded langers we have documented 11 groups of languages and it consists of 67 individuals and we have also identified about 60 species of plants that they eat which range from flowers fruits and leaves where they need some artificial structures to help them cross safely from one forest patch to another [Music] all this information will help us protect the last home of the language in singapore today is going to be an exciting day for raja because it's his first time entering the leopard habitat in singapore [Music] we're going to put some meat around and then i'm going to tie one small bone on the lock [Music] i just want him to follow the new trail he took the time like raja and he came to the exhibit like arranger raja is getting acquainted with the enclosure first without nua the resident female leopard these are solitary animals you only can pair them in a few minutes on easter first thing he did is he starts sniffing so he will be thinking that well i can smell another leopard that's why his move was very slow [Music] you can see him sand marking everywhere because he like okay these are my areas now the young large-tailed night jar that was found at the jurong bird park has regained its strength under gabrina's care it's now ready to return to the wild [Music] so we'll be releasing this juvenile what nitra over here because it's close to where it was found [Music] good luck buddy you can do it [Music] he looks happy and content and there hasn't been any sightings of like predators around so i think he will be fine going to meet other night jazz and make a family of his own so we're helping the whole ecosystem thrive by just helping him for that few weeks across the island acres is also releasing five pythons into the forest we don't want them going back to residential areas even though they're very adapted to urban living we should treat them properly because end of the day there are animals they are sentient beings [Music] back at the zoo the keepers are letting both raja and noah into the enclosure it's the first time the two solitary leopards are in the enclosure at the same time she's ready to mate but is he ,False,True,True,False

195,AlY-IOiSQ7Q,The Straits Times,All in the same fight | Covid-19 in Singapore | The Straits Times,2020-05-04T12:00:07Z,"The Straits Times looks at how two hospitals in the west of Singapore are coping with the surge of cases.

Full story: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/all-in-the-same-fight

Just a few months ago, before the coronavirus pandemic, the Community Hub at Jurong Community Hospital (JCH) was a multipurpose hall used by patients for weekly activities such as karaoke and movie sessions. 

Now the hall has been converted to house up to 48 patients while they await their Covid-19 swab results, which can take up to six hours.

Portable beds line the floor and are spaced out for safe distancing. Held up by yellow and red tape, transparent plastic sheets seal all exits except for the main entrance to the hall. Television screens and stage lights have also been wrapped up. 

JCH and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH) are fully integrated hospitals that have been operational since 2015. 

In March, NTFGH dealt with the then largest local cluster of patients who were connected to a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong. 

The majority of the Covid-19 cases at present are foreign workers who mainly reside in dormitories. As a number of these dormitories are in the western part of Singapore, there has been a spike in cases at the emergency department of NTFGH.

Brazil India's overtaking Russia and likewise most of the deaths a US and Brazil at this stage this is the global EPI curve you can see the major contribution in in orange which is the the Americas so that includes the US and Brazil driving most of that the green one the Southeast Asian region contains India and and the one you can hardly see down the bottom as the brown one which is the western Pacific area which is which is where we are and you can see there that what we've got is around 200,000 cases a day now so that gets you up to you 1.3 1.4 million a week deaths are around 5,000 per day so here's just the the five day moving average of the three main countries and you can see as I've shown in previous weeks that the US have done this extraordinary turnaround with 30,000 cases a day coming down to 20,000 and now up to 50,000 and some of these days are actually 60,000 Brazil may be plateauing off in in terms of its cases I'm not sure I'd think schools probably still out on that one but in India as is fairly fairly relentless this is the epic curves by region and particularly you can see Africa is having about 15,000 cases a day with a relatively low death rate the America is still going up with with with their death rate there or two or three thousand per day eastern Mediterranean seems to have flattened off Europe is a story of many different countries obviously and and and this is being maintained now really by by Eastern Europe if you like and as Western Europe as has come down so this is being maintained by by by other countries Southeast Asia this was the Indian catch up in in death reporting this was the China catch up on death reporting so in in the western Pacific region we're running at very very few deaths and in cases in the sort of two thousand three thousand I'm not going to go through every country this week I'm just trying to make it a slightly shorter session in just for the for the scheduling reasons the the big talk of the town is is Australia of course they've been coming out of lockdown for for for a couple of months now never really quite quite got fully back to normal before this this spike and this is this is all happening in Melbourne so Australia's had about 9,000 cases altogether there's there's 106 deaths there's about 160 to 190 cases a day in Victoria and and this is what's prompted prompted a re lockdown but it's a fairly focused one in Melbourne with particular attention to some tower blocks of largely migrant underprivileged people so it's a it's quite similar to a to a dormitory situation I think obviously there's some particular nuances this seems to have started when there was a security guard who was working in one of the quarantine hotels became infected and they or the whole the whole Melbourne cluster seems related to that so it really just takes one infection-control breach and and Milburn's back in lockdown so it's it's quite different across the states and they've even for the first time in 100 years shut the border with New South Wales Philippines is is the other story it's it's at around 42,000 cases with with 1300 deaths this is probably not so real this this coming up they had a testing backlog so they had a lot of samples for for some months and and and they caught up once with that improving testing capacity so I don't think that's a surge in cases most of their cases about half of them are in metropolitan Manila there's a spike in spike in cases and deaths in Cebu City and and hospitals describing being being overwhelmed there's some slum areas I think in in Cebu City and and they're they're really having trouble getting contact tracing and all the conventional outbreak responses happening they're testing positivity rates five point seven so that could be a bit better as well Japan this little spike here is is is now up to 200 cases on some days and and that's that's related to some nightclub outbreaks in in in Tokyo career just doing this nice little rumble along which I've I'm a big fan of I think this is this is your perfect Debbie curve the Korean one so India 675 thousand cases and almost twenty thousand deaths in in total testing positivity rate of 8% so so that this really is just just fairly relentless as I've said before it's it's fairly heterogeneous some some places not so badly affected but but others have got I've got major problems there's a shutdown in in an area of Kerala and as well as that Mumbai was having problems so so but but actually it's not all bad news I this this came I came across this with this place it's called the Dharavi slum and and this whole effort became the the Dharavi mission mission Doral via was called so this is an area and and hello and I know we've got a lot of people from India that the tune in to us so so hello to all of you and I hope I've got this story right but there's about there's about a million people that live in this area which is two square miles and they've had all together you can see this newspaper on June 30th said they had two thousand two hundred and sixty-eight cases in in April they had four hundred and ninety in in May they had about twelve hundred so so June was another thousand but but obviously it's peaked in in in early June and look at these cases in in July so so it's absolutely stunning that they could they could control this outbreak in this setting and and they did it with good old-fashioned outbreak response they took over schools and halls and sports facilities and and develop quarantine areas they were doing about they did about twelve thousand tests in total and with a mobile testing unit so so a good story I mean I guess this is still still dry kindling so it's it it could take off again but nonetheless it's a it's a good story the other area I thought I might just have a look at because we've never really spoken about this is his parts of of Eastern Europe and and and this came came across Greece is is doing remarkably well right three and a half thousand cases a hundred ninety two deaths but you can see that they're rumbling along and about maybe 20 cases a day now and many of those are actually from from Serbia so you can see Greece here Serbia not far away and there's there's been there's problems here you can see this it's got a beautiful second wave shape to it as soon as they unlocked all the the the efforts they had in in May this resurgence came back and apparently this is a media reports are of a poor case and that will under reporting of cases and deaths so so Greece's shut the borders to two to keep out these areas you can see the other areas with North Macedonia and Romania Bulgaria or all the curves are really going the wrong way so but interestingly with Serbia it was one of the ones that is allowed to go to the EU you'll remember they've the EU has declared 15 countries that can go there and UK has also declared countries that are allowed in without the 14 days quarantine and Serbia is one of those so so I think this is something to watch the Serbian testing positivity rates about five just over five percent so and as I said I'm not going to go through all the countries this week I'm just going to be a bit more mindful of time but just to to make the point that we're seeing a lot more focused lock downs now Lester lockdown on June 30 so you can see there there's London those Birmingham so Lester's Lester's here so it's right in the middle of the of the country and and they got to not a lot of thing it was around 500 cases of we're having so so anyway this this got locked down and you can see where we're back to those familiar beer streets what else there's also one in Spain this and if there's anyone that wants to criticize my pronunciation go for it the the Syria region of Li a de lis either and so that's that's over here and this area this is La Marina in in Galicia which is a beach resort so they're both been locked down so you get increasing cases clearly people are looking to have a much smarter shutdown it'll be a better shutdown shouldn't really be in the playbook but unfortunately once you get overwhelmed or you're heading towards overwhelmed hospitals overwhelmed public health systems you can't do the contact tracing anymore you testing capacity is is used up then you then you really got no choice so that's and probably earlier is better if you if you're seeing the trend this is a focus lockdown as I say in Melbourne these are the the blocks and there's though there were about 3,000 people across these blocks that will lock down now they've they've done a lot of testing some of them are are really quite negative so they've unlocked them and just put them on the melbourne lockdown and they've got different scales of lockdown so nonetheless that's what's happening in melbourne and for those of you don't know it's right down the the the southeastern corner of australia and you can see the live lockdown i heard someone on the it's actually all the all the problems are around here much more inner city but i'm not sure how they arrived at where the borderline would be but i know this this people are the people on this side of the water and not as happy as the people on this side of the water who are not on lockdown and of course india and don't even ask me to pronounce that but anyway it's in it's in kerala they've called this a triple lockdown and triple lockdown really it's it's interesting because there's been some other Indian towns sort of lockdowns and and they call it this triple one so so level one is sort of general containment it just stops movement of of all people in the area so you can see the area here and so there are there are checkpoints and there's there's closed roads as there might be an area where there's only one Road in and one Road out and there's barricades and police on on the other roads so so they're really trying to stop total movement then there's the movement of the specific within a specific geographical area and those areas might have had cases they might have contacts there this sort of quarantine zones so there's an extra special sort of lockdown for those areas and then lockdown three is is really at that household level where there might be contacts and there's extra special attention paid to to those so it's it's an interesting concept I certainly don't have any problems with it it's it's I guess a smart lockdown so back over to Singapore now here's out the three curbs I show every week imported cases remain negligible community cases well there's a little blip but we we would have expected that you can see it's still around twenty a day and the dormitory residents are slowly making their way down linked versus unlinked so you can see there's these are the linked cases and these are the the unlinked cases Green being being being gnf work permits so so the yellow ones are the Singaporeans and permanent residents so but the main point is there's been a little blip up I think it's a blip we can definitely tolerate but but where it takes where where it goes is is is the question and we'll have more answers to that over the next weeks and months and the final slide again this is where we sit in Singapore at the moment there's there's one one lost my mouth you know there's there's one case in ICU there's 214 in general Ward's across the country so that's that's been fairly flat in in care facilities or all the isolation facilities that have been built are starting to become underutilized I think we got to 20,000 beds to bed capacity so so that's coming down and the total of total number of deaths we haven't had a death for a little while now so thanks David back to you great deal thanks very much I want to remind you to send you questions in the country where you're watching via the Q&A tool at the bottom of your zoom screen again and it's my honor to have the opportunity to introduce our guest expert tonight dr. Cornelia Qi she is head and senior consultant Department of psychological medicine National University Hospitals senior consultant and director women's emotional health service and head in clinical senior lecturer department of psychological medicine young rule in School of Medicine National University of Singapore the title of our talk this evening is mental health issues surrounding COBIT 19 over to you Cornelia alright hello everybody everybody thank you so much for tuning in today I practice psychiatry at the National University Hospital for the last 20 years so I was here when SAS h1n1 and MERS hits Singapore I remember was a really dark time because as you know many of those who are affected with healthcare workers and you actually had some some of our best and our brightest passed away due to stylist morale was really low and I think our mental health was really affected we learned a lot from that and the other virus outbreaks over the years but it's clear that they haven't completely prepared us for this virus well we've learned a lot about its physical effects on the human body we are only just beginning to see how it affects the mental health of us as individuals and as species but there's so much to mental health during this pandemic that can I can only skim the surface so I decided to divide my talk into four different sections for the direct effects of Kovach 19 our population response to disasters what we can do as a population and personal mental health strategies okay so of course there are direct effects from health anxiety for 1:7 for others and when we it was becoming clear that that this virus was spreading among the population we were asked to reduce the number of cases so that we would have fewer patients coming to the the hospital and we need enough have really worried about that because we had a lot of psychiatric patients who who were deathly scared of coming to the hospital also the if you recall there a lot of fear of unknown aspects of how the virus spread and what its characteristics were and I think I was a lot more of that at the beginning although even now I think that it's still controversial whether or not the virus might be spread by an airborne root so there's still quite a lot of things that we are still learning then we had the effect from the lockdown or circuit breaker measures that they were called in Singapore and indirectly and this is one one of the things that's going to be having great impact on us is the financial and economic implications of unemployment difficulty with with one's business or maintaining one's home okay and then in what happened in Singapore is that Singapore school shifted to full home-based learning for two months well yes for two months first it was home based learning and then they went into school holidays so suddenly parents of young children had to cope with the kids being at home and since some of them were also working from home they had to juggle both the kids homework and supervising them as well as doing they are trying to do that work so I still remember I had a patient come in and the first thing she did the moment she came in was to burst into tears that was awful she had three kids under under nine and it was the rolling all over her and she was trying to do her work and she was she's just in tears okay so there are a lot of things that happens when when we're trying to do things at home and when we have a lot of distractions and there's no no boundaries at all really okay next I wanna shift gears a little bit and talk about direct early effects on people who actually get Kove in nineteen well the majority may well be asymptomatic but we do know now that there's a phenomenon called silent hypoxia where patients can have very low oxygen saturation levels without too much discomfort and for these patients because they're in a constant hypoxic state they could be having direct effects of that on their brains and therefore presenting with confusion or odd behavior so maybe that's something we need to look at also what some of the studies are coming up with is that there appears to be an awesome ear or the inability to smell in a majority of patients and this is something that I think we've got to look out for because it's one of those under rates that disabilities or problems that patients may have which we we don't give as much credit to compared to sales among with blindness or hearing impairment more on that later so it started became becoming quite clear that neurologic features were a part of the the picture when you had a severe infection so for patients who were in the hospital due to a RTS a large proportion of them had agitation some more had confusion and a post discharge about a third was still affected also after the the results of the recent trial that showed that dexamethasone might be helpful for severe infections we do know that steroids are associated with a variety of psychiatric in presenting Asians maybe see insomnia elation depression and once in a while Frank psychosis so that's another thing that we will be looking out for for these patients in terms of late effects I'd like to make a comparison with SARS and MERS because these are the most recent corona viral attacks that we've had so studied by Rogers that came out in May this year showed that during the acute phase of the illness about a third had confusion depression anxiety and but four in ten with insomnia and after infection about three years later about 15 to 15 percent had depressed mood or anxiety about a third had traumatic memories but the good news was that you know maybe about 77% were back at work after three years so there is some lingering morbidity but some ability to get back to a level of function okay in terms of the direct and involvement of the brain this is this is something that is becoming pretty obvious a very recent study has shown that there's a definite neuronal damage in severe and post-mortem cases of Kovac 90 and that is something that we really need to look out for so perhaps what we do need to do is to follow up with non-coated 19 sufferers over the long term especially those who had a RDS or and into ICU to make sure that they are not having long-term effects more on their nightmares talking about about 50% of patients even if they are having very mild symptoms may have anosmia they may not actually notice it but on a sniff test actually most of them will have complete anosmia or a reduced ability to smell food and if this is long-lasting then this is really going to impact the ability to to enjoy one's food and that's something that's you do three times a day or so and more so that would really impact one's quality of life okay so in terms of very late effects it's likely that we need to look up for late neuropsychiatry syndromes and another thing which kind of made me think about is that in psychiatry where we know that schizophrenia is associated with viral illness viral exposure in utero and this was an early article in 1988 that showed that an unfinished birth cohorts we had a higher rate of individuals developing schizophrenia during the 1957 a to type a to influenza epidemic so I'm not saying that this is definitely going to happen about this it's for sure something that we need to watch out for especially given that the number of patients getting covered 19 is so high across the world okay now a little bit about health care workers so based on our experience in Singapore with previous viral epidemics we are much better prepared this time so this is a study that was done by Benjamin Town at all in Singapore surveyed early during the pandemic and showed that there was about 8% with depression 11 percent anxiety and about 6 percent pts symptoms and this compares well with 21 percent morbidity for those health care workers who were surveyed during sauce and a PDS symptoms which were higher okay almost interesting about this current paper is that if you were medical which they defined as a doctor or a nurse then your chances of having anxiety is actually half that then compared if you were non-medical so executives or perhaps the the cleaning staff or airline health so this is an interesting finding so we really should look into into this and just bear in mind that perhaps even though we make they may be frontline there are maybe other reasons for this increased anxiety okay what do we know we know that the health mental health of healthcare workers is much much worse when healthcare systems are overwhelmed and especially when they have to make distressing ethical choices such as do we admit a 40 year old or the 70 year old to our last date in Nice you what if that 40 year olds a drug addict versus if the 70 oh is a recently retired eminent professor of economics let's see so you know going back to philosophy and the trolley bus problem that they're just so many combinations and it's really difficult to have to make these these life and death decisions okay so for healthcare start had to had to do this in Italy during the height of their pandemic you can see that the pts symptoms are so much higher so much so many more post-traumatic symptoms and a higher rate of depressed mood and anxiety now going on to migrant workers so we have 300 23,000 migrant workers which are housed in dormitories so it's almost as if there are like a lower middle-income country house within a high-income country for the most part they live apart and socialized apart and of course with the with increase in numbers that exploded in Singapore they have had to be housed in CCF's and and special dormitories to try and contain the virus so how is it different for them of course they have to fear losing their jobs being deported having language barriers being separated from their family in some cases overcrowding and with it misinformation some of them actually very early on even thought that they were going to be shepherded onto a ship to be killed so the think to note that is that a lot of these studies actually may have been in some ways a convenient sampling or particularly special groups that that might have been easier to sample and they may not be representative of the poor and marginalized groups especially so groups that may not have access to social media or the internet or a stuck at home and we also have to think of social and economic health as being very closely related to mental health so for those who are abused the poor and those are special needs I think we do need to really look out for them next in terms of the population response to disasters this is a very well-known chart that shows that when there is a impact due to a disaster at first there is a heroic response and there is a honeymoon where there's a lot of community cohesion but what is clear is that inevitably there is a period of disillusionment especially if they are trigger events and this can happen for for quite a while so after a single event such as a flood let's say or an earthquake the disillusionment phase can come in months after and lasts for up to a year and then after the anniversary some reconstruction occurs however what happens is that with with this virus we are seeing repeater waves so what we are going to see probably is a prolonged disaster not a single event and it's going to have a very long mental health tale okay this is a little bit of a switch and this is it's been very interesting really just noticing how how on on one hand people get together and they really pull through but at the same time there's a lot of tribalism that it's constantly rearing its ugly it and I think this is for me as a psychiatrist not surprising at all it's no it's no coincidence that as children we are brought up learning about good versus bad and and and that there's always a black is a white an evil stepmother and a good princess and that's because we think in terms of black and white it's also well ingrained in the human psyche to think in terms of tribes so as an in-group it promotes bonding and it helps us to perform better with our in-group and to you know sort of be a bit suspicious of potentially hostile out groups and when that happens then it's very easy especially when we're stressed to move in this tribalism mode it's really important though to bear in mind that oftentimes when tribalism is rearing its head it's our limbic system or emotional brains that are coming in rather than a more rational neocortex so if you find yourself thinking very clearly that this I am I am right and you are wrong and try and put it push it through your down cortex okay we're going to mental health strategies for the population so this is Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs it's right for me little lots of people basically it's a it's a pyramid we're starting from the bottom you look at physiological needs such as food water shelter and sleep and then you move up along the knee the the levels of needs and finally becomes self actualized I just want to concentrate on the bottom three physiological needs they're unique because we have to keep returning to them followed by safety and security needs and then love and belonging okay so very importantly one must meet basic needs and I would include maybe the internet in in terms of physiological needs almost all right so what happened is on February 7th we all know that it's Singapore das kann Orange was declared and then suddenly everybody kind of rushed to the supermarkets and started hoarding on things such as daily necessities and toilet paper and this is really the panic that the basic needs were not going to be met yeah so I saw that two days later our prime minister actually had to come and reassure the population that there was really no need to worry about the basic needs and I think this was a very good step recognizing that there were these needs that really need to be reassured so in terms of tribalism it's often about fight or flight but in terms of what else we can do as a population the other coping that we can do is to tend and befriend and I'm so glad to see that in nationally a national care hotline has been set up such that if you are worried or stressed during this time you can actually call for help in the NHS we also have hotlines and support groups for healthcare workers and as well as for for staff just like to bring a little bit of a detour to this little town called Rosetta and the Rosetta effect so what happened was in the 1960s it was noticed that this little Italian town Italian American town rather and much lower cardiovascular mortality rates compared to the nearby towns and they realized that actually there's a very high social cohesion they shared the festivals and had a lot of informal networks those were often open the houses were closely spaced and neighbors would often pop over to each other and share food and gossip well what happened is that and they were followed up over 50 years and as the population and became more Americanized as I said well social cohesion went down and mortality rate started approaching those of the rest of the neighbor towns so I mean it's not just about physical health but I think in terms of the mental health of the town it also sort of went along the same way hmm so this is what a new HS has been doing for for the migrant workers looking after their basic needs as well as their social social needs as well and connecting with them and giving them information largely though in the dorms this this has been taken up by the NGOs so for example Health Service got a Tele friending service where volunteers who can speak the local language of the migrant workers will speak to the will speak to the the patients but at the same time getting supervision from volunteer psychiatrists so this is the paper on recommendations for improving the mental health of healthcare workers it's it's really not rocket science clear communications important adequate PPE so this was not not provided in some countries likely Singapore is not one of them adequate rest and practical and psychological support okay finally into the mental health strategies these are the things that we are prone to misinformation unpredictability social isolation and a lack of control so in terms of misinformation obviously we should have accurate information and I would just say why not go for the Goldilocks effect basically if you want your information make sure it is not too little not too much not too hot and not too cold okay next for mindfulness what is mindfulness meditation it can be defined as the focused awareness on the present in a non-judgmental way and if you remember this dramatic Thai boys who are stuck in a cave in 2018 with their soccer coach for I think it was for 18 days before they were all rescued and I think part of the reason they actually managed to survive was really because their coach taught them how to meditate and therefore they stayed calm they used up less oxygen and they were not panicking or you know just just losing it so this is a very important thing I think when we are facing situations where things are very uncertain and we can't really control things I mean what else can you do focus on the present so this reminds me oh yes so there is actually increasing evidence space for this being able to actually change our brains this reminds me of a birthday card I got some time ago forget about the past you can't change it forget about the future it's not here yet forget about the present I didn't get you one but seriously this is what I tell my patients if you have a very active brain that's really overthinking and worrying too much about the future all the time then you're prone to anxiety likewise if you're thinking too much about the past and really preoccupy all the time then you're going to be more likely to develop depression and this is where mindfulness comes in because now you can there's a tool for you to focus more on the present and change your neuronal networks to not overthink either into the future not the past finally oh not finally third thing social isolation so finding new ways to connect this is an interesting paper I found where they studied different regions in Italy and they found that the regions which had the highest spread of Kovac 19 also had the smallest household size and a higher number of nursing homes so in fact social connectedness was not a risk factor for spreading kovat 19 in fact it was the opposite okay lots of control so you generally for high-functioning adults we're used to a high level of control and now in this pandemic of the fields that we can't control many things so the best thing to do then is to focus on what you can control and in self-determination theory I found this good when you're choosing things that you can control think of things that you feel competent in that you can feel that you have some freedom in and which helps you feel related having said that if you're introvert then chances are you'll be happier with with hobbies that don't require so much relatedness so actually there are a lot of things that can be done and it's up to you to pick and choose something that actually makes you happy my other advice also would be to have as many tools in your toolbox as you can if you only rely on exercise for example and you're not allowed to exercise or you develop an injury and you have nothing else to fall back on then it becomes a problem so develop more Skills more hobbies and more ways of coping finally I think that there's another thing we can do and that's to choose gratitude so focusing on the things that we can be grateful for and there's there's more evidence coming in now that actually changes our brains as well so looking at the silver linings I think it's been very helpful my patients teach me a lot and actually I was quite surprised when I to feel my patients didn't actually feel that kovat 19 was a big deal they said well I'm at home now and I've always liked to be at home and now I'm actually normal and others were saying you know I can spend more time with my family or I can actually focus on the important things in life and that ends my talk thank you very much Thank You Cornelia we very much appreciate that time is short we do want you to send in your questions we're going to try to get to as many as we can let me start off with the question from Tana Lee hoon who states that lockdown measures have seen mothers having to juggle work from home and organizing their children's schooling from home what words of advice do you have for us yes I think we need to involve fathers more now a recent study that came out from the center for family and population research in NUS that showed that working mothers spend twice as much time than compared to fathers on weekdays so you know I think men can step up more excellent and there's a follow-up question do not I mean don't children benefit from having a loving parents at home with them during these trying times there's a lot of stress it's better than them being in a place where maybe people are a bit more impersonal such as where school oh yeah but you know schools an important place to socialize as well especially for teens yeah okay Kenneth you asks what's your professional opinion is to the ministerial task force decision to classify psychological services as non-essential during the circuit breaker period I got phone calls from my psychologist friends in private practice the night it happened is it what we're non-essential oh I had so many patients we're not doing well because they could not see that their counselors and their mental health practitioners in private I think that was a misstep policy okay I assume the the organisation the professional organizations in Singapore able to convey that message was sephorus lee and that's why that that was eventually reversed how do we in to bill individualize the message regarding the availability of mental health screening and mental health care to be more acceptable in light of the cultural religious and or ethnic group differences in how mental health issues are perceived this is gonna be a tough one it has to be a whole of society thing and you know I was just chatting with my foot my patient today and she's saying that can I get insurance if I if I if I apply for it now cuz I was I was denied it when I when I was hospitalized three years ago and I said you know honestly our local insurers are not really very enlightened and that is a tragedy it's it's got to be not just not just mental health advocates I think visions that keep on pushing the envelope so what is the what is the baseline rate of mental health issues in Singapore I know in the United States is around 17 to 20 percent and I know after after Katrina it went up to 55 percent the hurricane so what is our baseline rate baseline rate according to our single Singapore mental health study that was done a few years ago what depression anxiety if I'm not wrong at around five percent but that's not lifetime prevalence that was quite prevalence okay how would you compare the efficacy of face-to-face delivery of mental health mental health care versus virtual delivery well their pros and cons both ways if you if it's compared with no mental health delivery then it's definitely ideal but there are problems with mental health delivery via you know tele consult or video consult I think some of the nuances don't quite come across and suddenly if the patient might be at risk for self-harm or suicide then that could be a problem so we always have to make sure that the patient is likely to be safe before we start the console most countries do not have adequate mental health personnel to meet everyone's needs and as such the primary caregivers are often providing screening and mental health care you have a few simple tips for primary care providers who may be in a poly clinic with only 5 to 15 minutes with each patient certain minutes this is asking a lot I think that's a tough one I think sometimes it's about relationship and it's just showing that you care as a person and you're listening actually not not enough people listen so if you're able to listen I think that was that's a great help already we're doing more telling and incorporating that into our lives is there a looming crisis from social media reliance you mentioned earlier that that one of the basic necessities is the internet but does the reliance on social media cause us to have disintegration and socialization well I think this is a complex one human beings are are generally meant to be social and I think that the early studies generally showed that if you spend more time on social media than it was correlated with more mental health problems I think it's actually much more complex than that I think for some people it can be a real lifeline and I think society is evolving to to socialize and to reach out and to find very positive things using social media ething has asked what are the top three silver linings you see arising from kovat 19 for the mental healthcare sector if you can firstly the chance to simplify one's life so I used to travel very often and when I couldn't do that anymore I had to find books and then now I'm happily traveling to you know 18th century Russia or Japan in my mind that's one so simplifying I think the other thing is to get back to nature one of the things I really really enjoyed about the last day of the circuit breaker was how blue the skies were so I think getting back to nature is another one and the last one is I think on if you can connecting with the people in your house I've got two teenage girls and we taught that my husband I taught them mahjong and we had many happy evenings playing mahjong nice Joyce tio has asked a doctor Qi what stage of the disaster response chart is Singapore at now what can we expect in the delusion Minh stage so that chart is for a single event so what we're really doing is very uncharted - really and I think the disillusionment is just gonna go up and down with time and it's gonna be dragged out quite a bit mm-hmm okay and just last question is looking back in the last six months if you could have two wishes for mental health services or support in Singapore what what would you have in place now that maybe we don't I think maybe more more of a set up for for tele visits or tele consulting and the other thing would be just less stigma yeah thank you so much we're gonna where time is short over to you Dale that's quick okay so it's a slightly truncated version tonight David because I we predicted that we might might run out of time so I've just got got a couple tonight the first one the and Cornelia actually mentioned that does this whole business about is it airborne and and I've got a little story about drones in South Korea after that so so I think it will remember this picture this was in in the outbreak movie when Dustin Hoffman looked up at a at an event and said it's gone airborne and I think it's a hallmark moment in the movie and and I think that's what a lot of people think about but it's obviously a lot more complicated than that when so when we are considering whether something's airborne it comes down to the the size of the particle but as a rule of thumb if it's if it's under five microns in size that's five thousandth of a millimeter then it's capable of being suspended in air but but bigger ones bigger particles tend to be droplets that fall to the ground and that's whether the one to two meters comes from and it relates to the precautions we take when we say one to two meters when we say surgical mask is is adequate most of the time then then this is really the the presumption so so it is quite important to understand whether it is airborne or not so as I think most people would know there was a an article published in CID during the week and a letter also to the New York Times by the same authors claiming 239 people that had were wanting to put pressure on WH o to admit that it was that it was airborne so let me just take you through that the the people that wrote the letter though there were a few epidemiologists and public health people but but by and large they were their ventilation experts their aero engineers they work in laboratories and and look at air flow and and droplets and and suspended particles in the air and things like that so we're trying to work out if these particles can can spread long distances so you can see in this little graphic that obviously with generally a movement if it was suspended in the air that it could go really tens of meters so so they're in how do you prove it and you can do this two ways you can do this by epidemiologically and you can also do it viral aaja Klee now let's let's start with the epidemiologic side so we know that the vast majority of people that get covert get it from close contact and the and the reproductive number is generally around 2.5 now measles and chickenpox are the two famous viruses for for being airborne their reproductive number is you know 10 12 15 and that's because it's airborne it can go long distances and people can get the disease without having any close contact with someone with the disease so already that reproductive number is starting to give us some hints that that it's it's mostly droplet spread now there are there any examples of people that have got the disease with no contact now that's possible there's there's some publications of restaurants and singing events where where so many people got it indeed even super spreading events where you might argue that it must be airborne because it was a super spreader event and so many so many people got the disease and maybe singing does have the capacity to create these very small aerosols but unfortunately you can't remove the concept of fomites being contaminated so this is the environment so this is where we say when we're when we're deciding is on trans on transmission based precautions is it contact is a droplet is it airborne and we we generally go with the theory that it's contact and droplet therefore wash your hands keep your distance wear a mask particularly if you can't keep that distance so um did some of these super spreading events restaurants and singing events did they have environmental contamination and that's how the transmission happened and that we can't be a hundred percent sure of but this is one of the pieces of evidence cited by the the the airborne protagonists so so that would be be the first thing now we know it's never been cultured from an aerosol okay with the found PCR positive but it's never been cultured as opposed to other viruses which you can culture from the aerosols so therefore is it just fragments of the virus in in the in the aerosol we know that when we swab throats towards that the the end of the illness that we can't culture it but we can detect that the PCR can be positive and we can detect we can detect viral RNA so um that's an important point to know that it's actually never been cultured despite a lot of efforts having said that it's not easy to culture era sauce so so so that again is not a definite no it can't be aerosol spread so on so the the w-h-o has basically always said that we believe that it's mostly contact and and droplet spread we won't exclude that it could be aerosol spread but with that R naught and with that epidemiology and with the fact that we can't culture it or at least can culture it easily then then at best I would argue that that airborne precaution is is unlikely or is is a lower driver of the outbreak we know there's aerosol generating procedures so if you're having a tube put down your throat or dental work or something like that then that can generate aerosols um but outside of the hospital we really don't don't see it as a as a big driver although that what that's what all the fuss is about with with a school of thought being that it is a big driver it's definitely the arguments definitely not over yet but but that's where we stand and I hope that explanation helps people out there I just wanted to to go to to a video now so this is a very neat video that that I came across during the week it's it's in South Korea these are drones choreographed amazingly the the actual video is a little bit longer so thank you Joe for editing it to just capture the the key bits but I'll I'll hand over to you now Joe to show the video please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some things just make you speechless right yeah anyway the whole video takes 11 minutes the way they moved through all the the virus on the front of the masks and the the social distancing moving the two heads away on the hand-washing and then the thanks to health care workers apparently no one in Seoul knew that was happening they just they just did it so anyway I don't know I've turned into the video guy we've that's three in a row wasn't supposed to be it but I don't know what's gonna happen from one week to the next but anyway back to you David thanks alright thank you very much do that's superb yeah let me just provide a brief summary of tonight the key points we learned that there'll be a long mental health tale as consequences of Koba 19 due to the biologic effects of the viruses the virus and the drugs are used to treat it as well as social isolation and the economic impact this is having on us there should be more discussion an action to alleviate the disproportionate responsibilities of working mothers are experiencing compared to the working father's during this pandemic we learned that and finally foreign workers and health care

200,sT_yuUAzMAA,The Workers' Party,Re-Imagining A Post-COVID Singapore (WP Youth Wing Webinar - 13 June 2020),2020-06-14T08:05:04Z,,"so just move on to the proper yeah so hello everyone welcome to the third webinar organized by the what is party you swing on of it 19 our previous sessions were well received and we thank everyone for your feedback response in this third episode our panelists will discuss their hopes and vision for post colvett Singapore conversation across generations reimagining our future together so you'll see that you know we have our panelists comprised of people from across various age groups and also moving on please post your questions on zoom' using the Q&A function on Facebook using the comments once the live stream is up we will try to take as many of your questions as possible but since time is limited we can only engage some points about the post Kovac team although zoom allows two-way video and audio you'll be leaving all audience members cameras and mics switched off both for your privacy and to avoid unwanted interruptions you'll not be able to turn the cameras and mics on if you have any questions for the panelists please use zooms Q&A function you'll find a Q&A button at the bottom of the zoom window and you may click it and then type your question in the Q&A window the entire session is being recorded and will be available on our Facebook page for you to catch up on your Facebook page on your own base before we move on to the inter introduction proper allow me to present findings from a survey from the youth wing which we conducted a few days ago so what we sent to everyone is a premise for the survey was with a backdrop of kovaydin doose new norms and looming general elections it is perhaps timely for Singaporeans who reimagine the Singapore we want to bill so what are some policy directions we need to reexamine or sacred cows that need slaughtering so what are those practices we need to keep and so I'll show the survey results okay everyone see the slides okay so this is the survey they were conducted so the questions we asked were what areas do you think Singapore does best at we hadn't ranked the top three what areas do you think Singapore could do better in ranking the top three and what are your hopes for Singapore's future so for the first two questions the options given were civil liberties cost of living education system environment government accountability health care housing inequality and jobs images so a total of 728 respondents over the path over four days in the past week so just 99 percent of respondents were Singapore citizens and it can note that majority of respondents were above 40 yeah so we assign points to each policy category based on people's rankings so for example first choice we have three point waste three points second choice base two points and the choice B is one point for each cap degree the rank points were summed up and expressed as a percentage of the total number of points in the survey so you can see based on the overall positive results what areas do you think for the first question what is the thing that Singapore does best at so the top three was the education system health care and environment and what areas do you think Singapore can do better in ranked my relative importance for three were possibly being civil liberties and freedoms and government accountability so in terms of age wise quantitative results as you can see based on the age groups they are pretty spreche it really depends like for example if you see some of these sediments may be shed across the different age groups especially when it comes to what areas do you think's in what could do better in when it comes to government accountability for example the ranking the relative importance was pretty much almost the same across the three age groups and we actually sent actually question number three right it was actually an open-ended question so we actually prepared what cloud based on multiple open-ended responses we have receive on what our hopes for Singapore's future so it comes with many of the words many more the more popular words include a hope transparency accountability which are pretty much some of some of them at least in line with the more popular options that were mentioned earlier so I'll move on to the actual introduction proper so pass the time to Dennis to move on with introducing the panelists we have today and then we'll move on with the Q&A sessions as well yeah I Denise i hi everyone ladies and gentlemen a very

our audience now we are you take questions or also for those who are with us on the webinar please submit your question um a and our team will be quality collecting these questions and panelists okay without further ado let me invite our first speaker our first panelist sign-in to speak hello can everyone hear me yeah clear okay so I think this pandemic experience has felt unprecedented in many ways I personally never thought I would see the cross very close or have a big full school but this happened right and I think because of the weight the weight feels I think of all of us believe that somehow our life will change in some fundamental way because you know things can't be the same as they were before the pandemic to put a problem is that you know the many views out there about what can change or what should change and you know for example like the migrants say this better work at the Singapore some people I think would love to go back to the status quo some people believe that changes in the way that dogs are built would be enough and other people believe that we need deep systemic changes and I think you know these things can all happen at the same time right and so there's gonna be conflict I think and conversation of ideas post pandemic right and for me today we're didn't talk about what I personally think should all could happen I think a bit about maybe a way to think about our own views that to make it easier to find common ground maybe or at least be a little bit less angry at people who disagree with us and the central idea is about storytelling right and how essentially we're all storytellers and everything you believe in at some level are just narratives and that maybe we should therefore not be too attached to a particle story just because that it wasn't we ourselves believe in and what a new mistress is quite a broad thing right it's a belief systems and most of reality that allow us to make sense of the world and when we share them and believe in them together as communities and we are able to build what is sometimes called into subjective realities that are quite powerful turkishwin you've all horribly somebody called a lot right he likes to give example of chimpanzees and how you can never get a chimpanzee to do something for a banana in the afterlife also give you a better another in exchange for pieces of paper to have no real value and yet for us humans we are ready willing to do these things right you do things for religions for money and you know is this ability to believe in things that don't exist that allows us to go you know nuclear bombs and big mega cities and our collective belief in things like money religions nation-states and corporations things they don't exist in a real non-human world but true a collective belief and imagination become very real and very tangible things and of course we're telling stories about ourselves in the world we also has become the main characters in the stories right so as the protagonist we are the heroes of our journey and it was very easy to understand why we would think that anybody who disagrees reverse must be in some way evil or ignorant or stupid but so my hope is that by realizing this by being aware that this kind of storytelling is going on all the time then we are able to realize that there is maybe no objective truth out there you know about whether we should be socialists or capitalists whether we a conservative outside of human needs and our own biological makeup none of these things really really exist on that you know to the universe in itself and although some people might think that this makes everything seem meaningless I'm not sure that it does right because I think that people human beings are able to understand for example that we are all mortal they're all gonna die one day and yet we still have no we don't we don't all succumb to existential threat and we still are able to their ambitions and dreams and desires to you know write books attend webinars and you know get haircuts so I think that we are able to both believe it both realize the things I've made up but also still believe in them you have to know that things are meaningless and still finding very meaning for my own example would be football right when I play stop in my friends we look at it from her extra point of view is just bunch of people running around trying to put a wrong I'm checking to a rectangular space which makes no real sense but yet we find it really enjoyable and you know really meaningful to us so I'm hoping that but having this critical awareness get the stories that we believe in that we care about I really just as good or bad as tyonne's and other people who disagree with us or tone or even opposed to us what they believe and care about right they'll be able to on the one hand fight for the things you believe in right to be able to try to shape the course corporate banking world the way we want well realizing that the people who are against this are also doing exactly the same thing right we all living inside stories that we all try and tell ourselves stories and trying to persuade other people of our stories and maybe this awareness will allow us to become less attached to a particular story while at the same time making us realized that we all have this common ground Australian telling and that could be a way to start to understand each other and work together to do a better future that's it Thank You sunny now may I invite sassy to share with us his thoughts thank you first and foremost thank you to the Workers Party youth wing for inviting me to this to this panel I I i I'm still pinching myself I I can't believe I'm on the same panel as marble man Sonny knew it's a such an honor to share the panel and it's appropriate I think that he talked about historically because I do have a story to tell and it's a it's a story of reimagining ourselves it's always a good time to reimagine ourselves and the pandemic is a particularly good time for it the ancient Greeks thought that plagues and pestilences were a sign that something is rotten in the stage a sign from the gods that the rulers had erred a failure of leadership that a new dispensation is necessary we too have been laid bare in the blink of an eye we have moved from gold standard to cautionary tale from one nation one people to two communities low wage workers and the rest and despite the spin of the spin doctors the virus has prevailed we are one people the powerless of the disabled the elderly poor lesbians and gays and queer and transgender people and our non-binary brothers and sisters but to include them all in the story to include them all as one we must reimagine ourselves reimagine forging a new conscience for the nation and here's how I propose we do it give the arts a place at the main table stop treating the ass like an instrument for other ends economic social political the arts are not about utility or usefulness that rubbish will lead to the bankruptcy of the imagination soon we won't be able to tell art apart from propaganda and from feel-good school assembly songs the arts are essential to our lives the lifeblood of our imagination it feeds our souls is part of our very being treated as it is treated as a capital good as we do health security utilities and water art is not about the number of performances or exhibitions it's not about buildings and institutions and burgeoning bureaucracies our resides in the people in our capacity to both make it and receive it and if it matters at all it matters because of the people second point I want to make is resist racism in Singapore acknowledge the failure of multiculturalism we aren't a multicultural society we are multicultural only in name there's no understanding about the subtleties of difference of race color and Creed for all our racial harmony days and interfaith dialogues and our unanimous love for roti prata and chicken rice our neighbours mostly remain strangers they are culturally alien to most of us and to many of us many of us still lack empathy and even tolerance for others we are not a multicultural society we're a plural moral cultural society a moral culturalism conceived concocted and dictated by the state and that's why we have never learned as individuals to sit with our discomfort of other nurse as earnest is this comforting color creed body order dietary preferences mannerisms speech whenever it is other it is dis company but we have never learned to sit with that discomfort to ask questions of that discomfort to engage the other and find a way of living of connecting with others this is a failure of our multiculturalism in Singapore finally to resist racism we must acknowledge majoritarian privilege this is the unearned advantages benefits and access to resources and power that accrue to those born in the majority majoritarian privilege is both the legacy and the cause of racism majoritarian privilege is the reason why regardless of race language and religion could still turn out to be a lie in Singapore and we have never acknowledged it we have never talked about it and it's about time that we do this finally I would say that we need to imagine a new compact between citizens and the state and I would urge you to start thinking about this new compact by thinking about article 14 of the Constitution every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms and all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations many of us are surprised that freedom of speech and expression is actually enshrined in our Constitution it is understandable these rights have had the stuffing eaten out of them by serial legislation enacted by successive Parliament's restricting conditioning and limiting them to the point of oblivion every Singaporean child will tell you those rights are not an absolute will for our children to well to forget that these rights do exist and as citizens we are entitled to these rights if not absolutely then at least fully and completely we forget to teach our children that it is only the contingency of politics that denies these rights to us and we can reimagine our politics we can change it thank you Thank You sassy next I like to invite to you to shave ass abuse thank you for that and thank you for inviting me on this panel I think I'm incredibly honored to be speaking outside you know amazing people and I think following sassy and sunny scheme of narratives as a fresh Environmental Studies graduate and an environmental and activist perhaps then this is my narrative and I also see that in the Sophie environment ranks quite highly on what people think the government has done but I'll first recommend you to check out as you climb at Reggie's green watch people and I think in looking at reimagining from my lens I hope I can show that environmental and social issues are deeply intertwined and these issues are very much political so firstly the Cova 19 pandemic has a very grave socio-economic impacts and I think we see that and many academics civil society groups communities and individuals have all these bills glaring errors that we perhaps have ignored and stepped up being to raise awareness pull resources but most importantly engage in discourse that takes aim and the structural changes can be very badly need to see and commit as a public health crisis comes with a lot of great policy challenges because as Singapore is trying to control the health impacts of this crisis we are also now looking at economic recovery and I think as the title of this webinar states you know instead of starting to tweak issues here and there we need to really look at reimagining what a post kovetz Singapore in terms of our society and economy needs to look like so about recovery I'm actually now agreeing with this ego business article that does talk on green recovery post Kovach and in dealing with all the different fall outs in the short term immediate stimulus measures definitely must prioritize saving lives and minimizing the pandemics heavy toll on our society and likelihoods we know that their lives at stake they need immediate attention and saving but moving forward policymakers and business leaders must work to ensure that where possible green initiatives such as low-carbon investments and building societal resilience integrated into our long-term recovery plans hence you know this makes us think about what kind of stimulus and recovery packages do we need to envision in a postcode well that will help us build this resilience for future health or environmental crisis as a society so speaking of this one example that I wanted to bring up was the emerging stronger task force that is currently made about 15 industry leaders who are from the petrochemicals the banks real estate and every businesses and these this task force actually then feeds suggestion into the future economy Council that looks at the next phase of industry transformation and I think very recently this task force has been criticized to be lacking diversity so in talking about diversity I remember and piece of vellum and nmp and young raised questions in Parliament about how it lacks diversity in gender in race and socio-economic representation and even industry representation so Miss and Young said that if we want a flexible and responsive society that is able to absorb shocks and rebound from them I believe we must recalibrate current power structures for a fair economy that considers key stakeholders and I cannot mixes them equally furthermore I remember the future economy counsel being mentioned in the budget and was a little disheartened that there wasn't plans or priorities on sustainable transitions or sustainability even though these are things that could be included in their other plans so it just seems to me that we fall short on addressing the climate crisis in trying to future-proof our economy and society so for me I see that the climate crisis and the Kovach pandemic i extremely linked and they are more than enough Studies on this and these crises are going to occur in very different ways you look at swarms fires natural disasters and here may be extreme weather patterns so a bunch of us climate activists recently published an article on continental ins that provide an overview of climate related parliamentary questions and one interesting question that stuck out to me was one which asked about whether we could consider replacing HDB doors to a stronger model it there's been an increased volatility of our weather patterns so I think from this as a youth you know the climate crisis has very real impacts and it hits very different people differently it is a bread and butter issue and it's impacts are also very closely linked to socio-economic inequalities healthcare and jobs so when we think about setting policies and plans for the future we need to think about why they screen and that is just an equitable so as a youth you know growing up in Singapore and in this pandemic and you know in the background of a bigger climate crisis and extremely fearful about the Singapore that I will be living in in the next 40 years because the consequences of inaction now will be heavily felt by me and my peers and that's why I also think we see a rise in youth activism in various social issues it's a very scary time to be growing up in and the climate crisis plus you know as much as we talk about how different people have different ways of what we've been moving forward there are very real consequences and climate crisis is a reality for me and my friends and this is definitely no easy feat and it requires a lot of training and imagination to look beyond our existing narratives of economic growth efficiency that we have been very used to and I think they're already solutions and imaginations provided by civil society groups academics practitioners and even used in this space and there is there needs to be more space for this collective reimagining that's outside state narratives and I hope that these voices will be valued and that people of all ages will be able to add their voice to imagining a more green and just future thank you any to you I can hear the urgency the tone of urgency coming out from a call for action now before it's too late and so far we have a very very different perspectives for post COBIT Singapore and we're not done yet we still have next speaker our next panelist Damien welcome beaming Thank You Dennis thank you everyone again I like to echo the sentiments about how privileged we are to be on spend in each other's company and for the opportunity to share our thoughts and views on the future of Singapore which all of us have a stake in today I think the main issue that one focus on is education education is something that I find that that's very close to my heart and it's nicely shaped by my experience growing up in Singapore's education system through what we colloquially know as neighborhood schools I was new boot school student from primary school secondary school how do we junior college and I am I mean the company that I had in school was was extremely valuable for for me I know that our education system doesn't work for everyone and the two issues in particular that concern me is one how do we make sure our education system doesn't exacerbate inequality and to make sure that we promote social mobility in a second concern that I have also is how do we ensure that our education system unlocks the potential of as many students as possible and not just those of the academically inclined and these are not new concerns or problems and we always knew I mean must have known that this was always going to be a problem given our exam based mental protect system on the mobility front we already see you know elite schools and government schools attracting for very different types of students 2016 study by the Singapore Children's Society show that the 30% of those schools live in private housing compared to 2% government secondary schools sixty six point three percent of those in need schools have at least come from households with at least one parent who come from University compared to 28% of those in government schools and 42% of those from elite schools come from households with more than $10,000 in monthly income compared to 7% in government schools and I think the answer to these two concerns is in some sense linked given the nature of the problem which is how education systems focus on exams and on academics no I'd like to recognize at the outset that the movie has me important moves away from exams in primary school I don't think we've gone fine off because the peers are is today and the effects of exam down the road in secondary school and then in junior college and politics still makes the PSL yes one of those life-altering events and even we subject bending in secondary schools the curriculum is to going to be academically inclined and so I mean the problem with an exam based system is fairly well known right teachers are pressured to prepare students for exam I didn't teach students prepare for exams rather than learn as well as the amount of the impact on self-esteem they're not doing well in exams hairs on those I think the other gap that is not talked about and and this is something that felt coming up through boot school system is this is what I call the social capital such as how much students I exposed the world beyond their classroom the networks and so on because those from better offenders are going to have more opportunities to travel to participate in internships to me from a broader social circle and in so doing have different types of conversations and this isn't I'm going to top them broaden the understanding of the world it's going to boost their confidence and it's going to motivate them and I think this is a gap that education system needs to try and close and it's going to be difficult to try and close it so long as we focus on exams so I don't propose they're all the answers but I want to try and sketch out what I think how I think the education system has to be transformed further and I think we need to mean to act swiftly that doesn't need immediate change where we have to act with with send more sense of urgency because these are structural problems and once they take they're going to be very very hard to correct so we cannot be complacent and say that social mobility is not a big issue yet and then wait for it to become a big issue before we correct it because it all research has shown that investment in education has to come very very early on because remedial and remedial measures and peripheral kind of tinkering it's going to cost more and it's not going to be as effective so I'm not really going to talk too much about this perturbation because I'm not too familiar with that after all it's quite a while since I attended school but I on primary school but before I do that I think it is important for there to be intensive intervention at the preschool level and I recognize Emily's moves on this front and and we need to continue to see whether we should be doing more or can do more especially for the low income where preschool is really I wanna know about primary and secondary school and I think the focus has to be making learning fun at the primary school level and by this I don't just mean removing the element of exams but it's about making outdoor learning more from things kids should be brought to see the outside world as much as possible to see wildlife architecture people it is not only makes learning fun but makes it relatable and it also gives those from not so well-off families the exposure which they might not otherwise f so this requires a greater rollback of examination so that teachers will not be pressured into preparing kids for exams and also to make sure that our kids are not gonna suffer from low self-esteem from for not doing well in exams because different students learn differently and a different pace we might want to consider having teachers taking care of a child a set of students for an extended period of time versus a change of teachers every single year and then the new teacher needs to rediscover the pace and the style of learning that particular student a particular student has and then by the time he or she discovers it it's time to hand the student over to the next teacher so my starting point for from a square division is very simple and it says Ken Brooke so Ken will be some observe all kids love to learn but not all kids enjoy an education so if we want lifelong learning we need lifelong curiosity and the focus shouldn't be on output but you should be on culture and I think primary school is a place for us to cultivate that culture and secondary school is where we need to see a more intensive intervention to close it so she'll get which I was talkin so students should as far as possible be exposed to more the more complicated aspects of life they get the chance to embark on small work attachments and get the chance to again go further and discover how the world works and not just what is out there in the world and I think the other thing that is important and is worth considering is allowing every secondary school student to be given the chance to go overseas and they don't have to go far as young countries are good I mean we've been talking about having created connection to Asia and then of course we need generous subsidies for students whose family cannot afford to pay for them so all these programs are going to place an even heavier burden on teachers I mean understand the outages are busy so we may need to hire more teachers numbers constant as class sizes town and be sure to consider hiring teachers especially at the secondary school level from from who have experience outside of the education the education system to bring breath to the teaching Renz teaching should still remain a profession and those who want to join from outside the teaching service have to go through professional training but I think there's scope for us to hire from a broader range of candidates and this one this breadth of experience we intend to go down to our students as well I mean maybe we can find a spot in the education system for an essay of general two so it's not just about teach less learn more but teach differently so that our kids learn better and when we do with our education reforms our education system we cannot just ask we cannot just put it in the hands of people who are done well in school we need to speak to those whose the education system hasn't worked well for so I think I'm going to leave it as that except to say this end-of-the our dropout rates in school may be low our attendance rates might be high but we need to ask how many of our students are genuinely enjoying school or genuinely learning well in school if to determine if they get the most out of formal education it's in my point I think in doing that when we can unlock the potential of our kids we are not just going to wealth and economy but those who might not be academically inclined and this tends to be those who are from less well-off families are going to be able to benefit as much as those from well-off families thank you very much Thank You Damian for that very thoughtful piece on education we have been receiving quite a lot of questions but I do hope that the webinar expense continue to keep the questions come in and we will we will try to answer as many of them as possible later now let's for the last but not least let me invite Bao Zhi to share with us his view about Belgium you yourself is can you hear me yes I was quite disheartened to look at your survey results because the two things that I wanted to talk about or the two issues I wanted to talk about are not in the survey at all one of them is media on the one issue is professional British media the other is partly personal but partly national and that is aging and I don't see both these issues in your in your in your list which kind of tells me what the preoccupation of the people that you interviewed what is your preoccupation doesn't matter but I think these two issues are very important when I when I talk about meteor media and because I be the media for a long time it is it's a wonder that how Singapore that calls itself first world country first of all society doesn't have a media that fits its first world status now what do I mean by that I mean first I had a very important anyway at a big primary level the kind of control that the government has on media and the control is at one level at a very serious level the government lost you know and one of the one of the laws is which has been there for a long long time is a license to publish a newspaper so if you want to publish newspaper you have to get a license from from the government and that's a one-year license and you have to renew it every year and of course if the government doesn't be new your license it doesn't have to give a reason so that's the first second one which again not many people know of is the shareholding of public listed company like Singapore Press Holdings in the 1970s under the newspaper presses printing act the shareholding structure was changed by the government to make sure that no single the shareholder is not one single person or one single entity it was kind of spread out but what I think is the devil in this detail is that the intrigue the government introduced a shareholding structure by giving three percent making the company give three percent of its shares to a group of people who my interpretation would protect the government at all costs so and they will be in the boards so to appoint the editor of a newspaper of course it has to seek the approval of the board and as far as the voting rights are concerned the 3% of shareholders have much higher voting rights powers then then the ordinary shareholders so you can see where the the the so-called bottleneck for media is so at that's at one level now moving away from the rules rules in laws you know moving away from that you still have the government for want of a better word interfering in media what do I mean by that you look at the chairman of Chairman I think the Chairman now previously was executed chairman look back from the time of that from 1990s I think we had chairman who or executive chairman who were former cabinet ministers so you had mr. Lim Kim Sam you had mr. Tony Tan and you had you had mr. SR Noddin and now you have lee bo-young it was a former manpower minister now from even below that level so the government is still not happy the controls are not enough for them I'll come to the what I think is a reason for that okay the next level is the CEOs the CEOs in the past many years have all been top civil servants the most reason one is an army general so you have at different levels you know the controls are source not just they are not just sweeping but they go even to the extent of who is appointed as yes see you as chairman I'm not sure whether you will reach a stage where the editor is also appointed by the government maybe they don't need to because you already have enough checks you know now I said why does the government do this  or continue to do this you know and I think it goes back to mr. Lee Kuan Yew who never trusted media even though the media is under the control of the government there are laws to control them still the government is still very still believe that I cannot trust the media it goes back to Lee Kuan Yew long time ago how he looked at the Western press and I still remember one occasion where he told editors he said he was very unhappy with the photograph his photograph the photograph that I think the Straits Times used it was many years ago when he was still Prime Minister and he said he I said it says what I what are y'all trying to do are y'all trying to bring me down because that's what the British press did to Harold Wilson the prime minister because Harold Wilson when the media decided that Harold Wilson was not a right person they began to use a series of pictures over a number of days showing Hal Wilson in a very bad light so it goes to that minut example they can say that so it's there's a lot of distress despite bringing the media under its for despite so many controls the next part of this story about media is and i think i'll be i will be i'll be i'll not be I'm not completing the picture if I don't if I don't talk about the journalists and the editors I mean I worked in a system which was of course there were many issues there but I worked under editors and and I call them the last of the Mohicans in there they were even occasions not many occasions but on the rare occasions when they had to put their foot down with Lee Kuan Yew and I said I described that time as when Lee Kuan Yew was at his rope best some of the editors stood their ground I I don't want to go into the details but they are all available in the public domain and of course two of them paid a very heavy price lost your jobs one continue to stay on for a long time and after he wrote I'm talking about mr. Chong Ling who was the editor in chief I think it was the longest lasting editor in chief in The Straits Times he wrote a book called OB Marcus where he actually talked about government intervention we just felt quite directly intervention and what happened after that he lost his ambassadorship and so so even people who are who have done a good job for the government or protecting the government but even if you if you go against the government for one small thing which I consider small you pay a price it's also partly lesson to the others so coming to the present media see I think all of you have your own views on it and I would say that the media today that we see is very different and definitely not as good as the media we used to have there were many occasions and I have been party to that not all the time but some times where the editors will put up strong arguments that this is not a way to go sometimes the the on the rare occasion the government listens most times they don't listen but my point is it is very important in a Singapore context that the editors behind closed doors at least should put up their point of view from what I hear it doesn't happen at all if it really happens and you will not see the kind of media that you see now and why is it that the journalists I would talk more about the editors why is it that the editors of today don't do what the editors the previous editors did and I can only think of one reason or maybe two reasons what is they have been so well they have taken in the government propaganda so well they can't even think of alternative measures so they accept they buy the arguments all the time second point is that they have seen what has happened to editors of the previous generation losing of jobs right so they say I don't want to be in that position is my livelihood at stake so and and and the fundamental point here is I believe that it is time you know whether it is post Kovac or not the time has come to relax take away some of these rules relax these rules because I don't believe that we have editors at least for the time being who will go and sabotage Singapore I don't think so right so why is it cannot relax is it because no big things about it is it because nobody agitates against it as your survey showed nobody cares about media but via is such a fundamental part of Singapore Society so I'll stop here now I go to the second topic I'm not sure where I'm on time or taking away a lot of you I'll keep that very short and that is ageing I'm now 72 years old because of this Kovach period three months two and a half months I I feel I'm like 80 years old I think I've aged very fast sitting at home not being able to go out not being able to meet my friends not being able to go to the coffee shop to have a drink and again at ageing story is at two levels level one is at government the biggest if you ask me I mean I'm using I'm saying this from a purely anecdotal using anecdotal evidence on all my friends most of my friends of my age most of them have retired but most of them want to do something which is work you know because they want to occupy themselves of them cannot do maybe their skills are not there maybe the employers are not giving them any jobs you know you look at the retirement age right what is the retirement age now minimum retirement age is 62 and it is going up and by 270 by 2030 that is 10 years from now I just can't understand why it has to take 10 years to change your retirement age right let's first point second point is what is your longevity the government has taken very good care of us that longevity is now 85 so what does a person who has to retire maybe at 62 or 64 what does he do until he or she does until the person is 85 he just needs to keep himself employable and it is not a question and most of my friends they are not asking for big salary you know I'm not asking for the same salaries yet even if you pay me an honorarium and ask me to work for three days a week I'm fine so why you know so that's at the at the structural level now at the human level you know I don't I think it is a very very aging Society I don't think we have respect for our the people generally speaking of course we I I I find it such a hassle trying to walk to their market frame to their multi-station people pushing you from behind or you feel you are being pushed behind from behind and of course when you reach 70 70 to you you are not as brightly as you used to be you walk slow slower your gait is slower but people are pushing you they have already got for the old people so and and and how to tap and and older people all of you have fathers and mothers right the older people have a lot to offer their experience you know their wisdom right the experience you know when I talk to younger journalism and I talked to them about some of the things that have happened in journalism they don't know I mean if you don't know your history your media history how can you be a good journalist it's not just media history but even your institutional knowledge about events in Singapore they don't know right if you speak to them about kbjr none for example they know very vaguely but they don't know the real details which are all actually available right if you go and do your research they are all available but because it didn't live through that experience and when they now become journalists they forget everything right so the point is really that these two are actually very important issues Media purely from us that the fact that we are a modern society and we cannot I mean the the PAP government keeps saying we don't need to be checked we will check ourselves right I don't buy that argument because what happened in 2011 the elections of 2011 there were enough evidence to show that the PAP was hitting for a major humiliating victory if you want to call it that you know there was evidence but the paper the ruling government did not no less did nothing right so I don't buy the argument whether it is for me or for any other party or organization that they can check themselves I don't believe that and of course my second one the second point is really an appeal please take care of other people I'll stop you thank you oh gee thank you for sharing you know your impressions and your hopes for media changes in future and also your concerns about ageism about about how the elderly how they are treated and the challenges they'll face our elderly in the coming years time is moving on and I would like to move on to the next section and and that really is a short section where I will actually invite our panelists to ask any question they were like ask of your fellow panelists and may I ask the sunny has any question yes would you like to and who do okay so my question is for Damien actually an education I think a lot of us at the sense that Singapore system might be a bit stripping and all that but it's how we get students we could have things like math and science for example right but at the same time I have a big awareness that a country like Finland or someone's Canada countries actually has pretty liberal open systems and yet they also have very high scores in math and science I'm wondering if this is true and what you think about you know rote learning for certain paths medication this is a more open liberal progressive kind of approach yeah well first of all first of all I don't think there's necessarily a trade-off I think so those who have studied the Finnish education system have shown research has shown that there is no trade-off between switching away from learning that sort the switching away from a rote learning system doesn't necessarily until sacrifice of literacy numeracy the the quality of learning that our students get and in fact I think the research suggests that it's going to enhance them because we my experience everyone's experience would indicate that there are certain subjects which we enjoy which we do well at and the knowledge to begin from those subjects we retain in our minds far beyond second school and then others we discount after finishing the exams so that tells us that doing well that just because our kids do well exams that doesn't mean that they are well equipped with knowledge and that doesn't necessarily also equip them to be and I I don't use this phrase too often lifelong learners I mean I think it's a good phrase but we reduced our catch phrase so I think the school must be about how we cultivate learners of course there are some subjects that we want them when our kids to be good at I mean literacy numeracy basic stuff but then there's a question of whether we are then sacrificing in trying to equip them with what we think is good for them are we then sacrificing the love for learning and are we also then stunting the development other areas because we might have prodigies and Genesis doing all sorts of things but calculation and writing essays and the question is whether our economy not just our society is going and I think that will be based on my experience and as well as the numbers we've seen so far Duffy do you have any question yes I do and this is a topology actually I mean the point he made about the need to relax the rules that muzzle the media that nobody can argue with that but I'm just questioning whether is that still relevant in an age when mainstream media or legacy media have been shoved into the wings and The Straits Times for instance is no longer the the media that sets the agenda and you know social media is clearly an roached into this sphere and even the ministers are directly using Facebook and other social media platforms to talk to the people do you do you still think that easing the rules will make that much of a difference well so see it's well it's it's actually a very very good question and when preparing myself for this session that was something that I didn't focus on but let me tell you that the Straits Times we always talked about we always talk about the Straits Times it's still very important in the sense that it has still got a wide reach but I think your point really is does it still set the agenda the government is using the Straits Times just to set the agenda and if you read you know if you read comments right on social media of course some people say that or not some people many people say that these are all vigilantism PAP vigilantes you go in there make noise but you will find that there are people who still believe the Straits Times and also reading the Straits Times or at least the way I read The Straits Times you have to read between the lines if you read between the lines if you have a lot of patience and perseverance you can get quite a lot of information for the Straits Times so you're in direct answer to your question is yes I think States tends to has some some some important some impact not as much as it used to have say 10 years 15 years ago rather then and also not to forget that the social media online media they don't have the resources to go out there and do reporting so most of them what shall I say are doing analysis one or two people or three people other than let's say mothership for example and Yahoo the other one but these are not I don't see them as big influences yeah yeah influence is growing I don't know how long that rotate but I think the bigger question to me I always ask ask the Straits Times revenue keeps dropping every quarter right and it's not just circulation revenue but it's also advertising revenue I call it the double whammy I've never seen this before now I've never heard it during my time in a speech this never happened in fact the editor in chief used to say we don't have to worry about circulation because as long as there are hey she do you really be blocks of flexible our circulation will go up now we look at it today so me HDB flats are being built but the circulation is going down and so I think that is we are going to come I hope it happens during my lifetime we are going to come to the trench is going to be crunch time soon newspapers like a speech that is why they have I would say quite smartly they have themselves decided that media may not be here their cash count so they have gone into property they have gone into also they have gone into all folks home nursing homes they have gone into building dormitories overseas so they are spreading eggs and one other point that's kind of related to what sassy top mentioned is the biggest stakeholder in this business the media business means mainstream media business is the government and until the government realizes that the Straits Times is of no use to me they will keep controlling the Straits Times and this is one thing that I am dumbfounded about you know I cannot I cannot see why the government don't see this as an issue moving forward because that is the only source of for want of a better word only credible source or credible platform for them to get across your message and and that is slowly being eroded but I also expect this government is it's quite a smart government quite a cunning government expect them to do other things I don't know what that is I can only I can really give you the example of before what happened after the 2011 elections one of the key things that happen I'm not sure people have focused on it suddenly - suddenly - online websites came out ask yourselves why who are the funders right definitely not the people who started those websites and soon after the 2015 elections when the PAP won big the two websites disappear right so they will they will do a lot of things - to muddy the waters sorry I don't know what I answered your question thank you thank you yeah I got a question for sassy so I think when you were talking about imagining a new compact right so you know as a youth people always tell us that oh you know it's so great that youths are getting involved in social issues and these feels like pets on the back and it still just feels like their pets on the back well we're not really taken seriously enough dismissed as naive or inexperienced I still think that youth voices are still important because we are the future of society right so how do you think Society or current political leaders and business leaders can be more intentional in including youth voices in training for the future of Singapore wow that's a big that's a big question I I it may appear as if I think young people are not being listened to but I do believe that the leadership particularly the political leadership is acutely aware of the demo demography of young people and their concerns the problem in Singapore is that sometimes the reality of the ground takes time to move up to levels where it's going to impact policy this is I think not just a reality about youth opinions it's it's a reality generally you know basically the leadership is not listening the leadership is disconnected and I think that this is the problem that youths are facing but at least theoretically the leaders are concerned about you know listening to the to the user at least to seem to to listen to youth and I mean it's just you know it's just a factor of good democratic politics you need to listen to the people who are going to ultimately vote for you or not vote for you and I think and I the best way I think that youth can continue to engage this this in this area is to be active I mean activism advocacy engaging leadership engaging everyone from MPs to to institutional leaders and and speaking your mind and having your voice in the mix you know of the discussions which country are which are going to decide policy these are the ways these are time-tested ways and I think these are the best ways that you can do for themselves what the leaders may not want to do thank you thank you sassy Damon do you have any questions no I mean on from experience I think one one way to be taken seriously and I think that's a way that your group has is to to yourself take it seriously in the sense that you know you do do do our homework on the issues to the proper research and come up with with concrete proposals and over time people realized that you know what you've got to say and then they will listen to you Thanks a couple of questions but mainly related to the young and fascist success response do you think I see there of course there's a lot of young people who want to be active want to take part do you but what happens in the home do you think the parents encourage them or discourage them I think by and large the tendency among Singaporeans parents is to play it safe to not to not rock the boat you know to not to swim against the current this this is I think by and large the case in Singapore but despite this I am amazed whenever I attend events where there I people you know people who basically have been exposed and III suspect this also this is also a result of the media and you know the availability of information today unlike the time when when when I was growing up I think that you know as you say the Straits Times was the sole truth but that's no longer the case and the the level at which young people are informed and the level at which they know and understand realities about the world about politics throughout society I think far exceeds what the parents actually do and this is a good thing so despite be the the conservatism of the parents I think young people still hold on something for the future and it's something we can hope for I'm glad to hear them and you know just for the question I had is a very actually a simple question do you think that the education system that the new me that the new education minister and some of the things that he's been trying to do do they will they meet Singapore's future will it be the type of education that we want our children grandchildren so I okay let me answer the first I think that he's done it fairly significant changes much needed changes are they going to be sufficient to meet the needs of our future I I can't say for sure I mean which I I don't think it's going to be a disaster right for sure is not going to disaster for sure we are still going to be able to do very well but I think the question with education is not but when we do it will do very well but it's whether we can do the best we can not just whether we can do the best we can but whether each of our kids as equal opportunity to do the best that we can so in short I think that the changes are good but I think we can do better and commit new questions about parents I think firstly you know if we are able to inspire our young people parents can only resist an idealistic young person that much right an idealistic passionate young person is an irresistible force and parents to resist that but even if you know our kids are discouraged from participating in certain way because of what their parents say there's nothing to stop a society or the nation from planting the seed of idealism and then because at some point they're gonna grow up and going to be independent of their parents and then they can make their own decisions and they still be young is to be idealistic and we still value their contributions as much at that point I'm just quickly and I will add to that point because I think the education what happens in school I think most of us from what I've heard my friends say the blame is always on the scale the teachers the school system but nobody talks about the home what does the whole do right when the children kind of go against a system or ask very very difficult questions because they want to shut them up either they are tired or maybe they don't have the answers if this child grows up right in that kind of an environment school at home do they spend any business all the time then what happens is he so I think the focus also has to be in the boom how did how the children brought up by their parents they give them a chance to express themselves even if those expressions are not within the bounds of what the government wants if not I mean you need to have something okay I mean for sure but I think this this thing's that any government can do with regards to the home I'm sure being I'm not asking for the government to intervene so that's why we need to be a safe space and to be space where that kind of discourse encouraged and that's where kids are empowered to participate in that way okay it's it's very exciting discussion just between the panelists and I wish we have a lot more time in this but we need to give a fair bit of time to our webinar participants and many questions that flow in so we move on to that now unfortunately we are we are probably not able to go through all these many questions that have been sent in but we'll try to answer as many as we can and so they have a very very good question so let's let's start on on the first question from Jay Josh Kumar Singh his questions Rita's follow thank you for taking the time to read my question my question is directed the BAU G sunny and sassy yeah that's an commit humanity is having a source of Solace for many during these extraordinary circumstances many of us has to have turned to literature music film theater and other artistic forms to help us cope with a change that's been flicked upon us in a post COBIT situation how we using our appreciation for the above will change and may I suggest maybe some thinking off it's what the question is look a look at it again and you repeat last part in the post Kovac situation of using our appreciation for the above will change you know we are not sure you'll change fundamentally I think it's uh you know it's the consider to bees in a way of luxury and you know it is hard to UNESCO should have asked myself panna cotta to argue against it because I talked about button you know the famous brand bread and butter issues arts well you know for what reason that I never be on that level I think I'm less speaking to people who know policy-making level and they tell me that you know I say every citizen whether they want tax money spent on arts or what anyone is spent on a new at home they always go for the past or right so to me I think that's it's a curious thing right it's it's so intention to our life is so important to us as human beings but at the same time you can feel so unsure right and after talking my game I think one reason might be that arts is you know it's it's staying power is actually a problem for it because we can reach your skill today right as we did back then so we don't actually need more all the time right there's this you know how to go around to the books millions of books out there that we got to read music and watch so I'm not sure people given a choice between that and something more like a job or you know the kind of growth they will choose is purposeful for expending right and you know in a way that I think is a misunderstanding because I think of course Contemporary Arts will address contemporary issues in a way they're all the arts as an I think that in Singapore especially since I located at the asking gear and all that it is dominated by what I would myself classify as middle-class or upper-class partition is because we can afford to take the risk to create our and in doing so I think we lose a lot of the voices of the lower classes low-income classes and and then I think would need to be fixed and I could be fixed right I think talked about do you ask supporting government and all that and I think it's very difficult to change the ecosystem here to allow us to find a way to fund us which is not government approved you know I'm not sure what's a solution to that is to me I feel like the fact that I'm also having desks to come to me NEC and MDA creates a lot of problems for a long term over us there's not government and dates it so I see you have a quick answer that Safiye you have a quick answer I can't you can't argue with that you know with the books versus butter dichotomy I guess the problem with for me with that is that you you are making that I caught me at all I don't think that we need to choose between the arts and bread-and-butter issues I think that we have frankly I think Singapore is is wealthy enough to ensure that people can have the culture and the arts that they need and the desire and they can have the basics that they that they require in life I think that there has to be a change in the perception of the people who are holding the posture to understand that that we need to look again at these time-worn dichotomies that's all I would say thanks I see let me poverty you have a quick answer today I'd like to move on to the next question I don't quite a few to go okay let's move on to the next question I like a juicer adequate a question of Education we just grow to that this question form Irene sim she says interesting the number one as we do well is education I'm of a different view I'd like to ask panelists of their views of the education system now such as focus on stem and suppose the humanities is this enough to meet post coding we'll do our and young have the skills for 21st and 22nd century ahead any panelists who wish to answer needs Damien yes well I think apart from I mean if we are going to look at the system within a kind of academic based framework which it is now then I think the very minimum we shouldn't put people into the arts and science stream kind of framework because I think both both important I mean you need to understand the sciences for people understand you know how we do with virus for example how we do it problems like climate change how we do with a lot of scientific issues technical issues in the world but then we need the humanities to which speaks to us about how we are going to work with other people who disagree with us how you know we look back at history and look at the things the mistakes that many ask me and try not to make the same mistakes so in that sense yes I I I don't know if system has too much of a focus on science because I've not been in fine stream but I think that we should get our students to be more well-rounded and not just box them into one category or another end and the problem with that system also is that it influences the kids to think of themselves as humanities people or science people and then you know kind of narrow their motivation to particular to learn to particular fuse or not I think broader than that we need to have education that is non-academic based so we need to cultivate leadership skills collaborative skills and things like that and these are things that might not be amenable to be cultivated just by just within the humanities view or the science view so I think we need to look at education system s with much broader lenses and and and understand that is much broader objectives as well and then teaching and getting our students to learn the things that we want them to learn because because sorry I just quickly because humanities alone is not winning teach people not going quit people with the character and the qualities that they need to survive in the world I'm just learning about something it's not character building in a sense and so those things need to be focused on this one thanks Damon let's move on to the next question by Rene Lee and I'm going to ask you this question post Kobe 19 what do you think should be the focus of the government and do you think the government should continue to continue striving for sustained economic growth or should it shift their focus to social inequalities and global issues like climate change a lot of priorities and for me because I wanted to focus on it's comfortable I think fundamentally what I think they should be more focused on is possibly listening to different voices or at least you know when I'm talking about advocacy or activism and civil society in general I would like to just be appointed Damian made about you know having your voice in the mix and to be heard or to be recognized as credible need written homework and do research to come out concrete proposals I think a lot of activists are already doing their work and all our civil society grids are already well but still we are not being hard and I think what it's missing from that conversation is the fact that there is a very clear power dynamic between who gets listening to and which voices get dismissed in and you know with that kind of power dynamic I don't understand how you can posture position to be more credible and fundamentally these simple society groups are quite certain that people already do not want to listen to so I think you know the governor should first focus on process turns back and be more inclusive for different groups who have a stake in decision-making from various demographics and not just use and we need to relook the way that even public consultations are being done and communicated because you know what does really listening to the people mean and I think about really second point thank you for raising that up it's there I think we can now see that I was tried for 16 economic growth being talked about by so many academics they have seen that this has resulted in a lot of social inequalities all of the issues ABC today and I think I'm not sure about shifting their focus but I believe that there is a need to rethink and relook the way that our economy and our society is you know is being structured and there's been a lot alternative models but irineu deals all over the world about D growth about steady-state economy and of course we may not all apply to Singapore but they are learnings that I think Singapore can adopt in moving away from one that has been driven by a GDP growth and you know there are already people who are pushing out operational policies beyond just ideology that I think that the government should start looking into and protect shape their focus one that pieces you know social equality and I guess sustainability in the agenda if I have they were frame the way that future policies are being constant thank you to you thanks I have a question question from the audience miss Canada sue Kynan and this is just about G and it's it's not a question but it's more asking well gee what he thinks of these this view that his Honda has and let me read a decreasing respect for all it's a phenomenon that extends beyond our borders it is in line with the Hokey Buddha mindset that the older people are partially responsible for the dreamer economic conditions the experience now this is of course not the case in Singapore certainly not as much as in the US or UK I will suggest that a real problem is a breakdown in familial relationships which is in large part driven by the capitalist economy that we are entrenched in over to you about yep so the question is the real issue with ageing is in the whole Michael yes family breakdown and relationship how do you need to anew yourself families don't take care of their elderly is that is that is that the point yes I believe so yes family breakdown yeah Rick tower relationships with the family that's how I really you know okay I don't deny that that is a problem but I don't believe that that is a major problem it may become a major problem over time and so it's it's IIIi talked about the public and in that way it is also a family problem although honestly I must say I didn't focus on that issue I don't get the sense in my own interactions with people that that is the big issue I don't get that sense maybe I'm interacting with the wrong people I have a question from Constance Ingham and her question is addressed to see how do we learn and teach the next generation to say with our discomfort chorim could see with our discomfort Thank You Constance for asking that yeah that's a difficult question isn't it I guess I guess the and there are a number of things that must happen right to say that one of the reasons why we don't do that as a people in Singapore is because of the failure of multiculturalism or the model of multiculturalism that we experienced you know since independence that basically we are not a multicultural a really multicultural society and that we are essentially a pool mono cultural society so that's one of the fundamental problems I feel the other reason I think is because there is a deep distrust of the people by the government there is a deep distrust about human nature about the possibility of people engaging and interacting you know across cultures deep distrust in the fact that we can learn to understand other nests that we have the capacity we can develop the sensibility and the sensitivities to understand difference and this is something I think that is reflected in the kind of policing of of interracial and intercultural interactions in Singapore the kind of disciplining that the people of Singapore have become accustomed to of course we can always point to the fact look how harmonious we are but how many is not just about the lack of conflict how many must mean something deeper than that it must mean understanding it must mean empathy it must mean a sense of taller and this comes about because in fact we are segregated racially and culturally and even in terms of religion we are deeply segregated and and and I suppose the answer to your question consensus that we need to trust our people we need to trust human nature we need to take risks as a society for interactions to take place it may not be something that our leaders have the stomach for but I think we pay a price as a society if we don't do that thank you thank you so see perhaps you want to wind on this from your own perspective yeah and I think he actually brought up a lot of very structural and issues or themes that we have to think about when we think about you know sitting with our discomfort so I just wanted to read that you know in sitting with discomfort it's not a generational problem I think everybody in Singapore does have to sit with this discomfort in a very challenging time and I think sitting in with discomfort does look like you know use could be fearing a very uncertain future and the impact on your family and life you got and I think while we are growing up in a globalised well recognizing that they are real very real fears it's something that we need to address but they're also dose and we need to recognize who are uncomfortable because of the fact that they benefit from status cool that's actually being challenged in these times so I think everybody needs to sit with discomfort and the different kinds of discomfort and in sitting with this discomfort I hope there you know we can work together as a society rather than being separated or for the for further divided but more together in communal and caring for one another in order to move forward in you know Cosco fear thank you thank you we have one question from James Lim the is for Damien Damon in your view do you think that there can be more purposive public policy for developing social capital for the less fortunate beyond travel exposure for instance do you think a specialized agency should be formed to develop social capital with after-school programs and internships company intervention in cetera yeah it's working your question shot because we are going to wrap up soon your answer sure thank you I haven't really thought about this in this way my my me because this is part of development of Education age in the early age I think so okay if you talk about the early age then I think then we should should take care of it and should be able to take away and then be I mean now everything actually so um I I don't know whether we need a specialized agency or such but and it's something I probably should think about further and would think about further but I would say this which is that we need to be sensitive as to how we do it because the men in which assistance is given or if it is the many ways we think of assistance on effects how it's given how it's perceived by the recipients as well and I think it needs to be approached from a solidarity perspective from an empowerment perspective not from an assistance perspective and and that's because this quite force within the remit of my I think that it is time for Emily to consider making social mobility one of his explicit goes if it already I mean it isn't it's quite implicit in what they do and I know that a lot of teachers care about it by English we made explicit in in the world I know it does Thank You Damian we are running short time and we should be wrapping up soon but I've seen to question that came in which I think they are quite suitable for our panelists to address in there wrapping up as such and so I will read these questions and perhaps invite our panelists to consider sticking of view to this as you wrap up in addition to whatever they may want to say which you may have prepared beforehand so the first question come from Ryu and he says to all panelists which is one concrete thing that you would change immediately about policy in your respective domains if given the power and the second question from mr. Mellor law what values you think of it has taught us and how can we we ask them hos code okay so does anybody want to start first sorry we don't start with yes thank you so I didn't really prepare like the closing statements I was answer the questions quite directly in terms of changes the policy I was given power I think from what I'm hearing in of the panelist in general a lot of while talking about this density increase apology is that the mainstream narrative is really dominated by the you know like a modal voice right diverse you know and I think that's the same with the odds so to to change it I guess I would one thing I could do you could do is to change the odds family model right and that says I think the NEC for example could be much less of a step and much more of a US agency much more independent in its governance and the way you to ship its funds and even if you look at it in terms of its own rationale where the government likes to say that it's taxpayers money and therefore we can't spend it on things that are anti-government or critical to me getting some to some extent because look at the voting patterns of the every election there's at least 30 percent block that to be you know critical of the government that sense so by that logic taxpayer funds at least thirty percent should be devoted to projects whereas otherwise there are not pro government in terms of what changes Cobie 19's has my career I think for me the main thing really is that is give us a sense that change is possible right I think again like what I said earlier about how I never talk closely because there are only possible things that seem impossible I think before probably nineteen maybe now seem to be doable as long as we have the works to it with a reason to do it I don't know whether it's an environment whether it's education whether it's at your aunt's I think this is the sense that as long as this collective you go change can happen Thank You Sonny and SATs see you on who you want to share abuse okay I I didn't prepare any sort of closing statements but yeah I'll start with the second question for us about what changes you think covet nineteen has forced us to confront I think I mean did you ever think that that our nurses and frontline health workers would get a one month salary bonus did you ever think that delivery men and the guys who were stocking supermarkets were essential to our economy did you ever think that the the cabinet would take a one-month pay cut so that the money could be distributed to other people did you think that such redistribution could be possible or what was even conceivable before this pandemic did you think that such welfarism such care for the daily needs of the people who are most deprived in Singapore was possible did we think that computers and other devices could be distributed to children for children so that they could they could partake of home based learning did we think that this sort of distributive justice was possible in our economy before no the simple answer was no because there was only one univocal point of view which said that the market had to determine our future that's no longer the case now we are looking at a new world we have to rethink the place of market economics we have to rethink distribution of resources we have to rethink our nsima to a universal basic income we have to rethink our antipathy to minimum wage and we have to rethink what is essential for us as a people and I think while we are doing this rethinking as Sonny has already pointed out we need to have an Arts Council that is truly connected to the arts and rather than be an extension of a government bureaucracy we need an Arts Council that champions the arts not just instrumental eise's it for government policy thank you Thank You sassy thanks we like to invite Damien so what we learned from covet I think we need to look after everyone economy I don't think I've enough times to talk about the issue but when so to come out of this covet 19 economic situation and to emerge stronger than before it's about maintaining a strong economy and a strong economy needs to be in this context needs to be a dynamic economy you know I'd love to share I'm aware that I'm on limited time so I just like to refer everyone to a paper that local economies wrote his name is Manu Buster and my name if you are watching hello this was a paper published with the Lowy Institute and it's it's it's a fantastic paper about how our economy hasn't been dynamic enough and how it needs to be more dynamic moving forward and then I want to close off with influenza is the Youngs question and this is something that I didn't mention in my opening address just now I think we need to seriously consider when we talk about social mobility abolishing looking relooking the emission criteria and my preference is for abolishing alumni and affiliation based and Roman in all schools n abolishing the GP and IP the gifted education program and the integrated program because these two programs as long as they exist are going to make the exams or tests in school high stakes for those people who want to compete and then it's also going to cause the better schools to pull away from the other schools so I understand as far as an Roman for Primus News locality and Roman is going to be difficult and there is a problem that has to be looked at from the point of view of urban plan in doing research for this I mean I was shocked to find and I looked at the numbers on detail I was shocked to find it in the polar Bukit Timah according to how the boundaries are drawn by government they're only eight thousand three hundred HDD residents in FEMA so the premise was they are obviously going to me except certain people from a certain background and this is a an issue that we have to look at across the entire nation as well not just bukit timah and in closing I just want to say that we've done well but we need to do better our education system is a national treasure but it has to be a treasure right now you know education is about unlocking the imaginations and dreams of our students and right now you know people might price the route the educational more higher paying jobs then groups less travel and as long as the market pays people with better with certain types of qualifications better than those who don't have qualifications that problem is going to persist and so to change that we can't just change the education system we need to look at how economy in structure as well and that will take time but the education system provides us with a good starting point to do this because even if the rest of society is going to be slow to react you can always rely on the stubbornness the idealism and the passion of young people to break barriers and push boundaries thank you very much thank you dreaming sharing that see would you like to share your closing cost and answers to the two questions thank you yeah I think takeaways from Kovac I think policy wise the importance of resilience has come up a lot and personal resilience looks right you know like what Sasi said rethinking market economics and what is essential and for me that ties in very well with building a green and socially equitable transition as a principal to future-proof you know our economy and society and also about Damien's point earlier about education and climate change climate change is unjust as such crises even like this pandemic is increasingly and it's incredibly intersectional and we need all causes and all disciplines to recognize their role in the pandemic and climate change and pushing for climate action and we also need more humanities driven or intersectional climate research as well and echoing Sassy's point on distributive justice I think something is come up it's a lot of autonomous community support and I think to some extent it has taught us to remove ourselves from individualistic mindset and interest to you know looking after the community and looking after the people around us and for those who might be worse off in dealing with this crisis and it's something that I hope continues and I think the last point about youth activism or use just generally becoming more socially aware I think it's increasing and we definitely need more voices to be speaking up and I think this requires a lot of courage because there are a lot of risks involved equity say at home or even you know in their careers in the future or sometimes some people just do not have do I feel safe speaking up or do I have the luxury of time and capacity to do enough research to speak up but fundamentally I think people care and they want to be listened to so here's a call to say that you know there are many voices youth voices speaking with you and what activism shouldn't hear what they shall but the fundamental principle of it is to speak up and shout for issues that you care about and engagement not just your politicians by even your community social circles to reimagine what a post-conviction appall can look like and I hope that this youth awareness and center for social justice is continuing thank you to you politics over to you I knew yourself this thought you knew yourself if there is one single takeaway for me as a result of this crisis and that takeaway is that this narrative that the PAP government is always right it never goes wrong you can anticipate all the problems in the world obviously I didn't do it right that's very clear I mean I think the they themselves will admit it so first point second point is I think moving away from moving out of Kovac I see two major issues coming to the forefront one is international relations as the world begins to relook globalization they now look at themselves or at their neighbors these are the people I want to work with I want to trade with and for Singapore there's going to be a major major problem and I feel that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the role the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will going will be very very important it is not that it was not important many years ago under ministers like rajaratnam for example and we had some of the best diplomats with us Tommy Cole Esarhaddon Andalites I'm not convinced that we have diplomats at that level and my if I can call it a wish is that we need those diplomats the second point is for want of a better word talent I am more and more convinced than we have the government has missed the ball or dropped the ball on the talent issue not developing our people fast enough much earlier leaving it to a much later stage so much so that now we have to depend on foreigners I'm not an anti foreigner by any means I'm not anti talent person if we have the right talent it would be we should take them in and to add to them then the economy is going to one is going to demand the type of people the type of jobs that they are creating are going to be very very different I'm not convinced that we have enough people Singaporeans who can do all those jobs right so I hope that these two issues and I'm sure the government is looking into it but the bigger issue is talent how is the government going to convince the public that we need foreign talent it again dropped the ball many years ago when it when it lifted the floodgates to allow so many people in and caused a lot of problems and also taking in making sure that we're taking the right people thank you about you thank you a big thanks to all our panelists who join us today and they're sharing I would say across the generations and the first time that in our looping webinars that we were trying this sub panelist asking each other questions in a frame personally I find it very exciting thank you very much to

""We think he’s too young to do this or that, but he just needs a push in the right direction,” says dad. Vasantham actor Jay Nesh Isuran and his wife tasked their 3-year-old, Om Jay, to cross busy roads to buy breakfast and to get groceries at the wet market.

In a world of helicopter parenting, it might surprise you to learn how independent your child can be. Or how making them take responsibility can boost your child's confidence,  and increase his self esteem. 

On The Red Dot’s series “Old Enough!” is adapted from the popular long-running series from Japan’s Nippon Television Network Corporation (Nippon TV) and showcases determined preschoolers overcoming their fears and running errands on their own for the first time.

In response to the pandemic, the Singapore government implemented preventative measures such as the circuit breaker and social distancing, which have translated into reduced levels of community access and long periods of staying at home. These sudden changes could have a profound impact on individuals experiencing difficulties with emotional regulation. Join us for this public lecture as we bring our focus to COVID-19 and what the new normal for persons with special needs might mean.

The National Library is the custodian of Singapore’s published heritage and continually expands and makes accessible its research and resource collection to the public.",all right this evening's topic is about kobe 19 and the new normal for children with special needs and we're very happy to have it asked two speakers dr sylvia chu and dr kenneth who they'll be introduced by our moderator dr sean go dr gold is a research scientist and clinical psychologist at the center for research in child development nie ntu i shall now pass the session on to dr goh over to you dr girl hello everybody a very good evening to everybody out there my name is sean and i'm the moderator for this evening's event so we have two speakers today uh formerly our first speaker dr sylvia chu is a practicing pediatrician at the department of child development kk hospital before that she worked at the department of neonatal and developmental medicine at the singapore general hospital her interests are in family centered care working with parents including parent-mediated intervention and the integration and right-sighting of care and early intervention for children with developmental needs following from her our second speaker dr kenneth poon is associate professor at the national institute of education nanyang technology university and co-center director of the center for research in child development he's trained as a clinical psychologist and early childhood special educator his research mainly focuses on the life course studies of children with neural developmental disorders and their families the implications of these for policy as well as the methods for assessing their needs so without further ado i'd like to pass the time over now to dr sylvia true please okay good evening everyone thank you for attending this um adapting to the new normal i think some people will find the term new normal quite irritating because i think it's been vented around and nobody really knows what the new normal really is but we've used it anyway um i'm gonna go through what we know about covet 19 as at least in singapore uh what we might expect and what are the strategies that we can use and um the strategies are the three hours reassurance routines and regulation and possibly preparing for the possible changes ahead so facts about covert 19 in singapore children so far less than 100 children i think probably around 70 to 80 children have been infected the symptoms have been mild there's been no need for respiratory support or oxygen or icu care in any of the children so far and we have not had any cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children so far as well 50 cases were reported as of april 22nd there have been a few cases in recent weeks after school has reopened but they've been isolated except for this current 12th of july report on two students at jurong west secondary in fact the week before that 25th of june my colleagues at kk had published a paper saying that there's been no transmission of um kobe 2 19 between um children so we don't know we don't know if the one at jurong west secondary is actually a transmission between the two students or it's from other other causes but so far in all the outbreaks so far including the function pcf outbreak there has been no transmission of the virus between children in the center okay so that tells us a bit of how this virus behaves in children we know that the transmission is varied via droplets and usually the large droplets which can contaminate surfaces and things but there's been a recent 9th of july letter to who which asked who not to ignore aerosol transmission so if you look at this diagram the big droplets will tell you why we want to keep social distancing but if um the droplets really do hang up in the air hang in the air over time then we might and that might explain some of the other uh problems like um crowded places uh poorly ventilated indoor spaces like um choir practice rooms gyms nightclubs places like that so that's what we know so far and again things are changing quite a bit so we don't know whether aerosol transmission is a problem the small droplets or it's just large droplets still but we also know how we can protect ourselves so there are the three w's wear a mask watch your distance wash your hands and also avoid the three seas closed spaces with poor ventilation crowded places with many people nearby and closed contact settings such as close range conservation conversations and that was from the japanese government wearing a mask actually protects other people from your droplets and your aerosols but if the other people also wear a mask then you are protected from their aerosols and their droplets so it's a bit of a i protect myself i protect you you protect me kind of situation but we know that it does reduce airborne transmission outdoors is better than indoors as recent times have shown and good ventilation definitely helps so there's there is a move to make the indoors more like the outdoors so open windows turn on the fan when you're in a cab or a grab open the windows as well limit the duration of interactions with outsiders as well i just wanted to congratulate everyone for having gone through this very challenging period it was rapidly evolving with major major changes along the way from 7th of february when dorschoon orange was announced to 7th of april when circuit breakers started and from two first of june when circuits uh phase one of circuit breaker lifting was uh announced or was uh instituted and then 19th of june was phase two of circuit breaker and i think from what um the minister said it's likely that phase two may last for an indefinite period we don't know when phase three will start um whatever families control work from home home-based learning long hours at home with everybody in the family at home limitations in where we can go wearing of mass safe distancing challenging situations for some families it's true that the experience has been very different for different every family and um some families have thrived right well some have not um i think hopefully all this is also being documented and we we find different things that we may need to do in future for different families and inequalities are also uh looked at but we know for sure that covert 19 is not going to go away really soon we know that it is here to stay and the world is kind of working out how to live with it now and how to adapt to it and a lot of it is behavioral change um this was i think late june coronavirus may be here for much longer due to rapid mutations because these rapid mutations may have implications for immunity being conferred on the persons who have had coronavirus as well as for vaccine development so there are some people who think that the vaccine may be available in a few months perhaps early 2021 but there are many people who also believe that who believe that a vaccine may never come actually so we don't know when we wait so the new normal we don't really know what it is but we know that it is a situation full of challenges many of which are unpredictable and except that it will feel a little daunting at times even having just said that we know that schools in hong kong which were closed and opened are being closed again one week ahead of their summer their regular summer holidays because of a spike in cases in hong kong so strategies now to deal with the whole situation i suppose the first strategy would be reassurance and communicating with our children so reassuring ourselves as well as our children getting good in information and information from good reliable sources um but be curious what has your child heard what does he or she think correct misconceptions and offer honest and realistic reassurance so we know that a lot of truths about the coronavirus the virus the transmissibility the possibility of being very sick but we know that most people who have the virus are going to be okay and that makes about 80 15 percent may need hospitalization and then five percent may need icu care all right so uh that's the the truth i think there are also a lot of helpers people who can help in this situation uh that we want to communicate to our children so that they don't think that we are all helpless with this uh there are doctors nurses first responders grocery workers garbage truck drivers cleaners food delivery workers teachers safe distancing ambassadors all who are playing a role in helping the situation there are also a lot of people working on this disease but it does take time so development of effective therapies vaccines public health officials who are trying to do what we can so there are also things that we can do and i think this helps children we know some things that work to protect us against the virus so communicating children using age-appropriate materials books comics websites videos and there are many many books out there now most of them are available online and i'll be happy to share them with you later communication for development and disability appropriate ways so supporting understanding describing the virus and current situation in concrete language and terms using social stories visual supports offering visual cues to clarify the passage of time because it's been going on for months now actually right allowing um opportu opportunities for expression um including discussions writing activities journal writing play aac music dance yoga and visual arts so i think in singapore we had some children who okay sorry this is the social story about covid the resources are from here mohimh also has some resources um and this was a girl who wrote about anxiety drew about anxiety her world at home versus the world outside and um i guess even with all that take a moment each day to be truly present to the child or children listen to your child's thoughts and concerns enjoy some play time with them and also realize that this conversation is going to be a continuous one with anticipated twists and turns and your child may have more questions and concerns as the situation evolves again this was done i think by our local children seeing covet through art okay the second strategy is routines um juggling adult responsibilities is really really difficult i think working from home is not easy especially with the children at home and trying to be a parent a teacher as well as an efficient worker producing work as well so we have to be realistic about how we can manage our day striking a balance between all the competing demands providing structure for your family is helpful but without being too ambitious hopefully making adjustments reaching out to others and be kind being kind to ourselves and being those around us um i think working from home is not the end of the conversation yet i think there's a lot more to be said a lot more to be uh talked about and discussed how do we juggle parenting and working from home i think a lot depends on the age and the development of the child so the younger they are the more direct attention is needed and planning ahead is needed to get work done so for infants you know that they need you most of the time uh you could wear a purpose or you know where your child to work but plan ahead to get the work done in very very short spots of time taking play breaks is good as well uh toddlers also need a lot of direct attention and sure they have a very short attention span so um plan a variety of activities and someone has talked about having activity stations so lego blocks dolls kitchen artwork and moving from station to station as their concentration range and also doing some side-by-side work with you so you do your tasks but you know have him or her do his coloring and you check in with them now and then but you can do your task the rest of the time school-age children and twins and teens family routines are probably important keeping some structure but give choices and for twins and teens who are older perhaps set goals for them so that they can reach those goals without being too being too ordered by you and why is routine sense structure well um why do we say establish your daily or weekly routine because and why do we say build structure into your home environment because it gives predictability predictability and order and allows us to fall back onto familiar basic things anxiety is said to be often a response to uncertainty so giving certainty predictability structure order does give children and ourselves often some something to fall back on and something to reassure ourselves with so maintaining up you know existing routines is important sleep weight routines eating bathing toileting routines one thing that has come up a lot is physical exercise and physical activity and then another thing that we could introduce if we haven't introduced is household helping um building new routines is important because you know school stopped and work stops and everything stopped and uh transitioning off screens is something that we find difficult often so using a visual timer visual countdown system because the children are on the screen for school work for often five to six hours and we need to build routines also into things like what time is mom and dad available so um we need to both maintain all routines what we can and build new routines according to the changes that have come about so we're using visual schedules i think everyone knows about these these give predictability makes transitions between activities easier helping children deal with changes to routine and encourages independence eventually what's in a routine for a very young child a very structured schedule but for the older it's just a framework you can give choices it allows control which is good for children older children and it also helps them to problem solve it may include learning time imaginative play family time physical exercise as well as free really free time helping in the household the motivation for children is that they get to be around their parents and it teaches them to prioritize what is first and what is then the need tools come before the one tools and some things have a timestamp some things must be done by a certain time right like homework advantages you learn skills the child learns skills and they can increase their self-esteem because their value does help us and they could really help adults if they can actually do some of this helping there's an order to teach children that there's an order to things everything has a beginning a middle and an end and they're finishing tasks so for example a meal you prepare a meal you eat a meal and you clean up after a meal so some of the things that singapore children can do possibly and it depends on the age group and the learning goals are different for the different age groups um so structure fixed areas for certain routines our homes are small so often our eating and learning areas are the same play and leisure may be in the living room in the park downstairs and then sleeping areas good if we could have quiet decreased distractions such as televisions being on good lighting comfortable seating with your feet on the floor flat on the floor for younger children um quiet calm places to sleep in dark decreased toys and screen devices learning time setting realistic expectations so they say grade level so primary 1 times 10 for attention span in minutes so a primary one person would have 10 minutes primary 2 20 minutes for example a quiet place some do well with some heavy work before learning get your water go to the toilet before you start but schedule in some movement breaks split your learning with a big task into smaller chunks it's always helpful to start with something the child is able to do first so that they are encouraged they had to have interesting materials to engage the child if possible and to follow up learning tasks with an enjoyable an activity or free time what about screen time i think that's been talked a lot a lot about it um unfortunately screen time during this pandemic was the main way for young people to learn to talk and to play during the pandemic but we want children to get the most out of using screens it's not a great time a great term because it fails to distinguish the different activities that you use the screen for the advice is to use screen time strategically and we recognize that there is intentional screen time so you talk to your friends you socialize uh you learn and um i think people are saying that children can spend as long as five to six hours on school related work so if you go into the um the the rules of you know two hours per day you're gonna go past it straight away right with just school work but there's also passive um screen time such as watching youtube videos video after video tick tock and people think this might be a waste of time for the brain but i think we have to take into consideration things like free time and downtime for ourselves as well and of our children time management for older children the older they get life skills are important so they have a 4-h rule for teens manage their health so things like eating exercising sleeping hygiene mass shower must brush your teeth homework and then household chores because they can occupy themselves all day but they may be things that we are not so keen on right um one advice was to inspire them set goals let them go into deep dives during this period at home because they are unlikely to ever have a period like that again social media need tools versus one tools again intentional versus passives and i think ultimately does it affect the four ages is an important uh question to ask so the a lot of this advice was from this book which is available online as well uh regulation the last uh strategy um corona virus parenting be realistic about expectations work versus parent versus teachers not easy but i think focus on your relationship with your children versus academic learning children know if there are strains or anxieties at home they can feel it and it reflects in their own function and it's very hard for them to learn well if they're not feeling safe or loved your relationship is probably the precursor for everything else falling into place um it's not easy to be our best selves we need to be extra conscious of our own eating well sleeping well and our own physical activity levels because these impact our mood and our own ability to problem solve stay calm concentrate and focus so um i think getting enough sleep is definitely important uh i think some people said i feel like i'm a teacher principal cruz director laundry janitor chef servant all at the same time so prioritize make sure everyone is safe and basic needs are met and be realistic about what you and your children can realistically accomplish daily so plan it in advance and um if you're feeling that you're threat yelling and throwing tantrums yourself plan uh when you feel upset give yourself some quiet time or time out in the bathroom perhaps be proactive about recharging schedule small amounts of time 15 minutes a source of calm reading exercise creative project yoga whatever works for you when you do lose your cool maybe apologize wait so everyone has calmed down be honest with your kids tell them if you're tired you're hungry you're struggling you're overwhelmed you're sad yourself let them know that you will work hard to do better perhaps involve your kids in problem solving about what can be done differently next time because they are learning from this as well share our misabs find the humor in it because it's our job in the end to model appropriate behavior which is part of co-regulation um so self-regulation is ability to manage our thoughts feelings and actions and in a time like this it's very easy to um not to be dysregulated right things change things take a turn for the worse very quickly being able to self-regulate helps us to remain calm and alert it supports the capacity for us to respond rather to then react to a situation so co-regulation happens from infancy and parents actually do this from very very young so for example when you play with a child and you you do peek-a-boo or jack-in-the-box and it's fighting to the child the first time and the child might cry but your responses to how you respond with the child actually helps him to learn how to regulate when he next uh meets this situation again right so you might he might cry the first time but the second time he might actually um uh because you you say hey look that's so funny and so on and he might not cry the next time and he might laugh instead because you've laughed um so that's the strategy um i think i'm running out of time so teach model practice and praise practice is important a lot of kids know the theory behind why you do certain things but practice is needed for them to be able to respond in the way that you want them to respond or they want to respond and praise is very important praising them when you see the desired behavior or when you see that telling them exactly what it is that they did that was good um so carefully observe your child demonstrate self-regulation yourself difficulties will be encountered share these could this be a lesson show humor teach words to express thoughts and emotions make expectations clear play games with rules and let children make choices and set goals themselves these are calming skills and i think you will know better what works and of course some of them need to be learned as well for children with perhaps autism and these activities may be scheduled as part of the routine for example working in a rocking chair walking watching a preferred video clip or for some children even skimming might be helpful and part of the routine and schedule this has been brought up a lot physical activity it is a proven strategy to reduce anxiety consider establishing and adding basic exercise routines for the family and can be a walk run a cycle downstairs going to the playground or even an online or app based workout so preparing for change giving advanced warning discussing the situation which is changing and evolving talk about what is coming up remind him or her of the positives for example going back to school the friends the familiar candian foods the school bus a favorite teacher perhaps keep as much the same as possible but keep some concerns that he enjoys give choices for the older kids use visual schedules and social stories and you might want to disrupt routine some weekends as a game or as role play and do a practice run and communicate listen to their questions concerns and answer their questions as much as you can changes in the family i think we've all experienced why isn't grandma coming over anymore can we visit her but we've used facetime and zoom birthday parties to help all this connections are very important so fostering connections from a distance because the importance of human contact is very important um going back to school was a big thing and there are a lot of resources out there this is from nuh they have a very nice back school pack wearing a mask wearing a mask can be frightening for some children how can you help how do you help embrace mask wearing and you know even these special masks made for children of uh children with hearing impairment washing hands safe distancing their social stories and schedules out there this was interesting this was from peter vermeulen how do you cope with people not following rules i think i had a girl who came to the clinic and her mom said she's in secondary school actually she said she's um kind of the police in class and she's writing down the the names of all the people who are not wearing their mask properly so i think this is one way of dealing with it most people follow rules but some don't and why don't they do that because people with autism sometimes can't imagine what's going on in another person's mind um mental health is very important so be aware of changing behaviors changes in all the eating sleeping patterns increases in repetitive behaviors worry rumination increased agitation aggression decreased self-care can be signs of anxiety in our children or even in ourselves these are some hotlines and uh websites that are available locally uh this was uh set up by nuh and super hero me as well uh leon foundation life does go on uh we have to do the three we have to be personally responsible do the three w's avoid the three c's so takeaways what works for one family your child may not work for another we know our child or family best and it's okay to try things out and see what works best for your child or your family be kind to yourself your spouse your child your children your family we are in really unprecedented times we are all learning there will be good days and bad days share your load schedule breaks self-care set realistic expectations routines and structure are helpful there are basics which we can go back to work on self-regulation and prepare for the changes ahead and build resilience but the big takeaway is eat well sleep well physical exercise and time in the sun every day if we can build with family relationships with some fun along the way thank you thank you so much i'm dr chu thank you for sharing um all the very very important points for us to to keep in mind um i think one of the takeaways that i get from from this sharing is that um covet 19 will have an impact um in many ways on uh the behavior of both children as well as families and one of the aspects that we will be experiencing more broadly is this this entire aspect of us spending more moments at home so um i think the the wonderful thing about having a forerunner is that uh in many ways dr chu has actually shed many of the same strategies that i will be talking about so i will just be uh picking up on a few of them and um to to spend a little bit more time on them so um i think another thing that i also wanted to add is that um the home environment is uh something that um we will be spending a little bit more time on up in during the the copenhagen situation but um even outside this period of time whenever that will occur uh we will also be spending time at home um during the weekends during school vacations so the strategies that i will be sharing will also be equally applicable during those those periods over there so i think um the other point that i want to add about why this time at home is an important time for many of us as professionals as well as for parents to consider is um that it helps to bridge this sense of learning and let me try to explain how i think this this this bridge is very important um this must have been about 12 years ago uh where i had this little project with um teachers in special schools and what we did was that we had the teachers go back to the homes of their students who have graduated so they paid a home visit um to their to their former students and um what what went on as they came back to share was something which we did not expect what we did not expect was that many of the children um in special schools uh and and this is in the teacher's words had regressed meaning that they had actually stopped using many of the skills that they previously had used them in the classrooms and i think in many ways that got us as an entire team to start thinking about now what what's when uh why why it happened and what can we do differently and for us i think one of the biggest learning is that whatever that occurs in the classroom does not automatically get shared it does not get automatically automatically applied to the home environment and beyond and this is especially so for our students for our children with more significant autism or sometimes also for children with more significant forms of intellectual disabilities so as a result then one of the big take home that i i personally learned and many of the teachers with me was that um this this entire aspect of thinking about how we need to bring these skills this learning to the home environment is a very important one so um the the focus then is is as stated in the title for today which is making the time spent at home count so um i want to share three main ideas today okay but before i talk about that um i want to start with a question for everyone to to consider so i've got a question over here and i will be posting um a poll just to get um that sense oh okay um i'm going to take that back because i've got some i'm not not all the questions are there but um think have a think about it yourself um what is the main role of a parent of a person with special needs uh would that be um that of a co-therapist will the parents role be one as a case manager where they try to see and coordinate what is happening between all the people who are supporting the child is the role one of a transition coordinator to help thinking about now how can i prepare my child for the next um environment is the role of the parent that of an advocate somebody who is going to be there to say you know what um this is what my child needs can we find a way to support my child or is the parents role that as a primary attachment figure okay so i talked about a few um core therapist or co-teacher case manager transition coordinator advocate or primary attachment figure give you three seconds just have a think about that and why i wanted to highlight these roles is because in many ways these are all important roles that we very frequently engage we normally very frequently ask parents to take take some some role in and and for a good reason but for me i think that if i were to ask what is the most important one and i'm now putting on my head as a parent um and as a person who has worked with my parents for a while i would say that actually at the end of the day um first of all everything is important but really if i were to ask myself what would i if i can only choose one what do i think is the most important i will say that at the end of the day we are parents we are the child's primary attachment figure everything else is is isn't good to have but really if there's anything that we cannot not have um it's the parent um as as playing the primary role of a parent um and then i think secondarily uh parents being the advocate this person who is going to speak up for the sheer well-being of the child for the child's interest so i think these are two primary roles that that i think parents should should play so um why why do i think that relationships are so important i think dr chu i talked about that that um this this trust this affiliation that forms from the very early days of childhood is a basic need of individuals if we don't get that in place we know that it will have in particularly adverse circumstances are pretty long-term negative effects so at the very core on this this entire role of parents as as the primary attachment figure is a very important one all of us will need to know that there is someone we can count on all of us will need to know that there is someone that we can trust and in many ways this serves ourselves as the foundation for subsequent relationships that we will be having um later on in life um from a perspective of someone who has worked with children i also and and adolescents as well this this relationship is also very important because when there is this sense of trust it will guide it will help you through i will help the parents through uh the the very difficult moments that um all of us will experience through through different points in life uh i i've seen how a very strong parent-child relationship can have a very important role during the child's adolescence as well so what's what can be done to transform the relationship with the child i want to be sharing three ideas that can make this um home environment count i think the first and i will have a few slides um later you can take a look at that i will for those of you i was told that um this is recorded but for those of you who need to i will also tell you when there is that one slide that summarizes of everything i've talked about so you can either do a screenshot or take a photograph of that at that point in time so but there are three the first is that homes offer a good foundation for life and that and i think that i've talked about that a little bit the second is that i want to talk a lot more about um the role of routines um dr chu has talked about that i think routines are important um and routines additionally also very importantly serve as the home school bridge um that you can be practicing the skills that we have learned in schools and thirdly the planning that planning will further enhance the home environment so let's look at the first homes offer a good foundation for life so i've mentioned earlier that bonds that that are built at home are foundational and and and are important for subsequent relationships um so how can we go about building these relationships um that uh with with our children the first and you will find um on the picture on the right uh that there's a little owl there uh for me that is always uh an acronym for me to think about how can we really understand a child how can we understand the person more um owl is actually an acronym for first observe wait listen so um how then will will uh i think at one level it's it's in trying is in watching and seeing what the child does um sometimes some of our children with special needs do not uh necessarily express themselves verbally but we can also through observations know what they are thinking of what do they like so um observing is a very powerful tool um my second aspect is this entire spec of waiting very frequently for those of us as parents especially um singaporean parents we feel the urge to want to rush and help what i've learned particularly in the in the years in which i've been in the classrooms is that whenever i try i want to do something i have to tell myself to wait wait two seconds wait three seconds and see what the child is doing as long as there is no danger for harm wait and see because sometimes i find that the child actually has um many good strategies um that the child has um his or her sleep and the third is to listen and i know that there are good number of professionals um listening in today as well these two will work for the students in your class on your therapy rooms um these two will work also for any child actually so this this entire aspect of understanding um understanding the child's strengths understanding their child's um uh dislikes um also to understand the child's interest with this itself this will help us through the the sense of interest and strengths help us to especially for children special people with special needs think about now what are possibilities that we can have with them the reality i think if we uh one of the things i do is to read autobiographies of people with on with with special needs that um do well uh one of the things that we very frequently see is that well many will succeed despite having special needs but very few actually succeed uh curing themselves or the special needs so really the lesson for me actually is that and i think for all of us here is that if we know um the strengths if we can build this um the strengths on the interest of the child very frequently we will be able to find uh ways to have the child's strengths give the child future opportunities i think in terms of dislikes as well how can we go about avoiding triggers to difficult situations the second aspect is um praising and affirming the trial i think dr chu too has talked about that i just want to highlight to it two additional aspects the first is that when we are giving uh praise uh one of the things that we want to do is to move beyond just saying oh clever boy you make me very happy um but um to be descriptive i mean i think i think about that not only in terms of from our children but also in terms of us as employees if my boss comes into my office and says you know and say you know what i noticed that um you uh were very good at planning ahead for the event um last week so i think that that will tell me that oh this is something that is good i want to do more of that so likewise when it comes to us work um praising children and affirming children it is in being descriptive [Music] um there is a very helpful ratio called the five is to one ratio uh that is american um but i think there are there are good lessons in that um the five is to one ratio basically um is something that says that every for every one corrective or for every one negative comments that we give we should be actually having in the environment five additional positive and affirmative responses uh for me itself up that is always a challenge particularly i think as a parent i want to be helping my children to do well and for me this this is a constant reminder that um children need to be affirmed and and this this five is the one ratio is a continual challenge to me finally i think in terms of um this this first idea of the we want to be enjoying time together as we spend time with their children so the important thing is not to try to cram into many things particularly when we are home um i find that when i am when i am home uh my guard is down so i i get more impatient so what i've also learned over the years with my two children is that i try to savor the moment to my child i try to go slow not be totally ambitious with things and really to build positive memories together it's very much in line with this five is to one ratio we want to have uh in order to develop this positive relationship you want to be building this positive memories so i think the the the the takeaway then for us is to as parents or as people who might be working parents is to see now what can we do to actually help facilitate very positive relationships between parents and their children that's the first the second is to be thinking about how routines at home offer an excellent opportunity to learn so what are routines routines are well if you look at official definitions or dictionaries sequence of actions which are regularly followed so depending and but the routines that we do can be very different uh for different families very different for children with um of different ages because when we we might be looking at very young infants and toddlers that might be having change routines feeding routines we can be looking at adults with with special needs who can have routines in which they're participating in independently so the the power of routines um is that it occurs every day the power of routines is that it occurs in small steps uh when i used to be working in the homes of children with autism one of the things i or when i was in the classroom one of the things i did was that i spent a lot of time practicing things many times so that um those who are slower learning will have more opportunities to learn uh what i learned later on is that well you very frequently can have the same practice effect if uh we practice them firstly uh uh on a regular basis so that um it occurs during the routines that my very definition happens very frequently like new times like um i'm changing like i'm cleaning up so these are things that occurs very frequently and if they are practiced in the right context then the transfer of learning will be much faster will be much easier so um the the first thing then i'm in in understanding a routine is to be in tapping on this ability of under the power of the routine is to first be intentional what do i mean by being intentional so i want to think about what skills we have that we want to be practicing in a specific routine so um i don't um think that we should be dumping the entire child's ieps into the entire day but one of the things that i might want to do especially if i'm starting is to say well i'm going to start with one routine and then with that one routine i'm going to practice one skill and then as long as i try to practice this skill in every time this routine is being executed it takes place then i find that um we'll have enough practice so for example um if my child if the child is trying to tie their shoelaces um that um that will be practiced every time we have uh um we go out and then we'll have lace-up shoes um or if i'm trying if my child's who are of the my child's um rooty uh skill that we only practicing is in um describing um in a three sentence uh in three sentences whatever is going on then that is something that i might want to be implementing in every other meal time for example so if i do it every other new times i might have two practice sessions every day where the child will have that um practice session put in so if we were to do it twice a day in one week we'll have at least 14 times where the child can get to practice that and i so then i think when we start to have more of these routines uh once the child is doing work well in one routine i'm going to add a new routine where i'm going to put in a second skill so um in doing this intentionally we will start to build in more and more there's what i call school home on transfer skills or therapy home transfer of skills that we can be uh looking at um one aspect of transferring routines uh of practicing skills and routines then it takes more time so i think one important aspect is that we need to be able to slow down to give time for these to occur the third idea is to plan for success i think dr chu talked about it earlier about how we want to be we want to be helping to facilitate these um many skills by by planning ahead by structuring the day and so um likewise for uh to be successful um i think uh one of the things that we can do also is if we can i i do understand that it sometimes gets difficult if we have competing demands among different children but um i think we've talked about too first enjoying time second in terms of using the routines and if you can do it anymore then i'll say my third idea is to say is to think about how can we plan ahead um planning in terms of structuring the day so and i think dr chu has shown a few examples of what it means to be structuring so it can structuring it on the day is very important because it helps the child to know what to expect when to expect and sometimes who the child will be with um and when so this will like what she mentioned uh provide this sense of predictability this has a structure that helps in many ways to reduce the level of anxiety because one of the things that happens together with uh the many of these um stay at home no no no i'm not staying home when we have the circuit breaker is that um there is this sometimes success of anxiety and this sense of uncertainty and so when we are able to actually build in the sense of structure well we may not know what happens next week but we know that um for this week we are going to do three fun things it's going to be a monday on tuesday and on friday and this is when it's going to happen so uh by structuring the week structuring the day uh we are we are able to build in um this structure that can actually help us that will help um the child um or with all the person with special needs to to have some degree of predictability in life another thing that indicated is also special special activities that we can be planning i've talked earlier about how we can use routines another thing that we can also do is to be planning special activities so what you see in the picture below as well i'm planting uh uh or we can be looking i i think during the circuit breaker time we have people who are growing bean sprouts uh we can also have um just sessions in which we're engaging in painting or whatever activities so but the important thing is to choose an activity that is preferred and then use that time again to either practice a skill or teach a new skill um during that time um that as parents we might be learning from teachers or as teachers we can be introducing to parents with with materials so this is um thinking about now if we are professional what can we do to help facilitate i think the last point i want to highlight is that um very frequently uh with um some of these some skills and particularly when i was our children of people persons with special needs grow take a little longer to learn is that um we don't always get to see this rapid progress and we we sometimes get um discouraged um very frequently it's not only us that this gets discouraged but also the person with special needs so i think very importantly what i will say is track the progress uh how do you track progress uh in this day and age it's sometimes just take uh as easy as just taking well um let's have the routine i'm going to take uh my camera and do a short video of that and i'm going to take a video of that again um one month later or two months later if the if the pro we don't see that much progress and then what you will find is that as we start to take videotapes of the routines we will start to see well what kind of changes are we see are we observing and so then that becomes a means for us to see the changes um in a very real way and also um with that take the time to celebrate the success um i think um learning um these skills for our students for people with special needs is not necessarily easy and so we want to acknowledge that so um i think with the la with the um the next slide um um these are basically what i've talked about in in summary uh three ideas for making the home environment so if you want a device that you want to take you can do a screenshot here or you can take a photograph over here okay and i am going to move on uh give you another five more seconds before i move on to my last slide i want to just um end off by saying that the combat 19 is a challenge for many of us um as adults in included many ways is a big storm um and whilst we wait for the for the sunny skies um i think um um be sure to look out for the rainbow uh this this and this rainbow for us is the home environment it offers an excellent opportunity not only in terms of learning but i want to go back again to that key fundamental aspect which is it offers a wonderful opportunity for us to know our children and to develop a long-lasting relationship with them thanks and we now swiftly move to the q a segment of this session and i think everybody can see uh three questions have been fielded so far so we will answer these three now and maybe one or two as time permits um first um i think i can see dr poon reading so we'll give him some time to absorb and digest because these are you know important questions that we want great answers so i could trouble dr chu to perhaps uh maybe you want to summarize or elaborate your response to a mr tsung pingtay on intellectual disability and wearing masks yeah i think i guess your priority here might be just to get the child to wear the mask first before working on understanding i i guess it's the wrong way around in many ways but um i guess the urgent thing especially if with going back to school and so on and going out of the house is to wear a mask so that one um is usually getting familiar with the mask first finding something that uh is acceptable to the person uh to the child so for example letting them choose or you know touch feel smell the mask first finding a fabric mask especially that's comfortable and acceptable to the person um and you may want to if these i i think people are children are sometimes afraid of people wearing masks especially in the hospital situation so you may want to demonstrate wearing a mask on a stuffed toy or a doll or on a parent and you know demonstrate taking off the mask take pictures with it so that the person sees the child sees that it's actually the parent underneath it and you might want to practice wearing the mask for for short periods at home allowing breaks and then maybe wearing it in a non non low demand environment for example a part where you can actually take it off for example and you know being successful and having success experiences is important and being praised for wearing the mask so those are good opportunities to do that when they do it at home and low demand environments before you do it in a high demand environment for example school um yeah i think that that's about it yeah thank you dr chu i you know those are principles that i know but somehow when you say it makes more sense now dr poon over to you not sure which question you want to go for but i think too uh for you please take it away okay let's let's start with uh the third question by jessica that uh that was asking how can teachers support children with special needs better in classrooms um i think with regards to that um the first i'll say uh at least based on what we have i've shared today um the first is to first of all develop a positive relationship with the child have the the students um um trust you um let me just share one one one one story uh because once i was um during when i was still training uh to be a psychologist um i was um in an acute psychiatry unit and at that time i had a young man with autism who came in and it was a tough time for him this was in singapore because he was very stressed by being admitted and he started hurting himself so they were very worried about him and they wanted to make sure that he wasn't hurting himself so they wanted to send him for um a scandal said um eeg which were actually involved wearing a net and they were going to sedate him for the purpose with with him because i was the i i i i had not go and gone in there as a as as a special educator but um because i've worked with children in autism before um quite a lot of time i spent in the unit was spent working with him and we had this understanding and there's this trust with each other and so um at the end of the day uh what i did was basically to read him a story um and um that because he was with someone whom he was comfortable with someone that he trusted and there was an an activity to engage it um we actually did the entire procedure without um any the need for um anything else so um i think the the big piece that i took back from that is that um this this this entire aspect of having this relationship of trust uh with your students is very important uh because when when you try when your student trusts you um you'll find that you are able to do a lot more um and and for me itself when my students trust me a lot more uh trust me i find that i can take i can push the boundaries a little bit more and and get them to do things that they sometimes might be anxious to try out on their own so that's the first the second is the same things that we've talked about that parents can do at home predictability so uh just keeping in mind that not everyone understands the class timetable the same way as the rest of the children in the class so depending on the needs of our students in the class uh the students with special needs in their class we might sometimes find that you know they may not understand so um with some students with uh with special needs we might need individualized schedules to give them a sense of now what's going to happen next um this can sometimes take the form of a full day schedule in the class or sometimes it's just a what's next schedule so and not all my children uh all children especially needs know how to read um i can use objects i can use photographs um that helps them to know what what is going to happen next or what are the two activities that are going to happen next i think the third thing is uh use the part same thing use the power of routines very frequently if i'm a teacher in the class i may not have the time to do that one to one but at the same time if i know that you know what um the the parent is saying that the therapist might have taught the child something or the child might be in an early intervention program elsewhere that um has um that they've learned a few new skills these are things that we can be practicing in in some classroom routines as well so i think um i'm hoping that this this um might be able to uh might be ways in which we can share uh we can be applying some of the same routines and the same talk under the same ideas i've shared in classroom environments um with regards to the first question sean do you want me to answer this as well if you could not sure okay how can we support um students with special needs uh for hbl how can schools support students better i have to say that this is an answer that we are still i mean right in the middle of research in um actually uh we hope to be able to find out i hope to be able to share at some point in time with data that we are we're actually i'm gathering from singapore but um if i were to make an educated professional um guest with this um how can we go about supporting this uh how can we go about supporting our students um i think the first aspect is that um uh whether from from a parental standpoint you recognize that um very frequently when our schools go into home-based learning teachers are caught unaware uh so um teachers too are scrambling so as a result um it's it's teachers don't always manage to to customize uh the the activity for on the the student special needs so i think the first i the first aspect then is to have a very good um and clear open channel of communication between the parents and the school uh because um what you will find is that you know what um some you just try i mean uh when when i went into hbl uh when the university went hbl um i had to convert the six hour seminar into uh online um so um we we are all um scrambling and so for that reason i can understand what teachers um go through so i think it's having that sense of of um communicate of communication with the parents um i think that's the first the second is to um i think be flexible and um to not be afraid to make tweaks to what what we are going to achieve uh what we will find is that uh uh with with hbl some of the students with special needs may not be able to achieve um some of what some of what we are trying to do independently um in fact during hbo i was talking to um a participant of my study and she was saying that she was um this is the parents she was struggling so hard because um all the hbo activities involved reading and her uh this this parent's daughter has dyslexia so um what it meant was that the parent actually has to sit um with the parent um to really uh uh the parent has to sit with their child in order to make sense of what what is being read so um i think um to be aware um of some of these difficulties and then to maybe say well um maybe um for this um lesson we can say that well there is just this one aspect that we want to be covering and so differentiating it slightly and then negotiating it and then i think um over time you'll find that you're more able to do that ,True,True,False,False

Google+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/101828483855692460629",happy to be in front of you guys exactly so close to my heart that it's a great day for me today and also because of course for those who live in Singapore you know phase two is starting today so it's two big reasons for for a great day okay so what is the agenda for today today we're going to look at brands and audience impacted during The Cove eat right so the big picture is looking at behaviors and concept consumption patterns and that have happened drink of it and I'm gonna explain you why and how in a minute okay so moving to next so that's what I said we're gonna look at brand performance audience impact and of course there would be room for your questions at the end I'm gonna go quite quickly through a lot of data so feel free to ask questions whenever you want quick introduction about myself who is this French guy I've been a student at exact a long long time ago now 98 to 2002 and I was privileged enough to live in Singapore for one year at the end of a sack at that time there was no campus in Singapore but but still I had chosen Singapore to to do my last hindered internship I worked at Nielsen after that for those who do all of you don't know it's a it's a market research company and this is where I started my career and since then I've always remained a fervent believer of market research and started in a basis division you're working for Unilever money and then I was in charge of pricing input folio for Europe and then this company whom I had never known of contacting me called YouGov UK market research and asked me to start the French in Paris so I became the CEO of myself actually in France I grew the team for a few years then added Spain and Italy as new new markets and I joined the region two years ago where we had been established for about five years this is about me and enough about me now I'm gonna move quickly about talking about you gob what is you got who is your government how are we collecting all the data and gathering the information you're gonna see later so we are a data and analytics company and the principle is very simple we have online panels proprietary panels across the world in 44 countries to be very accurate close to 10 million of people and we are gathering information about those panelists on a continuous basis right so it's either specific survey studies for specific projects but we also have a continuous stream of data coming to us because we are basically asking questions every day and the good point about having 10 million panelists is you don't need to ask everyone a question every day of course so we we kind of switch between people just to give you an example we interviewed 14 40 million people last year only so we really have a lot of data and of course we keep this data we keep track of this data so in some markets we have more than 10 years of history are of data around brands for instance I'm not going to talk into details about what we're doing but basically when once you get this data there's several ways you can distribute the data I can either do a pop on presentation but we have a lot of tools that actually give you access real-time to this data so most of our clients are actually accessing the data real-time and manipulating the data themselves might have heard about you gob you gob is not as big as the others Nielsen observes and so on but we are very very active on the on the median news side the most quoted research agency in the UK and we are tackling a lot of topics and we are not only attacking business topics but we're doing political public opinion overall and this is what allows us to be to be published across the global and in the region in particular okay enough about you go of and now let's go through what we have collected during and Co vide and cross the globe so the way we are positioned during covered is a priority is to serve the public good we are collecting a lot of data and this data is mostly dedicated to public instances public institutions governments and we want to also give everyone the ability to have free access to this data what kind of data are we collecting we are collecting behavioral data about public health and about symptoms behaviors and this data is really dedicated to those public organisations and policymakers we are working very closely with the Imperial College in London and this data is actually used to study the pattern of those behaviors right are our people following the public policies are they wearing a mask are they likely to do that in the future are they happy about it or not right so this is really managed to to observe actually the application of the public policies but also to adapt the speech when you're one of those institutions we've got a whole lot of data as well that is dedicated to the public you everyone every one of us i excessive ellonija on our website and we're tracking a lot of countries about those those behaviors and of we are still a business company so there's a lot of this data that would be selling to our customers and clients across the globe okay so today we're going to look at two kind of pieces of information one is a global tracker specifically focused on curve in 19 and we've been running this tracker actually starting in Asia since February right so we asked questions around curve it every week and we are asking those questions now in something like 29 markets but as I said previously we are also collecting data on a lot of other topics right on behaviors on brand consumption and it's been the case for years and years so what we can assure you in the next few slides is a combination of those data how how this lets say traditional kind of collection of data how is the brand story that we have been collecting for years impacted by the curve it okay so first let's look at brands and if you examples across the globe the first point and you guys have been for sure very exposed to that is brands are communicating a lot during during curvy and actually a lot of the people this is a UK data believe that brands are over communicating so so first information for most of the marketers be careful about over communication and people are are claiming and showing that that they've had a bit enough right also on top of the the frequency or the amount of communication there's content itself right so a lot of the of the consumers of the population actually it's 43 percent of the total population believe that those messages are not authentic so especially during curvy we hear a lot about this word so much and probably too much we have to be very careful about the the authenticity sorry of them message then more specifically what consumers fed up off they're fed up about some of those expressions that I think we've been all guilty to use a lot not only as marketers but also in a daily communication so we are all in this together unprecedented it's gonna be the new normal of course those messages are resonating be negatively at the moment I might add stay safe because okay let's stay safe at some point it's been too much so something to keep in mind and of course that we are tracking over time okay now let's go into the specific examples of brands and how brands are communicated during kovat so first one is the UK insurance might know this brand I didn't know but Advani's could Admiral it's a auto insurance band and well what they've said actually doing kovetz around a phone you can see the dates at the bottom of the chart is that they would actually give some cash back to everyone because during lockdown you drive less so you drive less you should be paying less and those calls are actually birth scores so this is the question is have you heard something positive or negative about the brand and this is a net score so this is the net positive score and you can see the bust scores are rocketing high alright so the minute they announced that they will be giving money back a very targeting message very on purpose very to-the-point the impact the impact is is huge so you can see that on the purple line the the pink line is the average of the rest of the insurance sector and you can see this effect was only for for this brand quick a party on this one the way we do that as I said is we are asking question about hundreds hundreds of brands around the globe every day so it just allows us to track the very meaningful events and the specific date started that could have ended an impact on anything on the brand right on the bars and purchase intent whatever you might want to track so moving on now to another example with me oh yes sorry not only the buzz has been impacted but a lot of other measures right attention word-of-mouth and as you can guess customer satisfaction so of course the point is not only to generate buzz but to influence those metrics that will have an impact on your brand brand image or also purchasing that or consideration another example closer to us prudential in singapore prudential in singapore I've announced as many other instruments companies that they would be supported those infected with the virus but they went beyond that they actually said they would be supported all those affected by the by the virus those who have to stay at home because a family member has been infected those who have had an impact in their job and this message has resonated very positively among the population if you can see the purple line and this is for potential same the birth score so basically did you hear something positive about this brand yes significantly about financial and you can see all the big insurances in Singapore also have communicated generated some positive effects but less so than Prudential what do of course always forget the animations buzz is fine but of course they also managed to generate positive positivity around attention reputation and very important for them and all brands are purchase intent what do we have next supermarket in Singapore as well shanks young what the deed is actually in q1 as as many companies they shared there are financial statements and they announced they were making a lot of profit and they were able to make a lot of profit because consumption was good Chinese New Year all of that I had a very positive impact on their numbers and when curve it started to hit the region more significantly they announced that they would share those profits with the employees and again here you can see the impacts on those very clear very immediate and of course way higher the sector average in Singapore and here even more so the impact has been massive on their KPIs right impression which is what you think about the brand reputation as in Azzam as a potential employee would you be proud or or not to work for this company and recommendation would you recommend the brand to 2ne1 very very massive impact and thus are very well done to them another example of the this daily tracking and how actually brands have leveraged the curve in 19 here yet back in the day so back in the days like about two years ago there was a Royal Commission that issued a very negative report on Australian banks so it was around March 2018 you can see that this report had a negative effect on the big four banks big four brand CBA and Zed NAB and Westpac the buzz went down the reputation went down impression Wyndham but during kovat those banks announced that they would actually implement some measures to support and give incentives around mortgages loans and help people actually in this difficult situation so very positive impact and and as you can see this is only now actually so two years after the Royal Commission that those banks come back to where they were before the very negative buzz impact and reputation impact of the the Commission as burden never works alone you can you can see as well it had an impact on value on quality of the services on customer satisfaction and on recommendation so those messages really matter and those commercial strategies actually we're very successful last example I think in terms of the brands themselves actually not last there's another one after that is going to Europe this time so Germany in Germany the government set up some measures and said that actually the small businesses would benefit from rent cuts right so at the fact that those were Street retailers would have to pay less on low rents big brands announced or we're known to take advantage of those cuts and you can see in green what happened to added us when when people found out that they would stop paying their rent and benefit from this measure the buzz score went crazy low right this is a huge decrease on the other side and actually the others as well right but adidas was more frontline in this in this event later on around early May those big brands and notes that actually no they will not they would refuse to benefit from the government subsidy but it was too late it was too late and not enough and they are not going back to where they were and it's also something very important to measure right the buzz is happening all the time whenever a brand is saying whatever happens in the market that is probably out of their control there will be a positive or negative bus that's fine but the key question is actually how positive or how negativities and how long does it last how long does it last before I come back to normal does that affect actually what people think about me or what people consider in their in their purchasing patterns okay this one I'll be quite quick on this chart but this is just to show you actually that what I was showing so far is very big picture right very big picture about what people think and so on but then you can you can do a deep dive and specific audiences in particular so let's say Wow who are those current customers of adidas who have a positive impression of the brands and you can you can link further and look at what what sports they follow what actually club their fans are off by and moon turn you can as you can imagine what they are interested in and so on and this as a marketer would give you the ability to to kind of fine-tune your message right to craft your message the right audience and see how to actually target better those those groups last this time is the last one last brand example McDonald's in Singapore those again you live in Singapore you've heard that Singapore had to close magnum Astoria to close all their restaurants because one of their staff was infected and actually you can see of course that this had this has had an impact on everyone when you hear that a brand is closing their restaurants for health reasons everybody was concerned actually those were afraid of the curvy but also those were not afraid of the kovat then when McDonald's did is they actually despite the new face are of circuit breaker they've waited to reopen the restaurant they've said we are not going to reopen now we want to wait a little bit further and you can see that this has been received very positively by the population again by everyone but this was a smart move from from McDonald's actually as I said the buzz is going to be very reactive right whatever you say whatever appears in the press the bus is gonna move up or down but then if you look at those metrics that are harder to to leverage like consideration purchase intent you can actually see that during the closure of the restaurant the consideration didn't go down that much it didn't go down that much of course naturally people less considered to go they could they could actually not but then again with the the smart move and actually a very sensible move the consideration went back up and and is currently at the same level as it was before the closure of those restaurants same here we can look at the consumers of the population through different segments and if you want to have more insights about those Singaporeans who are afraid of contracting the the curve in nineteen you can see that they are more likely to say that the government should play a dominant role in the economy the supports and they are more more likely to support the surveillance to fight crime they are following the S League more than others they are more likely to consider Pizza Hut for instance and so on and so forth so again what we are trying to bring to light with this data is not only the big picture trends but then the way we can differentiate those audiences the way we can describe them in a more granular way right it's not only about age or where you live but it's it's actually about what you think what brings you by what kind of media you are consuming as well and you can go a bit deeper into that by the financial attributes they are investing they believe that investing is too risky they prefer to invest in gold and watches and wine for instance so all of that is going to also help to craft a message if you want to address this specific segment of the population and they of course believe that being insured for everything is important or more they believe that more than the others okay now we've looked at brands or specific brands in particular we can also look at the total sector how do we do that while in a given sector will always be tracking about 30 brands and we just agree agree aggregate the data sorry so from left to right you have schools starting from December to last month's to May and you can see that some sectors have suffered during curvy right some sectors have been more effective in terms of lack you to purchase airlines as you can guess I've been massively affected you can see the difference between December and January automotive as well the market has suffered very very clearly fashion retailers personal care as well weren't we a lot of people communicated a lot on the fact that that retail was doing well that ecommerce was actually doing well actually not all categories right personal care well when you are stuck at home you are less likely to be willing to to buy a personal care items and you probably need them a bit less when you are isolated but this pattern is not true for all sectors so again in Indonesia in particular we saw an increase in interest for interest and likely to purchase cooking in ingredients household care clean your house more internet it's a it's a big sectors where you've got the likes of Facebook tik-tok and so on so of course much more attention in news edge in those sectors and and finance in particular insurances right so not all sectors have been equal during curve Eid and and of course the data would be different from one market to another in particular in terms of timing right there's a clear impact of the timing itself of the lockdown okay so enough about the brands now we can move to something more broad actually in terms of what what population think and feel during covered right how is it effect affecting sorry their health and the perception are of the future how do we collect this information I quickly told you a bit before but we are actually interviewing people in 29 countries I think about 10 in a pack and we are interviewing those people every week because we want to be to track those changes when external events happen right so the data we're going to see has been collected since February and we're going to look at the last five wave so what happened between metaphors and early June okay so this first one is a is a broad question what people feel about the situation is the situation according to you getting better or getting worse and bettering blue/green getting worse in pink you can see that actually the the response is the answers across markets are quite different but two of them stand out India and Indonesia where we have a majority of the population telling us that the situation is getting worse and then it's going to span between five and twenty percent depending on the countries right so Singapore is it 15 Hongkong 15 on on getting worse but the the majority of the markets are really seeing an improvement and are confident that the situation is improving except India and Indonesia [Music] so if we do a deep dive into Indonesia and we look at those people that are concerned that the situation is getting worse who are there right who are they and how do they compare so there are numbers on their data is expressed in in red and they are compared to those who are thinking that the situation is getting better they are majority of women there's more women that believe the situation is getting worse and if you think about it in Indonesia a lot of the sectors where women are overrepresented in terms of the workforce manufacturing textile and so on those sectors have been badly and severely affected by it so it makes sense that women are more worried it's not the case in all markets right in some markets men are much more worried the younger you are the more worried you are actually which is not common as well right there's a lot of markets where actually the younger population is much less worried about the situation and the future but in Indonesia the the younger folks are more worried and in terms of level of education it's across the board whether you went to university or not you you are more worried right I'm not going to give you all the details but again it gives you a picture of those dynamics of course something that has been circulating a lot in the press is the damage on the economy itself so we've seen health but now we're talking about the economy a lot of articles are quantifying the impact the impact in terms of whether there would be a recession how bad is it gonna be how much the economy is going to shrink so of course those news are affecting what the population thinks but not only not only those news on the desk clear effects visible effects are on the economy and today so when we ask people what they think and if they if they there will be a recession in the next 12 months actually the the majority of people think that there would be a recession right across the whole region of a pack and men as well actually much more in a pack than in Mena as you can see because in a pack we are ranging between 50 and 70% of the population the exception in Asia is China actually the Chinese are much more optimistic about about the economy and about the rebound of the economy and actually other markets in a region are quite pessimistic Hong Kong is the most pessimistic with 79 percent expecting a reception recession and and just behind Singapore Thailand and Malaysia are also in the 65 to 70 percent when we ask one when we display the other part of the question which is what percent of people believe actually that the economies will be growing in the upcoming years you can see actually that very few people believe that again much more optimism in UAE and KSA optimism in China and to give you a benchmark because we are asking those questions across the globe this number rises to 25 percent in the US so there's no clear link probably in how you feel about the economy and the actual health situation in a country because the u.s. is still a country where there are a lot of cases and we can't say it's it's under control yet the population is much more optimistic than in Asia where in a lot of the markets actually did the epidemic at the Panda me has been has been controlled very well um a bit further on this topic so how do you think that you are activity the business activity at your place of work has been affected again here I'm not gonna go through all those numbers but it's right here that the activity has been reducing it's very Inspira when you look at the data in Indonesia or in India back to what we were saying in terms of the confidence in the future but it's really across the board those who are actually saying less that that the activity has decreased are China Australia and even Hong Kong right if you think about the lockdown in Hong Kong the conscious netted market has never been in a full lockdown so so of course if you look around you and people are going back to the office you have you are less likely to say there's been a decrease in the activity job security again as you can imagine people are not very optimistic about their jobs but where is it that people feel the less secure about the future but there are jobs this Thailand 49 49 % does UAE the DM right 56 percent actually and we can see that actually the rest of a pack and Mina is between 35 and 45 percent again here Mort amazing optimism in China and in Australia where only 22 percent and 71 percent of the people feel less secure about their job this one is also to show that there's not only negative during the curve it and actually the situation is improving and the perception is improving as well right so we are tracking and those sentiments on a weekly basis and you can see that actually in some markets we have a stability in the Indus situation actually the situation is improving like in Australia and China because the situation has been control or started earlier in China there's more optimism optimism now in terms of our of the future and safety on jobs if you compare that now to Singapore you can see it's not the case yet in Singapore and again it's quite easy to understand right the circuit breaker has just ended we're just starting to consider resuming business activities on on the broad range and of course there's still a lot of concerns about job security right how is the economy going to bounce back how are we going to compensate those who have been affected and actually how fast we will be able to reopen to to go back to something that would be closer to normal if we same thing as earlier with Indonesia but if we do a deep dive into Singapore and we want to understand who are those people concerned about job security we can see here this time that males are more concerned and than females 43 percent versus 39 and this is the other way around in terms of our generation right so the baby boomers are actually much more concerned than the Millennials and in terms of work status it tends to affect more those who are working part-time and we can easily understand that people are also more worried about being able to pay for everyday essentials and of course they are claiming that they are spending less for instance on online purchases right they are they are trying to save or not be able to spend we also ask another question which is compared to 1 months ago how has your outside financial situation changed right and you think that your situation has improved in purple or do you think that situation is worse in pink the majority of course of the markets that we are studying in APAC and mina are saying that the situation is is getting worse on the situation is getting worse and worse actually but if you look at the trends well first of all if you look at at the markets specifically they don't have the same level of concern right some some are more concerned than than others but also the trends is positive because we are asking this question every month we can see actually that there's more and more people saying that the situation has improved every week sorry and there's less and less people saying that the situation is worse right so we are still not jumping in the streets and and being very positive and happy about all of that but but it's getting better and there's a bit more confidence as we progressed in the crisis other things again that we are covering and looking at and where you will see that there's differences across markets is actually how the curve eats context has changed the behaviors how is it has it changed to behaviors in different areas right so a lot of people of course are saying that they have actively reduced there are no non-essential expenses relied more on savings some that have taken on more depth to cover expenses but you can see it's interesting to look at the differences across markets so actually more similar poems and Malaysians are drawing on savings to cover expenses as compared to the other countries the Indonesians are those who are the most likely to have reduced non-essentials re-expanded charges about 70% of them and there's also a large portion of Thais and Indians who have taken on more debt last line now deep dive into Australia so how is it how is the curve it going to change your behavior in terms of the lifestyle right so there's of course a lot of changing in how we are behaving today and and now trying to face the recession but also it's change probably the perception that we have are of the world we've got 74 percent of the Australians or claim that they will support the local businesses much more they are also saying that they will take more local holidays right there's a dual factor in that a dual combination of the fact that yeah you can't really travel so you have to have to be more local but there's also a need and an and wish to support the local economy I'll be buying more green or sustainable sustainable produce for instance quite significant number of people 50 percent will use cash less in the future so interesting to see that and again would be good to compare across markets I can't wait to go on vacation holidays overseas I'm sure it's applying to a lot of people and rough people in Singapore in particular but yeah of course there's a lot of people who are still considering and and looking very much for what to go overseas and so on and so forth so this is the the kind of data we are able to look at very happy to take questions and hopefully I'll be able to answer because my team is not around me so I'll be probably not able to go into too many details party my heart and I was very very happy when you finally be open yes like signs of optimism going back to the more I want my people back yes so we're going to questions right now there we actually have an OHA start off with one of my own first uh it sounds actually early in your presentation about over communication friends through the Italian audiences in your personal opinion do you think it's too many messages are going to the audience or is it maybe one message there's actually go into too many channels of communication to these audiences in that case what we were able to see it's mostly that the content of the message was too similar right it was similar across the brands and people were just fed up because in terms of media activity actually in communication it's not increased right it's not true that brands have been communicated more and if anything they've been communicating less actually because a lot of brands have cut their advertising budget the problem and the feedback from from from humours where that the message is we're all the same we're all the same and for too much and probably too long on the same scene so that that's what we've been able to see so another question that we have is have you seen a positive buzz around brands that donate relevant products to fight Kovach 19 like LVMH manufacturing hand sanitizer does it that's a very good question we I don't have the data with me but in those cases what matters is the way it's been communicated we've had similar cases in the past where actually if the company is seen to have had an authentic and genuine approach it's going to have a positive effect right if the company's seen to have just kind of surfed on the trend the effect is going to be negative we've studied that a bit more precisely on on black lives matter for instance right on black lives matter matter some companies have been seen to be acting in reacting very well and others with the same message I've been judged very negatively so I don't have the data with me but this is definitely something then that we can look at all on a daily basis with specific brands in mind and looking at how much press as relayed the message and whether the buzz actually has been positive or negative next question that we have is does Yuka actually see an increase in business doing coffee 19 it's we are actually the fact that we are an online company right we are only online we've been much less affected than our competitors do we see an increase in business well I wish we would but but no I mean a lot of our clients are actually posing a lot of their investment so the good thing is of course we are not only selling data related to advertising or business effectiveness and a lot of clients are actually interesting to understand what people to think more broadly but yeah I would say we've been much less affected than our competitors but to see yeah not not an increase in business no we're not there yet especially we have is have you compared your Kovach data with other crises such as SARS or even the financial crisis are these reactions similar question I know you have I've seen some some articles around that what I remember from from this data is actually the main difference as you can guess is that this crisis is a global and has been actually affecting every country every brand every market at the same time or roughly at the same time while actually the other crises have been much more staggered or localized what we have studied in particular is the way the population has reacted and we were comparing for instance the way the population was reacting to public messages around wearing masks and so on and again here because of the mass effect and because of the globalization of the messages because of the fear actually that it was not only something local but it was touching everyone we've seen a much bigger reaction to those messages actually those message messages have been much more followed than during the previous crisis especially half is how do you make the separate impact of events such as security laws and Kobe 19 in Hong Kong there could be biases in the survey invitation totally actually we don't and I would say you should not because at the end of the day what is important is to understand the consumer feelings at a certain point of time the consumer reaction the consumer reaction in a certain point of time is never affected by only one thing if you think about bus for instance bus is this very general question have you heard something positive or negative about the brand this positiveness or negativeness can be coming from many things right it can be coming from financial statements issued by those companies an article in the press about a bad experience in a McDonald's restaurant advertising so there's always a combination of positive and negative messages and then we are able to look at the net effect however though if we want to differentiate what we are looking at is the trend right so the trend if you think about the context in Hong Kong those the social unrest has been happening for many months and of course we'd be seeing spikes when those events are more visible but if you have two events happening exactly at the same time I think what is important is to understand the net effect we really often get those questions from from clients and I'm a firm believer that actually we always have to think that as as an individual or as a consumer I'm always reacting to multiple messages if you want to assess the impact of your advertising you absolutely need absolutely need to take into account the fact that the context is changing the context is changing all the time so your advertising could be great but if there's bad press at the same time you can have an effect that is that is a bit more negative so so long answer to a short question but I would say we shouldn't try to isolate too much this way is to isolate right you can ask many many questions follow-up questions in pinpin point but to me the net effect is really what is important in driving marketing strategies so this is a last question from our participants he's asking if you have any insights on consumer readiness to adapt to a more digital lifestyle such as going you're using remote work online shopping payments post-crisis yes we've done a lot of surveys actually around this topic both internally in this kind of tracker but as you can guess we also have clients asking those kind of questions we have also linked who is the press to understand that I invite you guys to look at the yuga of asia-pacific LinkedIn page because there's actually some data around that and I've got some data from France recently so the big picture is like a lot of people have embraced the work from home concepts a lot of people have embraced that and when we started tracking and surveying and she did those people everyone was enthusiastic right there was probably a couple of weeks of adaptation and people were very enthusiastic about it what we can see now is that it starts to this to be a fatigue around that so people are telling us in a nutshell yes I want the work from home to be part of the new defaults but I can't do that all the time and there's actually another layer of fear because a lot of companies have been announcing that they would keep working from home for many months until probably the end of the year and more and know people are a bit scared about it because they realize somehow what they've lost if you're interested I can share more data because we have published some of this data actually across the globe Thank You Julian this ends our Q&A session I'd like to thank Julian for taking the time out to speak about this topic and for sharing such interesting insights we got a call with my team from his companies to bring the data thank you everyone thank you very much my pleasure to be here with all the ASIC folks thank you guys this whole webinar thank you very much participants as well and I wish you all great year hey

signal here i want to tell you i love you and i'm so excited about talking about self-love knowing that true love gives before we get into that i just want to say thank you for tuning in we're going to be doing this monthly and if this encourages you please make sure that you send this onward when we upload this for other people to watch as well we want to let you know that god loves you and he has a plan for you and i just want you to know that you know as human beings we we use that term love a lot right and and like i love this i love that but i really love my wife i love my kids i love god and god loves me like you know this salad is awesome i'm like in the restaurant thinking no god is awesome right not your salad and so like when we use these words you know um we we must understand though what is closest to god's heart is his love for you god whose thoughts and ways are way higher than owls he's the alpha and omega the the beginning and the end he created everything that we saw everything that we don't see right and and and he still cares for us that's right he even sent his son jesus christ to die for us and that big love is understanding that we are loved because of who god is and how he sees us as his children and even though i can love my kids sometimes sometimes they don't feel like loving themselves or even us as adults right like when we mess up we don't really love ourselves as much or we look at the media and you see these perfect people and success and this and that and you're like oh i'm single i need to be loved i don't think i'm ever going to marry anyone right and we don't really love ourselves we we judge ourselves we're actually not even our best friend we're our worst enemies sometimes of just letting those negative thoughts not be captured and replaced with truth but these little negative thoughts that that lies and fear spreads into our heart thinking about man well who am i if i don't do that then really what's my value if no one really cares for me maybe that's just a perception then maybe i'm unlovable and i want you to know with especially in 2021 where depression isolation addiction and even thoughts of suicide have really doubled in from what i'm hearing anyway i just want you to know that first of all i love you they call me the hugging machine right i've hugged so many people my arms have fallen off and i want you to know that i do love you and i don't know who you are i don't know your name don't know where you're watching from i'm actually hearing that we got people from india canada us uh watching and even england right now and it doesn't matter where you're from and what you look like or anything and how you're different than anybody else you're uniquely made there's not another you and god loves you and so do i why because there is no one that i can lay my eyes on that god doesn't love jesus died for the world and if i believe that he did die for me i then have the accepting love of jesus christ no matter how i look because he died for me before i was born right he knew my name before the earth began and that's the incredible insurmountable love that he has for us and so how do we know how do we love ourself how do we do that in a righteous way what does it even mean to have self-love because you see so many people out there saying you know you need to do this you need to do that and you know you need to love yourself and but you know some people might say but you need to do this and this and this before we really accept you right but what does the bible say about first of all loving yourself galatians 5 14 says love your neighbor as you love yourself this verse is telling us that the key to loving yourself is treating others the way you would want to be treated in other words true love gives i've actually met people who love others more than they love themselves what we must understand is not everyone has actually experienced love not everyone knows how it feels to be in someone's loving arms maybe they didn't have a loving home maybe i'm talking to you and i want you to first of all understand that loving yourself is not about having this ideology or the perfect life or the perfect image or body or the perfect friends right i want you to know that the key is really to love those around you when you can see them as god sees them because that's how god sees you when we get our eyes off of ourselves and focus on others not our own problems not our own challenges and what we think we need to do next it's just accepting the love of god in how we are he says come as you are and when we find that love of god we realize we don't have to be depressed and and those thoughts of feeling like oh my goodness i can't do this on my own that truth then helps you understand god i need you in every area of my life help me to know your love that i may also be able to see not just how i look on the outside and judge myself by what i've done but because i'm your child and then also then to see that that unconditional love as we pursue god in our post relationship it's one other thing to first of all love god but then love your neighbor as yourself it's because other people maybe haven't found that love of god and when you have found that love of god you not only accept the good and the bad and the ups and downs of life knowing that god will carry you when you cannot even walk but then it's that amazing opportunity for you to reach out to someone else and love them as if you're giving them what you would give to yourself if you will loving yourself and i want you to know that as you know i was born without arms and legs and when i was young i didn't like the way that god made me i didn't love myself i couldn't see a future for myself i wondered if i'd ever have friends who really accepted me i never thought that any cute girls would ever want to date me let alone marry me but i learned something when i got my eyes off myself and put my focus on others my own limitations and my apparent ugliness began to fade i know those are strong words but i feel like we all go through those insecurities and i want you to know that those insecurities we i think we all go through that and i'll never forget when i first spoke in front of a small crowd of people i was scared my palms were sweaty my knees were shaking you know what would they think of me right and then all of a sudden while i'm speaking i'm like i don't even know what i'm really talking about i'm just being real right and authentic and just letting people know that i love them all of a sudden there was a girl that just started crying and the whole room started moving and and they were they were like people whispering and hugging each other while i was talking and all of a sudden a girl put up a hand and she's just uncontrollably crying she said i'm so sorry can i come up there and give you a hug and in front of everyone she came and she hugged me and she whispered in my ear thank you thank you thank you no one's ever told me that they love me no one's ever told me that i'm beautiful the way that i am and that's when i knew that i needed to start living my life looking at what god did give me not what he didn't give me then i began to use the little i had to help others acceptance friends self-worth and self-loved their self-love they're in followed look we know that in the bible it says it's better to give than to receive and i want you to know that for me there is this instigated purpose in all of our life that sometimes it takes time to seek god and it's it's a pursuit after him to say god if you really are there if you really have a plan for me if you really have a purpose for me please reveal yourself to me and guess what the bible also says that when you seek him you will find him so my friend i want you to know that there is an unconditional source of love for you out there and it's from god first and and and jesus when you read this and you pursue this love of jesus um you actually see that jesus in matthew 22 even had a greater concept where he tells us three things we are to love love god love others and love yourself and he said that in that order too and so to understand that when you find the love of god and you're almost like rescued from this prison and you were captive from fear anxiety feeling like a failure fear of rejection being rejected maybe even your failures where you feel like you're in a prison of shame right now you're in a prison of feeling like you're condemned by god no we know that those who are in christ jesus are not in condemnation god loves you and his love pursues you even if you're running a million miles an hour in the wrong direction of god's perfect plan guess what god can run faster than you my friend and there is no sin that he cannot forgive no chain that he cannot break no depression that he cannot lift off and i want you to know that that you can pray and know that god is listening to you keep on seeking him friend and you will find him love god and in loving god it helps me to love others and help them turn to that love of god that rescued me i want you to know that when you feel desperate you go into despair and and and thoughts of suicide it's almost like you feel like there is nothing good left in you thoughts have given up it just feels like there is no strength left in you when i was young i had those thoughts i thought i was just a burden to my parents i thought i would never have friends i thought i was the alien i began to consider suicide but god's love swallowed up my feelings of self-hatred of self-condemnation of self-isolation of me writing my own hope off but man thank god i was wrong he always has a plan that's what god says that's when you know what's in your head is it lined up with the bible or not because his word the bible told me that i am fearfully and wonderfully made just the way that i am his word told me that he had a plan for me plans to prosper me and not to harm me his word told me that i could do all things through christ who strengthens me knowing and loving god gave me strength and the boldness to love others loving others gave me the self-worth instigating purposeness and me being an instrument in his hand as a child of god to go and rescue my brother or my sister which actually was the one thing that i longed for fulfillment loving myself made me a usable vessel in god's hand because god gave me every chance but it was me giving god a chance to allow me to know and understand his great love for me and everyone around me including my enemies that's right loving others praying for my enemies that doesn't mean that i have to be friends with my enemies but praying that god would lift up the scales of their eyes that god would bind their evil deeds against me but i would still pray for their soul not immediately after they harm me sometimes it took me 10 years to forgive some people and i'm the evangelist it's when you know i'm just like i'm just like you we all have ups and downs we all have doubts we all go through different seasons of our life but who knew that god would use a man without arms and legs to be his hands and feet and i want you to know that if it's maybe you today finding it hard to love yourself i want to pray with you right now i want to pray that god himself will reveal his love to you that when he looks at you he just looks at your eyes when i look at my child as his father i don't remember the bad stuff he's done when my three-year-old boys you know when they were three you know when they stumbled or or there were two trying to learn how to walk and they fell they don't get beaten up by mum and dad or you fell down no they're learning how to walk you're learning how to walk in the love of god and i want to pray that you can learn to live a life of giving to and loving others so that you really understand that when you even love someone or serve someone or go into a ministry or non-profit in a way to show love it's that instigation of your unselfishly given a someone not to give to receive but just to give and god then reveals that love in how he built you in knowing that you're giving and serving others and loving others not because they deserve and not because you want to get something back but that's the unconditional love i'm here to serve and if jesus came not to be served but to serve who are we to think that we are here just to be served to exist to coexist and feel good and happy no we are here to be first self self-loved in a god fashion in his nature because he created us he adopted us in his family and because of that joy of being adopted in his home and i'm a son and you're a son and daughter to the king of kings man this is just the beginning i want you to know that god wants to draw you closer to him and he's got a lot for you in store so first of all if you already know who god is but you are struggling right now with they would call it in the world self-esteem but we call it here tonight self-love the way that we are to look after ourselves to understand that we are not just somebody with this that that according to the world no you are a child of god you're an ambassador the king of kings and lord of lords you are anointed you're appointed and god loves you no matter what i want to pray for you right now okay let's pray dear god we thank you so much for those who are watching right now who do know about you who do know that god is love who do know that that you love them that you did create them but lord right now they're going through a chapter or season in their life where they just don't like themselves god whatever judgment has been happening or affliction or oppression or depression we we ask in jesus name that every pound principality of darkness would be gone in jesus name father we ask that whoever is hurting us or afflicting us uh lord god help us to find counseling help us to reach out to a friend help us to email someone online tonight lord god and get some resources that that can help us to know that we're not alone and that your love for us never changes and help us lord god to use that power of your love to let other people know that you love them too father we thank you for miracles tonight we pray for that lord you know our desires you know our needs we thank you that you'll always supply what we need but lord we also uplift any desires lord god we thank you that we're vertical we're upright we are breathing on our own and every day that passes is a day closer to coming to eternal joy in seeing you face to face in heaven thank you lord that we do not have to be afraid what people think we don't have to achieve or just fit into the world to feel love but love ourselves because of your love for us and love others as we have received your love so undeservingly thank you god that you encourage us and help us to seek you in everything we do help us to know your plan in jesus name amen and those friends who are now still watching and maybe you don't know who god is i want to ask you do you know jesus do you know me do you know him as a just a person a human being just as a good teacher or some may call him a prophet who do you say jesus is you know i mean you can go to church every sunday and you know youth group every wednesday night or whatever but still not know jesus you can go to church you know twice a year christmas easter and do some traditions but doesn't mean that you have a relationship with him you see jesus wants a friendship a relationship with you and jesus demonstrated that ultimate love when he died on the cross in place of us for our sins he paid the price of every sin and shameful thing we've ever done and i just want to quote one more verse john 15 13 greater love has no one than this than to lay one's life down for one's friend and that is exactly what jesus did for you he didn't ask him to do it he did it anyway and there's reasons and people think well i didn't understand i i don't understand how a loving god consent is sent his son to die on the cross for me i didn't ask anyone to sacrifice his son no we were fallen we had sin when man fell and jesus died once and for all that then god will be reunited with all his millions or billions of children who believe that the price for their sin also was paid i want to ask you are you done living for yourself and trying to live up to expectations of the world are you quite done yet trying to figure out your way of finding happiness and the more you try to be good the more you realize that you really have a lot of sin i want you to know that god wants to fill you with his love and guide you every day if you want to invite jesus into your heart right now and to seek him to know his love to know he has a plan for you would you just say this prayer with me say dear god i come to you today and i thank you for loving me thank you jesus for dying on the cross for my sins i believe you are the son of god and you rose again forgive me of everything i've done wrong i am a sinner and i need you please help me come into my life and fill me right now with your holy spirit i want to know you i want to know your strength please be my strength help me to know what your peace feels like and your joy thank you lord help me teach me to pray show me how to live one day at a time in jesus name i pray amen friend if you just prayed that prayer with me i want to offer you some next steps that can really help you first of all i have

maybe tune in next month please let them know it's going to be another awesome engaging time together and i just want to say thank you to katie for your question nick how are you and your family doing

you to know that um we're doing great we're doing really really good um we were hanging to get outside in the sun today um to you know really enjoy the sun um we are looking forward to as a family going fishing uh in about 10 or 14 days and go out there and and do um almost like a family trip within texas and we're so excited um you know to be in this state uh we know that this is where god wants us to be and we knew that in november 2019 and so please pay for us in our ministry as we also relocate life without limbs hq um out of california to texas and thank you for your prayers for that transition and thank you to all of you who are praying for us our staff our board our future staff in this transition uh there's a lot of uh a lot of pieces happening right now but we are so thrilled we know where exactly where god wants us to be in the timing of all these things uh we we know that god's in it all so thank you for your prayers for me and my family me and my wife we just celebrated our ninth anniversary so exciting um you know the kids are getting taller i'm actually the shortest one at home right now can you believe that like i'm looking up at everyone like my goodness what's going on um so thank you for your love and your prayers thanks for asking how we're doing we're doing awesome uh samuel s how do i know god's plan for my life thank you samuel s for your question that is like the question of questions right so first of all when you talk about the plan let's talk about let's change that word desire right what's god's greatest desire for you to know him to love him to love others exactly fitting in with what we're talking about tonight if you're wondering like how to serve others black and white written in the bible remember the orphans remember the widows and go clothe the naked and feed the hungry pretty simply put go and be jesus be the hands and feet call someone tonight see how they're doing you don't know if they also have maybe thoughts of suicide or depression or feeling like they're so alone you want to know the greatest way in someone not feeling alone someone reaching out to them right and some of us are like you remember how i was talking about tonight right when we take our focus off ourselves when we focus on someone else right it's understanding how beautiful it is that you don't need a miracle to be one remember that right this is so cool and so um now god's overall plan for you obviously there's a lot of verticals within this question but the way that god's gifted you talented giving you talent whatever it is some of us have a nine-to-five job that don't really do anything that quote-unquote is directly related to god's mission or a non-profit organization very few of us are actually employed by a god-given mission right but what we understand is it's not about where you're employed it's or who's employing you it's where you're at to be the light of god as well and so make sure that you understand that your plan for god's desire and plan for you is to share the gospel at your workplace and the greatest way to do that is to ask your work colleague hey let's go out you know and and tell me your story and when they're finished telling you their story guess what they ask you later what's your story and then you can share about how jesus has changed your life right your history is his story yeah use the powerful testimony god has given you yes to then let them know that god loves them too um but you know ask god seek him have people pray for you if it's something specific if it's ministries whatever um just keep on seeking god follow your peace that's the greatest advice i've ever been given by a wonderful friend of mine for 11 years my mentor john phelps one of my mentors who who said just follow your piece and uh i'm just i'm glad it's like the greatest advice anyone could give me so so glad so thank you samuel hope that helps you keep on seek and you'll find it and and and don't make a rocket science of it right go back to the basics that i told you as well wendy t thank you for your question what are some ways you practice off love what a fantastic question um and so i i feel like there are times when you don't really feel that you've even accepted or are okay with who you are sometimes um i read some verses over my life sometimes when you feel a little bit depressed or anxious or fearful you know read psalm 139 read psalm 91 reading the word helps your spirit to hear the word of god and that's where you get faith right faith comes by it's a gift you can't muster it up can't earn it can't achieve it it's a gift that seriously only comes it's what the bible says when you hear the word of god so like why wait till sunday to pick up your bible or tune into something right that's why we read the word daily in psalm 139 psalm 91 love that philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me that's another one and there is no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus and so when you feel like there's shame or guilt or or fear in your life and you feel like you need breakthrough of those emotions first of all be okay to feel the way that you feel sometimes we are human beings not human doing so human beings have feelings and it's okay like god knows what you're feeling okay um but he's there to comfort you he's there to like you know be there for you but eventually just break those lies with the truth baby who cares about how you look who cares about how many friends you have who cares about what money you make he's got another you're the child of the king of kings and lord of lords and your daddy owns everything man you're like the richest kid on earth because your daddy owns everything so it's not about money what you can have what you can't have um it's understanding who you are and whose you are now there are people that might actually watch this in very poor countries i just want you to know keep on trusting in god god's grace is sufficient and may god bless your financial need or give you that food right now i don't know what's going on i know that 2020 is being crazy all over the world i'm hearing some things that will never be on the news and i'm very sorry to hear of the suffering in the world and and that's another way that you can also um you know give out and make sure that it's not just in your community or national but international but for anyone who wants to practice a healthy self love it's i i think what i love is reflecting on what god's done for me i don't think it's like me mustering up self-love i think it's just really coming to the rawness of writing down the miracles if you just wrote down the goodness of god if you just wrote down the things that you can be thankful for for real write it down i think that's the greatest way where you also give glory obviously to god but i can't love me when i know my own weaknesses my own failures and all that stuff but i can i can really magnify the love of god in my life when i realize oh my gosh look look at what he's done for me and who am i right so i think that's a great write down the blessings of life and the miracles i journal i think that's a wonderful way to do that from joni c um last one on this ipad what was your first book my first book written was life without limits it came out in 2010 um and it sold 1.4 million books around the world in 39 languages i think and we're so excited we've done now six books one of them talk about love okay one of my dearest friends i'm not going to say who it is and the connection to that person but she called me crying after she was engaged to be married to the person who she is now married to um just crying on the phone with me or teary-eyed holding back more tears i know you were crying um just saying thank you nick for writing that book love without limits with your wife because it helped me to know how to have self-love and actually give myself a chance to believe that true love was still out there for me i doubt it i'm in my 30s and i she's telling me on the phone and you don't know this nick but that book changed my life and so if you want to learn more about self-love or if you're single or if you're divorced um or or people have hurt you and you want to read a book that instigates this new newness of the joy of believing in love and god's love for you and loving each other and the love story of me and my wife oh my goodness check it out go to life limbs.org and audio copy there love without limits as well uh justin oh uh what are you excited for this year oh my gosh i'm so excited um i'm at home baby we're going fishing next week with my children i get to speak to thousands of people through this this is amazing it's not like nick's not going to be traveling in the future we actually have some really exciting plans across america uh and when things whatever around the world will uh you know go where god wants us to go but we're really going digitally and i'm most excited about the fact that we've been praying that this little guy with no arms on legs has been on 2500 plane rides 3 million miles around the world 3 500 stages 9.5 million people have heard the gospel of jesus christ through the minister of life that limbs because of your support because of your prayers um now to be reaching millions without me having to travel the world and actually see my children grow up and not miss their childhood i'm so humbled to have met billy graham with my wife while we were engaged and he had two uh regrets he didn't read his bible enough okay billy graham says that um and then i wish i spent more time with my family and i and i really get both of them and it's so humbling to hear that from him um and and that's the beauty in it i've actually i feel like i'm 19 again you've never heard me say that ever this is a brand new chapter for life without limbs and we need your prayer because there are territories that we're now taking that it's just unbelievable we're building a prayer army and we'd love to share with you our prayer requests as a ministry as well and i think i'm most excited

Singapore has made impressive headway in advancing gender equality over the last half century. But whether gender equality has been a fundamental value in Singapore or merely an effect of economic growth is questionable. What would it mean, for all Singaporeans, to centre gender equality in Singapore’s future? Are there lessons to be learnt from Singapore’s women pioneers in civil society and politics? What socio-economic barriers do women continue to face at the workplace and at home? And critically, how can men play a part in achieving gender equality in Singapore?  

The Caring Economy
Women are taken to be the natural stewards of care, often bound to the home. In Singapore, where most women are in the workforce, these beliefs nevertheless persist. If couples have children, women are made to factor that into career considerations. These expectations do not exist for men. As Singapore’s economy grows and its people age, whose job is it to take care of our kids and our elderly? Are foreign domestic workers the solution? Why is Singapore’s total fertility rate at rock bottom levels, despite the billions spent on pro-natal measures? This lecture will deal with these questions and explore how we can build a robust care infrastructure to support our families, our economy and our nation.

second lecture the caring economy karina please we the citizens of singapore pledge ourselves as one united people regardless of race language religion or gender to build a democratic society based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness prosperity and progress foundation good afternoon everyone thank you all for coming to my second lecture i am really glad that you are here i'm happy to report that from my first lecture my revised version of the pledge which i which i just recited incorporating gender was well received by the media as a way of imprinting gender equality into our collective consciousness i go further in this lecture to talk about our continuing project to build a just and equal society to achieve happiness prosperity and progress foundation the second part of our pledge today we zoom in on the issues of caregiving work fertility aging and gender a big thank you to the people who left very positive feedback for lecture one many of you said you were inspired by the stories of our early women's rights activists and that you liked my gender equality flower so here it is again as a reminder of the six core dimensions of gender equality represented by the colorful petals and the gender norms that lie at the heart of the flower in this lecture i will zero in on the dark blue petal at the bottom of the flower equal distribution of unpaid housework and caregiving why first because it is a laggard and much more needs to be done second and more importantly it is holding back women's progress in other areas especially in the economy and leadership dimensions the green and light blue petals and third because this might just help singapore to reverse its declining fertility rate the main norm we have to change is this idea that men should be the primary breadwinner and women the primary caregiver of the family caregiving for our young and old is central to three important issues our low fertility rate women leaving the workforce prematurely and care for our aging population these are super important issues for singapore and i will be dealing with each of them in turn getting men to share the care more equally at home is part of the solution and i believe many men are ready and and want to do this with the right laws and support from employers we can make this happen but of course it takes more than gender equality in the family to support our family's caregiving needs president joe biden in the first hundred days of his presidency released a massive infrastructure promo proposal that included family leave investments in child care and at home care for the elderly and disabled together with rebuilding crumbling roads and bridges what was inspiring to me was the idea that child care elder care cooking and cleaning was seen to be just as vital to the functioning of the economy as roads and bridges care work is infrastructure what singapore needs is a robust care infrastructure to support our family's care needs both child care and elder care and without a strong care infrastructure our economy and our society just won't tick that's why i have titled this talk the caring economy first let me start with a teaser for all of you who cooked adam smith's dinner i think that many of you would have heard of adam smith also known as the father of capitalism you might have studied him and his works in his seminal book titled the wealth of nations written in 1776 adam smith used the answer to the question of who cooked his dinner to formulate his thesis of capitalism well you asked me what did adam smith have for dinner well his dinner was bread beer and steak so the answer to this question was the baker the brewer and the butcher and why did they do it because of their own self-interest which gave rise to what he called the invisible hand that drives capitalist markets but actually adam smith overlooked something really important which is this he forgot his mother margaret douglas adam smith lived most of his life with his mother margaret who cared for him and their home margaret cooked and served the steak but she's completely left out from the picture together with the wives of the baker the brewer and the butcher unfortunately this incomplete picture of how a capitalist society operates has become the paradigm of economic life family care work that is generally carried out by women doesn't get counted and so it doesn't count it doesn't count in the gdp and continues to be overlooked and undervalued by policy makers yet capitalism depends on this very work without people caring for the workers the economy would collapse we caught a glimpse of this when schools and child care closed during the lockdown care and work then collided under one roof people's homes without child care parents were struggling to get anything else done with their kids at home many men also realized for the first time how much caregiving and housework their wives were doing on top of their paid work the point is if we don't see the caregiving being done because we are outside working or it is taken care of by someone else we may just not realize how much work there is and how important it is the undervaluing of family care is very much at the heart of this lecture next let me move to the topic of singapore's abysmally low fertility rate singapore's total fertility rate or tfr is today at an all-time low 1.10 children per woman replacement rate is 2.1 all developed countries have gone below 2.1 but not as low as us lower fertility rate isn't necessarily all bad it's partly a signal of how women and men are finding fulfillment in other areas beyond raising a family but our tfr at 1.10 is considered to be dangerously low look at the slide which our then dpm teo trihen presented to parliament in 2013. the tfr then was 1.2 slightly above what it is today and this slide shows that in just two generations we will have one third of the singaporeans that we have today so this is why tfr is an existential issue for singapore the main concern to address is this how do we support the people who want kids to fulfill their parenthood aspirations the government's 2016 marriage and parenthood survey showed that 92 percent of married couples would like to have at least two kids 37 percent did not achieve their ideal and this is despite the government efforts to support and promote marriage and parenthood there are also people who have decided not to get married right or they are you know they're not attracted to get married and have kids right so we are also concerned about that group of people the government's annual spending on pro-natal measures has increased progressively by five times from 500 million in 2001 to 2.5 billion in 2017. you can see this in the black bars and yet the tfr total fertility rate represented by the pink line continues to fall even as we spend to try to stem that fall and it fell further in 2020 to 20 to 1.1 so why did the pro-natal measures not work the short answer is that the measures were just not sufficient to address the reasons why couples didn't have as many kids as they wished they said too expensive too stressful too difficult to manage work and family demands these were the reasons given by couples in a 2016 government survey so the issue is not just money it's also about time stress and the actual work of giving care the pro-natal incentives were mainly in the form of family leave and monetary incentives in the form of baby bonuses tax breaks and subsidies for preschool leave is essential of course and money is always welcome but the actual burden of caregiving especially the burden on mothers was still not a dress let me take a sip of water so let me move to the related issue of women leaving the workforce prematurely as i said in the last lecture girls have overtaken boys in education girls do better in schools and on average have better educational qualifications but what happens when women and men enter the workforce this slide shows the male and female participation rates in the workforce across age groups in other words what percentage of men are working and what percentage of women are working blue is female the green line is male let's look at the green male line first what we see is that between the ages 25 to 54 close to 100 of men are in the workforce they start retiring in their mid 50s now look at the blue female line behaves very differently from the ages of 20 20 to 29 the blue and the green lines run together women no different from the men and then the blue line [Music] peaks at about 90 in the 25 to 29 age group and from 30 to 34 it starts to go downhill what do you think happens at 30 to 34 if you guessed childbirth you are absolutely right the median age of first-time mothers is 30.6 years old so unlike men women's ability to work is hampered by child rearing this pattern isn't too surprising the same happens in many oecd countries women start working when they become mothers but the difference is that for many oecd countries including japan and korea women return to the workforce after the children go to school at about you know when they are about 35 to 40 years old the woman's their woman's curve is in the shape of an m the curve goes down but it goes up and then down again when they retire and for singapore it's just downhill all the way why is there no m curve for singapore why don't our women return to work after their kids start primary school i have not seen any direct research on this but we can make some intelligent guesses first psle women take time off to ensure that kids do well in primary school so even as some women return some get out then aging parents women then take time off to look after their aging parents this would be women who are in their 40s to 50s and finally ageism which makes it hard for women and men to go back to the workforce at an older age after the family responsibilities are done so how does our labor force participation rate fare against other developed countries this slide shows how singapore's ratio of female to male labor force participation compares to all other oecd countries right we want the number to be a hundred percent that means the percentage of women working is the same as the percentage of men working singapore is represented by the red line and we are not top of the class by any means we're not very behind but we are not in the top half at 79 we are just slightly better than japan and korea the two green lines to the left of the red and we are quite far behind the best countries sweden and norway by about 10 women dropping out of the labor force is a waste of human potential especially given that on average singapore women are more highly educated than men so we must try to do better the issues of women's workforce participation and singapore's low fertility rates boil down to one thing the expectation that women who are now educated and have careers will continue to bear the brunt of the caregiving burden as they did in the past this expectation sets up a situation where women have to choose between their careers and the children some give up their careers for family others choose career over family either way it's not ideal for singapore we end up with both low fertility and women leaving the workforce prematurely many places including korea taiwan japan face similar problems can we have can women have both career and kids countries like sweden norway iceland and finland have shown that it is possible with the right family support and care policies a country can have it all high fertility working mothers a competitive economy and also very happy citizens you know the nordics always top the charts for happiness the experience of these countries showed that there are two things that governments can do to increase fertility and women's workforce participation the first embed gender equality into laws and policies in particular use parental leave policies to nudge husbands to be more active fathers what i call the gender equality solution the second build a robust care infrastructure to support all families caregiving needs we need to do both let's look at the gender equality solution first the nordic experience has shown that the best way to change societal norms on parenting is to give men and women equal parenting leave if men don't take their leave they will lose it so many take it and end up loving it as the swedish ambassador to singapore said to me during a gender equality discussion no man ever regrets it the ambassador has four kids and he took daddy days for all of them up to as much as 60 days so the norms have changed so much in sweden that fathers who don't take paternity leave are frowned upon research has shown that dads who are actively involved in the early months of their kids lives are much more likely to be active fathers in later years so we have to be strategic to target the early years these men also share domestic work and paid work more equitably with their partners beyond the paternity leave period so what's the paternity leave situation in singapore as part of its prenatal measures singapore extended paternity leave to two weeks in 2017 it was one week and then it was extended to two weeks in 2017. and last year 53 percent of men took their leave to me this is a positive sign of how social norms are changing quite rapidly these days it's quite common to see dads walking around with their kids strapped onto their chest or jogging cycling going to the store with their kids in hand no moms in sight more than more fathers have become active parents although moms still do the bulk of the work at home this particular pro-natal strategy is definitely worth pursuing because it benefits families directly and also creates a more gender equal and pro-family culture in the long run now two weeks paternity leave was a good start but i think of it as a pilot it is insufficient for fathers who really want to be equal parents how much can a person do in two weeks that might just be enough time for fathers to get the hang of things it's really not so easy to be supporting baby and and your wife during this period and it does take some time to understand what the role is so that's like orientation we see companies like aviva diageo and hp voluntarily giving four months paternity leave to their male employees in singapore they understand that this is what their male employees want and it is a good way to attract and retain talent i also spoke to two parents ken and liz about their experience with paternity leave early parenting ken is the father of a 10 year old boy he shared his parenting experience about why men should have longer paternity leave he said to me when i became a father i relished being a freelancer because i had flexible hours that allowed me to spend a lot of time with my son and assume my rightful half of childcare duties at the same time i wondered about other fathers fathers who had full-time jobs but only scanned paternity leave i know that even if i was working as a full-time employee in a company i would want to have as much paid leave for child care as any new mother my body unlike my wives did not need physical healing and regeneration for breastfeeding after my son's birth therefore it was all the more important to me that i could do the diaper changing share in the sleepless nights through bottle feeding and as my son grew older spend as much time with him as possible today ken enjoys a wonderful relationship with his son he tells me in many ways my son is as close to me if not closer than to his mom sometimes when he's trouble he'll come to me first he looks to me for comfort and play but also for the conventional mom things preparing food setting him to soccer classes story and bedtime routine ken's wishlist for policy changes include paid paternity leave equal to what mothers have and unisex toddler stations or diaper-changing facilities in men's toilets he's had to change his son on top of a wet wiped toilet seat too many times liz is the mother of a five-month-old baby she's my colleague she shared the importance of having the support of a partner she says one obstacle i face is the unequal amount of parental leave that my partner and i have as he only had two weeks i gave him my shareable month so he had a total of 1.5 months and i had three months i had a condition where i feel a burst of negative emotions right before breastfeeding and having my partner's presence at home at that time was really helpful for me to cope my partner had to return to work during my maternity leave which meant i had to do things like lifting the baby out of the court myself going against my physiotherapist advised to not exert myself three months post c-section now while not every man is ready to take more than two weeks of paternity leave our policies should support those who are keen to do so and those who are not going to take it so be it it's their loss the other unsatisfactory issue about the current leave is the disparity between mothers and fathers leave currently moms have four months maternity leave and dads have two weeks this huge disparity reinforces the idea that child rearing is primarily the mom's role it goes against the idea of gender equality and also hurts women's career prospects women will not be equal leaders or in the workplace unless men assume roles as equal or primary caregivers so the gender equality review presents us with a wonderful opportunity to update our paternity leave provisions ultimately we should aim for a situation where all parents have the same amount of parenting leave regardless of gender if moms have four months that should have four months too but this needs long-term consideration and planning as employers will be greatly impacted by this so in the meantime here is my recommendation to equalize paternity leave as part of the gender equality review so it can be done more quickly here's the proposal increase father's entitlement from two weeks to three months maintain mother's leave at 4 months cap the total paid leave for the family at 6 months what this means is that parents can decide for themselves if they want to do 50 50 they can do that three months for moms and three months for dads or sixty forty four months four months for moms and two months for dads and although the current uh leave situation allows men to share women's leave no mom wants to give up a very very few mom give up that last month this was one of them because actually three months isn't may not be enough right for them to recover so um and it is their leave so for them to share their their entitlement is difficult but if mom and dad both had their own leave and they just need to decide who's going to take how much then it's much more likely than they're likely to do uh 50 50. now i'm a huge advocate of active fatherhood for many reasons aside from the ones that i've shared here are a few more first it's great for kids when fathers were more involved research shows that kids did better in schools they were more empathetic had higher self-esteem and life satisfaction and when they grew up they didn't get into as much trouble and were less likely to engage in substance abuse secondly it's great for that too fatherhood increases self-esteem and sense of purpose in life that's take the health more seriously and reduce risk-taking behaviors and thirdly it role models gender equality for our next generation even if we don't achieve gender equality in this generation the next generation will be more gender equal when women went out to work it changed the way that their children thought about women's roles in society in the same way men doing more at home will change the way that our children seize men's role in society in line with the idea that fathers should be equal parents or sometimes even stay-at-home parents we should also amend the women's charter to equalize men's rights to seek maintenance from their wives currently section 69 of the women's charter only allows husbands to apply for maintenance from their wives if they are incapacitated wives have an unfettered right to apply for maintenance from their husbands they don't have to be incapacitated this provision reflects the old patriarchal norm that men were the primary caregivers and had a duty to maintain their wives it is time to update this provision and give men the same rights as women to apply for maintenance and when husbands do apply for maintenance the courts can make that final decision on whether it is fair to award this as the nordic experience has shown equal parenting policies are effective in setting more egalitarian gender norms in a family now in sweden these days it's common to see lati papas this is an affectionate term for groups of dads who push their prams go to a cafe and have a latte and i can't wait for the day when kopi papas become a thing in singapore let's move on to the second solution building a robust care in infrastructure to ease the burden on women now this refers to the state providing public child care services in the late 70s when the government realized that family caregiving was hindering women's participation in the workforce it launched the foreign-made scheme to enable families to employ foreign domestic workers at this point the state didn't invest in building public child care for all families but the private market saw this opportunity and seized it offering a range of services which cost as much as two thousand dollars per child at the high end to me this is not the usual singapore way of doing things our excellent social infrastructure in education housing healthcare and transport has been the cornerstone of our economic success the state provided high quality flats facilities and services to ensure that the basic needs of all singaporeans were met the private market exists but it's secondary why didn't the government at first instance not invest in building a strong child care infrastructure in the same way that it built a strong education system and why did the government start aggressively building the child care infrastructure only after 2012 less than a decade ago when it has been desperately trying to increase total fertility rates for more than three decades why was there a delay of 20 years to build child care i've been researching and pondering about this in the last few months and in my analysis there are three reasons for this let's go back to the adam smith story unpaid care work is overlooked and undervalued in our capitalist system male decision makers especially may not realize how important child care is for women to work lack of child care doesn't impact men's work as much as women's second patriarchal thinking women are supposed to do the housework and take care of the family that's the patriarch patriarchal idea so if women can't handle those duties then pay another woman a migrant domestic worker to do this for low wages no need to provide public services and the third reason is an elitist or eugenic way of thinking our early leaders in particular prime minister lee kuan yew was fixated on the elitist idea that intelligence is an inheritable trait so this idea led the government to introduce the graduate mother scheme in 1984 to incentivize graduate moms to have kids under the scheme children of graduate mothers got priority admission to schools the moms got tax breaks but on the flip side low income and poorly educated couples were discouraged from having kids they were paid ten thousand dollars to stop at two kids this graduate mother scheme was so unpopular it was reversed the next year however this elitist way of thinking didn't go away since the government was not keen for less educated families to have more kids there wasn't a need to provide child care for for them better off families could avoid afford their own domestic workers and to pay for private child care private solutions may seem very attractive it saves the government from having to take on the burden of managing or providing these services however relying on the market to provide solutions to fulfill basic human needs like child care is deeply concerning as it increases social inequality certainly in awareness 2018 research report why are you not working the lack of accessible preschool was one of the reasons why low-income mothers were not working it is only in 2013 that the government really focused its attention on child care provision when it set up the early childhood development agency acta since then the state has made great progress in building the preschool infrastructure including improving the quality of preschool services making it more affordable and accessible creating the kidstart program to support the healthy development of kids from low income families families who now earn less than two thousand five hundred dollars a month cannot can pay as little as three dollars a month for full day child care after subsidies and in 2017 prime minister li shin long announced that the government will double its annual spending on the pre-school sector to 1.7 billion in 2022 a heavy investment but worthwhile and necessary said pmd so from this graph you can see how singapore has increased its annual spending on preschool by about five months by about five times from 2012. from 20 from 360 million it went up to 1.7 billion a decade later and the latest indications are that government supported preschool will be able to meet at least 80 percent of families needs by 2025. that's the singapore way we had a late start and there's still some catching up to do so let me go back to my colleague liz right who shared also about her search for infant care even as i speak this is desperately searching for infant care for a five-month-old baby because she wants to go back to work she's anxious and stressed as she's used up all of her maternity leave yet she can't get back to work until she can get full day infant care for her daughter she's been on the waiting list of 10 nearby preschool centers she would go on more but this is the maximum number of waiting lists that she's allowed to be on her family monthly household income is about seven thousand dollars sparkle thoughts is the most affordable center after subsidies it will cost the family four hundred and eighty dollars about seven percent of the income one other center has space in september five months from the time she applied but they are higher end and charge 960 dollars per month that's 13 of the family income is actually beyond the couple's budget but they may have no choice so many couples today face this predicament with securing infant care availability and cost hopefully this situation too will get better by 2025. now aside from providing more affordable preschool places there are other urgent priorities to work on first we don't have enough child care teachers as the pay and recognition aren't great second child care fees are still much higher than primary school the lowest rate for full day care right and this is not infant but child care is about 300 compared to primary school fees at 15 also the fee should not depend on whether the mother is working or not currently the case is that working mothers pay a lower fee it is ironic because and it and it is because child care was designed originally as a scheme to support working mothers child care really should be a public good that is available to every single child so working and non-working parents should be paying the same third we also need to enable our preschools to cater to kids with special needs this is a growing problem in singapore there's an increase in the number of kids with developmental problems such as autism behavioral issues and speech delays currently the early intervention programs are outside the preschools so this makes it really challenging for parents who have to transfer their kids from one place to another in the middle of the work day i am really really glad to see the government's current focus and investment on developing the preschool infrastructure it is critical and the good news is that the research does show that the availability of formal child care by lowering the care burden positively influences parents decisions to have kids so hopefully good access to quality child care will improve fertility rates and even if it doesn't our families and kids really need it so far i've been focusing on the caregiving infrastructure for children the education system is a separate but related system it used to be a great public system but these days parents spend a lot of money on tuition to help their kids do well in psle in 2018 singapore households spent 1.4 billion dollars on tuition not all of this is for psle but we know that nothing beats the psle in terms of parental involvement and tuition the upshot of this is that primary school now has become a public come private system that amplifies inequality rich kids get tuition in every subject poor families scrounge around for free tuition in the subjects they need help in middle class families give tuition to the kids for the subjects they are weak in so it does promote inequality the psle system has also created a huge amount of unpleasant care labor for parents parents spend a lot of time searching for the best tutors fairing kids here and there coordinating timetables nagging and scolding their children and getting upset with each other because it is also stressful it's now quite normal for one parent usually mom to resign from her job or take one year off to support her kids through psle a mother whose child was struggling at primary five told me that she quit her job as she felt that she would not be able to live with herself if her child did poorly and she had not done everything she possibly could to support him because the stakes they see as very high it's heartbreaking to hear these stories this is not what childhood and parenthood should be about the psle system is clearly not working this is one of the reasons why i think that our women's labor force participation curve does not have an m shape research from east asia has also shown a negative correlation between total fertility rate and household spending on education there have been calls to abolish psle i strongly support those calls that we abolish or overhaul the system and in assessing the system i hope that policy makers will take into account the impact of psle on women our economy fertility fertility rates and social inequality there must be less costly ways to provide our children with a good education will we be able to successfully reverse our fertility rate if we implement the gender equality solution take away psle and make high quality preschool universal i wish i could guarantee this i know these solutions will help many families and that it may make it more feasible for people to have kids but we also have new challenges ahead of us climate change christian and his partner heng yen are recent graduates they are in their mid-20s and part of the climate justice group sg climate rally they are waiting excitedly for their bto flat which should be ready by 2023 but they've decided not to have any kids for this reason my partner and i recognize that this world is rapidly deteriorating both socio-political and ecologically the science shows us that we are teetering on the edge of no return with more diseases natural disasters and unpredictable changes on the horizon recognizing this reality the conversation around having a child becomes quite non-negotiable for us we cannot knowingly bring a child into this literal and metaphorical burning world even though it sounds somewhat depressing it is important to know what some members of the younger generation are thinking and to hear their concerns singapore and the world has to really think about how people can thrive without overburdening our planet without having to rely on economic models that are dependent on population growth it is ironic i'm standing here and talking about how we can increase our fertility when population growth is actually one of the problems that have led to climate change i hope that this will be the subject of another sro northern fellowship let's move on to another topic our aging population let me ask you a question assuming good health if you could choose to live either till 64 or 84 what would you choose this is a no-brainer right most people would choose to live till 84 and that is one of the remarkable benefits of singapore's development in the last 60 years singaporeans are living longer than almost any other nationality the average life expectancy in 1957 was 64. and today it is 84. we gained an extra 20 years lease of life 84 years is the average life expectancy in 2020 which means that many of us alive today may live to beyond 90 years old our longevity is certainly something to celebrate and can be a huge boost to our economy older individuals today are generally healthier and wealthier than those in past generations and they seek to remain engaged and relevant for years beyond the retirement age as you know from my last lecture my feminist mother dr khan al jazeen is 79 and still practices as an orthopedic surgeon my real mother jun lim is also 79 and she still enjoys working as a housing agent they both do more strenuous workouts than me i tell them jokingly when i grow up i want to be like them older workers offer valuable experience and talent they provide perspective experience stability and through their insights they can serve as mentors and role models to younger counterparts i have been the beneficiary of many wiser mentors studies have found that the productivity of both older and younger workers is higher in companies with mixed age work teams also an aging population opens up new markets as older people will have different needs so if managed well our aging population may indeed be our only increasing natural resource but usually when people talk about aging in our aging population it's with a sense of dread apprehension and anxiety the images that we associate in our mind with aging are those of illness disability vulnerability and the sacrifices and burden of caregiving when we think about the aging of our older relatives we worry about the impact it may have on our lives if they should fall sick or become disabled will we be able to cope with our own families our jobs and caregiving do we have to change our living arrangements can we afford the care that our loved ones need in short the aging population offers both opportunities and challenges here's the thing though we can only reap the benefits of the gifts of longevity if we have a strong care infrastructure to support our aging population's needs in other words we need to meet the challenges before we can benefit from longevity but more than that if we fail to meet the challenges longevity becomes a liability for our economy and society so the stakes are high meet the challenges get a bonus don't meet the challenges not just you don't get the bonus it becomes a liability so it's a bit different from children with children if we don't have a strong care infrastructure not enough support people just won't have babies with all the persons that is not an option many of us have two parents and we have no choice and we would want to care for them so if our parents are unable to cope on their own and if we have to we will make other adjustments like give up work at 50. this then leads to further problems down the road for caregivers and society no longevity benefits just liabilities with those things in mind let me talk about the current infrastructure of elder care the question is does our current infrastructure support the people who need care and the people who give care to enable us to benefit from longevity from my perspective the answer is not yet but i am actually really worried about the current pace and trajectory of the development of our elder care infrastructure will we get there and will we get there soon enough here's why i'm worried our current national strategy is to have people age at home what we call aging in place rather than in in institutions of course all of us want that right research shows that in most families in singapore this home care is given by a family member usually female supported by a migrant domestic worker sounds familiar right that was our child care strategy too of course not every family can afford to hire a domestic worker nor are all domestic workers fit to look after specific elder elder needs and conditions like dementia and stroke currently the family carers have inadequate public support for example there isn't even a single day of mandated elder care paid leave in singapore for child care each parent is given six days of paid leave secondly there are formal services like day care centers and home care services which are supposed to support family caregivers however families do not use this because they are too expensive based on yen foundations report care where you are a family of three with a household income of about eight thousand dollars would have to spend nearly one third of its income on eldercare overall the out of pocket expenses that families have to pay a much more than for child care there's also a severe shortage of nursing homes and respite care is difficult to access all this is being improved but currently the situation is not good so aware research in this area shows the following trends emerging right as a result of of the shortages many family members usually women are giving up their jobs to take care of their relatives these family caregivers are mostly in their 50s they're not just disadvantaged by their loss of income and ongoing expenses during this period of full-time caregiving many of them disrupted their careers before they built up enough savings for themselves when they grow old many of them are single daughters so they do need to return to the workforce but will face the issues of loss of confidence workplace ageism and they're not having kept up with technological change it will be extremely difficult for them to return to work when they are in their late 50s also many of the family caregivers and domestic workers we interviewed were suffering from prolonged stress and fatigue four hours of sleep every night on a prolonged period is exhausting many exhibited signs of caregiver burnout once again we undervalue care and are not investing enough to build a robust eldercare infrastructure in the case of eldercare that i think there might be also ages biases in society that elders are over the hill and economically provide poor returns on investment some people think if money is limited invest in kids and compromise elder care if you did think this i hope that my earlier statements have shown why we need to invest in both for our economy to reap the benefits of our human capital if we don't do this our economy and workforce will suffer and when i say build a care infrastructure i don't mean that it has to be a hdb model where the government owns everything the private sector will have a role to play but the government must be involved to oversee fund manage as necessary to ensure that the services are universally accessible to all so it could be like our education model or child care model if money is not enough we either find money from other sources or raise taxes or the insurance the long-term insurance we have been too conservative in our long-term care investments just to illustrate about eight years ago singapore started to build more nursing homes because we really need them there were calls from the public to provide single or twin rooms and in the end the government decided on dom style layouts of 6 to eight bits here's a photo of the nursing home what do you think would you like to spend your last years here or put your parents in this nursing home some people that i showed this photo to thought this was a hospital i have not found anyone who liked who would like to spend their last years here if they had a choice it seems short-sighted to try to save money and build dom-style nursing homes that people are averse to with this as the only other alternative family caregivers feel they have no choice but to take care of the seniors at home even when they are not in the best position to do so so i strongly strongly urge the government to review its approach to long-term care there is a lot at stake for the economy and our society if we don't invest enough and soon enough to support our family caregivers it takes time to build up affordable home care services center-based care nursing homes paid leave and a much wide wide array of residential options so we should start investing more now and not scramble to do this 10 or 20 years down the road as we did with child care it may call for more taxes but perhaps people will accept the need for higher taxes if they understand how they and their ben and their families can benefit more funding in this area also offers opportunities for the marketplace to innovate technological solutions and services given the large cohort of seniors the lack of adequate infrastructure will cause a lot of pain in the community to help us imagine what good public care infrastructure looks like here is a short video of a government-funded nursing home in japan it's it is an extract from the lian foundation's very helpful genki kaki series where they brought two singapore caregivers to japan to find out how japan does elder care japan grew older uh grew older faster than us so they've had many more years in getting it right so you know this is their experience after many more years of being old let's watch the video we arrived we met saito-san we'll just briefly explain the place here [Music] today [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] what [Music] [Music] i think the other big difference i find between singapore and japan not just the staff but even the residents appear to be a lot happier and friendly towards each other she was singing away she was stepping her hands on her tie to the rhythm so i think she's a very happy contented person [Music] although she's got no family and it must be something that the home has done to cheer her for her to forget her loneliness or you know this is the gold standard for public nursing homes very high quality and professional and inspires confidence that seniors will be treated with dignity and comfort that's what i imagine good quality long-term care should look like it's important for singapore to think about what's the level of provision that we should ensure for everybody what is our hdb standard for nursing homes and home care services what level of privacy and comfort will assure people that their dignity will be respected right up till the end the dom style nursing home does not seem to meet people's expectations the japanese model is eye-opening singapore is on its way to becoming one of the oldest countries in the world let's build elder care systems that we can be really proud of systems that speak to who we want to be as people decent caring compassionate respectful of our seniors in this lecture i've covered issues that are most pertinent today to care and families and provided recommendations for policy changes that can be affected as part of the gender equality review or in the near future if we succeeded in building a caring economy what would our society look like in 2050 come with me as we journey into the future the year is 2050. dads are loving being fathers they can't get enough of it fathers talk about how they see life differently they talk about how they want to be the best person they can be for their kids we see a lot more children these days the fertility rate has turned the corner our tfr is now at 1.25 work changed a lot because of the pandemic working from home became the norm it became easier for parents to balance work and family good thing that happened as it has become really difficult and expensive to hire domestic workers many families then decided they could do without a living domestic worker also now we have a great child care system child care quality improved every year kids with disabilities now attend the same child care as other kids singapore is now among the top four top five for child care systems in the world haha we always have to be top ten our long-term care is now number two in the world next to japan we can be really proud of that because we came a long way children are enjoying school exams no more psle primary school is more fun the kids also say that new pledge you know with the word gender in it singapore has become a silver head paradise silva is in silver had men and women everywhere economically active contributing in many ways from the cabinet to the boardroom malls fast food counters and new community centers also the government did a great job in making it easy for seniors like me to travel everywhere easily and for free their project to make singapore a silver head paradise worked really well i wrote this from my hdb studio apartment in the eastern hdb retirement village many of my friends also moved here as well it's great because we can look out for each other so that's what i see of the singapore of 2050 do you think this is possible it's important to be able to dream of the society that we want for ourselves now let's all work to make that dream come true this brings me to the end of my second lecture it's been a journey writing this paper and at the end i found myself left with one final thought that to establish gender equality as a fundamental value we need also to establish care and compassion as values that define the singaporean i hope that this lecture has given you much food for thought and look forward to all your questions the third lecture is called reset men women violence i will take a compassionate look at men and masculinity the impact of shifting gender norms caused by our internet generation on boys and girls we'll look at domestic and sexual violence and what our various institutions families schools workplaces even national service can do to build a more gender equal caring and respectful culture thank you very much thank you very much corinna i'd ask that everyone keep submitting your comments and questions we'll now be shifting to the q a session of this lecture may i now invite linsu ling executive editor at cna digital to start the q a session hi i'm lin suling and welcome to the q a section of carina's second lecture um very honored to be here karina i first met you at the national youth council dialogue and we were on separate panels but it was both looking at diversity and inclusion in the workplace yes i remember that many big questions were asked um how much of family responsibilities should people leave at the door when they get to work um and it's work-life integration a one-way street but that was in 2018 and a great deal has happened since then not least a raging pandemic and we were reminded of it today when titan measures were announced no dining out group sizes being reduced so as the moderator i would exercise my right to ask you the first question which is could you talk a little bit about covet 19's impact on women and looking also at the titan measures are there areas of concern we should pay specific attention to what sort of support do you hope to see in place as well yep so covert 19 yeah will not looks like it's going to take some time before we see the end of that uh but one thing a few things came out uh specifically in relation to women one was care and how we saw the care needs like you know really uh right before our eyes in our homes right like as i was saying in my lecture uh it became very very clear uh that there were a lot of care needs that in our day-to-day life you know it was happening because other people were taking care of it but that's just really how essential it is now it's interesting that things like child care elder care are seen as essential services but are not really treated as very important services they don't even have a progressive wage model for these industries for example so the pay is quite low right especially elder care so we had a scheme where we would uh recruit and train women for child care and elder care a lot more people took up the child care work than the other care because of the pain right so one is we will see these care needs again intensify and parents may have to be if we are in lockdown again it will be a repeat of that situation maybe it's better the second time round because we already know what to expect right but we will see those care needs really intensify and emerge and and parents will struggle in their homes the other thing we saw was domestic violence a sharp rise in our helpline calls on domestic violence as people were you know domestic violence is about domination and power and control and so uh when people could not get out of their homes and everyone had to stay there and maybe the stress was high it just gave rise to a lot more domestic violence right so we could expect that if we have another lockdown in the current situation you know if we can still get out of the house it may not give rise to so much domestic violence the work situation for like the fnb industry for example any industries that have to shut down even for a short time and especially if they have low income families who have very thin safety nets they have hardly any savings so a shutdown for them is really you know they're living hand to mouth it has huge impacts the government was great in coming in with very quickly right and this is one of the things that we hope to see again if we get to that situation can we make sure that that immediate lifeline is there right for the people who really need it and now that we have had some experience with actually giving this sort of financial support quite quickly i think again the second time will be better the first time there were people like this uh self-employed scheme struggling with the forms right there was a lot of confusion the service hung all these things happened but um that was a learning experience and really the government did really well in just making sure that they were there and they were generous enough right to to support those immediate needs things like elder care you know was tricky because uh the centers closed at the the community care center so the caregivers at home were like oh i think they were really suffering because there was no place that they could actually you know take their relative to go to for the day yeah so yeah care needs are going to again intensify and it's the family members no choice the family members will have to uh support would do do it yeah but this is where we realize how important it is to have that care infrastructure just to switch gears a little bit and talk about uh the lecture on the questions that are coming in from online um so your proposal to have uh increasing the amount of fathers leave entitlement to three months there's a question here about whether why not propose the increase of father's entitlement to four months such it's equal to mothers why three yeah you know i struggled back and forth and i i this was the part that i i would love to suggest for but it is not realistic at this point to go from two weeks to four months and you know i i did speak to quite a few people about this including people who ran small businesses and they're like how will we survive if you know the man and the woman all go on leave that is not uh currently we need more things in place first right and how do these countries that have one year leave how do they do it so there is a much stronger much more robust part-time or interim or temporary sort of contract work industry for every type of industry there is that kind of work right and there are people who just specialize in actually uh providing you know matching you when you need a maternity cover right so there are people who who just do this maternity maternity covers right uh lawyers who are just always just covering for people so you need to have those things in place it's a bit chicken and egg but i think if we just did it now it would be very difficult also the funding is an issue right um so i've been looking at funding models as well and interestingly the best practice is not really what we have the best practice according to i think what the ilo is something called employment insurance so it is that the employer just so that the employer doesn't bear the full burden of giving this leave because this leave the country wants it country wants babies uh the employees want it but the employer doesn't really get to gain as much so they are reluctant right they will do it but they're reluctant so even to say can we have elder kelly for three days mom will say the employers say no they can't right this year is a bad year it's already very bad for them in other ways so we cannot so we are sort of held ransom by employers because they can't so i think we have to look at different funding models so insurance this employment insurance is that the employee pays say 0.5 percent or 1 and the employer pays as well it funds all the leave not just uh pertaining a parenting leave family leave you know leave for single par for single persons as well it just goes into this pool and the government also can top up right so it's sort of spread out more and it's not like you know bad luck this year three persons i'm a small company three persons went on leave it's a big hit to my bottom line right so i think we need to look at all of these things before we can save four months so much as i would like to that's why i said we should ultimately work towards that but for now i think this is what we can manage and even this i think is a stretch but i think we can do it because not a lot of people a lot of men will take all two months right so i think you know it will be a phased approach it will be a naturally phased approach as people get used to this but those who want it we should go for it right yeah so do you expect that success would be more men taking leave yes and if so then why not let families choose because ultimately families have a diversity of choices and the men and women make the decisions oh no circumstances that more men take the like four to two i mean the women still get the same right the women will still get four and the men will get two right uh three and three i think you know some families will do it but more likely if the men take it they'll probably do four and two because again i think women are anchored to the four months already right we're like okay hey this is mine four months is mine but you know the math oh i had three i i purposely made it like four and three but kept at six because i didn't want a man to be seen as like uh can you please give me some leave right that's the woman's leave just leave it i mean going back to the intent of this gender equality solution the problem you've identified or at least the idea that we want to reach towards is having more children and more babies yes so this is a relevant question here where um the question therefore is why do we assume that the way to do that is to help women manage caregiving needs for children for newly born children there's a comment here from o king xiong saying compared to 10 years ago actually fewer singapore women are getting married and married women have a total fertility rate that's near replacement do you think therefore that the focus should be on encouraging more marriages or more women getting married instead yeah i did see some research on this and they said you know the reason the self you're trying to solve the same problem the people who are not getting married it's because they don't want to have kids also so actually it's all tied up so it's not necessarily that you treat the two as different pools right you just need to make like having a family a very happy thing right so that people will like get married because if you are not planning to have children then you're like okay you know getting married or not if i read meet the right guy that's good but i'm not actually going to be so active doing it right so then they focus on their career so it's not so different right i think that what we're doing now i mean the proposal will actually help the people who are not actively thinking of families because it's so difficult right to think about having a family those two pieces of the puzzle uh i think this we're trying to solve the same problem right the main issue is it's too difficult to have families so people don't need to get married they're not getting married right then the people who are married are they having their two or three kids which you want them to have that they want to have right and so i i still feel like it is all about making it easier to have families related to that also is um a question about how much value we place on home responsibilities and caregiving so a related question here comes from madilha abdal and she asks us should housewives be compensated for household and care giving work which she says is essentially unpaid labor and how feasible do you think such a policy would be in singapore yep this one is quite a contentious one in relation to child care i feel um why is it contentious it's okay some nordic countries have done it it's contentious because we actually do want to encourage women to work because there are many benefits to being able to you know go out there work build your networks build your skills all of that it's it's a better position for the women at the end of the day and so some of the uh countries have found that if we give this caregiving allowance then more women actually just stay at home which makes them maybe less equal right it weakens that the whole positioning i feel differently about elder care right the women who are giving up work they would not give up work and they're giving up work at this point when they actually should be building their savings i feel that that group we should seriously consider this proposal right that we there is a caregiver allowance because we we should understand that if we don't do it now we might have to do it later when they are 70 or 80 and they don't have money right so it's actually better to just support them now and recognize that they are doing something if they weren't doing it we would need more nursing homes etc we would need more infrastructure but all of singapore wants people to age in place so as a society i think we can actually have a justification for this and the the argument about you know they should be working rather than staying at home doesn't so much apply to this group right they've already been working for a long time so what do you make of the discussions last week in parliament this question came from our facebook follower also she asked us how in this week's debate there was an exchange of views on the singer act as you recall between gpm hence we kit and some members of the opposition and there was a discussion about whether we should redefine infrastructure to include human capital and social policies right her question is how would you respond to that and would you make a case for the inclusion of caregiving in infrastructure spending uh i'm not sure what the significance of making it in singapore a part of the infrastructure you know expenditure but i think caregiving is infrastructure right that's that is my thesis for my lecture we have to treat it and when i say infrastructure i mean it is fundamental uh just like education is infrastructure to me right so yes it is about services and it's about human capital so yes if that's answering the question i'm not sure what the significance is though if we say it is infrastructure does it mean it will have more money right but i think what's important is to see it as so fundamental to the health of our economy that we are willing to put more invest more into it right knowing that we don't the economy and the society will suffer so of course another way to look at it also is how much do we pay caregiving and roles that are considered feminine this question comes to us from sarah tenning she asks us and her comment is due in part to the what she calls the feminization of industries for example caregiving education hospitality um do you think more needs to be done to address this refusal to give recognition and wages to what is absolutely work absolutely right so if it's if that's what it is that we need to see it as infrastructure this work is just so devalued right why is child care and was elder care so poorly paid why is it it on the pwm right even though we think of it as essential services uh so i you know i think there is a pattern of this that's why i was trying to draw from our child care experience to our elder care experience we just see this and it continues this of undervaluing right how do you square up the dilemma that could increase cost yes it will increase cost we have to pay for this so somehow we have to fund this right like i said we as a society we have it's a you know we're so used to not um and one of the problems is because of the solutions that we've had with like domestic workers it's completely devalued care that work now is worth so little and everything else child care cetera the base they're comparing it to having a domestic worker because we went for that cheap solution which has no future the domestic worker doesn't build skills that contributes to the economy if we had not relied on that and we said we need to have professional care more professionalized care we could have built that you know more of a professional care industry but now you know we are a little bit uh hampered by the fact that we have very cheap sources of care so a lot of things need to change the other thing about the domestic workers solution not only is it hampering the growth of our other care industries it's also i think a very risky thing to rely on the supply of domestic workers which you ultimately do not control it's like you want to have your own control over your water supplies it's because it is basic to life we really would like to build we should try to build a more robust local infrastructure right uh if we have to rely on outside and we will have to then let it be higher end right skills that are coming in you know we do this for every single uh other part of our economy we say skills right we are looking for skills and you come in and you know we are very mindful about how many people we let in but we don't do this we you know when you see the stats no one ever it's always like excluding domestic workers because that is like no control and so i don't know i mean this part needs to be fixed and it is actually a structural problem well you made a really strong case for government to invest in this area in government to focus and double down on the care economy yes so a question therefore that's related is in addition to these policy moves that you've already set out what do you think is the role of community and business that can improve the attention and the value of the care economy or have you given up on the role the private sector there no i'm not no i and i don't see it as so uh separate right so with child care so a lot of child care providers but um some are vwo some are private the government funds and they control the standards they also do you know offer the training institutes et cetera right they they they control a large part of it but actually the business activity is still done by private players so i think it is important to have both i certainly don't think that government should be providing these services it's way too much right so it is it is that they play this role of working with the private sector um and they will determine you know how much what needs we have and you know where we need to grow um the provisions so i'm reminded that it's about 5 30 but would you mind if we take maybe two more questions yep um we've talked a lot about the various aspects of gender equality but then this question also raises a much larger one which is how much of this is about culture and so these questions from constant singham asks us i have a concern it seems like singapore's corporate-centric culture and values play a huge part in why some may avoid caregiving work and singapore's working hours are some of the longest in the world and does not give time for a social life a family life what do you think we can do about that yep thanks connie that's a great question of course connie would ask it um it is absolutely true right we are struggling when i say that's why caring economy right we need both i think we're too skewed to economy and we have really neglected the caring part and we need a better balance in society i don't know this goes well beyond um like small things you do but because it is about working hours how are we going to deal with that because it's also like it's globalization it is capitalism neo-liberal systems gone like it just gets faster and more intense right life 20 years ago if you remember i don't know when you started work yes i still remember that you were slower right it was different but it was not so like oh it's so intense now right you didn't have many devices we didn't have so many devices of course we didn't have those devices that you know now you never turn off right so how do we deal with this i mean some countries have put down rules right no texts after 8 pm yeah you know i mean we as a society have to want that i think at the end of the day yes there is that whole i don't know you know there's a whole corporate momentum that is hard to stop [Music] i don't know how much people can do climate change offers a little bit of you know there is a crisis coming up the young people care more because it is their future and at some point will we will this stop us you know will it sort of cause some of us to pause to say we can't go on it's not sustainable right so yeah this is uh a global issue and i said so i said singapore and the world must find some ways of really working in a different way yeah more sustainably last question then um so this comes to us from suenmu who asks what do you think are the key mindset changes that the government needs to adopt in order for your proposals to be feasible and hopefully implemented i suppose she's asking because you've got quite a few to chew on right tonight um key mindset change i tried to uh in a way do this lecture so that i wasn't so radical in changing the way i think that the government works which is it really is a very pragmatic government right so i've used that pragmatism there's some limits to it right just being pragmatic all the time i i think we have to talk about the values and so i showed that last video because i think that it just shows us what caring means what dignity means and you know we have to see it and we have to want it as people and so um mindset cheer for government i don't know that i mean i i hope that we have we've made a compelling case today to say please do not undervalue care because it is very important for the economy stability society right long term um for the people i think we have to start thinking about what is important to our society so when it comes to taxes for example right if i say if we need to we pay more tax that's us paying because we feel these values are important we want to age well we you know if that becomes more important and what's interesting is that the older generation becomes the largest cohort of people right they will be the voters of of the next elections and you know they will have a say so they're gonna like okay you know we we we want better whatever you know it's in the at the end of the day i think the is the people yeah for fundamental shifts arena thanks so much you're welcome drawing this to a close it was very nice talking to you thank you thank you tim

#gracerevolution #josephprincesermons","love you all laughs you guys now would you be so kind as to double up that shout for the one who gave his all for us [Applause] hallelujah he's the one all together lovely amen you know when Jesus is tough he doesn't hurt when he is kind he's not soft he's steel and velvet servant and King he's all together lovely even close you may be seated [Applause] love you back I want to introduce the one that loves me all the time when I'm good and when I'm bad sometimes when I'm bad I'm kind of good she's blessed my lovely wife is here Wendy my beautiful daughter Jessica you know it's a real honor and privilege for me to be here I don't say that lightly because I know there is no lack of great ministers of the word in America so for Joel and Victoria to invite me is no small thing to me I honor that I take the sense of humility and responsibility I'll make sure I do do you know Joel and I we share a lot of similarities we have ministries of grace and hope we have beautiful wives lovely daughters he has a handsome boy and the doctors tell us that seventy percent my next child might be a boy but the most striking similarity between us both is that we are both darn good-looking at least we think so so much for humility are you all ready for the word luck okay never mind John chapter 1 verse 17 my favorite scripture verse John chapter 1 verse 17 for the law was given through Moses but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ the law was given you can give from a distance I could send a DVD of myself from Singapore but I came grace and truth came through Jesus Christ the law was given to his servant grace came through the son the law talks about what men ought to be grace reveals who God is in the first miracle of Moses he turned the water into blood resulting in death in the first miracle of grace Jesus turned the water into wine resulting in life and celebration and the law God demands righteousness from sinfully bankrupt men but under grace God provides righteousness as a gift now which one you're gonna be under I thought you would and yet today we have so confused we mixed up law and grace we have some law in some grace jesus said you cannot put new wine grace into the old wineskin because the new one would ferment and you will lose both now under law God said by no means pass by your transgressions but I'll visit your sins to the third and fourth generation but under grace God says I will be merciful to your unrighteousness and your sins I will remember there's been a change that's been a change Church and it's all because of Jesus and yet we are still preaching the law we are still preaching if you obey God God will bless you if you disobey God God will curse you and I sounds so right but it's so dangerous because today many of us we don't have it all together but we are so blessed I mean joy and I will testify to that it is called unearned undeserved unmerited favor amen you know when Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount he said love your enemies we've got problems loving our neighbor let alone our enemies he said if your right eye offend you pluck it out throw it away from you if your hand or fan you cut it off have you seen any any church anyone doing that the church would look like a huge amputation ward so what did Jesus mean Jesus brought the law to its pristine standard where the Pharisees has brought the law in a way that's manageable Jesus says it gives the woman the eye you have sin the Pharisee says unless you do it physically you have sinned so Jesus is an expert at using the law to bring you to the end of yourself so that you'll see your need for Jesus amen he didn't mean for you to pluck out your eye and cut off your hand a pastor Prince you should have come earlier clap your stops all together at least you still got your eyeball so what did Jesus mean now if Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount and he stayed up there on the mound there'll be no hope for us but you know the king of the sermon of the mount the king came down the mountain he came down to where there was sighing crying dying humanity and somehow there was a leper that made his way by stealth in the midst of the crowd and Jesus found that leper and he said a lot of you are willing you can make me clean there's no way the standards of the sermon of the mount could save him Jesus came down to where we were and Jesus touch him he's not been touched all these years he's not embraced his children he cannot even be in a public place for a leper is someone unclean and when he's in a public place he must shout I'm clean and clean and here he is before Jesus and he says a lot of you are willing you can make me clean he didn't doubt Jesus could he doubt he would and Jesus stretched out his hand and says I am willing be tranced now watch this on the law the leper the unclean will make the clean and clean but under grace Jesus made the unclean clean and the law sin is contagious and the grace righteousness and God's goodness is contagious we need not fear that being under grace will cost license license justice because the Bible says clearly in Romans 6:14 if you looked up here for sin shall not have dominion over you for or because you are not under law but under grace but what we have belief is that when you are under grace sin will have dominion over you we've been hoodwinked by the devil the Word of God is so clear when you are under grace and not under law sin shall not have dominion over you though what's in there is a noun you can put Satan shall not have dominion over you sickness shall not have dominion over you poverty should not have dominion over you when when you are not under law but under grace this idea that when people are under grace it will cost licentiousness it's not the pit of hell you cannot be under water and not be wet anymore than you can be under grace and not be holy you see Joe's ministry he preaches people right into the grace of God you never knew you got slapped right into the grace of God with God's goodness that Smile is dangerous to the devil [Applause] and then there's always some people who will say well pastor please you need to preach more on repentance it tells Joel Joel you need to fish more on repentance we know something and the law you have to repent first before God can bless you but under grace God blesses you first and he received the blessing and His goodness the goodness of God will lead you to repentance that's been a change so why don't we just open up the people's hearts and let them receive God's goodness anyway when they receive God's goodness they will change not because of their willpower but because of his goodness amen you know every Sunday from this pulpit repentance is going on in the church because as Joel preaches the Greek word for repentance metanoia changing of minds is taking place all the time all the time repentance is not beating your breasts shouting chili sauce in the altar call you understand you can do all that and go away unchanged because you have not not heard something that would change your life but every time you hear the word of God you hear the good news you hear how wonderful God is and his plans towards you a plans of good and not evil how God is for you your minds begin to change because the natural man they have hard thoughts about God they are thoughts about God are legalistic and hard you see Joe's preaching is dangerous to the kingdom of darkness so it's my preaching amen God is raising ministers of righteousness in these last days in the past the church has had many ministers and we have great revivals no doubt no doubt all right and those revivals have been characterized by preaching against sin and they are revivals nonetheless I'm not saying that people not safe I'm not saying they were not revivals but if you look at 2nd Corinthians 3 verse 9 it tells us up here look up is the minute if the Ministry of condemnation had glory God calls those ministry Ministry of condemnation those revivals that emphasize sin preaching against sin God calls them Ministry of condemnation and God said they were glorious but look what is the Ministry of righteousness exceeds exceeds much more glory you ain't seen nothing yet God is raising ministers of righteousness all over the world there is a grace revolution or harm and we are so glad we are part of it amen gone are those days of ministries of condemnation its Ministry of righteousness you know I remember many years ago in my living room God spoke to me while I was doing my study I was sitting on the floor and with all my Bibles and my study aids and God spoke to me very clearly on the inside he's his son study the journey of the children of Israel from Egypt to Mount Sinai for this is a picture of pure grace although they murmured and complained during this time not a single one died now I've never heard anyone preach this at a time I've never read any books on it so I spiritually went to my Bible check that portion as if the proof got wrong have you done that before her you can never win God and I found not a single one died from Egypt to Sinai although they murmured they complain now how many no memory and complaining is sin all right before the Red Sea when the armies of Pharaoh were charging against them from behind and the Red Sea was in front of them they shouted Moses did you bring us out here to die they're not enough grace in Egypt they murmured and complain no one died God open up the sea next three days we're doing okay and then there was no water they complain and God made the bitter waters sweet they were okay for a few days and then they complained there was no food and got rain not judgment but bread from heaven it seems like every fresh murmuring brought forth fresh demonstrations of God's goodness they complain again there was no water and God brought forth water out of the flinty rock and then they came to the foot of Mount Sinai in Exodus 19 and then they said to God all that the LORD hath said we will do now in the Hebrew is a strong word now I said then Ashima which means all that God can command us we can do it even before they heard the Ten Commandments in chapter 20 they boasted even before they have heard now that is men presuming on his own strength on his own righteousness which he had none and all this while God has blessed them not because they are good but because he is good he has made a way and provided for them not because of the a playfulness but because of his faithfulness that came out by the Abrahamic covenant of grace and now at the foot of the mountain in essence they are saying to God God don't treat us don't judge us don't assess us base don't bless us based on your goodness bless us based on our obedience the moment men presume on his own strength notice God change his stone in Exodus 19 gossiped Moses tell them don't come near all of a sudden God was a distance between him and men if you want me to bless you based on your obedience based on your goodness then don't come near the mountain is holy less you die now he never had that tone before before this he wasn't a pillar of cloud by day in the pillar of fire by night he was close to them and yet all of a sudden because men presume on his holiness on his own righteousness we see at none goes is this the deal if you want me to bless you based on your obedience don't come near not even a beast can come here unless it dies the next chapter God gives them the big 10 and listen God did not say if you break one you're guilty of the one you break God says if you break one you're guilty of all in other words if you don't commit adultery but you steal God sees you as an adulterer that's what it means in other words the Ten Commandments stands as a composite whole and you know what happened after there right after Sinai when the moment and complained the same scene that committed before cyanide you know what happened they died when they complain they died when they complained they died that tells us they should never have exchanged covenants and God put Israel for 1,500 years God put Israel under the law and the best of them still even David failed see the law condemns the best of us grace saves the worst of us hallelujah for his amazing grace the scriptures are clear that the Ministry of death if you look up here in 2nd Corinthians 3 it tells you clearly clearly in verse 7 in the Ministry of death written and engraved on stones noticed Ministry of death God calls the Ten Commandments the Ministry of death written and engraved on stones now you cannot tell me pastor Prince we are not under law in the sense we are not under killing of sacrificial animals we are not under the feasts of Israel because those laws were never engraved on stones the Ministry of death God is talking about the only ones and grave on stones and what are they the Ten Commandments God calls it the Ministry of death and sometimes we have a series of Sunday meetings where we teach the Ten Commandments killing people softly every single week God calls it the Ministry of death look at the verse before this God has made us ministers sufficient as ministers of the New Covenant now if you want to be a minister of the Old Covenant there's no power there's most efficiency there there's no provision there is no favor there's no charisma and no charisma tah alright God only makes efficient those who are ministers of the New Covenant and it tells us clearly not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life do you know that the first Pentecost 50 days after passed over the first pass over was the tune of Israel with a blood of the lamb on the doorposts there was the first pass over fifty days after that they were at the foot of Mount Sinai and what he got gave God gave the law and 3,000 people died in the New Covenant when the day of Pentecost was fully come God gave not the law but the spirit on Mount Zion and 3,000 will say the letter kills but grace the spirit is life hallelujah let's move our puppets from Mount Sinai to Mount Zion we are on the wrong mountain god of the move mountains can we are still came at Mount Sinai no wonder we are being shaken because those that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion the New Covenant you should not be shaken forever don't misunderstand me the law is holy the law is righteous but they cannot make you righteous the law is unbending therein lies its problem it is like a mirror when you look at a mirror it is unbending Lee and inflexibly true if you see ugly which I never do if you see ugly don't blame the mirror don't break the mirror don't punch the mirror sometimes you look at it it breaks the law just reveals who you are but he has no power to cleanse away your blemishes the law is holy but I cannot make you holy if the law of Bend slightly is no more the law you see the deal is this if you can keep God's law god bless you yes but by the same token if you break one God has to curse you can you understand that sometimes we we think that by preaching the law people become lawful but the Bible says clearly the string of sin is the law you hardly hear that preach in 1st Corinthians 5 verse 56 the sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law Wow the witch train des Dunamis in the Greek the strength of sin is the law guess what who is trying to bring the string of sin back to the church and he uses the pulpit and no marvel because his ministers that check transform into ministers of righteousness righteousness according to works his name in Hebrew is hasta thong which means prosecutor at law the devil long before I can still kill or destroy he's the accuser you must receive his accusation before he can steal from you you must receive his accusation before he can kill before he can destroy he's not called the destroyer he's called the accuser accuser not the murderer but the accuser of our brethren you need to know his devices in Colossians chapter 2 he tells us Jesus nailed the handwriting of Ordinances to his cross now what is the handwriting of Ordinances someone says no one can obliterate handwriting yeah but got him got nailed the law to the cross you know was getting next verse having disarmed principalities and powers that tells you the armory the weapon of the devil is the law the devil uses the law to knock you under here it tells you have not done this enough you have not done that enough even when you do right it's not enough when you do wrong it tells you you've done wrong when you do right it tells you is not enough is that user the accuser pastor Prince I'm married to one no that's not that's your wife's voice of conscience speaking to you brother you heard about the guy who boasted to his friends you know last night I had my wife begging begging me on her knees his friends were you know so by the NSA what did she say what did she say come out from under the bed and fight like a man no he didn't happen to me okay peace there was a minister at a cemetery once and he heard someone crying so he made his way over to place where he had a crying and was this man hugging the tombstone crying why did you leave me why did you leave me the pastor went to in the safe can I pray for you and he says yeah who is there that passed away my wife's first husband [Applause] all right let's get back to what sherry [Applause] we have so trade when people are not under law they become lawless that's the fleshly fear the devil puts in the hearts and the minds of the people the devil tells you without the law you become lawless but how come God called Abraham his friend Abraham lived more than 400 years before the Ten Commandments was given and he was tight with God man he was called my friend God causing my friend I'm a friend of God I'm a friend of guy you like that move slow motion you and I must make a plan we must bring salvation bad just call his name he'll be dead I believe he's in heaven well how do you know that pastor friends now I'm not a universalist but I tell you this there'll be more people safe than you reckon all right because of God's mercy God says believe on the Lord Jesus you shall be safe in your house you never know between that stage of unconsciousness and the place where one departs got in just visit someone say yo I'm Jesus because my Bible tells me that John saw in the book of Revelation a multitude no manhood number of every tongue of every nation of every tribe which no man could number but nothing is said of that in terms of those who go to hell it seems like they are more going to heaven and I think this church this ministry has a lot to do with them unveiling the goodness of God Amen when Peter first met Jesus Jesus said let's go fishing alright and Peter caught the whole night he caught nothing and he said to the Lord at your word I'll let down the net cuffed enter fisherman well if you say so I'll let down the net he let down one net and his neck broke it was a boat sinking lord of fishes and then he realized who Jesus was he fell at Jesus feet and says depart from me I'm a sinful man now question which one came first the goodness of God or Peters repentance is the goodness of God that leads us to repentance so ministry is like Joel God's so good it's powerful ass often breaks bones poor man UFC oh sorry excuse me [Applause] forgot I was in liquid you know look eighteen and nineteen the Holy Spirit put these two scriptures together look 18 and 19 I don't believe these two events happen chronologically but the Holy Spirit put them together in divine order in Luke 18 is the rich young ruler in Luke 19 is Zacchaeus in Luke 18 the rich young ruler came to Jesus and said what must I do what shall I do to inherit eternal life he was emphasizing his doing now Jesus should have given the evangelical answer believe on me and you shall be saved but he did not what did Jesus give him the law honor your father and mother thou shalt not steal don't commit adultery you know what the young man did he was quite smart he says all these I've kept whenever you both in the law Jesus always comes back to you and say one thing you left because by the law is the knowledge of sin God never gave the law to justify men by God gave the law so the every mouth may be stopped and all the world become guilty before God so they always see their need for grace Jesus said one thing you like sell all that you have and give to the poor and come and follow me that's the first commandment you must have no other gods not even Mammon not even money the Bible tells us that young man went away sorrowful next chapter Zacchaeus Jesus came into Jericho and the Bible tells us Zacchaeus was short so he climb a tree for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and the answer is always the tree so he looked down and Jesus looked up in geodes accus come down I must eat at your house Wow and all the people saw that whispering because Zacchaeus was a tax collector let's lie betraying your own nation and the scandal of grace began he's gone to eat with someone who's a sinner he's gone on this TV show he's gone on that TV show I'm sorry he's gone to Zacchaeus house [Applause] no loss given just brace at the end of that meal Zacchaeus stood up and said you know who all that I've cheated I'll repay for for half my goods I gave to the poor Jesus my land says salvation has come to this house now watch this in Luke 18 Jesus gave the rich young ruler the law and he could hardly give up a dollar and the grace Jesus gave no loss but grace and his wallet was open his house was open everything about Zacchaeus was open you know I always say I gotta watch it when my wife comes under grace she gives everything away I'm afraid that one of these days she'll give me away grace makes you generous grace opens up your heart and some leaders and some pastors are so afraid of grace because if I preach praise the people stop giving nothing could be further from the truth they will give and give all the right reasons not out of fear of the curse but the gift because the grace of God is upon them in abundance oh man you know we have added to the gospel folks it's said Jesus Christ died on the cross to give us the gift of righteousness he became our sin that we might become his righteousness he was cursed that we might be blessed he was made poor at the cross that we might be rich he wore the crown of thorns so that we can have the crown of peace and yet with a de to the gospel is always Jesus plus something Jesus plus restitution you have that teaching here not here in this church this is a Grace Church I'm talking about in America restitution it's not enough to be saved you must repay back everything that you've taken if you're a tip you must restore everything you have stolen it's virtually impossible to imagine the teeth at the cross when Jesus was nailed there and the teeth turns to Jesus and says Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus says to him I would save you if only you were make restitution the thief says I would Lord but I'm kind of stuck no that wasn't the way works he did not remember me today you shall be with me in paradise his wonderful name hallelujah this is our God he's our King he came a long way for us he came a long way for us Jesus is amazing you know we tend to get into human reasoning but in the economy of God he loves for you to take from him just like mater and Mary when Jesus came to Martha's house Martha went into the kitchen and she was busy preparing food but Mary said at Jesus feet now in the Asian custom or the middle-eastern custom what Mary did was rude what Martha did was right socially but in God's cause God's economy he wanted Mary right where she was drawing from him hearing his word and mater came out and she was stressed out and she was grumpy and she was angry and Lord don't you care my sister has left me alone to serve she blamed to it one go don't you care my sister blame the Lord and the sister you know when you're under stress you blame everybody but yourself and Jesus look at her sis Martha Martha you are troubled and worried about many things but one thing say one thing you know why Martha was trouble about many things because she didn't do the one thing that Mary did no you don't believe that many of you believe a few things are necessary not only one thing but Jesus says one thing is necessary and mary has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her amen which sister make Jesus feel like God mother who saw him in his natural tiredness wanting to give to him or Mary put two and two and took from him to an inexhaustible fullness that is still there beneath that veneer of tightness for he came not to be served but to serve when he was tired at the well in psyche are a sinner woman King the Bible tells us she came in the afternoon because she want to avoid all the lady folks you know and they are gossiping in the in the morning so she came in the afternoon when Jesus was there and the Bible tells us the disciples have gone to buy some McDonald's and she took from Jesus and she went away she took from Jesus and took from him and she went away and this time she was no longer self-conscious but Christ conscious telling that everyone in the city of Samara come see a man who told me everything about myself notice she was delivered from self because she took from Jesus when disciples came back with the McDonald's on a hip Jesus put obviously they saw Jesus was reinvigorated he looked different than when he when they left him he looked up he looked fresh and they asked one another has someone given him food you see with the Lord when you take from him you reinvigorate him when you take from him is as if you make him stronger David said it this way what shall i render to the Lord for all his benefits to me you know how God feels appreciated David gave us the answer what shall I give back to God for all his benefits to me I will take the cup of salvation the answer all right is to take some more from God amen God loves for you to take from him take your healing take your provision that his goodness take take take take and then and then you're given given give but unless you take you have nothing to give with men horizontally is more blessed to give than to receive with God is more blessed to receive and he wants you to receive you know sometimes we come to Jesus for a sermon we come to Jesus to have something to give some to somebody else we come to draw water instead of drinking you can draw water and still die of Tears but Jesus says if you come to me and drink drink is a personal consumption come to me and drink out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water for others amen let me bring this to a close blessed are the shot winded for they shall be invited back close pays a great man of God my mama didn't raise no fool you know one time they brought a woman caught in adultery and Jesus so rudely threw her right in front of Jesus while he was teaching in the temple and they said the Pharisees said master we have caught this woman in the act of adultery now Moses according to the law says that such should be stoned what's theirs there caught in the act she was not properly clothed now from what I understand about adultery he takes - is it the same in Houston I mean in Singapore it takes two so where is the man it was probably one of the Pharisees master is what Moses says what do you say now if Jesus says don't stone her oh you're breaking Moses law if he had said stone her everyone around there would be wondering they're confused because he preached about grace and love so they thought either way they caught Jesus he said nothing you know what he did he bend down with his finger he wrote on the ground now what is that a picture of by the way the precincts of the temple is not earth and ground it is cobblestones look up here we have a picture here is cobblestones so God is writing on stone he's saying you presume to talk to me about the law I am the one who gave the law now since you brought up the law is almost as if Jesus unleashed the full light of the law upon all of them by saying he that is without sin among you cast the first stone now he didn't break the law he upheld the law but only one who is sinless can throw the first stone and one by one they dropped your rocks Jesus stooped down again and the second time he wrote on the ground now God gave the Ten Commandments twice God wouldn't storm twice the first time never made it to the bottom Moses broke it off and gauzy small come back here so he went up for another 40 days and God gave another two sets right but this time God said put it under the mercy seat in the Ark of the Covenant mercy rejoices of a judgment that is the reason why the Bible says when you fall from grace notice grace is higher than the law fall from grace in a second time heap after he said those without sin cast the first stone he knelt down in a second time again he won on the ground by the symbolic action testifying he is the one who gave the law now there was one who was sinless who could cast the stone that day his name is a know something when it comes to stoning that lady that girl the Pharisees would if they could but they could not Jesus on the other hand could but he would not [Applause] the Bible tells us one by one they left convicted by their own conscience conscience from the oldest you know the intrigues me that the oldest one left first I always thought when you grow older you have less of a problem with you with your sin consciousness it gets worse when you get older so the oldest one left unto the youngest until there's no one left but Jesus and the girl and Jesus went to her she was probably crying and Jesus says woman where are those accusers and for the first time she looked up with tear-filled eyes and says no man Lord then he says neither do i condemn you go and sin no more now listen listen the church has it backwards the church says go and sin no more first then we won't condemn you but Jesus gave her the gift of no condemnation which empowered her to go and sin no more condemnation people will be empowered to go and sin no more hallelujah what a failure you know I believe as that lady left with all the burnouts in row away from her shoulders Jesus my Linh says father another one said to my account which he'll pay at the cross because you see the reason why there is no condemnation for you and I today wonderful as that truth is it's not because God has gone soft on sin God is holy his Trice holy he's a wonderful God but he's the holy God but every sin was born in the body of Jesus and when he hung there on the cross he took your sins and my sins and God's holiness holiness unleash his fury and holy indignation and wrath against all lawlessness against all sins and shake at the strength of the curse of lawlessness fell on Jesus he exhausted all of God's judgment and try [Applause] ha [Applause] now I'll go on help yourself and now the reason why there is present tense now no condemnation for you and I even when we sin it's not because God has gone soft it is because God's holiness cannot punish the same sin twice the law of double jeopardy when you sinned look to the cross and say Lord thank you is paid for if you don't do that something inside you your DNA is very smart when you condemn yourself is simply the cells of your body say he wants to condemn himself he wants to hurt himself let's create a disease doctors call a psychosomatic auto immune disorders when your body fights the gains it served people are sick today not because of sin sin is taken care of people are sick because of condemnation condemnation kills so when you sin what you do look away from self to the cross and say father thank you there is my judgment there is my beating and all the cells in your body go pee boys relax the price is paid as well and you are on your way to wholeness recovery life and health what a savior the dying teeth rejoice to see that fountain in his day and there may I doe file s he wash all my sins away wash all my sins away wash all my sins away and then I don't let see wash all my sins away there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from in my new Wells veins and

The first time I went to Singapore was in 2003. Growing up I had very low self esteem as I had failed in every sphere of my life. When I surrendered by life to Jesus, as I started to read the Bible meaningfully, God spoke to me from Proverbs 22:29 that He will put me in front of kings, presidents etc. Meeting the President of Singapore, who happened to be the 1st President that I ever met, was the fulfillment of God's promise in my life. Later on I started to meet many other dignitaries and shared my testimony and I give all the glory back to Jesus.

I'm forty-six years old and I suffer from an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes weakness to all parts of my muscles. That can be my limbs (and it can also affect my) swallowing and breathing. It's called myasthenia gravis. It's the kind of question that comes from a society that judges people based on their appearance. So, when people ask me that most of the time, the first reaction I give them is a deadpan stare. Autoimmune disease is a type of disease where your own immune system is turning against you. Somehow it targets your own organs (and treats them) as enemies. I have multiple autoimmune diseases actually. First is primary sclerosing cholangitis autoimmune hepatitis and ulcerative colitis where my immune system attacks my colon, liver and bile ducts. I was thirty-eight two years ago when I was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis. It's an autoimmune condition which attacks the brain and the result is that I now suffer from short-term memory loss. I don't really tell people openly that I'm sick unless the situation comes up that I have to tell people. So they tell me things that I have to do after the meeting and then I'll tell people, ""Oh actually you have to keep reminding me because you know, I have this condition."" My condition is called lupus nephritis. In short, it's called SLE. I remember, once I was in the army I was feeling a bit unwell, like a headache of sorts. I went to see the army doctor. At first he thought I was chao keng (slacking off) but when he saw my records, his (facial expression became) very pitiful and sorrowful. He said, ""Oh, you're such a poor thing. How many days of MC (Medical Certificate) do you want? I'll give it to you."" Actually, my life is like a time bomb. My health is like a time bomb. Meaning to say that, touch wood, there can be a relapse anytime my kidneys can be rejected anytime. Internally, things are just hanging on a thread. I was diagnosed at the age of nineteen. I had this drooping of eyelids. I thought there was something wrong with my eyes so I went to this ophthalmologist. So, they were saying, ""Hey, no, it's not due to your eyes it's due to some neurological disease-related condition."" He just told me, ""Okay, this gland (is producing) too many antibodies and it is attacking your other muscles. Antibodies are supposed to help you, but you have too many. So, once it is removed, your condition will be better."" It is a gland quite near to my heart, this area so you can see the scar here, actually. I didn't know it would leave such a long, permanent scar here. I never expected that. Once out of the operating theatre normally, maybe one week later you should be going to the normal ward from the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). But I stayed there for almost two-and-a-half months because I could not breathe by myself I needed to rely on a respirator. In fact, I just wanted to end my life at that time. I just told my sister, ""Just bring me back (home) I'll be very happy if I can just go home and die on the spot. I'll also be happy."" [Laughter] One of my friends in school pointed it out. She was like, ""Your eyes look like a cat's."" Because they were yellow. At first, I didn't think much of it. I just thought maybe it was the lighting or something. But then, slowly over time I felt like my skin got a bit more yellow. And then I started having a lot of stomach pains and cramps. Then, (I) had a lot of bloody diarrhoea. Sometimes the stools were also pale, like clay-coloured stools. My parents actually brought me to the A&E (Accident and Emergency) because of that. Because they felt that something was already wrong I mean, you're pooping blood and all that. At thirteen years old, I didn't really know what my condition was but I felt upset because they  gave me medicine that made me gain weight. So I actually started to cut myself. It didn't last very long though because my teacher found out then she scolded me. She talked me out of it. I don't know if she remembers, but I'm thankful to her for that. When I was eight (or) nine years old I recall one fine day when I was going to pass urine then I felt a burning sensation (when urinating) and my legs started to swell. And when I woke up from my sleep I also felt that my eyes were swollen. My mother was a nurse and she felt that something was very amiss. So we went to the Chinese sinseh (traditional Chinese medicine doctor) and the sinseh said that it was probably a chronic kidney condition. (He) referred me to the specialist and yes, it was true. He said that it was because of lupus and the eventuality would be kidney failure. So that was the time when I remember me and my mom, we were in a hospital ward and then we both broke down and cried. My girlfriend came home and she found me sitting on the couch, staring into space and chewing on a bag of cotton buds. And she asked me, as you would expect ""What are you doing?"" But I couldn't answer her. And that's when she got worried and sent me to A&E. When I got discharged, I kind of always questioned ""Why did this happen to me?"" The statistics for this illness is one in 250,000 people a year. So why did I have to be that one person, you know? So that was kind of difficult for me. I think that's another very common question that people ask me. My immune system kept attacking my liver  until my liver actually failed to work. I had to go for a transplant. That was when I was eighteen years old. I remember one of my friends asked me ""Oh, it's great that you're going (for a) transplant right?"" Then, I got a bit upset at her because I feel like everyone thinks (having a) transplant is a cure-all. But they don't realise that a transplant is the option that the doctor only gives when you've reached end-stage. Like when it is really bad enough that nothing else will work. I, personally, as a recipient of a kidney transplant a living kidney transplant my brother actually said that if I weren't his brother he probably (would not have) donated the kidney. After the kidney transplant the cocktail of medicines was greatly reduced but I still have to take medications every day for their anti-rejection (functions). Actually I wouldn't even think that I would recover fully in fact, I would think that I may go anytime. Initially, when I was diagnosed the doctors were telling me, yes there was a good chance I would make it to a hundred percent recovery. But, (during the) last therapy session they were saying, ""Oh, you are probably never going to be able to get back to a hundred percent."" And the analogy that they used was ""If a car gets into an accident, even if you go to the workshop and repair it, it's still not going to be brand-new."" At that session when I received the news I kind of like, slammed the table and just walked out the door from my therapy session and said, ""Forget it, I'm not coming back here anymore."" There were quite a few episodes of depression. And I actually had to see a psychiatrist and a psychologist. They told me not to focus on why it happened to me but to focus on how much I have improved since I came down with the illness. I think actually, being here today is kind of a major improvement for me as well. Till now, there's no cure for my condition. I mean, those medical researchers, when they want to find a cure they also think about the return of investment, right? If that medicine can cure a bigger population of course they would go for that first. Mine is a smaller group, maybe there is (research going on, but that) might have a long way to go. Do I feel (if it's) unfair? I don't feel (that it's) unfair because at least there is still medication to let me live a life. I still can breathe, just that I need to take long-term medication and I might be experiencing a lot of side effects (because of that). But it's okay!  I mean, there are still other medicines to control these side effects. I still can breathe, that's the most important thing. When I started to apply for a few jobs after my graduation they had a list, a very comprehensive form that I had to fill up where I had to write down my medical condition so I had to be honest and truthful, so I wrote (them) down. And subsequently there weren't many interviews - there weren't any interviews after that. In my heart, I sort of knew that it was because of my medical condition that made me a less suitable candidate because when both have the same results and both have the same CCAs (Co-Curricular Activities) and both have the same leadership experience, so to speak why would you choose the one who has a serious medical condition? Ya. So I knew that  I had to take the self-employment route. I was actually very open about my condition in the office and actually, very surprisingly a lot of my colleagues were very understanding of my condition. I was a project manager before I got sick and that involved a lot of keeping track of deadlines and all those kind of things. But, since I can't do that anymore the company and my colleagues have found me other work to do. I think yes, people do see me as less capable. But, I think it's also with the understanding of my illness. So it's not the case of me being lazy or whatever that I can't do certain things but I just can't help it. It's an official medical condition. So, yes, they see me as less capable but I'm okay with that. I do my best. To date, most of my colleagues don't know about my condition so, they don't see (me as) less capable. I still can - in fact, I'm more productive than them sometimes. [Laughter] And my boss gives me equal opportunities. Sometimes he knows that, ""This is quite a stressful project."" But he knows that I'm still capable and responsible. In terms of appraisal, I'm equal among all my colleagues. Actually, I went for one meetup in a way, a matchmaking session. So I was very honest with the people I met that I actually have this autoimmune disease, that kind of condition. So, I was being treated as a different class of person in a way. So he didn't want to continue because of my medical condition. I always feel that there are good apples around just that the timing may not be correct because there are always very nice stories where okay guys are even willing to take care of their sick companion for life that kind of thing. So I feel that when the time is right, I will also find that right person. My classmates don't seem to think that I'm doing as much as them. So, I feel like people who don't really know me will look down on me. There was this girl who I thought I was friends with in school. Then we had to do a group project together and I thought she understood my problems because she was one of the only two (people) who I talked to mostly in class. But then, it turns out she complained to another friend that she felt that I didn't do my part in the project and that she was tanking (dealing with) everything. She said something like ""So what if she has medical problems. Everyone also has their own problems."" So I felt very betrayed by that. To be honest, I'm not really disappointed because I feel I've proven myself enough to those who I care about. If I spend my time being angry at people, I'll just get more tired out. Why should you pity me? I still lead the same life as you and sometimes even better than you. So, I don't need people to give me better treatment or see me as a less privileged person, no. You don't need to. We are all equal. I would say my faith, my religion has helped me a lot whereby I learnt from my mentor in my life (that) actually, I'm someone who is much more fortunate than others. (That) made me feel like ""Hey, there's always hope."" I used to have very low self-esteem, very low confidence because of all my scars. But then, I was taught what beauty is. It's about inner (beauty). So I can also shine as beautifully as (other) people. I don't really like being pitied but I prefer being pitied rather than having my problems brushed off. Because at least if you pity me, it means you feel sympathy for me. So you understand that I am going through something that is a bit bigger than what other kids my age go through. And it is a form of acknowledgement because validation is something that I think most people with illnesses struggle with especially those with invisible symptoms. Maybe get piss drunk? [Laughter] I have this dream where I want to go to Disney World with my mom and ride all the rollercoasters there. Even though it is a bit late but at least I want to experience some of the happiness that other people have been through. After the transplant, my symptoms were mostly gone. Before that, my skin was actually yellow. like totally yellow. So I could not wear nice clothes I didn't want to dress up well. I didn't want to like, do the things that normal kids would want to do. Because during that time I felt like, ""What's the point?"" So now's the time for me to awaken as a teenager. I hope I can be in those less-developed countries where there are very poor living conditions where I can teach the students. Yeah. That's what I want to do. Because of my medical condition, I cannot join all these volunteering works. I think, that's what I would love to do. The first thing that came to my mind was to be able to drink water. A kidney dialysis patient can only drink 500ml of water every day. We feel thirsty 24/7. And every drop of water especially ice water, that was my favourite when I was on dialysis to us, it is precious. And I recall once after the kidney transplant the doctor even advised, ""You need to drink as much water as possible."" I was so happy, I gulped down one Ice Mountain, one litre of water I just drank [Gulping noises] and I went into the shower, when I was showering I was drinking water. Drinking the tap water and everything. So, it was a release. Even simple things like drinking water, I don't take it for granted. I think, people with autoimmune diseases I just want to say, ""Hang in there"". Life is not over even though you've come down with the disease. There will always be somebody who is willing to support you and see you through it. I think the best way to know what to do for another patient is if you ask them what they want you to do. I think what hurts me the most is that people ask you to go out and you have to keep saying no because you are tired. And then they actually stop asking. But the thing is that if you keep asking on days that I feel well I will say ""Yes"". Because, I'd rather have that option. I cannot be strong like other boys. So I studied very hard, I scored well academically. Actually deep inside I felt inferior. Sometimes, it is our mind and our heart that suffer the disability. Even when you meet obstacles, how can you overcome it and still stay so happy and hopeful? I feel like, everyone is given the opportunity to be happy it's just that you don't really realise that you can be happy too! When you meet our profiles, you might not realise that they have autoimmune diseases. Most of them suffer from invisible symptoms and so it may be hard for us to notice their pain. As a society, let us be kind to one another. We never know when someone might need some kindness. Do you know of any autoimmune diseases that are not mentioned in this video?

210,w8ZNp7cFgdo,民視英語新聞 Formosa TV English News,Taiwan reports community transmission of COVID-19,2021-05-11T14:54:20Z,"For the first time since the start of the pandemic, Taiwan has reported the community transmission of COVID-19. The Central Epidemic Command Center announced seven domestic cases on Tuesday, six of whom have an unknown infection source. One of the six is a man in New Taipei, who has a long list of close contacts. The other five are connected to an amusement facility in Yilan called the Galaxy Baccarat. 

Community transmission is here, says the CECC. On Tuesday, Taiwan reported seven domestic cases, the most in a single day since the start of the pandemic. Of greatest concern at present is that six of the cases have unknown sources of infection. Five of those six are a cluster connected to an entertainment facility in Yilan County. Four are employees and the other a customer.

Chen Shih-chung
Health minister
So far, there is no link that we can draw to any source of infection. Based on preliminary analysis, there is a very low chance that they are connected to the airline infections. We also confirmed their movements and there are no connections there.

In the wake of the outbreak, the entertainment facility and its entire building were disinfected. Case No. 1,202 – an employee at the amusement venue – experienced chills, a cough, a fever and other symptoms on Sunday and went to the hospital before being sent for COVID testing. Health officials then rushed to test those she had been in contact with. Three of her coworkers, as well as one regular customer, tested positive.

Chen Shih-chung
Health minister
These five cases from the arcade had no history of overseas travel. We will continue to investigate their recent activities to clarify the source of infection. In response to this incident, the facility is closed starting today.

The CECC said these cases would not have been detected, had it not been for the vigilance of healthcare professionals.

Philip Lo
CECC’s medical response division
The two cases, 1,202 and 1,211, had gone to the emergency ward of the same hospital. The cases were reported by the same doctor. It’s likely that a cluster was suspected – the medical team there was very much on high alert. So they qualify for our reporting bonus of NT$10,000 per case.

Voice of Kuo En-yueh
Camillian Saint Mary''s Hospital Luodong
It seemed that she was under a tremendous amount of pressure when she came to seek medical treatment. When she was replying to questions, I could sense her hesitation. But in the end, she did give truthful responses, on matters like the nature of her work. So I was able to make the assessment that this was someone in a high-risk group.

Another case with an unknown source of infection was found in New Taipei. Case No. 1,203, a man in his 60s, began experiencing fatigue, a cough, and chills last Friday. When he developed a fever that weekend, he sought medical care and was tested for COVID. So far 115 people have been listed as contacts of this new case. The CECC has released his recent whereabouts, which include a restaurant in Xinzhuang and a massage parlor in Luzhou.",for the first time since the start of the pandemic taiwan has reported the community transmission of covet 19. the central epidemic command center announced seven domestic cases on tuesday six of whom have an unknown infection source one of the six is a man in you taipei who has a long list of close contacts the other five are connected to an amusement facility in ilan called the galaxy baccarats community transmission is here says the cecc on tuesday taiwan reported seven domestic cases the most in a single day since the start of the pandemic of greatest concern at present is that six of the cases have unknown sources of infection five of those cases are a cluster connected to an entertainment facility in ilan county for our employees and the other a customer so far there is no link that we can draw to any source of infection based on preliminary analysis there is a very low chance that they are connected to the airline infections we also confirm their movements and there are no connections there in the wake of the outbreak the entertainment facility and its entire building was disinfected case number 1202 an employee at the amusement venue experienced chills a cough a fever and other symptoms on sunday and went to the hospital before being sent for kova testing health officials then rushed to test those she had been in contact with three of her co-workers as well as one regular customer tested positive these five cases from the arcade had no history of overseas travel we will continue to investigate their recent activities to clarify the source of infection in response to this incident the facility is closed starting today the cecc said these cases would not have been detected had it not been for the vigilance of health care professionals the two cases 1202 and 1211 had gone to the emergency ward of the same hospital the cases were reported by the same doctor it's likely that a cluster was suspected the medical team there was very much on high alert so they qualify for our reporting bonus of 10 000 nt per case it seemed that she was under a tremendous amount of pressure when she came to seek medical treatment when she was replying to questions i could sense her hesitation but in the end she did give truthful responses on matters like the nature of her work but in the end she did give truthful responses on matters like the nature of her work so i was able to make the assessment that this was someone in a high risk group another case with an unknown source of infection was found in new taipei case number 1203 a man in his 60s began experiencing fatigue a cough and chills last friday when he developed a fever that weekend he sought medical care and was tested for kovid so far 115 people have been listed as contacts of this new case the cecc has released his recent whereabouts which include a restaurant in xinjiang and a massage parlor in lujo ,True,False,False,False
211,f4vgNf_dk18,CNA Insider,Caring For My Son With Depression & Asperger's | Strangers In My Head | Mental Health,2021-01-08T12:00:10Z,"As a caregiver to her son who is dealing with Depression and Asperger Syndrome, Karen has devoted a large part of her life as a mother, a nurse, a counselor and a constant companion. Through her caregiving journey, she has been overwhelmed with worries for her son’s well-being and uncertainties of the future. Aside from self-blame, she faces harsh criticisms that she has been derelict in her duties as a mother.

With most of her energy devoted to the caring of her son, over time, Karen began to feel trapped and lonely - the caregiver burnout. With the help of Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL), Karen became aware of the importance of having a network of support. As her son’s condition improves, Karen is now helping to care for other caregivers. And at times when things get too much for her, Karen has to relearn how to take care of herself.

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",hi darling you went to wiki and this thing is really hot oh okay are you troubled by it i'll give you a few minutes and then you prepare some cheese toast for you all right i see you in a bit out of my tree thoughts i worry about brian the most brian has been diagnosed with depression in his teens so when you're playing games the whole night so you told me last night you couldn't sleep because of the cup is too hot actually it's my fault whatever it's not about fog i mean you get adjusted aircon look at me darling look at me they're feeling upset the change i saw in brian after he was diagnosed with depression it sort of broke my heart and it was very very difficult because i didn't know how to cope where to go [Music] [Music] this was the first year we went to australia and brian was only two years old but you can see you're so cute looking there this one he was a very happy kid when he was young enough we moved to australia at that time because a peter had a job offer so you can see the three boys uh so clement brian and andrew it's kind of interesting looking at the photos because there were so many things i've forgotten brian was so cheerful when he was young you know he was always smiling and up to anticipate i think things only started changing early teens so when he was in middle school in australia before he came back to singapore he already had difficulty with social and so at that time the school counselor informed us that he had exposure syndrome is a very mild form of autism but very high functioning who wants to shell the eggs and who wants to do the tuna okay um anyone wants i would like i don't know uh you want some more to me he has got this inability to socialize so he actually went through his life without really friends but because at home he has got two brothers we don't notice the problem you know it's only when andrew had to go to university and clement was in another part of the school that we saw that he was lonely and he wasn't coping that's when his depression got worse in some ways it's hard to describe what it what depression feels like i suppose it's a sense of bleakness hopelessness i suppose where you know things things it's not just the things are bad but it's never going to get better it's not really something i like to revisit in my mind so to speak having lived since he was a baby practically in australia and to come back to singapore is a complete cultural change in fact he's an alien in his own country so to speak he doesn't understand the local nuances the social norms in singapore so to him it is hey he's a new country altogether this is old-fashioned picnic huh what can i serve you young man a piece okay oh okay i'll try one next and then give him my easter because i'm responsible for one of these things usually he's very mild-mannered you know and very soft-spoken but during those periods brian displayed intense unhappiness frustration frustration over the whole situation then i ask his psychiatrist why is he behaving this way and also the psychiatrist told me you know every episode they have a relapse it becomes worse you know they become more aggressive and maybe eventually become violent he's like so much bigger than me you know how am i going to handle him if he becomes aggressive and violent so i was really troubled myself because i'm oh you know this is my personal history my mother is probably in my most consistent long term sport she was the one who would who prodded me to get help who took me to get help who encouraged me to get help she's been the most consistent part of that for my life essentially caregiving especially for people with mental health issues is more lonely than somebody maybe with a physical disability to some extent maybe i felt some guilt some shame you know for not being able to bring up my son properly so people will call me a bad mother i don't know how to bring up my child you know so you start withdrawing as well you know that it's to the loneliness kell provides support for people who are caregivers help them understand what the problem is and also teaches them skills to manage their program is called c2c caregivers to caregivers program it's like one caregiver talking to another and i get kind of the support network that i so yearn to have you know and that connection with other caregivers then i have this group that i can turn to and they won't judge me by attending itself just by your presence you are supporting someone else you don't need to say very much sometimes no words sometimes you know are needed to help someone yeah so what we do is outreach to the caregivers and then we also organize talks we share our stories you know it's been a very long journey and i think karen knows that it's been very trying with my younger boy so sometimes we give so much and we collapse and we don't forget about ourselves so the class actually helped me identify that my feelings and what i should do and of course i got a whole list of people to harass if i need help one thing i learned very important work all caregivers is self-care and i think to this day i think i neglect a huge part of it and when you do that you sort of really suffer because a lot of the burden that we are carrying is more on emotions and mental so if you do not take time to care for yourself that part of you will really dry up and drain you so yeah i did a bit of reflection the past few days and i think that is really very lacking in my life so what's happening this time what's happening this time i don't know i think i feel like giving up my plants are not in a very healthy state because my mind wasn't in a healthy state as well i was giving up i was giving up on my own life and so whenever i want to water my plants i looked at my plants and then i'll turn away i said no i'm not gonna water you are you growing new yeah fantastic looking back learning to care for brian was really tough i think it emotionally trained you know it's not a physical thing it's emotion and mental thing because he he is my son you know i want the best for him and i felt kind of trapped as a caregiver i wanted my life back i thought that you know when my children started university i can claim my life back okay darling you like to recline okay so i'm going to clean your face okay one day you know i just asked and also brian do you think of getting married you know and he told me mom i don't think anybody will love me you know and as a mother when you hear that you get very heartbroken not so much because i wanted a daughter-in-law or grandchildren but because the fact that he felt that in himself you know that he was not lovable so i was determined i supposed to do everything i can to make his life better why sugar now yeah so i decided to be brian's so-called constant companion okay i sit i lie down here and you must touch me now [Laughter] well it's comforting to know that there's someone out there who is at least on my side who's looking out for me even if i don't really need it so much anymore someone who i can talk to without being too judgmental and i don't have to pay that's good brian this is fair three [Laughter] all right to some extent i suppose in my heart of heart i might have blamed him you know like will i ever get a life you know kind of thing sort of a bit resentful i shouldn't but i did being human so i i think sometimes i i was rather rough with him you know i have a lot more conflict with him than peter because um i'm usually at home with him rather than peter and i'm a lot closer to him well part of the reason why i don't often don't tell people about it is because uh you let someone know that you have them and a lot of the times they trying to treat you as non-functional so to speak as in that you can't really go about your you know a normal day-to-day life if people a brand cannot find useful work cannot find decent jobs they will forever have to be dependent on others so as a parent the concern is will he be able to support himself look after himself when we are no longer around you think you'll most likely be affected or you can continue to work from home so now we're in the corporate period so everyone has to work from home so he enjoyed like two months you know of working from home i would imagine that you know when we go back to normal he might find it hard to adapt going back to the office so you're not looking forward to it is there a lot of preparation required oh well i think sometimes you need the mental adjustment you know because um i think if we can travel overseas we want to plan for holiday i need to go to places i like to go and visit andrew if they allow you go with me or you want to go with clemen you okay you're not comfortable at that point no this isn't really something good how does the meltdown look like well he'll start swearing he will raise his voice small things can trigger but we do not want to escalate as a caregiver we hope for complete recovery we want instant results now an illness do not have instant recovery so to me it's like it's a journey i've come to accept that i cannot hurry brian what do you want to talk about what is this i always encourage him to maybe take a certain course or try certain things so that you know it's okay to fail because i think as caregivers we are like a safety net you know if they fall we are there to catch them she sleeps a lot in the daytime she doesn't sleep at night i also notice that a couple of my siblings they need help but they don't want to recognize the fact that they need help right yeah they're also afraid of stigma so one of them will be like um constantly she'll come to my house a lot and i noticed uh she was behaving a bit strange when you take in a lot of this you hear a lot of pain and grievances mentally you have to process it and then you know emotionally it will affect you how you feel you know because here you are practicing empathy so from what i understand um you know i think the ocd of patients i think they need a lot of reassurance usually it comes from a place of anxiety you know for a pretty long time i can cope with my fellow caregivers when they share with me then of late you know there was too much of it and sort of affected me so my own mental state um it's up and down okay so uh why did you go back something happened to your daughter um so so how bad is her autism mild or severe so for them there's something in the brain that that wasn't connecting properly so don't blame yourself can karen is one when she gets into something she will get deeply in up to her ears caregivers have got crises all hours of the day and they will call you when they need help so she tries to help them whenever she can a lot of the times you know when they do not know how to express themselves they would just cry or they throw tantrums things like that no you've done nothing wrong you've done everything correct okay i do think my mom sort of enjoys as a sort of mentor to other caregivers honestly i feel like having people to help having people talk to having something to do is helping her as well she's helping other people i'm happy for her so it takes time but then at the end i think they can lead quite a normal life don't give up we are still here we can do it together yeah [Music] so my whole life i sort of always been somebody's wife somebody's mother i always live my life for my family i come to a stage where i think i want to claim back a part of my life for myself live for myself to do the things that i love doing i treasure freedom a lot i actually used to socialize a lot oh and then brian doesn't really like company so in the past my fear of upsetting brian stops me from inviting my friends over so i thought now he seems to be better i actually ask him if it's okay to have some friends over people that he knows as well so he's agreed hi jessa hi good good good oh thank you thank you thank you so much we go to the other side for dinner come come brian come this is brian my second son [Music] that's yesterday this is johnny the two j is yeah okay and uh they brought something for us there okay okay okay all right have some drinks first drink with doctors it's okay ah thank you uh [Laughter] i find it difficult to talk about friends in general so to speak i don't really i sadly don't have much familiarity with the concept in practice so i really can't say i haven't seen you whatever yes that's right hi hi how are you good good we have dessert upsets these also have to be in the fridge right okay ah okay uh brian uh okay daddy bring okay anything else that needs to go to the fridge we've been working from home yeah uh okay right now today i just got ambushed by something that looks so i'm really kind of angry sorry i'm ambushed by something in the world today so i'm kind of angry oh okay all right i believe this dinner is a milestone for brian i think he has grown and be more open in this life a step in the right direction i suppose small steps you know which is good looking after brian over the years didn't wear her down but now that we have more understanding things have gotten better [Music] i relate to plants nature basically because it gives hope so like you know when you plant something um it will grow like a tree it can grow strong and tall then there were shrubs and then there were saplings and so it reflects our life different phases of our life and then i tell myself when i was looking at that that it's okay whichever stage i am in because some part of my life i will be strong so even though i maybe at the moment i'm not doing very well i should be okay nature takes care of itself my plans were dying i didn't even bother to sort of revive them in spite of my neglect i could see new shoots you know and then i was reflecting they want to live [Music] [Music] my plans represent my life and my life represent my plans [Music] i will rebuild i will rebuild and maybe make my little own private garden and i hope to rebuild my life i must try you know i must try because i must bring back some color and some life into my home into my life [Music] what's up ,False,False,True,False

coming year there would be a pandemic on the rise now that i think about it i actually got sick in singapore i had a fever i had chills diarrhea and i was told by the cruise staff that i needed to quarantine for a bit of a time it didn't click at the time but when you look at the symptoms of covered 19 fever chills diarrhea sickness and more i probably ticked or 50 of those i'm zince ramono founder of black african and beautiful also known as bab media group a digital media agency that generates traffic in over 27 countries in four continents and today i'm here to speak to you about how globalization has enabled the foundation of my work and the and the impact that the pandemic has had on it the closing of borders around the world impacted a multitude of industries now did anyone hear about zoom before last year because i didn't and all it took for the video conferencing service to take off was grabbing the right opportunity at the right time and now zoom is one of the most resourceful tools for digital and remote work technology is transforming a globalizing planet covert 19 created a unification of some sorts as many of us were locked down in our homes we held tighter and closer to our loved ones making us worried about the uncertainty of an unknown future in south africa not only were we met with coronavirus and its volatility but we also had a shadow pandemic being gender-based violence and femicide that was exasperated by covert every day on the news we were flooded with taglines of number of infections and number of deaths alongside missing girls women and children because of the lockdown measures many victims were unable to escape their perpetrators and could not leave home to seek protection this was my experience of covet 19 and it activated feminine leadership and activism within me so what does it mean to break borders for south africa and how can this great nation my home become a leader for post-pandemic world in globalization according to unaids the riches of countries are vaccinating a person every second while the poorest of nations are yet to vaccine anyone as recent as march 2021 protectionism can be defined as a theory or practice by which countries protect the domestic industries from foreign competition by taxing imports there's no doubt that developing countries are stuck in a debt trap impacted by protectionism covert 19 and socio-economic issues this debt trap continues to grow as money is borrowed from first world countries through initiatives such as kovacs suddenly a non-third world problem became a third world problem can you afford to vaccinate your citizens acquired debt represents a systemic risk to the global economy according to the world bank and international monetary fund the economy of south africa cannot keep up with the competition when it comes to limited access to vaccines i believe that vaccine equity should be a human right for all with no terms and conditions attached the virus impacts us all it does not care about your physiological geographical or economic identity and this is what unifies us yet when citizens don't have their health they cannot contribute to an international economy the ideology of globalization requires countries to work together towards a common goal this is why alliances are formed such as the african union and sadek the african union and the african center for disease control have developed a digital application called my covert pass the ideology behind this app is so that we can ensure safer border crossing across the continent it indicates who has been vaccinated and who hasn't who has a medical history of covert and who does not the app is powered by econet a telecommunications group that has operations and investments in africa and around the world it is founded by strive massivea one of africa's billionaires did someone say african excellence but how does one strive for excellence when their health is at risk maso's hierarchy of needs is an idea in psychology that consists of safety and needs love and belonging esteem and self-actualization so where does south africa belong on this pyramid safety and needs that has been the reality of the country 27 years into its democracy the safety and needs of south african women needs to be prioritized i've had the wonderful opportunity to work with an ngo called international women's forum south africa they do various initiatives including young leaders connect of which i'm head of digital conversations through that we seek to develop the next generation of women leaders the time is now to mobilize women and to invest in the girl child in stem which is science technology engineering and mathematics through this we may achieve a redefined post-pandemic globalized world there's a saying that if you educate a man you're educating an individual yet if you educate a woman you're educating a nation yes with the pandemic we have witnessed rich countries holding vaccines we have witnessed protectionism and violence against women exasperated by covet 19 including covet 19 itself yet what do we aspire to achieve the 2020s are the divine time for a digital economy through this we are witnessing remote work technology transforming change and the future will be defined by technology monetary and financial innovation there's an african proverb that states that if you want to go fast you go alone yet if you want to go far you go together and by now you're probably asking yourself hm how do i get involved well you must be lucky today because young leaders connect is always looking to develop the next generation of women leaders all you need to do to qualify is be between the ages of 23 to 40 years old and have an experience of one to ten years in your field in closing the pandemic has had an effect on globalization and yes together we are on a path to recovery but it is important and very vital to remember that no one is safe until everyone is safe thank you for listening [Music] you ,False,False,False,False

of IPs Singapore perspective seminar 2020 this year's topic is politics in many places this is almost a dirty word often associated with power contests for one's personal benefit always being associated with corruption hence not surprisingly in many of these places many of the most capable and committed have hesitated to come forth into political service however politics in Singapore should really be about governance governance is fundamentally about improving the lives of our people and allowing them the best opportunity to fulfill their potential and aspirations so this afternoon the question before us is how can we build a political system and culture in Singapore that will keep us going growing and glow it this is so that our people can continue to improve our lives and realize our expectations but this is not easy many other societies are fracturing under the stresses and strains of various forces for Singapore we face another major challenge as an open society where external forces will always penetrate and permeate our society to try to influence our choices and direction unlike many other countries and like many other bigger countries we do not have the geographical historical linguistic or cultural buffers against many of these external forces so to catalyze today's discussion I will propose three hypotheses for consideration on how we can remain exceptional amidst this global and local developments so the first hypothesis is asked to remain exceptional and keep going we must have a political DNA that inclines us to constructive solution and positive actions beyond rhetoric and debate some define democracy to narrowly as a contention and strife among opposing and competing ideologies others suggest that the map of success is about the quantity of different voices and representations in the legislature or society I think these definitions are inadequate beyond pure reality any functioning political system must have reasoned debate based on facts that lead to concrete actions and plans to better the lives of our people what distinguished us in Singapore is the second part of the sentence that beyond reasoned debate based on facts we need concrete plans and actions to better the lives of our people and this is the essence of SG together today in this digital age of fake news and alternative reality this simple task has never been uttered beyond plurality there must be mechanisms to allow the diversity of ideas and the divergence of perspectives to finally lead to convergence for action this is the true test of democracy in action today in many societies and democracies we indeed see plurality and diversity in debate but we have yet to see many societies where all these lead to convergence in action instead increasingly we see compromises and consideration for the broader societal interests giving way to narrow sectoral interests the result being that the long the longer term interests of the future generations are often sacrificed we will really have to ask ourselves this what sort of politics we won in Singapore especially if Singapore is to be around forever not just for the next four to five years hypothesis number two to remain exceptional and keep growing we will need to have the gumption to evolve our political system to stay relevant with the needs of time now this is a very difficult task but the lack of evolution in any system almost inevitably leads to revolution so in the Singapore context how to evolve our systems to anticipate and pre-amp roblems even when it is politically inconvenient and politically not expedient can maturity in our case not be a preview to ossification decrepitude and finally collapse I will pose it that answer to these questions are as important as who we choose to lead us within the existing system hypothesis number three to remain exceptional and keep glowing beyond culture and structure the final piece must be the ethos of political leadership how do we inspire and bring forth teams of people who are capable committed and with conviction that means we need good and real political leaders and not just politicians for the short haul we have been lucky over the last six decades but maintaining the right ethos of political service will never be easy especially in times of peace and abundance we can all be easily loud into complacency thinking that all will be well or we think that someone else can and should do the job or us why should it be me to undertake this Danglars task but this issue goes beyond political leadership it actually applies to leadership at all levels of our society we all see ourselves as fellow Singaporeans with this same shared responsibility to seek solutions for the challenges that we face anticipate the challenges that we face and put in place system structures organization's culture ahead of time to priam those challenges so on that note let me pause and hear your thoughts for us to continue the discussion true political service requires leadership and stewardship for this generation and for the future generations the emphasis is on service and not politics may we all work together as one United team to keep Singapore going growing and glowing thank you very much [Music] you [Music] um good evening Minister thank you for your time this today I'm Aiden I'm a student from yo and u.s. college and I'm also a member of SG climate rally you mentioned that we want su to be around forever I would like that too but in order for that to happen we must reverse the climate emergency that we're seeing today and so as Minister for Trade industry I wanted to ask how Singapore intends to confront the elephant in the room which is a large phosphate industry that we host given that we want to be responsible and pull our way in dealing with the climate crisis as well thank you yes we have a big petrochemical industry but we also have to be realistic how is our petrochemical industry performing in fact this is one of the things that when we went to the Paris treaty discussions for a small country like us we felt very much done in because of the size of our GDP population - graphical area we have that mascota our pet that our pet cam industry is one of the most efficient one of the cleaners in the whole industry and you benchmark ourselves if you know the terminology they will they will do the first quarter second quarter the quarter and the benchmark most of our industries are in the first quarter but the carbon budget is counted against us rather than a consumer if we tomorrow we don't produce so we ask the people in a discussion room tomorrow if we don't produce if we don't produce we're all these same petrochemicals we produce they will be produced somewhere else in the world and more likely also to be under conditions which are perhaps more polluted than the current conditions but we do have this issue so notwithstanding that we take our carbon responsibilities very seriously there are industries that may want to come in to Singapore and which we may not be able to even accept them so I'll give you an example Singapore is the data hub many internet companies many digital companies would like to set up their data centers in Singapore but data centers require huge amount of energy huge amount of energy requires huge amount of carbon budget are we able to attract those if we are unable to attract those what does it mean for our economy our position as a global hub for the digital services now these are difficult questions that cannot be answered just because we are philosophically whether to one consideration and not the rest in fact in all such difficult decisions we have to ask ourselves how do we remain competitive as a economy to attract those investment create good jobs for people how do we fulfill our carbon budget obligations not just for this generation for the next generation how do we have sufficient energy supplies for Singapore and life is fair in Singapore we don't have earthquake we don't have Thai food but that means that we have no job we have no wind power and not much the only thing that we have is a solar however 80 percent of the time in Singapore the skies are overcast the efficiency of the solar panels when they are working at a current technology level is about 20 to 25 percent for the best of class so what can we do to unlock the energy constraint or rather the carbon constraint for the next 50 years so that we can continue to attract the industries create good jobs for people and yet at the same time manage our future carbon budget number one think of how we can diversify our energy sources so we have gone from oil and gas to LNG which is one of the cleanest fossil fuel number two we can significantly try to improve our solar panel coverage in fact I think by the end of this year if I'm not wrong we have one in every two hitch to be flat with at least some solar panel and we will try to steal as much as we can right so those are what I call supply but we need to manage the demand as well I always ask ourselves how we can reduce significantly the energy consumption for cooling needs one third of our energy consumption goes to cooling needs for the residential and commercial so we are going to that's why during the energy week we have set off a grand challenge to for Singaporeans to come up with ideas on how we can reduce our energy consumption in order for us to release the constraint for us to still have our fair share of industries and so forth now finally your question is that are we thinking of a post fossil fuel future yes we are because we know where the trend of the world is going right we are just one small part on the global economic many of the big companies be Exxon Mobil we shell and so forth they are all thinking of a future beyond for silk fuels how fast we can get there it all depends on how fast we are able to adopt those technologies but are we thinking about it yes certainly but when the time comes it will mean that our economic structures will fundamentally be quite different it means that the type of jobs that we can create for our own people will be quite different and all this will not be able to be done overnight because as you shift the industry structure we must have all care about the jobs that are being displaced and these are jobs that many of our people are working in so yes we are looking at that and we are thinking of how to make sure that we insulate ourselves against all these difficult problems then we come and confront us but we can all do something to unlock the energy and carbon puzzle there confronting us today mr. Chang my name is wallet and I'm from NTU I am heartened by a call for us to have more gumption to evolve the political system so in the spirit of providing constructive suggestions beyond rhetoric and debate I would like to run by two suggestions with you to evolve the political system firstly is it possible for us to have an independent electoral boundaries review committee wonder is not under the purview of the Prime Minister's Office and not checked by the secretary to the Prime Minister the second one is about the GRC s can we have a reduction in the size of GRCC to a maximum of over 2% GRC because if the motivation if the intention is minority representation we do not need beyond two people in a particular GRC thank you so the EBR see the electoral boundaries review committee they are formed by the civil servants who have knowledge on things like demographics and other counting's I never dug their independence they do their job professionally they report to the cap sack okay as a former metal procedure because no matter who does the work how is done you have to report to somebody and present it to be a proof and then to be issued right so I never done the work of the ebee RC and I don't think the civil servants will be so unprofessional as to take into account considerations beyond their remit as to your second question I think the Prime Minister have said this before and I'll just repeat here and the primary starting after the last GE have said that well he would give instructions to the GRC to see how we can have a smaller giasses and more assemblies so I wait for the EBS is what to be done before we make any comments as to what it is but that the Prime Minister has gone on record to say that I'm caught I am from NTU center for liberal arts and social sciences my question moves away from the material to the issue of language and identity you mentioned you're one of your themes is evolution and change with regard to current policies and the language policies were crafted at a time where historical circumstances and other circumstances were different and I'm wonder I'm wondering whether you are thinking about bringing them up to date because they contain a lot of contradictions a consequence of our leaving Malaysia and our choice of multiracialism was the English language became the linchpin of multiracialism as a result the national language Malay became symbolic a contradiction here is that bilingualism is very narrowly defined its mother tongue and English we live in a neighborhood which is largely Malay and we have a large male minority so why is not this choice available now okay right the next contradiction is this is a majority Chinese population and it was decided that Mandarin is our mother tongue the reality is Mandarin is that which was used by the Chinese educator in the Chinese educative system for many people their real mother tongue is really their dialects to promote Mandarin dialects were suppressed repressed and the result is a repression a suppression a psychic depression right of people who spoke dialect and for the younger generation a sense of cultural loss at the moment it doesn't seem to be an important question but in times of crisis when identity politics come in this could be very important thank you actually you are right a great review the circumstances which the we are facing now and then is quite different we chose English as the language which is the common for all of us partly because it is not used by any particular linguistic group as you mentioned but there's also a very practical reason and that's our ability to connect to the rest of the world because english is the language of business in the rest of the world for a large part of the world on one hand we want to unite our people on the other hand we want to be able to connect with the rest of the world on the policy objective is that we all want our children to grow up having some understanding of their roots which is why the mother tongue came in with Malay Chinese or demo right the question which is before us is then what is a practical way forward today because of the rise of china because chinese has become economically more useful there are many people taking up Chinese seriously in schools and even beyond schools for economic reasons so that has changed compared to the password by in the 60s and 70s with before the sharp rise in the Chinese economic have people were perhaps not so seized with learning the language if you ask me for those who are capable I encourage everyone to learn as many languages as you can but I know how tough it is to master one language if not two and definitely more difficult entry I myself went through this journey my family doesn't speak English for me until today people laugh at my english funny twang I do speak as polish as other people but that's my background so I try in my home we watch Chinese programmes so I think in Chinese and convert them into English that's why sometimes when the media interview me they think I'm speaking in Chinese when I'm actually speaking to them in English my late grandmother knew neither English nor Chinese so she spoke to me in Cantonese - ah I learned my multiplication table in Cantonese today when I think about mathematical concepts I think in Cantonese it's very complicated but I think say that I think my posture is this all of us learn English to try to connect ourselves and connect with the world all of us : a mother tongue to the extent that we can to keep our roots and understand where we come from all of us to those who are more capable take at that language whether is it bahasa melayu bahasa indonesia Japanese German French whatever if you are I encourage you to do so because you will make the Singaporean much more competitive in the global economy to be able to connect to the rest of the world but I don't think you'll be possible for us to insist that everybody not master so many languages I'm Ching her from tamasic Junior College I just want to ask about your long-term vision for Singapore being cognizant or global uncertainty bit politically socially or economically where do you see Singapore in the next 20 to 30 years my long-term vision in Singapore is not just the next 20 and 30 years it's not just the next 20-30 years I grew up in a system in a part of the system where understand that the last 50 over years of our existence has been an aberration in the history of Singapore and the history of this part of the world if we go back a few hundred years Singapore has never been independent and some would argue Singapore has never been allowed to be independent never been independent because as a small city-state without a natural convention in Tallinn it is very difficult to survive without those external links for resources supplies markets Pelin and so forth it's very difficult so I never never take it as a given that we will arrive at SG 100 effortlessly never when it comes to the social issues we have succeeded on many fronts but the challenges are ongoing in the past we were equally poor today we are unequally rich the challenges are no less in the past everybody feels that they have a chance to rise up to the top and today we pride ourselves to that amongst all the societies that we see Singapore is probably the best place to be born even if we don't come from a privileged background because we have every reason to believe that we can succeed that is not to be taken for granted every country as they mature ossified they form groups and after a while there will be groups they ask themselves why should I continue to support this system if I cannot get a hit in this system those are our ongoing challenges so what's my vision I only have one simple vision for my entire life will be in the SAF MSF and you see or now MTI I have one very simple and that is for Singapore to defy the laws of history that will define a future where the future is in our hands and we are not beholden to others nor hell ransom by others there were others as us to jump we don't have to only us how high but we can ask why is it easy no I don't think so is it easy my wife asked me why do you continue to be where you are every day you are getting all the big bets your family is getting the regrets your children are getting the big bets why are we still here and I can tell you we are still here I am still here because I want my children and my grandchildren and for many more generations to come to be able to call themselves Singaporeans that they have the means to Rico Singaporeans and they have the gumption to be causing a foreign the will that today we may just be Singaporeans but one day there will be a Singapore trip that's why for the Bicentennial I like it so much when Indrani proposed the tec-9 from Singapore to Singaporeans there's the double meaning to it from Singapore a geographical location to Singaporean people of people united by a set of values although we may not be having a common ancestry race language religion but Singapore to Singaporeans is also about our stewardship to leave behind something better for the next generation just as the previous generation have left us with what we have today that every generation of Singaporeans will not fear because they will start from a higher platform to still a higher peak that every generation will lend our shoulders to the next to stand taller and see for them and if we can continue to do that I worry not I'm not worried about SG 100 I will say that even beyond SG 100 we will continue to shine so what's my vision for Singapore defy the odds of history show the world how a small city-state without natural resources without a common ancestry come together value add to the world contribute to the world and bring forth people with a common set of values and vision and not just looking at the past that is our life spoke you a surrogate I think you'll be the same answer that's what unites us in this endeavor to make sure that there will be a Singapore there are our children and future generations they can be proud [Music] [Music] dooba French political scientists have this very interesting hypothesis he argued okay let me let me read the dominant party whereas itself out in office it loses his vigor it's a trace hadn't it would does be possible to show that every domination best within itself the seeds of its own destruction so is it the done deal gender pap you still still be ruling party two or three decades from now the PAP seem to have defied do it just a prediction Jospeh look at Congress Party of India a pillar any one party dominant gone across the Cosby I'm no it's in them in the opposition now but party which I spent a lot of time examining the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan in power from 1955 to 1993 out buying power in 94 and between two nine two two one two it was in the opposition so so it's interesting is the pap going to be the last perennial one party in the world I would argue quality of the leaders ability to attract talent and the smooth passing on the bitter political beaten that's why we have to G 3G 4G 5g question well ok the institution's norms and blueprint of governance established by the Olga I think resonated with the electorate if these values are not embraced by Sigma citizens I think they would have been thrown out out of office successful economic stewardship and identity eight that for the majority of voters in Singapore they do find life in Singapore rather vulnerable very good for some on the whole even if there are unhappiness with specific public policies such as public transportation problems later with our trains and immigration policies the other thing to note is the Cape is really really impressive at the grassroots now Singaporeans with any problems you couldn't see n is your MP I don't think you leave empty-handed if you really truly need KP is very very disciplined cadra party it's not faction ridden although some people joke that it is Leninist party no democratic centralism the advantage of parental rule by the PAP symbolic eyes with the state machinery and you see a strong influence on media and he extended its hegemonic values to society I don't think it's just propaganda coalition but many Singaporeans actually embraced the values which I mentioned articulated by the old God the question mark is can we maintain unity in diversity unity in diversity without leading to fragmentation and fishes in in our society and obviously the PNP must evolve in a dam likewise opposition parties a food for thought PPS hegemonic control of political narratives and facts both man was mentioned a few times this morning will they be effective we imagine in in future elections if you have opposition parties civil societies individuals making all kinds of statements how are you gonna enforce it maybe high parts being overloaded are we gonna go after them selectively pm/et problem how are you gonna address rising social inequality social inequality is something which is endemic across the board simple I saw globalized can be escaped from global trends of social inequality and can political parties attract the support of Millennials my daughter is a millennial I mean she thinks very differently from me so I mean good things we get and KP guess how you gonna convince the Millennials big challenge I will the PDP leadership remain united in the post vc and long Eva can PAP afford a team B without splitting without tearing itself apart look at the talent pool of the PAP look at the MPs and the activities very impressive is there no space for Team B now this may be a bit controversial political elitism I'll qualify it by saying that I cannot come across any political systems in the world where there are no elite is a matter of degree but in case of simple can the PPP's governance evolve from a small elite circle to greater political participation and transparency in governance can the PAP in the decades ahead avoid the adjust theory it was just trap that all dominant political parties are doomed to between true now power is that the feet of the PAP I'll start by highlighting three relatively stable factors that I believe are unlikely to change in the coming election they're not big surprises but I think it might be useful to know these things to frame our discussion first the opposition is not a government in Waiting furthermore that's not what most voters expect from them they function as a potential check on the ruling party a means for citizens to exert pressure on the PAP government the dominant party context helps explain why most voters do not expect opposition to have fully formed platforms with detailed policy proposals the PAP understandably finds this very frustrating it has criticised such voting behavior as irresponsible and warns that this is opposition for opposition's sake nevertheless many voters will continue to use their vote as a way to deliver a desired level or check and balance the second given is that the opposition parties will not form any grand coalition minor parties may tema but big ones won't at most they will enter into minor pacts to avoid three-cornered fights opposition disunity is a reflection of voters own lack of consensus about the kind of political competition they want different voters are attracted to different types of opposition therefore there is no single proven formula for both satisfying hardcore opposition voters were at the same time attracting swing voters first time voters and loyal PAP voters who may be tempted to defect the third constant that we should bear in mind is that the opposition will continue to benefit from the underdog advantage Singapore voters may not have a great appetite for multiparty democracy but they do have an innate sense of fair play the opposition plays the underdog hartwell and the government seems to know this thanks to that underdog advantage voters will give opposition candidates some leeway as long as they do not have disqualifying deficits the underdog advantage also means the attacks on the opposition may backfire if they are perceived as over the top remember how the wp raise 1 million dollars in three days - just one online post this is a sign the PAP cannot ignore now let me turn very quickly to the unknowns the new and less predictable factors in the this election first I think who really has the upper hand in the online battle for hearts and minds for a long time we have assumed that untamed territory or cyberspace is ruled by opponents of the PAP but the ruling party and the government were not sitting idly by especially after the 2011 election government ministers and agencies develop a major official Facebook presence by the 2015 election these efforts were already significant former IPS scholar Santana how noted that we were seeing quote-unquote a normalization of cyberspace by this he meant that Singapore's online space was beginning to resemble offline space that is largely middle-of-the-road opinions with anti-government voices on the fringe just like in the real world the government's voice was getting to be among the loudest in the virtual world I think the second game-changer in this election is the touching bop factor major opposition parties have done well to attract credible candidates including those that the PP might have also considered to be attractive candidates but I think it is Tanjung Box entry into opposition ranks that is groundbreaking he is he was no ordinary backbencher he was a trusted CC member the question is whether he will pave the way for others dr. Turner has cast himself as someone who wants to reclaim the OPP the question is whether there are enough people who can tell the difference between the all in the current now the third uncertainty is about how economic and geopolitical conditions will influence voters in most countries the state of economy is the best predictor of elections the greater the economic turbulence the more the people are likely to want to vote against the government of the day in Singapore it is different because of the Papists status of the National Party of government Singaporeans have contradictory feelings towards the PAP when times are bad they may blame the PAP and that and yet they may treat the PAP as a safe haven this is the inner conflict of many swing voters especially in the coming election the opposition may well gain from slower economic growth Oh voters may heat the PAP call for other instability at a time of leadership transition I was asked on how bilateral relations which I take more generally as international relations affects Singapore politics well the most important foreign policy decision we have ever taken was to join Malaysia it was also the most serious foreign policy miscalculation we have ever made and in that apparent paradox lies the genesis of independence Singapore's politics speaking in the Singapore Legislative Assembly on 5th March 1957 mr. Lee Kuan Yew said and I quote in the context of the second half of the 20th century of 20th century Southeast Asia island nations are a political joke a political joke now mr. Lee made that statement during a debate on the constitutional talks in government he reflected his conviction and the conviction of his comrades that merger with Malaya was the only practical way forward if Singapore were to completely shake off colonial rule we all know what happened after merger and what made it impossible for us to reign in Malaysia ultimately amounted to a point of political philosophy in the terminology of the day was it to be a Malaysian Malaysia or a Malay Malaysia our first generation leadership perhaps underestimated the vehemence with which the Malay leadership in Malaysia clung to the notion of couture animal are you male dominance consequently they underestimated the extent to which their vision of a Malaysian Malaysia based on values we now call multiracial meritocracy was unacceptable to the Malaysian Malay leadership and the fundamental incompatibility of these concepts is still the basic driving force underlying bilateral relations with Malaysia and in a slightly different way Indonesia to having risked an unexpectedly independent Singapore becoming a political joke over this value we had to make the value work and so we are still here the Singapore story is the of the government and people refused ly refusing to meekly away their faith but instead defiantly exercising the agency that is never entirely absent even in the most daunting of circumstances to ensure that the values for which we risked everything would succeed that imperative shaped our politics and society my key point is that there is always agency there is always something that can be done politics whether of the domestic or foreign variety is about using the agency that is never entirely absent even in the most dire of circumstances to preserve defend and advance the essential values on which our society is based and which is our unique value proposition we cannot be just like everybody else if a small country is just like every other country here is becoming irrelevant a political joke in broad outline the essential problems that we now face are enhanced 21st century iterations of issues that we are faced down before we were able to do so because our first general generation leaders were a rare mixture a rare blend of political skill and technocratic competence that is why Singapore succeeded when so many other countries they gained independence around the same time floundered in the face of similar challenges Singapore prospered politics receded but we are now entering a period and I think it will be a lengthy period when leadership will again require a melding of political skill and technocratic competence and so the lessons of our early political history are more relevant than ever and need to be reinforced eyes [Music] you [Music] what I do in this context is to look at how internet pop culture relates to the idea of everyday politics if we were to look at influencers who primarily serve as your amplification platforms it's great that they're giving us a vocabulary and a sense of urgency to talk about race gender sexuality and the like but we must also remember that some of the most popular YouTube channels or networks in Singapore that are run by Chinese youth you often see that they use minority or fringe identities as a punchline main factories in the same way who have been helping us with a conversation about normalizing the things that we find difficult to talk about you also want to think about the sources the agenda and who is channeling all of this information to us lastly with network threats well they do a very good job in surfacing issues that we would normally let fly under the radar or not care about we also want to be aware of mob mentality what should we make of everyday politics and internet pop culture the first is do not belittle the format as much as it comes across as funny frivolous and humor it is relatable and it reaches audiences that you can never imagine and finally don't underestimate the authority of where these sources come from they may not seem like the most learner most certified people but the networks of their power the information i extremely dispersed and when they consolidate that's where you really see the subversive power of them oh thank you most of my work is geographically specific to two neighborhoods Galen and Dakota Crescent what we really want to do is to build bridges and not walls and also look at how we as citizens can find a good in everybody to love our neighbors the question is always what kind of norms do we want to create as citizens and as people who care how do we get people to also know about these norms and allow these new norms to sit well within our population and it first has to start from ourselves so we need new role models who exemplify the values that we want to see in our society from triage how to MPs of different constituency's who value efforts of those who keep our estates clean whether local or foreigners or to the ordinary Singh parents who open up their hearts by opening up their homes we look to these social issues not just as issues in your own silo but as mirrors which reflect the values of our society so the dream is really to move beyond economic but social and environmental perceptions that we have and also to find non-google obols in our neighborhoods through the conversations that we have had whether amongst our friends in schools our workplaces to see communities as social ecosystems independent interdependent on one another and starting from humanizing the narrative to find strength in diversity and perhaps beyond the labels that we put on one another to talk to one another and let's stop talking about one another thank you to give a brief background about the women that we work with these are the demographics they belong to the bottom 10% socioeconomic class in Singapore our forum 80% of them have secondary school or lower education 40% of them are single mothers 80% are from ethnic minority groups and about a fifth of them are my grandmother's on long term visit paths so they range from having two to nine children and the span of the age that come through our doors range from 20 to the 50s and 60s and well they all fall below the $650 per capita income per month that qualifies them for the home care financial assistance I learned that poverty was actually an issue beyond just finances and that it depletes people in many ways beyond that the first thing I realized as to why women were not coming to programs by various workforce agencies was that they didn't even have enough money to pay for bus fare the other thing was they wanted they could have wanted to come out for workshops but looking at the stats of how many children they have and the fact the half of them are single mothers they really lacked a family support or other kinds of childcare support to allow them to actually attend any kind of skills upgrading or employability kind of programs so we also noticed that among the women that we serve at least 25 percent or 27 percent of them suffer from some form of mental health problems including anxiety depression and uniformly all of them suffered from very low self confidence and self-esteem and I think as a community and as policymakers I hope that you know we can encourage us to think about the low-income community is not just needy or deserving only of financial aid but it truly deserves our financial investment to help them fulfill all their potential and to help them with social mobility well just like to highlight there can be many different conversations as to what good politics is and there can be many different angles in terms of freedom of expression or barriers to entry for me and the climate context here in Singapore good politics means having a healthy ecosystem where all the key stakeholders all the ground groups agencies like NYC Muir and so on can come together and we can talk about things with each other building that trust and partnership which was earlier mentioned this morning I think for me one thing is clear regardless of your political affiliation the climate crisis should be at the top of your agenda and the incumbent should call for a national unity when co-creating policies for the climate crisis mr. Xiang Zi Tong he mentioned this in 1984 after the electoral victory I think this also is appropriate in our current context he mentioned whenever possible we will cooperate with the PAP and find solutions to the problems I want to help KP in its responsibilities of nation-building so here regardless of your political leanings and role in society be in the government or NGO I hope you see that the larger cost here is really to work towards a better Singapore so put aside your differences and work with each other more thank you [Applause] ,False,True,False,False

Lee co-founder and director of keyhole insights he will be speaking on hoping my kids impact on Chinese business sentiments sure you have any questions they'd like to ask the speaker please ask them by the chat group we will try our best to answer them during the Q&A session without further ado I shall now pass the mic over to come how hi good afternoon everybody thank you all for having me Thank You Larry Thank You yen and thank you for giving me this opportunity to share with your esteem alumni and Friends of a sec I think the topic we're going to present today is on the impact of kovat 19 on business implications in in China before we do that I'll quickly introduce a bit of myself my company what we do so we are a market research and consultancy company so on I think the slide is not moving yeah so I'll show skip this very quickly we are focusing on Asia he quoted Singapore companies are lastly Cobra whom champions seeking to international line transform their businesses and the topic we have today is Cove it's 19 impact on Chinese businesses and before I move further I would like to quickly caveat that this particular presentation or this particular survey was conducted between middle around middle much between 10 of March learn much the survey was running and by the time we get all the survey it's only meet much so there have been some changes to the situation and things have evolved and to give you a better idea how this relates to the current situation I also like to show you guys what has happened since then so this is a ft trekker and you can actually find on financial times and this check it every day and this is a updated every day so as you can see the red line represents what has happened in 2020 with coffee and the gray line actually happens in Yan unusual what happens in the Chinese economy in a usual year in 2019 for example so what happens you usually so in January it is indexed 100 and what usually happens is it runs up to Chinese Nuala New Year economic activity tapers off and there's a period where people just go back to the hometown and that's largely the same but what happens is coffee it happened on January 25th the eve of the Lunar New Year and what happens is with debt when economic activity recovers usually after Chinese New Year it stays down this time long so that the gap between what you see of the gray line and the red line actually represents what what happened on the economic impact of coffee on the Chinese economy and as you can see the red line that red dotted line that I say I have here actually represents when the survey was conducted at that point in time I think things was pretty hazy and the survey was conducted under such a scenario so I want everyone to actually have that context in mind when we actually go through the presentation of course first week of the January I'm sorry first week of April what happens is Wuhan actually announced the lifting of the lockdown and things have recovered a significantly since then next I'll go through some of the sub illnesses because the impact of coffee it actually is felt very differently across different sectors so in terms of real estate we can see that again the red line represents the time when the survey was taken so during that period things are actually starting to improve I think Chinese has been very innovative in using technology to sell houses so we can see some improvement following which but still nothing compared to the usual recovery seen in 2019 but what happens is after co feed we see actually in terms of great estate it has - because again and angling to tell evidence from China has shown that after kovat nineteen people actually came up in forced looking for a bigger house because with the lockdown with working from home home based learning I think a lot of people realized that that the smaller house they have is no longer in sufficient to house everyone and conducting economic activity in terms of power plant consumption in fact right now we are seeing on consumption even higher than what we normally see in 2019 as for container trade I think there was a bit of recovery after this survey was taken right up until the one log down was lifted but I think ting situation globally and externally took a turn for the worse and as you can see this particular sector turned downwards very quickly Nick in terms of traffic congestion there was a huge disparity in terms of activity before this survey was taken and after the survey was taken it has since closed again in fact right now you can see traffic congestion is actually back to normal levels and in China actually economic activity even FMB outlets are for people and just something interesting is that in fact Shanghai Disneyland sold out there are tickets within minutes after the tickets were announced online or rather ticket sales was reopened online I saw the first opening day ticket within minutes a pollution it has came down since Cove it 19 what it's bad for human beings is actually pretty good for mother so what happens is we've seen a huge drop but then air pollution actually has came back up above 2019 level at this time of the year and of course box office sales needless to say it's just stayed at zero ever since so some of the industries are much more affected than the other so with this backdrop I like to come back to this survey again so as you can see the demographic of the survey is such we have 1000 people 1000 respondent for this survey we sent out approximately close to 1800 but there's only one thousand respondents this was done across 31 provinces in terms of the breakdown by industry we have 19% manufacturing 17% electronics 14% real-estate very close to the Chinese economy composition or mikta 61% are from manufacturing IP real estate and trade and retail 70% are enterprises so we didn't this group and there are a bit of State on the price for in the price and center the prime 70% of all this our SMEs that has left them in five hundred people and of which 50% of the company's ever an old revenue of less than 50 million RMB and that translates to about 10 million Singh dollar or about 6 to 7 million euro sentiment is most affected in services trade and retail so as you can see the soufflé respondents came back what was on this particular question was expected impact of Kovach 19 on companies 2020 revenue the average is between 20 20 plus percent across the board some industries are worse heat for example services industries close to half of them expect revenue to decrease between 20% and above and for trade and retail 30% expect the revenue to decrease by 20% and more and when we actually tabulate the respondents by my provinces or by a geographic location we noticed that this four provinces are one was heat sink jiong Ningxia kwanghee and who pay and sink young one of the worst heat the oil industries because of the lockdown I think manufacturing was shut off completely and as a result one of the biggest end-user for utilities are actually the manufacturing and industrial complex tourism particularly I was he in India it's the coal industry the chemical industry guanxi automobile chemical annoy and who pay of course where the epic center of the entire Kobe 19 manufacturing literally everything FMB and co-ceo but at the same kind thing this also reflects some of the bigger sector in all this particular provinces so with this 1000 survey from key executive in and all this industries and all these companies we asked this question how long can your company's cash flow sustain and more than half of them says that the current cash flow can only sustain them for another three more months and that was at the peak of the crisis and fortunately within one month provinces in China in Wuhan and in everywhere every part of China started to open up and that's within one month and and thankfully I think a lot of businesses actually don't have to really think about this particular scenario where the situation continues for more than one month back then because situation globally hasn't been as bad in China more than half of businesses with 40% or more of income coming from overseas indicated sufficient cash flow to actually last six months or longer but I think right now in a situation is pretty much reversed NIC's how then would company look at hiding over this cash flow squeeze when we asked this question back in March instead a lot of them actually would look at business loans and thankfully the Chinese government came in with a lot of stimulus with a lot more lending lowering of interest rates a Ferrari cons interest rate hunt which has helped businesses from they suspect the second biggest share of one will be from funds from existing shareholder and finally salary reduction and the next will actually be delaying payments to their suppliers and vendors of about 8% will choose to do that and when we actually break this particular question down by sectors we see that actually in the real estate sector are more inclined and other sectors to decline to delay payment to title low cash flow so if you look at least alike where in general average industries or average companies only about 8% would delay payment real estate industries this particular more option tends to be higher than the other and when we look at manufacturing manufacturing companies are more inclined to taking business loan lightly because of the nature of the business tends to be more long-term tends to be a competitor estate probably not as Kestrel ad and then we look at IT lighty industries more likely than other sectors to me to use headcount or to cut point pay and then next we move on with regards to overseas expansion and results shows that companies that derive 20% of their revenue from overseas Express the greatest interest in further overseas expansion and Southeast Asia is actually the top choice so when we pull this group of 1,000 and to respond key executive in China Southeast Asia actually constitute 38% of the our expansion inclination followed by East Asia and by East Asia I am referring to countries such as Korea Japan followed by Europe United States and middle is when we we actually break them down by sectors it's slightly to finish well-trained and reaching definitely Southeast Asia is a big market with more than close to 1 billion population in Southeast Asia IT and electronics largely Southeast Asia as well when we look at realistic you % Southeast Asia because of the population because of rising affluence because of urbanization as well manufacturing large the Southeast Asia as well so as we can see Southeast Asia is one of the top choice in this particular survey where we can pull across a Chinese key executives so in this particular question it's slightly different this is not about in terms of sales but more in terms of regional headquarters or factories again we seized on this sectors manufacturing IT trade real estate and on some of the top industries that are likely to move the service Asia so companies with 20% to 40% of revenue from overseas missiles Express the most interested in expanding into other markets beyond China this may change somewhat but I would say that for Southeast Asia the situation should likely be pretty much the same the interest will likely be contain simply because I think in terms of this particular episode so is Asia so far has not been affected as badly as countries or regions such as Europe or the states so I think we've done I like to actually point or bring your attention back to how the situation has evolved if you look at this particular chart in Middle East in Asia in Africa the number of deaths actually sort of stabilized in most part of the world it has started to come down but in u.s. it's still one of the highest in particular 1344 in this period between that may 13 to 18 Europe has come down very quickly as well so this is just a quick update using other indicators to see how things are changing I think in London we are seeing a bit of revival compared to say Paris or even New York some of the countries like Beijing as you can see we are seeing a lot more activities the red line again showing this year the gray line showing last year so places like Singapore is about 50 percent Tokyo is 60 percent and Sydney in Cape Town it's also recovered somewhat yeah so with this I'd like to point out a few of my own personal opinion or observation I think what we're seeing now is Southeast Asia Asia would probably be one of the first few countries to start reopening borders already talks are in process with regards to how to facilitate air travels we will definitely see a longer check-in timing but countries are talking about how then we can start air travel for example with measures such as health declaration or people who want to travel may have to start doing a soft hands and to get declared a clean bill of health but I think definitely business travel definitely travelers are first going to happen in this part of the world so some of the things that may happen would definitely be more soft soft rate so trade with in Southeast Asia is probably going to start to recover first follow-on by trade in other parts of the world and with this I'm not sure how much time we have more but I would like to open up the floor I guess I think there are some questions that are coming in already so with that I think yen let's open up the floor first and if there is a need I may show the second presentation I prepare yeah what you again okay we have actually see some questions already from myself as well in your audio presentation you actually show parts of China which were actually severely affected such as I see in a movie but how actually is your opinion about Beijing and Shanghai what do you think for these two cities so I think that's been pretty much a lot of reporters already come out and I think the pictures are so you know people are actually mingling together already and I'm a number of group chats in China and people actually are organizing activity small groups less than 20 people but people are actually meeting up coming together of course taking the necessary safety precautions such as wearing a mask and I think restaurants I believe don't have very tight restrictions such as Hong Kong I think in Hong Kong what you have is every restaurants cannot have more than ten people but in Beijing I don't think there there is such enforcement and literally I think people are meeting and that the streets are busy already but of course there is also a of some bonus people are taking it seriously they are sanitizing their hand more frequently they they keep a certain safety distance but I would say that in China in large parts of China except what kind of provinces such as harping or where they are they have in some spikes recently or some new cases the most part of China actually it's business as usual this question that we have is with yourself iam also be what are you seeing from hospitality to really show in China so I think in terms of hospital hospitality and luxury in fact amazed sort of had like a very big day our big leap upon reopening so I think there are definitely evidence of some revenge buying a lot of Chinese customers I mean they've been home for two months or even more and they are they can't wait to spend some money but at the same time I think there are there are nuances between all this spending so for example I think spending on cosmetics if I'm not wrong they have been reported I believe reports will continue come up such as lipsticks day of sales actually dropping going going dropping like a fly because with co19 we are seeing people wearing more mass people staying at home more frequently and hence the last need for some of this cosmetics so I would say that retail sales luxury so is really also a very sector specific and in terms of hospitality I think a lot of my friends actually are are traveling already and I got mentioned Shanghai Disneyland within the first day of reopening of sales it just gets stepped on and so what happens is I think there will be controls there will be less people and in fact that may be more desirable for some individuals because I mean if you are you've been to China in some holidays in some places it's basically super pipe like sudden where you just are squeezing to get in and with this crop control I think experience is slightly better but definitely traveling is happening but probably not at the normal kind of rate so I have friends and classmates they actually have already started traveling from Shanghai to Hainan doll for example yes this question that we have is how do you see Kovach politics in the United States impacting business and this is sentiment in China okay so that the topic of this presentation is on China so I am less inclined to talk more about us but I think to the extent it could be politics are affecting for sure I think one of the biggest concern is in terms of quality of medical equipments in terms of safety and I think Chinese wants to be recognized across the world as one of the quality producers so I think with a country as big as China and with everybody rushing into the mass trail there were no doubt be some black ships among the crowd and I think the Chinese government more than anyone else more than Americans more than the Europeans wants to make sure that the products they set up are legit and decent qualities so that news like what we've been seeing a few expect will not happen so I think we are seeing Chinese themselves doing a lot of self-censorship doing a lot of checks or deed checks to ensure that the medical equipments of decent quality so what happens is we are seeing also a lot of interesting behavior where people are packing mass sales or mass exports under other category so what happens is for example in the past mass tends to be under certain is icy-cold people are now actually smuggling not smuggling it but declaring it under other categories to make sure that it goes through faster and that it will not be subjected to checks more easily so to that extent I think definitely exports affected but let's face it around the world there can not be a producer that can produce in such volume in such quantity so as the Chinese government starts to clear the quality issue I think slowly this what starts to get better yeah any question may we have is many countries have started that economies with a good revenue in domestic demand such as hospitality and air transportation for an island country like ours with a small domestic market what do you think the businesses can do as a spouse may be limited you to make countries closing up there are customs due to Kovac that's a very tough question that's a very good question I presume by hours person asking the question is referring to Singapore I think for Singapore we are a small open economy unfortunately and the thing is if things situation around the world does not improve there's only a certain extent we can get better so definitely our fortunes are tied to the global economy that's be very honest the Singapore economy breaked up 20% from manufacturing and with manufacturing a lot of export a lot of the end destination goes to China and even to China it's probably intimate it immediate destination that actually goes into me assembly into to China to us as well so a lot of end demand for Singapore goods which is /li in the electronic sector in the pharmaceutical sector is actually in u.s. in Europe so I would say that the only thing that probably we can move more into is into their new economy into e-commerce into digital services but again if the war economy is in total that's very little we can actually outperform yeah and not forgetting the fact that unless part of our economy is also tied to oil because of us being a refinery center a large part of our economy is also tied to exports because important wholesale trade is it's a big chunk of Singapore economy is well yeah ok yes the last question before we edgy moves the second part of your visitation how yeah the question is was kissing area let's say Covina it involves into another virus called Kovach 20 and countries go to another round of lockdown what do you think businesses can do especially for non digital businesses such as construction again I think this is this is difficult question but I would say that what we are seeing here is a modern pandemic I I do believe that in the past there are actually other instances of such pandemic happening case in point I think the flu in the u.s. one or two years ago but I think the whole the whole mindset about this but the particular pandemic is such whereby because of social media it's even more prevalent and a few years ago because of a few other issues because people's impression that this virus comes from China and anything that comes from China would be bad so there is also this particular effect that's at play here then there is also the effect that I think China started something that is really unprecedented which is a lockdown and I would say that if this had happened or the epicenter is not China is in US or in Europe this may not have happened and because this may not have happened other countries and other cities may not necessary follow suit so as much as I would like to say that I mean we should take this seriously but I think there is also at some point where fatigue takes it takes place and country realized that the reserve cannot go on forever to subsidize business to to pay on employment unemployment claims we welcomed into a new normal where businesses will will go about their businesses with a lot more added precaution yeah but I think that the simple answer to this thing is I would say that if this continued for another one or two people will start economic activity in all likelihood start assuming it's just that there will be a lot of measures taking place with your increased missus course there will be a lot of precaution the economic activity or go back to maybe 70% or 60% of the usual level but I think things will have to be open up again yeah that's that's my own thing of the this whole each issue yeah yeah okay so how will moved on to your second popular presentation yeah so the second presentation I'll have to stop the sharing here first formal one and then open up the other one so that the second presentation is very different from the first one but there is a lot of relevance to this and there are things that actually we could connect both dots together to actually derive a certain set of implications as to what will happen as the kovetz set us down or even as this virus this pandemic drags on but maybe to a lesser degree these are some of the things that I think we would likely be seeing so so industry evolution are made up or rather is driven by three main trends industry disruption because of the fear of disruption in this industry constantly upgrade themselves and as industry upgrades themselves and realized that cost may not be inserted favor some industry actually needs to migrate to another country so I will prove I will share the presentation later on so I will not actually go into individual explanation very quickly I want to go through its historical or global industry migration trends we we look at this across the last two century or sorry the last yea one one and a half century so what happens is we look at this from a perspective of migrating industry migrating directions and key migration drivers so I think since the start of the Industrial Revolution the steam revolution of on assembly in the 1890s and nineteen forty states the era of the rise of America we see industry from textiles Gammons steelmaking alloys moving from UK to the u.s. reason being availability of raw materials back in the u.s. back then lower labor costs emerging markets as well as less skilled migration and war later on from the now in 40s to 60s we have world war one war two and because of that war rebuilding and this period there's a lot of textile garments automobiles integrated it's moving from us to countries such as Japan to countries such as Germany and of course this whole country being one of the worst-hit also had a lot of stimulus package a lot of revitalization program such as the Marshall Plan that's happening in the 1960s to 1990s that's the era of the Asian dragons where we see the similar industries moving again from u.s. from Japan to the Asian turbulence we know of them Taiwan economy such as career economies such as China and sorry you know China and Singapore Hong Kong and Singapore sorry and what was driving some of this trends was national industrial policy and that's something that was very very strong in all these four economies Taiwan particularly in electronics in Korea as well we have your LG's coming out from Korea during that period Singapore as well in Hong Kong and finally 1990s there was a period of China's awakening that was the period where a lot of companies from modest industries moved to China and that was following Chi Kok - in the 1970s late 1970s early 1980s entering a world trade organization in 2001 and of course with dead manufacturing share of GDP an advanced economy continues to decline and even until now we see manufacturing share of GDP in advanced country falling from 24% to 19% in 2016 the kind of a 20% decline or a verge of 0.7 percent and some of the countries that are most prevalent will be us and I think that's also one of the reason why Trump managed to get reelected on this particular topic are reshoring on shoring or make America great again and where has all this manufacturing shake on to a lot of which has moved into Asia which is increasing at a 1.1% rate during this entire period 1988 2016 of which China is the main beneficiary and with Dean manufacturing we can also see that a lot of the the shares are moving from the low end the the more laborious more less productively industry to the ones that are more high-tech so you can see back in 1980 in advanced economy 15 percent comes from textile wood products paper and printing and now it actually continued to shrunk to 9 percent whereas for electronics from the high tech industry it has increased from 30 percent to 38 percent and if you look at emerging economies that the situation is even more pronounced because emerging economies for nonmetallic minerals it has increase re not no matter but from high tech industry such as electrical optical I tank mechanical engineering and transport equipment that's increased from 16 percent to 30 a doubling of the share and at the same time as the economy is growing at the same time this this is a huge gain in even or this high-tech industry and for the lower end on its run from 18 percent to 30 plus 13 percent but I think one has to be mindful that in terms of absolutely again it is still positive because the entire GDP of all these emerging economies has actually grown a lot so what the share is reduced from 18 percent to 13 percent the actual absolute value add in this industry has actually grown significantly as well so what happens is in this particular research what we did was we identify we try to identify can feed our most likely to benefit from industry migration so some of this criteria will be market size urban population growth education national savings because higher national saving translate to lower interest rate translating to a high industrialization because of the investments anchor finally political and monetary stability and with this using those matrixes and using a index China we want the economies that are most likely to write the next way regardless I mean they have wrote the last way for for the last 20 to 30 years but still going forward China will still be one of those countries because of simply because of population because of continued organization Vietnam is the other one Indonesia India Thailand as you can see a lot of all these countries are very populous countries and in the last 10 years or so are also countries that have urbanized very quickly with literacy rate with education level rising very quickly next u.s. would still be one of the countries within that identify Mexico Malaysia Philippines and South Africa and as you can see out of these 10 countries 7 of them actually from Asia and [Music] five of them from Southeast Asia so you can see that importance of Southeast Asia in this particular chart and I think with coffee 19 given the fact that Southeast Asia has done a much better job in in stemming this entire pandemic there will also be the first view to reopen and what we will likely be see be seeing is the continuum of shoring of some of China's lower and lower value-added industry to some of this country because from both a production point of view supply sight the fact that these countries are very populous wouldn't mean that wage rate would be lower in this country a lot of artists country also have the natural resources and endowment and finally from a team on site because this country's how the populous populace these countries are they also from dimana anger I like me to be able to supply the demand that a lot of these companies are looking for and not just demand because a lot of demand comes from urban needs right if you are staying in urban household with access to fresh water with access to electricity then which you need a washing machine for example which you need a refrigerator so a lot of discretionary goods actually depends on urbanization depends on basic infrastructure buta so what happens is we will continue to see this team play out in Southeast Asia because this country are urbanizing electric fire electric the cage electrification I'm not sure how to actually pronounce that the term here but then again when you actually look at the different the countries that were actually most likely benefit from this global migration trends by manufacturing by low VA and high va va here means very rare the the makeup actually changes again so what early on you've seen in terms of for mention the ranking China Vietnam Indonesia when you actually look at a follow an economy the ranking changes like China would be one India Vietnam Indonesia and then when you look at high-value a u.s. still is the number one in this case and because of the supply chain that's one of the key reason but also because of policy because of monetary as well as regulatory stability business environment IP protection among others so the least actually changes slightly and what we did is we we try to generalize all this industry into a few different types of models so I wouldn't go into this because I think the time we have is pretty short but I would actually send this out and I think we actually publish all this on our Lincoln Lincoln official accounts we also publish them on our blog as well so continued for us we'll share some of these things so there are different kinds of industries and different kind of models and over here we actually take a look at where some of these industries and the different kind of models will move from so productivity step up is like me is in electronics electrical appliances is in equipment /t and this kind of industry will continue to move from China to countries such as Philippines Thailand Vietnam Indonesia and then you have the low end this our demographic dividend because they are lastly labor intensive they are your your needs and once that people starts to buy when they have a little bit of money and not too much so in a move from China lastly because China is currently or in the last thirty years in in this particular sector they'll move to largely Southeast Asia and more some of the more bigger or more populous country supply chain relocation this depends on raw material and hence they were likely to move from countries where they are raw material so Egypt India Indonesia where there are abundance of a natural endowment allows them to take advantage of some of these sectors paper for example food processing as well and there are national policies push and pull demonic raiding and technology so technology countries that were largely benefit will be as usual china-us euro and the sequence of Industry migration in the next few couple of years with lastly follows such a pattern first three years Southeast Asia will I we take advantage of it more so dinner and this timeline may have been pushed back slightly because of Cove in nineteen next we quickly look at some of the trends that are affecting all this I think earlier on there was a question with regards to how can Singapore take advantage of all this I I guess some of the answers are in here but at the same time I come back to the whole thing is Singapore small open economy if the whole world doesn't do well we won't will never do so another way of mapping to understand some of the industries and some sectors they are most likely to do well and finally the conclusion and this is probably one of the most important part is what exactly does it mean after looking all those stripes is that China's move up the value chain will bring opportunities both for itself and the region Savas Asia would definitely be a main beneficiary because of the proximity to China also because of the wage condition because of the natural endowment because of urbanization because of industrialization and if you actually look at some of the deals some of the foreign direct investment and happened in the last one year and a half because of us-china trade war because of before Co V a lot of industries a lot of investments have moved from China into Vietnam into Indonesia into to a lesser extent Malaysia as well salvie's Asia will be the main beneficiary I think one of the key key thing is industry 4.0 also result in narrows spillovers so labor cost advantage of traditional low cost industry will shrink so what happen means is it increasingly or this really relocation because of more machinery being involved but benefit less people than it has been in the last half a century so in during the Asian dragons period doing rise of China period then it created a lot more employment but I think increasingly the employment spillover would be a little bit lesser maybe 60% to 70% on what it used to be because of machinery but I think in terms of which it'll be a lot bigger because of the productivity and what we will see more is because of Internet of Things and because of all these trends we will see more but smaller manufacturing plants with better global coordination because I mean the plants start to run and a pattern because of 5g because of Internet of Things because because of better ERP system CRM systems and I think Co v19 probably accentuated this trends as well as we can see supply chain disruption is one of the key trend so I think gone are the days where every companies would put all eggs in one basket put everything in China increasingly they would choose China and probably another populous country because for example the way we lower and at the same time it allows them to supply that only to this country we didn't think yeah we will also see more a job production because of tritium containing because our Internet of Things as well so that's all for my presentation I think some of the trends we can see previously are already in place and some have been brought forward by kovat 19 yeah that's all for my presentation and last but not least I will share my contacts so that you guys can take a look after there yeah horn form1 yeah so this is my contact personal link in corporate website and we continue to publish this so the the slice thing you've just seen or publish enough much often we completed a survey so to get more updated slide please join us for us on linking subscribe to our newsletter and with that I like to handle the airtime back to you thank you know how uh due to time constraints and that's going to actually doesn't ask you this one question yeah now I need you to actually look into a crystal ball right now and predict in your opinion what are the lists of industries yeah but the book host Kovac Mike did and what do you think are the industries they are going to be at risk okay I think a lot of people has published something on that so I wouldn't be the one to claim on originality but a lot of all these things are also pretty intuitive what we're gonna see is we're gonna see an increase in digital usage in terms of cloud storage so in fact I've heard a lot of inquiries of companies trying to buy over certain data centers or a lot of inquiries about buying over lens or data center so definitely online zoom technologies that allow people to communicate online e-commerce is definitely gonna boom shocka fine a lot of people are going online onto Shopify week's a lot of people are creating website I think in Singapore and she even hawkers I think for people who have stayed in Singapore yeah it's our version of I don't think you can get anything like that and in Europe it's more like a Sunday market Bazaar but it's every day right and you get a lot of all them a lot of all this Bendis going online to deliver their foot to sound airwaves so definitely you see services such as weeks in fact weeks actually just last month they had two million additional new subscribers so things like this things like health equipment also do pretty well because now that people can go out there probably starts are exercising at home so that the new economy is deafening on a cannon poo industries that will not do well would likely be set to say the traditional industry industry that use a lot of manpower a lot of labor but even then I think what would happen is really we won't go back to normal but this normal would be very different from what we used to see and a lot of industry will start automating a lot more a lot of industry would start to look breaking up their offices into more satellites I think that's something that might happen happened to the real estate industry we will likely see for example instead of one big HQ in Singapore CBD say TBS maybe having one level in would learns one level in one off one level in two wrong I think that's something that's increasing gonna be a trend a lot of companies and even then the total floor space would also swing drastically as we can see I mean first Facebook just destroyed a lot of employers to firmly work from home even so I think a lot of companies are realizing do we even need to have physical work space nonetheless I think we still need some level physical box paper the amount of days people needs to go to office for definitely just be reduce and we've such I think a lot of things are playing out at this point in time yeah that's all I can say I my guess is as good as everyone's well with that this concludes the end of our webinar I'd like to thank all for taking the time out to speak on this topic thank you and thank you very much to all participants as well and please stay safe have a baby here thank you thank you thank you ",True,False,False,False

From bottles of hand sterilizer to alcoholic wet wipes, products that claim to kill viruses are flying off the shelves. With the water crisis also showing no sign of abating, such products are being used in place of water for more and more cleaning purposes.

Bottle after bottle of disinfectant is filled up and screwed tight. This production line has been here in New Taipei for over 20 years.

Lee Wen-ko
FTV reporter
The production line workers are working flat out, and we’ve also got a new nightshift to help us adapt, because since the pandemic began, orders have grown tenfold.

The bottles are full of 75% ethanol hand disinfectant. Workers box the bottles swiftly, ready for shipping to retailers all across Taiwan. The producer has more orders than it can handle, and retailers are deluged with inquiries. Some online retailers have sold out completely.

Huang Mei-ko
Disinfectant producer
When the pandemic is less severe, sales slow down a bit. When new cases pop up, then consumers start to have a sense of the crisis, and because in the past there were shortages, so people fear that and buy more.

The pandemic once more feels tangible within Taiwan’s borders. That makes health items like custom masks a popular wedding favor.

Disinfectant producer
Now people decide to print some cute profiles of themselves and nice colors on their wedding gifts.

Some couples have chosen to give their guests Taiwan Sugar alcoholic wet wipes as gifts.

In Taichung, Miaoli, and North Changhua, the drought has meant a strict five days on two days off water rationing system. In the last month, the alcoholic disinfectant products sold by Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Liquor and Tobacco have seen sales jump 10% to 20%.

The Industrial Technology Research Institute says demand for pandemic-related innovations shows no sign of tailing off. Medical industries have seen the fastest growth this year, with the sector worth an estimated NT$130 billion.
