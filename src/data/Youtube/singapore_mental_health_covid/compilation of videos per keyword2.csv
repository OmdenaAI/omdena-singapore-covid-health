QShkVkVOlzs,Living with anxiety during Covid-19,UC4p_I9eiRewn2KoU-nawrDg,The Straits Times,2020-10-10T15:48:14Z,Four Singaporeans share how Covid-19 had an impact on their mental health and how they are coping with the uncertainties that come with the pandemic.,i graduated just thrusted into like the working world as quick as possible and you just keep fixating on something that you can't solve not knowing how secure your job is at this point in time is very scary waking up on days just feeling like there are too many problems to tackle and that was not something that i had ever felt before in my life [Music] even with all the stipends that's been being given by the government you're being told by your parents that it's not enough and that like eventually your savings might run out everywhere else is telling you that like oh yeah stay calm like it's a pandemic you shouldn't be too hard on yourself but the reality is is that there's that pressure that you need to get a job as quick as possible like get back that stability that has been taken away from you sort of start feeling like you're caged and trapped and the feeling can often be that there are very little options for you to take and very little control that you have over your own life there were a couple of days where i had a few breakdowns and that's when i realized hey maybe this is something that needs to be addressed and i actually went and reached out to a counselor i would not be able to like do my work properly like i would get tired whilst doing my work halfway so i think that's when i decided okay i need to get help so when you talk about mental disorder we're talking about the scenario where the individual is having difficulties functioning he or she will need some professional help to get back on track so without that help right he cannot snap out of it by himself of course then there will be those who are not to the point of a disorder so what that signifies is that the brain has not gone into a fixed state in those circumstances sometimes they may be able to self-help in order to get their anxiety better [Music] i think once i was able to spot these things happening i knew what i had to do i knew what steps i had to take it's definitely not easy even it's the second time around but just slowly getting out of bed brushing your teeth making yourself a nice meal like that's the small things you do to really get through the day you just feel worried all the time like it's constantly at the back of your head thankfully for me i have close friends and families who i can just go to them and tell them what i'm feeling or what i'm going through i usually just take it in take a deep breath and just try to put things into perspective certain things are just beyond our control and what we can do is to just move forward [Music] i think the more i'm open about it the more i can try to normalize these kind of conversations and i'd rather that people feel safe approaching me because i would love to help them i try to talk about it as much as i can because it's perfectly normal for you to go to visit and i want people to know that they're not alone in this [Music] of course the older generation they would tell their younger folks to just you know snap above it and many times the younger folks do feel quite frustrated with that approach best way to go forward really is to have a very open conversation to try to educate their parents or their seniors in the family mental health is really a lot like physical health one is being able to be comfortable opening up to someone but the second is also recognize that hey i need help [Music] [Music] you ,True,True,True,True

xzNMABRELPg,Mental Health Care in a Pandemic: Dealing with Anxiety and More,UCPEAYzwc7QJg4DL5x6U3AEQ,Babylon Health,2020-04-09T17:48:03Z,"Coronavirus can stir up all sorts of feelings, like fear, anxiety or stress. A little stress can be helpful. It can be the motivator that keeps us self-isolating or washing ...","Coronavirus can stir up all sorts of feelings. Like fear, anxiety or stress. A little stress can be helpful. It can be the motivator that keeps us self-isolating or washing our hands. But constant or high levels of stress can negatively affect our mental and physical health. Taking care of our minds is always important, but doing so in the middle of a pandemic can be really tricky. Here are some tips and techniques to help us all get through this. Start your day well It can be tempting to reach for your phone or switch on the news first thing in the morning but starting the day with a simple mindfulness exercise, such as ‘Notice 3 things’, can help you check in with how you’re feeling and connect with your environment. Mindfulness is well known to make people feel calmer and cope better with stress. This quick exercise takes less than a minute. Before you get out of bed: pause and concentrate on 3 things you can see. For example, your patterned curtains, the blue sky or even just a lightbulb. Then listen for 3 things you can hear. The sound of cars passing by, a singing bird or the hum of your boiler. And finally, notice 3 things you can feel in contact with your body. Your PJs, bedsheets or even your cat. Get planning Although it’s tempting to stay curled up in bed - adapting and creating positive new routines can be helpful and keep you motivated. For example, in the place of what was your morning commute or a school-run: listen to a podcast or go for a walk Incorporating some form of exercise outdoors if possible, into every day is good for mental and physical wellbeing. And set aside time to speak to friends, family or work colleagues every day. Connecting with others releases feel-good hormones that help to relieve stress. Stay informed, not overloaded Although we are able to cope with some stress here and there, being constantly exposed to a rolling fear-inducing news-feed can impact your mental health Hearing upsetting or anxiety-provoking news triggers a stress-response in our bodies. Keeping informed is important, but managing your social media and information intake will make a big difference to how you feel. Try to limit the time you spend listening to, watching or reading things about the outbreak Turn to one or two reliable sources for news and check them just once or twice a day to stay informed. If feelings of anxiety spring up in your day, try a breathing technique, such as box breathing. Concentrating on and controlling your breathing is a scientifically-backed way of making you feel calm. Box breathing is quick, easy and can be done anywhere. Breathe in deeply, through your nose, for a count of 4 Hold your breath for 4 Breathe out completely, through your mouth, for a count of 4 And hold your empty breath for 4 Then repeat 4 times Getting ready for bed Good quality sleep makes a big difference to how you feel. But feeling worried or anxious can make getting to sleep difficult. You could set a coronavirus news curfew, so you don’t watch or read anything to do with the outbreak after 7pm and aim for a regular bedtime. You might also find it helpful to: avoid caffeine before bed, Not eat or drink too much late in the evening Have a warm bath and keep screens out of your bedroom. If getting to sleep is proving tricky, you can try ‘the body scan’. This simple exercise helps you to relax both your mind and body, and with practice - you might find that it even sends you off to sleep. Whilst you’re lying in bed or resting, take your attention to your feet. Relax and soften them into the bed as much as possible. Then scan up your body, moving to your ankles. Release any tension and soften them into the bed. Once they feel relaxed, move up further to your calves, then knees, thighs and so on. Keep moving slowly up your body, all the way to your  head, softening and relaxing every muscle along the way. We hope these simple daily steps will help. Take care. ",True,False,True,False
8-XZrbyok3k,Off The Record: Caring For Your Mental Health During COVID-19,UCLgt3zL2EKHX6xaZ0XmT1XQ,MustShareNews,2021-06-28T04:26:19Z,"In this episode of 'Off the Record', we spoke with Dr Geraldine Tan, the principal psychologist at The Therapy Room, and Adrian Pang, actor and artistic director ...",testing one two three testing one two three testing one two three testing one two [Music] hello everyone and thank you very much for coming back uh if you're tuning in earlier we apologize for all the technical difficulties but we are back and better than ever okay hi everyone i'm falzi and you are watching off the record now of the record is our weekly live show which hasn't been happening every saturday for at 8 00 pm for the last four saturdays where we invite guests to answer your questions about covet 19 and any other related concerns you might have now before we go any further do us a favor and give us a like if you enjoyed this video and remember to share the link to our show with everyone you know now last week i spoke to minister for finance and co-chair of the multi-ministry task force mr lawrence wong about singapore's efforts against covet 19. as always if you missed that or any of the previous episodes feel free to check out the recordings after this stream now today we have two very special guests over to talk about another important topic and that is caring for your mental health during covit 19. and up first we have principal psychologist at the therapy room dr geraldine tan hello fauzi hello hello thank you very much for being here with us now for everyone tuning in we want this to be an interactive session so if you have any questions for dr tan please leave them in the comments and we will have we will compile them to be asked throughout the entire stream all right but to get us started this evening dr tan why don't you tell us a little bit more about yourself and what you do uh yeah i get asked all the time until i don't know where to start so i deal with um the whole spectrum of psychology so from the little ones right up to the adults and then for the little ones they are learning disorders behavioral issues and the adults all the clinical issues also including the learning disorders yeah so the the work that we do it has exponentially increased during this period of time yes and um yep so so counseling would be a major part of what i do uh and yeah sometimes i feel like i grow roots in my chair because i'm seated in my chair all the time and it's not like we talk all the time right the clients talk all the time yeah so this time round is opposite yeah you're talking oh i'm talking yes okay yeah okay but perfect i mean you're the perfect person to answer some of the questions that we have right here so dr tan are you ready let's go okay perfect the first question is how would you define mental wellness and what does being mentally well mean so mental wellness so we look at mental health mental health covers basically three components the social component you know the social health okay the mental health okay which is what we call the psychological health but mental capacity mental health mental functioning and the emotional health so this basic three different components and whether it's well or not is whether we can actually think feel and do and if any parts is not feeling too good fair enough okay um you you mentioned about um having a lot more work during this pandemic right maybe specifically in relation to the pandemic how does it affect mental health uh and what are some of the trends that you have observed yeah so one big big thing is just now it's always talking about the emotional well-being right and emotional health so the emotional health has been really kind of affected by covet because covet hit us and it was a crisis so our whole being was just you know shocked into like uh an imbalance yeah so the emotions are being um affected and one of the big thing that is occurring now is a lot of people come to us with anxiety okay high tension you know they're worried all the time yeah uh and it's not uh only um for covet itself it's not only because of the pandemic but it is a result of so it's a consequence of so it could be family issues it could be work issues it could be just even themselves because a lot of reflection and self-reflection is going on these days so their emotions are affected their mental capacity is being affected if you're so worried they cannot function right yeah and then uh needless to say in this climate social health is definitely being affected yeah okay okay um there's a thing called covet 19 fatigue yeah yeah i've heard of it um what exactly does it mean it's the pandemic fatigue so covet 19 is just the disorder itself but it's a pandemic fatigue and it is very prolonged so earlier i said crisis hit us we expected it to blow over like any crisis and then we came into this year and then we're like oh you mean it's not ending why is it not ending and it that the dragginess of it just drags our mood down we're so exhausted from it that's why it's fatigue right and we don't know where we are going with this there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel plus the fact every time our hopes are raised it gets crushed yeah i mean the very classic one would be like the hong kong singapore air travel bubble twice over it got crushed by no fault of anyone you know but that's where a lot of people go yes yes yes and even for those that did not buy the tickets right they are looking and hoping that it goes through so it gives a little bit more liberation like ah okay yes i think you know it's gonna be all better now but it's not well hopefully with more people getting vaccinated uh there is still a little bit of light coming at the end of the tunnel so that's really good um uh no this question is about young people i think specifically people are watching this i think they're curious are young people actually more susceptible to mental health issues i think the conversation about mental health has definitely picked up uh with social media during the pandemic do you think young people are a little bit more susceptible to this so young people can you define the age of me i mean maybe maybe youth and teens maybe teens yeah and you so up to 35 so maybe yeah until 30. maybe my age my age okay so i would say that each age group have their own challenges okay so the youth are going through a lot of different changes a lot of different transitions so they will feel a lot of challenge during this period of time right because they go through a lot of live events so life events we know so in in psychology every life event brings a lot of stress okay yeah and the stress stays with us until it blows over so for these uh youths teens they're going through a lot of changes so for those that are uh so take our secondary school population right so insect twos they have uh they they are going through that that um choosing their subjects their combi and everything and covet hit so now everything is a bit disrupted because they're learning styles and everything and the the mode of learning is different and then those that have had to take all levels a level suddenly you know the world already stressful the world would turn upside down you know um by the entire i i don't know this entire system right that had to change with the pandemic you know and then the choice that they have to make uh which uh secondary school with jc rich paulie now suddenly everything gets disrupted i never realized that and how important these milestones are in our lives right really for me i've taken it for granted how much that you know these but are big parts of our lives and we just lived through them but the kids now have to go through them during a pandemic okay that's actually a very interesting thought uh now i think with that how can youth take care of their mental health during these trying times i think the big thing is please disconnect from your devices and i'm looking straight at the camera now tell them tell them but please follow this show because it's good good uh yes in it um but i realized so many of them and i'll clarify um they would have two to three screens on when they are doing oh i'm guilty i'm very guilty of that just this afternoon my little boy was he's not so little he's a teen he's supposed to do his work he has one screen on to do his work and then i heard him talking so i went in to check he had another screen on and it had this cord on it ah and i was like who are you talking to you know and i was trying listen and on the other side there was no sound it was just a lot of like random noises home noises and then he had his uh phone by his side and i was like oh my gosh how many devices do you have and a lot of teens a lot of youths are very comfortable big on their devices right and they don't go out so they are very already we are so socially distant right we're forced to be with all the mars and stand one meter apart don't talk in the lifts don't talk in the trains and then suddenly you just start at home and you're not connecting you know face to face with another person yeah and we don't realize how important it is yeah so for the youth that's the first thing that i would say although a bit naggy but yeah i must i must take that advice i must take that advice okay we do uh have a bit of a viewer question here um from kezia tan uh it's a little bit out of the topic of school okay maybe this one is about for for those people a little bit older all right the question is what are some things organizations can do to help with mental health in a workplace setting maybe yeah i mean nowadays a lot of people are working from home for example maybe in that situation um also possibly in the future especially when we get out of this pandemic is that other things that the companies and organizations can do to promote a mental well mental well-being yeah so i uh because with the change from work from office to work from home there is a huge shift and there are a lot of other dynamics so it's not that work place has no work dynamics but the home environment have a different set of dynamics so i always encourage the employee employers to find out the home environment oh yeah because sometimes they have um children running at home young children running at home so it might be very difficult for them to turn on the mic because the kids are you know screaming behind or they're practicing the piano as i was having one session and i could hear your kid is playing piano behind you yeah yeah practicing but they try to put the dampener ready yeah so please you know find out a little bit more before faulting them for not turning on the the video or not turning on the mics you know okay um and because at in the workplace we can cite the person the person can sight to you quite easily you know at home you cannot cite anyone so a text would be great you know weekly meetings if if it's too much at least monthly meetings right right okay about what about like maybe in the future once we get out this pandemic and people start coming to the office mental health is such an important topic that people are talking about and it's definitely something that we will carry on talking about in the future is this any advice for that so the the whole um checking in on the emotional well-being part because when you can see the person you can look at the person and say you don't look so good today yeah but when someone is at home and very far away then you need to rely on uh attacks or them communicating to them that they can you know approach you at any time if they have an issue okay that's yeah that's good advice all right uh we've got the next question here where can you for going back to youth again where can you seek help for distress and mental health conditions okay i think this is a good important question i think most of the time people seem to you know know that something exists but they don't know exactly where so they have we have a few hotlines that are already set up you know the national healthcare uh hotline numbers um and you can easily go on their websites to uh website to check it beyond the label i think have also set up something for them uh chat at escape okay yeah so right on the top floor if i'm not wrong they have free services for the youths yeah so they can just pop in there no judgment no questions ask singapore psychological society also have one side community and a few of us are on board with reduced fees or pro bono so you get a whole lot of registered psychologists who are providing reduced fees or pro bono so the youth can always check out nice nice i do have a little note here uh that actually there is um bell uh beyond the label help bot that is actually an avenue for any youths if you're looking to seek for help that that that help can actually help you out in that sense all right we have a next question here okay ooh interesting what are some common mental health struggles that singaporeans face nowadays um so we have the you know really big bulk of uh depression and anxiety yeah okay so um i think you know even without the pandemic depression was quite a major issue with many of our youths yeah uh high stress level they have self-injurious behavior they feel very confident they have a lot of existential questions okay you don't know which direction even those that are beyond the teens you know working they are questioning why which direction am i going towards why am i working what's the purpose of my work yeah so it's been quite tough especially during this period of time where they really cannot see why are they working so hard for right right that actually does make sense okay uh are there any tips in terms of ways we can help manage these struggles so i came up with calm okay so c stands for compassion compassion for the self okay yeah so that needs to be the first thing that we remember but it's very very difficult so i go on to the next one which is a acknowledge acknowledge that you do have an issue acknowledge the discomfort in your body acknowledge like you are whatever emotions that you have and then we learn how to deal with them you know we learn from the past to deal with you know the future yeah so no we learn from the past so that we know what to do now so that we enhance the future right and the last one is m and i was using it as embrace so it doesn't start with m closing it sounds like yeah so embrace help a lot of people forget to embrace the resources that are around them so we just listed a whole lot of uh you know helplines and resources that are available but people forget that they can embrace you know and don't feel shy because it is there for a reason you know if you feel like oh i feel very pricey i feel very embarrassed or i'm gonna feel judged that i go and take you know a session with someone then you're not you're doing a disservice to yourself there you go all right now we have question here um good one should i tell anyone that i'm struggling with my mental health you not only should tell you should download to the whoever i hear this all the time download yeah yeah i i use that because with all the technology here right but we forget to do it right yeah but i hear that all the time that the the use the um no matter how old they are they say but i don't want to put my button on to someone else they are going through you know a lot themselves okay if you don't want to do that please go and seek some professional help then because we are definitely not burdened by you yeah okay yeah i think one final question is uh how can we fight stigma towards persons with mental health conditions i think it's a very important question it is it is and already by us talking about this so openly right it's a huge step forward and i think we were discussing earlier you know during our little chit chat that the schools are talking about it more openly also so the the children learn from a very young age that is okay to talk about you know feeling mentally well or being mentally healthy so that's important right right okay yeah i mean things like i mean stigma only not only comes from just from other people but also from the self as well right all right yep fantastic uh i think one we are wrapping it up for dr tan uh any final words yes before you go i prepared a little coat my favorite you know author maya angelou okay so she says we delight in the beauty of butterfly of the butterfly but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty wow yeah so isn't it nice it is very nice it is very nice that's your final words yes beautiful i love that ending on a poetic note uh thank you very much dr tan thank you thank you for coming by now before we move on to chat with our second guest i want to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are tuning in tonight as well as those of you who have tuned in religiously every week we really really appreciate all of your support now thank you and

more people can catch it okay the next guest is going to be an exciting one all right today we've been talking about a topic that many people have started discussing recently and that is about caring for your mental health during this pandemic all right to get his take on this topic we have someone i'm sure many of you will be very familiar with but before i go to that i want you all to start thinking of questions all right because we want you to start leaving questions uh in the comments for our lovely producers behind the scenes to start compiling them and for me to ask this lovely person who's sitting right there i'm very excited already okay because we have none other than adrian pong actor and artistic director at pandemonium hi adrian hello i had to stall a little bit for time there because they were setting you up uh yes as i said earlier on if you have any questions for adrian please feel free to leave them in the comments below and to get started i have a couple of questions maybe tell us a little bit more about what you do and how it is related to today's topic about mental health sure um i have been an actor for um exactly 32 years um ten years ago uh my wife tracy and i set up pandemonium theater company um so we've been producing feta for the last um 10 years since since 2010 and and um last year was supposed to be a big year for for us because we're going to be celebrating our 10th year as as as pangdemonium but then um something something funny happened to the world uh which kind of put a damper on uh on our plans right uh and it's still putting a damper on our plans because um um theater has basically come to a standstill over the last year and a half uh we're trying in small small steps to restart again everybody's trying to get their lives back on track um baby steps exactly exactly that uh you did mention a little bit about how the pandemic has affected your work uh i think i'm interested in how it has changed in how you work oh my god um i mean the very the very definition i suppose um traditionally of of theater is a group of people congregating in a shared space to experience uh storytelling absolutely live and to have um a piece of drama unfold before their eyes performed by live actors but the pandemic has rendered that completely um untenable and so like so many other sectors and so many um um other occupations we've all had to i hate this word pivot and and digitize good um and to digitize theater it's it's an oxymoron but but we've all had to embrace it you know and even uh dr tan was saying earlier on um seeing clients um had to be um online for a little while yes before before i um continue every single thing that dr tan said resonated with me right personally uh and and uh i identified with everything that she said i mean it's it's so true we we are as a as the human race going through some weird existential crisis here with with this pandemic where we are not allowed to [Music] co-exist in the way that we've become become accustomed to i mean the very fact that we're even sitting in a room together now is is is a is a strange thing we you know um we haven't been allowed to do that for the longest time so so it's it's it's been a real it's been really screwing with all our minds it certainly screwed with mine for the last year and a half i mean we could all really i can relate to that as well uh yeah you did talk about you know how you know things have to be think things have been digitized all right um do you think it's possible that online platforms can truly replace face-to-face interactions i mean i don't believe it's it's possible but no i i've been you know for ages i resisted it yeah and i was fighting against it the whole idea of putting theater online was was something that i found ridiculous and i just you know i just fought against it for for the longest time right but and and once again as dr tan was saying we just we just we thought you know this this you know in a few months this will be over we'll get back on track again no it just went on and on month after month of the month there was no end in sight and even now there doesn't seem to be any kind of real real end of sight because little things start getting in the way you know every week we we we are surprised by a new something by a new variant and so for the longest time i i resisted you know putting any of our our theater online but right but it got to a point where where we went oh my god looks like this is the new norm i mean if if if we don't just kind of try to get on board and and and embrace it in some way maybe we're gonna left behind so so in the end we [Music] slightly grudgingly you know experimented with it you know we did a couple of um productions online i wouldn't say it was the most fulfilling thing in the world for me certainly i mean there were people who were kind enough to tune in and some people were very very supportive of it some people went you know hey this is this is all not working for me you know give us the live thing which which i was like yeah i i want to get back on stage but we can't you know um so i think we've all just had to have no choice but to adapt and try to make the best of it you know um and and then just hope for the best fantastic all right now tell us a little bit maybe you can tell us a little bit more about what pandemium does i think specifically in relation to uh work in addressing mental health conditions right yeah um i think our mission has always been to tell stories that make people think make people feel make people feel uncomfortable make people want to debate and argue and even fight over make people challenge themselves and question themselves about their own beliefs and their own assumptions about their own lives and about the world and about each other [Music] and one major part of those challenging questions have arisen out of productions that we've we've staged that address um mental health issues and we have um staged several productions that um grapple with this very thorny issue of mental health how we started out with um production 2013 which was a musical called uh next to normal which was about a woman who's been struggling with bipolar disorder all her life right um and then later on the year we did another production called gruesome playground injuries which um looked at youth depression self-harming we also did a play last year the first show of our 2020 season um was a play by florenzella called the sun which was about a teenager who was experiencing severe depression and um i played the teen's father who could not understand what his teen son was going through and that was the final show that pandemonium was able to do before before lockdown kicked in uh and then theater just you know ground to a halt um and at the end of every performance of that play i would address the audience and say to them if anyone out there is experiencing any kind of mental health issue don't keep it to yourself right seek help two months later i found myself in that position where kovitt just um rendered me bedridden oh i found myself in a dark dark place and um literally couldn't get out of bed okay um and uh i found myself in the the kind of deepest depression that i've ever experienced um and so you know i'm very comfortable talking about this now um but when i was going through it i was in denial for a long long time okay you know and and it really took my family supporting me and rallying around me and saying listen you have to practice what you preach right you've been telling people to seek help you have to recognize that you need help now and and um what dr tom was saying calm being compassionate to yourself um and um embracing the fact that you need help embracing the fact that there is help uh is so so important um and so i finally got off my ass and went and and and sought help and since then i've been seeing a therapist right regularly online at first but then finally we were able to sit in the same room and sit there and tell her my stories and cry and shout and scream and and all that kind of stuff uh i am on um anti-depressive medication yeah which i've been taking very fully and it's it's it's um thankfully it's it's worked for me it's working for me it's still a daily struggle yeah um it's not a you know one-size-fits-all quick fix for everyone um but you know the the whole thing of self-care i never i never understood that that concept before and it's taken kovid to make me realize how damn important it is right for everybody to just take a moment at the start of every day just to look after yourself and make sure you're ready to face the world even especially in fact how strange the world is right now to make yourself ready to face this strange world but yeah that's so in a nutshell that's been my year yeah thank you for sharing i didn't expect that i was like a little taken off guard um maybe oh we have a little oh some a comment right from ivan lim uh falling was so good thanks for allowing to be shown free last year from ivan lim thank you evan thanks thanks for watching a comment for you um i think a lot of people can relate to where you've been uh is there any specific steps that you've taken for yourself that could possibly you know help someone out there to incorporate into their own daily life so you talk about like seeking help what are some things that you do on a day-to-day basis basis to you know help you feel better sure yeah um i got into and i like i said i've never subscribed to this whole kind of you know yeah to me it was just kind of mumbo jumbo but but but but i i was persuaded to start each day with just a little bit of quiet time right now once again uh dr tan oh god you know everything she said like i said resonated with the whole thing about being so so such slaves to our our digital devices the first thing that i usually do when i open my eyes in bed is to reach for my phone and check my messages and check my emails and that's just you know i just became a prisoner to this to this thing um so i had to get into this habit of waking up and just ignoring my phone until i had some time to myself and i just literally just kind of sit in my bed um comfortably and and just just try and shut out all the white noise that that i my mind kicked off the day with and just focus on my breathing i could never understand how to kind of empty my head i don't know what that means because there's always some crap going on right right um but but just even if it's just to focus on my breathing literally being very conscious of your inhale your your inhaling and your exhaling and just to just to be just to be conscious and then i got into this um self-generated um routine of of um kind of physically uh in a tactile way kind of cyanine okay myself my sigh on my head sliding my face eyeing my heart sowing my stomach and all the rest of it uh it's almost just just kind of trying to give myself these kind of positive tactile tangible strokes just to just to start the day um with some self-love right it sounds terrible but sounds wrong but um but by just loving loving myself in the in the best possible way right um before i before i really start the day you know um and i i to be honest i i was a little bit skeptical about that to be to begin with but i found that you know once i got into that routine i started the day in a much better mood um and um that like i said you know it was just a con constant thing of of just being self-aware and being very open about talking about how i was feeling um and being very disciplined you know um self-love is is is is i think there's um this is something yeah there's definitely something to it i'm only discovering that like now because of course thank you kovid i love that i think we will talk to dr tan later and see if there's any signs behind this whole idea of saying ourselves right we'll speak to her later on uh we've got a couple of your questions here uh one from doreen fan uh what was your outlet for your mental health during this period of time was it something that you know you channel uh into your work or something well that's the that's the thing because i mean like i said i've been doing this for 30 years and i think from my early days as as a freelance actor i i had somehow conditioned myself to to define myself by the work that i was doing ah so say okay so i'm an actor um so if i'm not acting if i'm in between jobs i'm not acting then i'm not an actor then oh my god who the hell am i right so it was a terrible thing to get into into my get my mind conditioned into thinking but at the time it was almost like a self challenge just to keep on working just to work as much as i could right um and that mindset has haunted me for the last 30 years even even now at my ripe old age when i'm in between productions i i feel that anxiety i feel that almost that i'm nothing i'm nothing if i'm not working right i am nothing if i'm not playing a role and so covid was the worst news for me because it made me not able to inhabit what was my security of of of pretending to be somebody else so so so for the last year and a half um i've been just clinging on to whatever life raft floated my way um but thank god thank god thank god um for my family because they've always been there and they've always been um supportive and we've always been the kind of family that kind of over shares with one another there is nothing that we cannot talk to each other about and and i'm very very very grateful for that um but i also realize that not every family is that way not everyone is in a household where they feel free enough to share what they're feeling and covet has been bad news for a lot of people like that because being stuck at home especially doing um circuit breaker um if you're within a not very happy family dynamic right that has i know and my therapist kind of shared this with me as well she she said that a lot of people are extra stressed out extra depressed because they're forced to face their family all the time and and i suppose going back to the question of the outlet is to find someone to talk to it's so so so important to reach out to someone you trust it might not be your family member but but please find someone that you can you can vent what you're feeling uh and share what you're feeling with um it could save your life it could save your life very very good advice actually uh and you answered a question that we have from is me raudatul who does lyman who did ask how do you communicate your personal struggles with mental health issues to your loved ones so find someone you trust and start talking about them but i mean it's it's not easy especially in in an asian context where where you know we suppose we just don't see we don't we don't tend to share our our deepest darkest secrets you know with uh with with with your loved ones um um and as a father i can kind of understand where that comes from as an asian as an asian dog you know if your child comes to you and says oh you know i've i've got a pain in my leg you know as a father oh i'll go and take you to see the doctor the the leg doctor will solve your leg problem you know but if your child comes and tell you you know i'm feeling very depressed yeah oh um oh that's a bit awkward um just come go and get some exercise or you know just just look on the bright side of things you know kind of thing i mean which is nothing obviously not i'm not uh prescribing that but i think there's a lot of of of um families that just don't know how to deal with um an emotional issue or a mental issue uh especially when when it's such still such a stigma in so many societies um but it must be must you must find someone to talk to you just have to yeah uh i think the next one will wrap it up a little bit nicely with how can we normalize conversations about mental health i mean thankfully i've been noticing that people are much more willing to have conversations like like this like what we're doing right now about mental health um um certainly when i was growing up and and going through my own teen nonsense uh and looking back now that teen nonsense was most depressing you know i was i was going through it even even then you know 40 over years ago but i couldn't talk to anybody about it uh not my family you know i was kind of awkward talking about it to my friends um [Music] but now i notice young people much more willing to to to share and talk about it um and not be afraid to talk about it yeah um it's i think trying to persuade the older generations that it's it's a matter of life and death for a lot of cases because the number of instances of young people not being able to cope um with their anxiety or depression and feeling just completely alone and resorting to the worst ways of ending it yeah i mean one life lost through through a mental health issue is one life too many uh and and it's just it's just heartbreaking to know that that still that still happens um so it's it's trying to persuade more and more people that mental illness is an illness and just like any illness you need to seek help to treat that illness that's actually yeah a really good piece again another good piece of advice uh final question i'm sorry that was like one more question and that is how do we fight the stigma uh towards people with mental health conditions i think this is one of the biggest problems that we still face as a society and we need to figure out ways on how to fight this any thoughts about that i mean this whole this whole thing about building a more compassionate society it's so easy to say yes you know um but it really just comes down to i think every single individual realizing that we all have to kind of rely on one another [Music] and especially in times of crisis like what we're going through um you can either manifest the worst sides of yourself by being very protectionist and very selfish and only looking after yourself hoping to hoping to survive this crisis or you can just open up your hearts i know it sounds very kumbaya but but but realize that you need people and if you look after yourself and try to look after your neighbor your neighbor will hopefully in turn look after you as well right you know um and you know if we learn if we don't learn this this lesson of mutual reliance yeah during this time of kovit then we would have we would have gone through this time for nothing and you know i i personally want to have learned something tangible and positive out of this this nightmare we're going through absolutely okay yeah i have a little note here yet again if you guys are tuning in uh beyond the label movement uh amongst other efforts is something to help you know generate and encourage conversation about mental health in the public space and that hopefully helps to address the stigma in our society and again there's other things other than stigma from outside there's also stigma from yourself so do overcome that by you know talking to someone about his or her mental health challenges and if you need to help seek help please do so as well um we have one final final final final question from a viewer christian lim he says is the mental health wellness something that you see yourself continuing beyond this pandemic um i think partly because i i myself know what it feels like to struggle with a mental health issue i i i'm going to be making as much noise about it as as as i can uh in fact that's nicely segwaying into me making a little plug for pandemonium's um upcoming production uh it's it's a play called the mother oh that was uh written by florian zeller who also wrote and directed uh the film the father that's recently been yes he's very lazy with his titles the father which we produced on on stage three years ago and then the sun which was our last right right and then uh the mother uh which uh pandorium is staging in august tickets on sale next week um and it's about um mother who is um struggling with some severe mental health issues and how her family is struggling to deal with um her her meltdown right um awesome awesome brilliant play janusco is going to knock it out of the park please come and see it there you go all right uh i think with that that is it we have come to the end of this episode of the record guys uh thank you very much to our guest dr geraldine tan and adrian punk for being on the show with us and of course thank you guys very much for tuning in we hope we managed to answer some of your questions and until next time bye guys bye [Music] [Music] you ,True,False,True,False

Although children may be ...",many of us reminisce back to our lives before the covet 19 pandemic and hope for things to get back to the way that they were while we simultaneously try to adapt to this new normal the pandemic has affected our lives in numerous ways but it is imperative that we focus on our mental health many people have reported about the fear and uncertainty about their own health the health of their loved ones their financial situation and job outcomes as well as tackling social isolation through following public health protocols mental health is inclusive to all age groups and should leave no one behind in terms of spreading awareness with this being said have you ever considered the effect that covid19 has had on children we could say that children are unable to fully grasp the concept of their mental health and well-being but the pandemic has taken away aspects of their life just like any other member of the community we urge you to keep watching this video for some insight on the mental health of the children within our communities and how you as a parent guardian or any type of caretaker can help to ease their experience although there are many factors to address children are particularly vulnerable due to their limited understanding of the current pandemic because of this many of them are also unable to physically and mentally escape the harms of the situation as they have little to no coping strategies and it is hard for them to communicate their feelings easily unlike adults although their understanding is minimal children can pick up on unverified information through social media or word of mouth as adults communicate which can aggravate mental distress and feelings of uncertainty as misinterpretation is bound to happen children are also in a continuous and critical period of development as they require special care in order to preserve and promote their mental health which has been primarily affected by a drastic change in routine the suppression of all class activities and learning as well as a shift to an online schooling has led to the creation of an isolated learning environment essentially schools are responsible for providing structure to a child's daily activities many articles have postulated the importance of physical activity during the quarantine as it is associated with a decline in symptoms of anxiety and depression research has also argued that schools play a primary role in providing a consistent daily calorie intake to ensure that children are getting their nutritional needs yet amidst the pandemic these essential needs have been significantly decreased a nationwide study in canada conducted by the international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity found that children and youth were actually less active played outside less where more sedentary engaged in more recreational screen time and slept more in comparison to before the covid19 restrictions but special needs are extremely vulnerable to the psychological impacts that come along for example shifting to an online learning environment has disrupted their daily routines and therapy sessions children with autism or neurocognitive disabilities are more likely to show problematic behaviors such as irritability aggression and social withdrawal online learning has also led to a decrease in assistance to these children as parents cannot replace special education teachers there is also a lack of technology to assist with this transition in addition to that social distancing and its effects are extremely new and difficult to understand especially for children that are experiencing developmental and intellectual delays for these reasons spreading awareness of the mental health of children with disabilities needs to be done on a global scale it is also no surprise that the pandemic causes parents and caregivers to become fearful of their own concerns research shows that fear can be contagious as children are sensitive to the emotional state of the adults that surround them to make matters worse parents are also unable to alleviate the stress through familiar mechanisms that were established prior to the pandemic such as visiting family and friends or going on excursions such as watching movies or dining out the process of isolation also imposes more constant contact between parents and children with this being said not all homes are safe places for children to learn or play due to exposure to various types of abuse during quarantine abuse complaints can actually decrease in frequency as there are limited ways for children to flee from perpetrators as schools usually act as an avenue for children to report issues regardless the frequency of children experiencing abuse at home may increase due to continuous contact with perpetrators in quarantine additionally browsing on online social media platforms and lack of supervision over the internet access has also increased vulnerability to online offenders attempted fraud and sexually inappropriate content due to these circumstances issues such as deteriorating performance aggression and regression may escalate these are all examples of environmental impacts that impair a child's mental health and physical perception of the world around them despite any of the negative impacts the internet has been a critical tool for children and youth in learning entertainment and even social interactions since the start of the covet 19 pandemic in particular research has shown that video games offer a temporary escape from real life but they also provide a fair amount of social engagement one of the greatest digital game distributors known as steam reports that since the pandemic started the number of users has increased significantly this report indicates that weekly users has increased from 19 million to 23.5 million although it is generally believed that video games have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of children recent high quality research by the journal of clinical psychological science shows the effects of video games on mental health and well-being is very small video games can help children and youth to fill in the empty gaps by interacting with their friends through online gaming additionally during the pandemic many children do not have enough physical activity so it is recommended to mix physical activities with video games there are active video games that kids can use which can be very helpful while the outdoor movements are restricted for example christopher alexander a professor of video games at ryerson university in toronto says video games can be positive activity during the time of self-distancing if we can take the time to discover the types of games that are best for you so what can you do to help your child during this pandemic there are several avenues of support that can be offered for children to ensure that their mental health is being addressed in this video we will cover the card system provided by the hospital for sick kids for parents and caregivers this system provides strategies that parents can play to help their children cope with stressful situations card is an acronym that stands for comfort ask relax and distract the comfort aspect involves talking to your child about what they can do to cope with their anxiety try to empower your child to overcome their negative thoughts by saying things like you are stronger than you feel also be sure to validate your child's concern by saying things like it's okay to be upset some other things that can be done specifically during the pandemic include limiting exposure to the media and news being mindful of the conversations that you have around family members and creating daily routines that give your child predictability and control next by asking questions your child is given an opportunity to open up some questions you can ask your child include what questions do you have or how are you feeling or what are your friends saying about this and lastly what fun things can you do today thirdly by relax this means to do things that you and your child enjoy to help them feel more secure and connected this can be done by listening to a mindfulness or relaxation activity together practicing positive self-talk or engaging in an enjoyable physical activity lastly a great thing to do is distract try to talk about things that are important to your child such as sports or dancing or art some great activities include reading books watching movies playing board games working on puzzles or even helping your child with their homework using card you can make a personalized system for your child to make their routines during the pandemic a little less difficult and hopefully this benefits your mental health in return because mental health as we said earlier is inclusive to all take care of yourself and don't forget to subscribe and

This World Mental Health Day, we learn more about mental health ...",the covet 19 pandemic has affected all of us in varying degrees but for some of us the uncertainty of our jobs relationships and future has taken a toll on our mental health so today october 10th world mental health day we're dedicating this episode to the important conversation around mental health and what friends and families can do to support those in need so we're speaking to e ping who works at chat an organization which promotes awareness around youth mental health in the recent few years there have been an increase in the number of young people turning to suicide as a way out of their challenges in life i think at the adolescence phase right up to young adulthood there are many changes that we are looking at it's very natural for people to have comments like you look so already why can't you make simple decisions when actually the frontal part of our brain which is really important for major decision making is not fully mature yet as well so for the individual he or she may feel like having new emotions more complex emotions may not necessarily yet know how to process or manage them at the same time the environmental changes all happen for example moving from one school to the next school finding new friends or perhaps even entering the workforce each phase of this is challenging on its own if we just take one change at a time it doesn't look like a lot but if you put everything together it can be very confusing very messy i think there is misconception out there that you know if i'm happy i'm happy if i'm sad it spells big trouble but the whole idea is to let people understand that our mental health doesn't stay stagnant at any one point in time but the health distress is what we commonly experience as stress in life it is normal to feel stressed on a day-to-day basis it's not the same as having a mental illness now mental health problems uh kind of a notch up their mental health distress it can be about losing a job or having a new family member a big enough thing to happen in life that causes a problem with our mental health because our body needs more time more space to adjust to what has happened the line between someone facing just mental health problems with an emerging mental illness that line is very fine so we see sleep changes changes in my behavior appetite changes it just gets worse and worse over time if this is really a mental illness that we are looking at without doing anything much to it people's mental health can get worse can you tell us how can we best provide support if we see our loved ones you know going through difficult times this uh what our young people share with us you know sometimes when i share things with them i really just want people to listen i don't expect them to give me solutions i don't think it's fair to expect people to solve the problems that i cannot stop when we are approached by someone in distress there's this unspoken expectation that this person is looking for solutions from us when actually it's not hold back on giving the advice in this conversation let's ask them what have you tried so far if whatever advice i have my friend has actually thought about tried is not helpful it's okay to feel lost and helpless then just feel helpless with the friend together i think there is that support knowing that i'm not helpless alone it also acknowledges that yeah they are really going through something challenging and not everybody you know have solutions to such a difficult problem yeah yeah exactly sometimes the support that we give doesn't have to be in the form of words it can be in the form of a hug it can be giving a piece of tissue it can be little little things like that [Music] at any point in time if we find ourselves in a down period not feel shame in reaching out for support and when we find ourselves in the better position in life then let's support others and this idea of i'm a giver sometimes i'm a receiver i'm never either one all the time and i think that may help everyone to be more receptive that it's not about your weak i'm weak but i need your help now knowing that in time to come you may need my help as well so let's just help and support one another [Music] to commemorate world mental health day this october 10th we're happy to be a part of facebook's hashtag heartbeats campaign and broaden the conversation around mental well-being share with us what mental well-being means to you in the comment section how can we better connect with ourselves and others [Music] ,False,False,True,False

topic that is very close to my heart mental health mr eric choi hi everyone just an introduction for those of you who don't know who is mrs erich tell us what do you really do i am championing youth matters especially you who are in not so privileged situations so disadvantages youth with issues like mental health issues so recently i spoke in parliament about youth mental health and also young people from disadvantaged families right so what do you do also as co-chair right of the youth um mental well-being network yeah actually very simple we started this uh youth methodology network in february last year oh no was it response to coveted 19. well you already wanted to do it we want to do it all along anyway okay so uh we actually said oh who wants to help out in this piece of work so we had a lot of parents young people professionals practitioners coming forth and to date we actually have 1 500 of them wow both individuals and group organizations who have come forward to say hey i want to help so now we have done quite a few sessions and we have organized ourselves along eight areas and they have as of now thought about at least 30 projects oh wow so hopefully this year we should see some of the projects bearing fruit why this passion in mental health do you know someone who has gone through it or one day you just woke up and be like yeah they need help i think it's a very prevalent thing actually in fact all of us contend with some form of mental health even if not mental health inventor well-being issues you know in a recent survey it was actually found that one in seven singaporeans actually contend with some mental health disorders at some point our lives and then how do we cope with it how do we reach out where do we go to for help i mean these are all questions that maybe a lot of people have but we don't have really answers for so i think coming from that and coming from a personal point of view that's something close to my heart in that sense and i'm sure all of us grapple with our own you know demons every day so i think uh online right there's been a rise of memes also that's concerning mental health so we'll be looking at seven okay and then we will be talking about how relatable this is to you okay and what you can tell us about it sure okay number one so going straight means actual therapy turning right makes oversharing on twitter and you see the smoke behind the car the views of the car so like suddenly right turn yeah over sharing so oral examination tell me about this photo i think if it's uh memes are meant for mostly young folks right yeah so young folks tend to be digital native so people like me digital migrant right so i think we want to express ourselves and we do a lot of sharing on our socials i think in a way that is also kind of like a reflex just to try to communicate with the world about hey what are my emotions at this point in time and i think that's good but i think also the online world is also a place where you can have resources so for instance you know beyond the labor movement they actually have a chat bot her name is bell yes so you can chat with bell and bell can point you to resources that are good for mental health that can possibly be of help to you both in the online world and in the real world and also there are websites like mineline.sg that you can go to so after you post that go to the line to sg all right chat with belle you know but let me just question you one thing also okay do you think people out rightly will tell people they are in therapy well i hardly think so actually because there's still stigma associated with mental health conditions right so even though we mentioned one in seven have some brush with mental health conditions at some point in their life but i think it's also a fact that one in three still think that mental health conditions are oh it comes from weak willpower right but i think that's not a good position to start with okay but the fact that one in three persons thinks that let's fix volumes of what we as a society think about mental health and how we react to it so i think there's a lot of room for us to reshape the way we think about mental health conditions as well as the people with mental health conditions in one sentence it's just about reducing the stigma so what is the youth mental well-being network right doing to you know help people say it's okay to tell people you're in therapy it bears repeating the phrase or the sentence it's okay to be not okay right right so i think we just need to remind ourselves as one people that you can seek help you love your value you are worth it and we just have to get this into our psyche and it's not easy because it means fundamentally changing some engine parts are yes in ourselves right yeah and just all got to keep at it well and i think that's a very practical uh word of advice that it is you know a habit we have to get into we have to constantly remind ourselves it's okay not to be okay one time is not enough you viewing this video one time is really gonna not gonna help your mental health condition is when you take away from this video is really okay not to be okay you telling yourself you telling the people around you and all of you saying the same thing then it will work keep nagging the next beam all right okay what i think yeah this is quite interesting quite cool yeah you do you know who's that i have no idea actually oh my goodness you oh okay so i think what um this meme tells us is that people always think that mental uh not wellness okay has a faith but the fact is a lot of these people are actually high-functioning adults walking around us and i think that's that's very true because um how then do we really identify who amongst us need help and i think here's where uh i'll throw in three letters you know government mama said acronyms right so we have look listen and link right so look just look out for a person's behavior right do i look like i'm a little listless do i look like i have lost interest in usually the things i'm passionate about right not looking at their physical appearance but looking at yeah behavior yeah right so second l is listen listen to what the person is saying is he or she saying something that hey usually you don't sound so pessimistic and these are all signs and symptoms so look listen and then you talk to that person in the process of listening and then if you realize that hey this person possibly has a problem then we link link to what link to the resources linking to persons around him or her who loves him or her because all of us have you know at least a few persons that loves us in our life right and and we go to them for comfort we go to them to re-center and refocus ourselves to recharge our inner core during this pandemic right i think a lot of people who are also like business leaders or you know you know like owners co-founders right they face a lot of stress like they will see like you know their colleagues having lower morale and that is look we see a problem yes right and then we listen they will tell us oh i'm i'm overworked right i feel very lost i'm very upset right and then the problem where we struggle is the link like as a boss i personally feel like it's too personal for me to say hey you should be doing this because i feel like we don't have that relationship but what can i possibly do simple you take out your company's organizational chat it's quite a big group right and then you look at that employee they're concerned about who are the friends the good friends around that person so have that person reach out and get a rough sense of hey what's going on is there anything going on at work in family life or things like that so it's a little bit of detective role in finding out hey what's the angle we can come in to help and our intention really is because we love that person right and we really want to be somebody useful and somebody constructive in that person's life to help him or her and the moment that that person realizes that hey there's somebody who cares about me i think that makes a world of difference so if you are like you know you know also you know running a company and you're facing the same problem as me i think um what eric just said i think it really helps okay next one when somebody asks me how i'm doing but i also want them to feel sorry for me oh my gosh ah this one oh again it goes back to it's okay not to be okay and i think forwards we are worth it so we are worth it because people around us love us even if it's just one person even if it's just your cat or your dog oh my god no ryan my best friend is my daughter yeah so so long as somebody loves you you are worth it so so don't ever ever say oh okay let's not impinge on others correct correct i think i think as singaporeans or like asians you know or in our society right we just don't want to be a burden and i think that is so real because you know everybody is facing the pandemic everybody also stressed like who am i to tell people i i'm very stressed can you take care of me you give me a bit of attention yeah okay me for a while i think that is hard for every one of us but it's okay just three words right don't buy stuff yeah just go because they love you they will hug you oh my gosh it's quite funny because like we've gotten to the stage like don't pass it just ask for it yeah like we are all burns anyway so we might as well just acknowledge it next one right this one's philosophical so you have a hand then you have another hand and then you do a high five and then the hand sinks into the water yes i think like you know i've been advocating for mental health for maybe two three years yeah right and i realized at the start there was a really a lot less awareness but i think now we're getting really into gradually yeah into the conversations and we are really looking at the nuances and the layers of what constitute mental health right it's really not just depression it also means you know your daily things you know how you look inwards and reflect and all that so i think this pose talks about hey now we are aware but still there is this gap between awareness and action that's where i go back to my triple else okay listen link and i think the link part is the critical part because you look you listen and probably you already know but you don't know how to react you don't know how to respond that's why you give a high five and then the person sings deeper yes absolutely but i think we we ought to be able to know where the help is so there's so many hot lines uh because of the pandemic we set up the national care hotline that's 1 800 202 needs to call this hotline if you think that you need some emotional psychological support go ahead there will be volunteers will be behind the line if need be they can actually make referrals for you the professionals they operate from 8 am to midnight every day but if you think that you're in a crisis that means you're in an emergency you have suicidal thoughts there are also emergency hotlines out there so for instance the sos hotline which is 1-800-221-4444 and there's also the imh hotline which is uh 6389-2222 these are good hotlines to call for emergencies they're on 24 7. so if you think or if you know somebody who is in need of help urgently in crisis mode go for these hotlines so i think a lot of us watching you be like oh this hotline is not for me no i think even i i think that we're like oh it's not for me i'm not that serious yet i think i can deal with it without calling some government hotline because that would make it so official that i'm in trouble but you know let us know who who are these people who actually really call this hotline and you know are there any examples that you know people have actually gotten better after calling these hotlines well it's all anonymized that's why i won't be able to tell you um of uh maybe auntie who and who or student who and who not really but actually if you are really really worried there's also another service which is a community health assessment team chat so they offer a range right can actually make an appointment to go down to skate they actually offer services for youth between 16 to 30. you can make an appointment there'll be actually practitioners there who help you walk you through some services and if they can also make referrals for you if need be and the best thing is this whole process is all anonymized right right yes so the bottom line is you know help yourself and help people around you right so well uh if you're a little bit stressed and you don't get a call hotline i tell you what just call first and then see how later yeah i mean it's there right it's free right it's free yes okay i mean like they're really steady that might as well just try like huh okay next one [Applause] [Music] okay so you know there are even a lot of tick-tock now right yeah like i said you know you really just bring into awareness all these kind of things what do you think you know of this kind of content i think it just points to the fact that hey understanding is not there yet i go back to the surveys that i talked about earlier actually one in five which is like 20 right think that people with mental health conditions should not hold any responsibility at all then what others do yeah so they expect people with mental conditions to just lie down corner i don't know so that speaks to the amount of understanding they have in our society and also about whether you are willing to work with or live near somebody with mental health conditions well it's only a little over five in ten persons in singapore who thinks that yes i can do that so it's only one in two who thinks that what about the other half do you know what's their primary uh primary fear i think it goes back to lack of understanding i think it goes back to the fact that people don't really know that it's actually so prevalent so i know we talked a lot about our downstream uh help right maybe the hotlines or where you can go right but let's talk a little bit about upstream what do you think are certain things every singaporean especially youth can really start adopting so that we are taking care of our health so we don't really get too too serious i think it's just about vocalizing how you feel on a day-to-day basis if you just reach home you just uh i see my wife how was your day and then just say like a lot of us would just say okay laughs yeah like that law yes but beneath like that law is what oh i had a few not so pleasant experiences at work today what are they what makes you feel that way and then decompress some of those thoughts and feelings right we are sometimes so detached from our inner feelings right yes that we think that hey very much yeah okay so for example right i live with my brother and i always ask him how is he uh yeah no like it's quite pisces to continue the conversation but what do you suggest well again what does he like to eat you know does he enjoy coffee does he enjoy a good cup of ice milo dinosaur or whatever it is yeah and then slowly make people comfortable get it out of the chat about their shelves yeah and it's hard to do so for guys i think so that is something that you do um with your family members any other upstream things that we can do non-verbals right just before going out for the day give a hug and show appreciation at work if your staff or your colleagues has done something right say hey that's a great thing that you're done thanks very much when you say you know say thanks i visualize me going out to the person and say thanks and i need so formal yeah and i don't think i can do that you need to organize world ceremony what thank you yeah right so just like simple things even a text would do if that is where you need to get started i think so long as it's heartfelt people get it the next one do you have friends or family that are going through mental struggles such as depression because i do and this is the biggest mistake i make as a friend see my friend suffers from mild depression and every time he gets depressed he falls into this dark hole and seeing him in a dark hole i will always try to give advice to help him get out of the hole but that's wrong that's very wrong we have to realize that when someone has a mental breakdown all they want is for someone to be there for them they don't need no advice they don't need anything logical they just need some emotional support so affirm them let them know that you are there and just be around them advise us they can wait they can wait until they feel better but for now all you have to do is to just be there for them do you agree you know they're so funny you know this reminds me of something at home actually you know typically when men talk to women about problems right okay so typically men are like okay let's go for the solutions yes how do we solve this and when women talk to men about problems and usually it's like okay like empathize with you i just want a heart kind of thing right so there are a couple of times which i i talked to my wife what today at work this and this and this isn't and then my objective was just to get a heart right and then she would tell me oh why don't you try this solution oh wow so she's trying to speak in the way that she thinks she gave me a 10-year series that's it actually yeah all i'm looking for is just some empathy and a heart class most of the times the the men and women dynamics you know the mars and venus thing is like that lah but sometimes it gets reversed and we often go back to one uh one joke about myself you know always all these personality tests right yes yeah and a lot one of these tests was uh let's find out how man or how woman you are okay so my wife said take the test i think i was like 80 women oh wow i mean for family right i think it's easier to say hey what i'm i'm looking for is just listening here and you just sit there there but let's say in a work context okay how how do we help somebody who's telling us their problems he think really is before you say anything just make sure that you're listening very hard trying to make sense of what the person is saying right and trying to empathize trying to be in her or in his shoes to try to understand from his or her point of view hey what's going on before you offer solutions this is the last one okay imagine what a perfect life might look like i'm not sure what i even want but it made me realize that some things i would keep i think the understanding for this one right is i guess for every singaporean every year out there we do have a life that is ideal for us a life that we used to be sick but at the end of the day halfway through seeking it will realize is this what i even want right have you ever felt this way and how did you deal with it actually a lot of us a lot of us just go through life without giving much thought as to hey where are we trying to get to right so i think it's good once in a while to really just sit down go to the gardens slide on the grass look at the sky really deep breaths you don't have to take a very long time 15 minutes to do right and then just take deep breaths i think deep breaths for me really work because it helps you re-center refocus and gets that blood bumping in the right way again and then really think about hey what is life about for you it's going to be different for all of us but we need to spend that time to really give some thought to it and get in touch really with your inner self right and they're deep breaths yeah and it's freela and you can just do it like right now when you're watching this video exactly so the final question okay i know you already mentioned you know since the start of last year you have already like a thousand over participants and volunteers so let's say if somebody who is watching yes they're taking that deep breath and they already feel better good very sad right yeah yes and they want to join right what what can we do very simple go to reach.golf.sg

university in asia elena a very warm welcome to you without further ado let me hand over to elena today elena over to you thank you very much christina really nice of you to kick start this important event and i'll welcome everyone disability is high on the diversity agenda and um it's for many companies health is one of the highest causes of disability in the world today and it causes companies billions of losses each year due to employee absenteeism lack of productivity and innovation the world health organization estimates that 10 of the global population suffers from some form of mental illness which means it's one of four of us is affected unfortunately stigma and taboo surrounds in mental health making it a poorly understood topic across the world and asia is not an exception fear and traditional beliefs prevail preventing many that are impacted by mental health issues from reaching out and receiving help that they need not seeing the apparent demand and not knowing how best to approach the sensitive subject unfortunately few companies today are addressing this critical aspect of employee well-being in their organization so to get us started and to set up the scene i would like to ask professor funk to share with us the landscape of the mental uh health sector in singapore and some of the common mental health conditions but particularly those that are increased over the recent years thank you elena i hope everyone can hear me um and i my slides are up okay i'm just gonna start off give us some background to what's happening and perhaps uh then we could leverage uh and speak on mental health and mental illness now the impact of this pandemic on mental health firstly has caused a lot of concerns because there's ex expression of the increased prevalence of illnesses and problems associated with economic recession job loss even family violence and abusive behaviors in lockdowns where people are kept at home at the same time there's concern that people because of that isolation may uh if they were emotionally unstable resorts to three sides this actually is data that uh we have in our institute looking at patients that we take care for at this point i don't think suicides are on the rise but suddenly we are monitoring the numbers and that's of concern at the same time uh the very providers of healthcare that are looking after our population are under tremendous amount of stress because this is a new virus we do not know how it works and what are the implications on life in general and there are risks and fears that people have so in fact in the study between singapore and india we compared the groups interestingly in india um you know depression and anxiety is slightly higher than uh in singapore where post-traumatic stress disorder was significant and i know it's a busy slide just just take my word for it it's quite significant and it's it's of concern uh certainly for us because workers if they are not able to manage themselves and uh suffering from some degree of stress would not be able to function and and truly in this study they actually showed that there's a higher um complaints of things like headaches throat pain apart from the the usual emotional aspects of insomnia tightness and lethargy and even anxiety alongside this process is what's happening in the world uh i had a quick scan of the literature this is a couple of studies one is in china where it looked at people returning to work well 10.8 percent of respondents suffered from ptsd or post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to work but returning to work did not actually cause an increase in psychiatric symptoms that means illness itself or mental illness didn't arise i'll talk to this a little bit later more executives are practicing hand hygiene and more workers avoided sharing utensils which is a good thing infection control measures were in place in fact another study this one looked at what's the real stress behind all of this it's actually financial stress this is the primary mediator for emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes so these are important points so what has happened since the pandemic the old normal this is what's happening in our hospitals number of admissions the hospital has been moderated the outpatient clinics the specialist uh outpatient clinics people were not coming forward as much emergencies were coming down because there was fear in the air this was in healthcare outside of healthcare i mean what our old normal was really meeting up and and um getting together in meetings and having collaborative face-to-face meetings had to change in fact digitalization working from home home-based learning for children and telly everything i mean we're having a webinar right which we would have been unheard of but we have a meeting in a room with lots of people it's changed it's changed the way we provided healthcare it's changed the way we've worked in our offices and and zoom is very well known i've used zoom so many times in the last i'm kind of over zoomed actually and it's a it's it's not a good thing so what is the mental health approach we have to take in this context first i want to talk a little bit about mental health because it's an area that is quite important and sometimes poorly understood now in the population and providers like myself as doctors and clinicians we are one end of what i call a pyramid the other are patients people who already have mental illnesses now mental health affects the general population what is mental health mental health is not merely an absence of illness it's actually a very overarching well-being concern now very often we are well we'd like to think that majority of us don't have much stress but some of us do and when stress increases we start to have this stress and we start to have problems these are mental health related issues on the other hand mental illness is slightly different this is a biological problem it's not a reaction to stress this very often have genetic um and and brain related abnormalities and they have to be treated by professionals that is about i think christina said or is it elena who said one and four i think in singapore the data is about less than one in one in five but um but it depends on where you do the prevalence studies and of course in mental illness there's mild illness and moderate illness and severe illness here in the institute of mental health we deal with mostly the moderate to severe illness so the percentage is much lower now what this slide actually shows is that there is you can have mental illness and you can have mental health issues they are not necessarily on the same dimension but they're in the same pyramid and severe mental health problems doesn't necessarily translate into mental illness the other piece of course is you can have a mental illness and be still in good mental health that means you are happy with your life your illness is under control very much like someone with diabetes or hypertension you're on treatment you're fine so it's important to understand the role of stress in this this is just a singapore mental health study looking at figures so one in seven is a lot lower than the one in four but that's our local data in singapore now what can we do what are the kind of services that are needed for our patients people with mental illness i think now because of infection control measures we need technology to enable the management uh and for um in the hospitals i think trying to manage trauma is important because post-traumatic stress disorder is very much associated with what's going on in and everyone's scared and frightened and fearful um and then of course there is the possible mental illnesses that may result from covet what we know of covet 19 is that we think it's a respiratory disorder actually it's an autoimmune it's a immune response disorder that causes an inflammatory process that can occur in the brain as well you're not sure on the mental health side of things there is need to provide firstly some guidance on health and how to seek help i think some of the other speakers on the panel will speak more on this but i just you know broadly say there needs to be both live support which is synchronous and asynchronous information needs to be available for the public so they know where to get help and what to do when they are in distress at the same time in the longer term i think there is importance to first train mental health professionals and even general health professionals to manage mental illnesses in general and reduce the stigma for the population at large psychological first aid and mental health literacy to understand mental health concerns do not necessarily translate the mental illness and what are mental illnesses in the first place to really manage issues like anxiety and depression as a whole in the workplace most of the issues are not around mental illness it is around mental health how do you manage stress because now there's a lot of changes in work processes working from home economic recession job loss social distancing and isolation is not a good thing if you don't meet your co-workers how would you feel as a team so you need to be able to manage emotions have coping strategies social support and social linkages within the workplace that's important how can you do that can you respect the safety dignity and rights of individuals but adapt and consider cultural aspects particularly in this part of the world be aware of infection control how to look after yourself and when to seek help when that is needed i went a little fast because i want to complete within the 10 minutes and i'm kind of done uh as an introduction to how we can support the workforce thank you very much i'm gonna stop the sharing thank you very much professor thank you um so what i'm recollecting is that um public and organizational education um has created an awareness around mental health and uh we can indeed uh go and find lots of information online and that's good because more understanding will facilitate our empathy and open-mindedness furthermore compassionate and compassionate communication could help those affected by mental health and bring them closer to those that can help so with that i'm turning to leanne a question to you are you seeing more people seeking help for mental health conditions and especially during circuit breaker how have the npos and charities been supporting its clients and beneficiaries uh especially during this period over to you hello everybody good afternoon i'm leanne from singapore association for mental health uh i'm happy to be with you here today to share a little bit uh on what we observe on the ground as a social service uh provider uh for mental health services um during this uh whole period of covic and circuit breaker we like many corporates um from the social service side actually do seek a lot of happenings in that sense to people uh and about their everyday uh daily life and their work life uh the experience they go mental health issues that come up as a result um simple association for mental health actually uh we have 10 services we started operation in 1968 and we have always been focusing on promoting mental wellness for all and our services range from community engagement education raising awareness about mental health issues to providing creative services to help people to manage their anxiety promote mental wellness and more importantly we also have rehabilitation services where we support people in recovery of mental illness so uh just uh to contextualize um some of the things that um daniel had shared um we all know that from the last 2016 survey one in seven um singaporean here would actually experience a mental health condition in their lifetime and um from a psychosocial perspective um we look at mental health as a continuum and um daniel has said that um being uh men having a mental illness does not necessarily mean that people have poor mental health and actually uh not having a mental illness does not also mean that we have uh good mental well-being so uh when we look at it uh from uh continuum uh at different point we could be experiencing a different kind of um feelings and emotional well-being on the green side on the healthy side we could be happy uh generally very satisfied with life and um meeting our aspiration and emotionally more balanced but sometimes when trouble takes place or stresses come in we could be in the yellow and the amber zone where we actually um our life can be a bit disturbed and there's more anxiety and we may not sleep well uh i'm sure you you can actually some of you may identify may be able to identify some of the symptoms that come about and uh it really depends on our coping strategies and uh how can we build our own resilience towards uh managing ourselves back to the green state yeah and if if um we move along and we don't take care of ourselves well and um do not know where are the resources to support us uh we can go into the raid state where we actually can become sick physically we can have very destructive lifestyle we cannot be functioning very well in our activity of daily living so that is a time of concern so uh in in this whole continuum um there are scales for us to actually uh look at where we are and often time um from our social service experience um we we we don't have a medical treatment so we we do a lot of psychosocial intervention uh to support people uh so this this are some of the ways we we help people understand um that um we need to take care of our mental well-being right um during this whole period um before we actually went into circuit breaker um we are already in dos corn orange in late february and um all the social service agencies uh in fact uh have to come up with our business continuity plan and uh we were already planning and uh to go into split team uh and in fact for singapore association for mental health we started uh going on trial speed team just before um circuit breaker kicks in on 7th of uh april and what happened was um it although we have plans we have preparation uh we had a lot of meetings discussion and preparation with staff uh actually we were quite affected by this uh circuit breaker the first phase because um the instruction is all services have to close except for um very very frontline services like uh residential homes so out of our tent service we only have one service that can fully remain open 24 7. that is our group home in bukit batu where we run a residential service for people in recovery so all the other nice services we have to immediately plan how to provide continually provide our service to our beneficiaries and community through remote means so it was very challenging for us because um we do not have all the hardware support at those in the initial juncture and uh when we acquire the hardware we may we do not have all the apps and software and it took us a while to get out the subscription of all this zoom and way backs up so and what happened was uh the instruction was very clear that due to the protective measure and uh uh safe distancing measures uh there's no way we could see clients and uh we have to actually uh refer services to uh other frontline that are allowed to or considered um white listed agencies uh that can actually visit cases so it was very tough and um what what happened was uh subsequently there was a reverse i would say not maybe not a reverse decision but uh moh has taken into consideration the feedback and um there was a um a new um advisory that allowed with exemption uh some exemption to some services so we managed to uh get some exemption and some of our services are listed as whitelisted agency and uh we could provide minimum on on-site support to our service recipient so our counseling services we could actually let some of our staff with minimum staffing go back to the center and we are able to see some high risk cases during those period yeah so during clear spirit uh even as we as a service provider try to adapt and change to using virtual means to provide consultations as well as sessions and activities with our service recipients um not all our service user could actually benefit from the remote services mainly we take it for granted that uh while we are ready you know people at the other end should be able to actually um enjoy what they usually enjoy during the on-site support uh but many of our clients actually do not have the hardware and they can't afford to do subscription um so we actually also face that challenge with with our clients who we want to support and also there are clients and beneficiaries who prefer not to do all this virtual um link up with us because their home environment is not suitable they are home condition and home buyer environment is not super and some of them are not used to this kind of arrangements where they felt that their privacy can be compromised especially if they have to do it in their house and there's not enough space and private space for them to do so so um so there is quite a lot of adjustment that we have to do um so we resort a lot to telephonic support and declines right okay just just a bit on what is seen on the ground which actually could be mirrored in in the survey national survey that uh carried out um one of the market survey company actually uh can show their survey results uh and i think it was published in the press and that uh actually a quarter one in four uh respondents actually expressed their that they are their mental health is not so good and uh one of our our partners uh silver ribbon they also carried out a survey of 500 over respondents and anxiety and mood issues also surface as a concern um uh i think everybody is also aware there's this national care hotline that was um launched uh on 10th of um april uh so shortly after the launch uh towards the end of the month uh in early may they have released this report to show that uh actually within a short span of time there is 6600 calls and out of this 6600 calls 40 percent actually uh need more support and uh these calls are diverted to uh social service agencies and other um community support agencies that provide more dedicated support to people with mental health worries and concerns um scss also have a chat board called bell the chat and they also see an increase during this period circuit breaker period of people assessing the web to to actually ask questions and seek help so i think it is also consistent that mutually people raise concern and have said that they are stressed and anxious and they need emotional support just coming back to our own uh singapore association for mental health our own service uh our counseling service has a toll-free helpline where our counselors um pick up calls from anybody in the community during this period between april to june uh compared to the same period in 2019 we have a 50 percent increase in callers and uh among the the callers that uh new callers uh we actually see almost 40 of um callers in the age band of 21 to 40 years old um this is pretty telling about the situation on the ground in that this would be the group of people who possibly are working adults and uh because of having to work from home uh because of the movement restriction um they have actually suffered more mental health concerns and um what surface is also 25 about 25 of them actually express or they are depressed they have an anxiety and mood issues uh very stressed during this period um and also they have also raised issues about relationship for example uh one of the caller actually said that during this period is very stressful and she wants to break up with her boyfriend and also family issues came up we have callers who call that they they um having a lot of conflict because of everybody being at home uh and um they are also those callers who are worried about their family members or friends who are expressing depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation and um the callers who are caregivers caregivers who are during this period is very stressed because um they are unable to send their children to child care nor are they able to send their seniors to day care centers for their rehab so it's elena i need to a little bit cut you um someone asked is there a phone number that you could share where um you know where people can call and probably we need another 20 seconds to close your section sure all right i will uh show some numbers and resources at the last slide okay so so i i think we are all aware that we all play uh wear many hats and now we are at the same time uh stressed with having to adapt to the challenges and move towards a a more um adaptive new normal uh so i'm just sharing i have two more slides just sharing some resources for employees uh and as well as for employers um tafette has some some guidelines on how we can actually uh be more mindful of our mental health concerns and issues and support employees throughout this period and there's also a workplace well-being work group comprising national bodies as well as uh corporates and uh jeffrey myset is also one of the company who is a part of this work group they have come up with an e-guide on managing the organizations and working with employees throughout this period smh has also partnered a corporate chancellor and we come up with a infographic and we have posted in our social media uh to share with people how actually this whole period of stress actually actually is a very good learning experience and we can turn it to very positive development for our own um mental well-being and we can become more resilient over time and um my last like is really to show um this is not exhaustive but these are some of the possible places where you can contact or your employee can contact uh if they need support yeah thank you very much it's really it's really pleasant to hear that many progressive organizations took the chance of corvette which is unfortunate chance yes uh they showed their resilience and uh showed a really good ways to advocate for those uh who need help and dispelling of the of their um issues around the topic and you've mentioned jeffrey which brings me amazingly well to uh to our next speaker jeffrey i know that you devote yourself patiently to supporting this big course and i know that you have a daytime job and uh sort of a another job of working for with the charity mindset that jardine set up please share with us how you've been supporting the mental health community and what what advices can you give to smes great uh can you hear me and hopefully you can be able to see my screen as well okay now not yet not yet i'm not sure why it's not coming through uh but it's okay let me try and see if i can share that once again there you go and is that coming true yes okay great thank you very much for your time and for inviting um mindset and myself to this i think you've heard from uh from daniel and from lian maybe just a little bit of background on mindset before i jump to the last couple of slides so mindset is the charity that the judy madison group has established about nine years ago and you're probably wondering why mental health when we started in 2011 this was a totally un interesting underserved area you would find a lot of charities focus on health on physical health on disabilities on children on education but nobody wanted to talk about mental wellness or mental health because it was a very taboo area to be a part of but not talking about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and so one of the things that group has started out over the last nine ten years is to be able to try and raise awareness about mental health mental wellness and to be able to talk about it for those of you who are not familiar with mindset well these are the constituent businesses of the group in singapore and i'm sure some of them would be quite familiar with you you know from the genki sushis to the starbucks the cold storage hong kong land and mandarin oriental this is all part of the group that is behind mindset in the jardins group itself we've been recognized for our efforts over the years and we've been encouraged by this what's our focus our focus really is trying to do good and to be able to recognize that this is a journey we don't do it alone obviously we do it with our partners and co-collaborators um two of them are with me today dr daniel fong of course and and lee yen from samh and you'll find that there has been a growing awareness and a environment where more people are aware of this and are willing to come alongside and be a part of it so we don't do this alone we do this with all our social service agency partners and if you think about mindset as an organization it's actually only made up of two full-time employees everyone else who is involved in this effort is actually a volunteer or has got a daytime job doing something else like myself um how do we do this we do this by way of what we call jardine ambassadors so every year we've got 40 individuals who come alongside spend two years of their life to be a part of this venture and to be able to walk alongside with the activities that they have what are the activities awareness outreach getting people back into the workforce and this is important because part of this inclusiveness is to be able to get and accept people who may be suffering from mental health issues to be accepted within the workplace and that i think just adds to this whole thing about how do we have an inclusive community as a whole social enterprise and fundraising um again this chart shows apart from the numbers that have been contributed to our effort are the other partners you know from digital mindset to singapore association mental health institute of mental health i just wanted to highlight two particular flagship projects that we have launched in the last nine years the first is with the singapore citizen mental health called mindset learning hub happens about raising the importance of the workplace environment and how if you're a mental health person in recovery how important it is to be in a work environment because that gives you a sense of attachment belonging to be part of a local community and it adds towards your self-worth in terms of building that environment for for persons in recovery the other one which we embarked on last year is kind of interesting uh it's with touch community services and this focus is on pathological gaming but it also talks about addiction to the internet and all things internet and it's kind of interesting because if you think about the last couple of months um i for one have been totally addicted to the internet i i am walking through that addiction right now and participating on a daily basis whether it's a webex or a zoom or some form of video conference that i'm on um and and i think this is going to be in my in our view a growing area that we'll have to address as we go back into that new normal of how to be able to regulate between the internet virtual world and the real physical world itself um i i think it would be an interesting challenge for us as we make that transition this is the one chart that i i think if you forget about all the other charts that i've talked about hopefully it will stay with you and what i would call the four is um as employers i i think it's important for us to be able to set the tone of awareness if you are an employee you would not think twice about saying physical safety in the workplace is important and you need to be able to have a place where your employees come in and will not leave injured because you have got poor processes but i think the fundamental shift needs to be not just a physical safe workplace but also a supportive workplace that accepts and supports good mental health practices and mental wellness and and as lien and says there's a group of employers have come together in the last couple of years called work well uh there is a e-guide that you know helps with steps is how you can be able to do this at the workplace and again one thing that i like to highlight is that it is not as daunting as it looks to be able to take that first step because i i think today we do have that support structure that's out there and and well this is one the second a that i would like to highlight is what i call acceptance because when you talk about mental health issues oftentimes people tend to light up their eyes when you talk to somebody about mental health challenge that you have but it's not lighting up to help it's lighting up to step away because immediately you have got that stigma that comes around and say oh maybe you're not quite that okay and if you're not quite that okay maybe i should not be associating with you or if i leave a label with you then i look at you in a very different perspective altogether and i think in hopefully over the last uh a couple of months of this corporate pandemic you know it's been able to show that none of us are immune from the stresses and none of us are immune from some of this mental health challenges that we may have whether it's stress at work for working from home over the last couple of months on not being able to separate our personal lives from our work lives um activities i think it's important as employers in the employment and environment to be able to talk about this to promote this and to be able to address uh stress management um i like to particularly highlight self-care here and i put down there especially for leaders why do i say that because oftentimes as managers and leaders in the work environment we don't tend to take a like a superhero persona and say of course i can manage this of course i can deal with this but i think it's also important for us as leaders of the groups that we manage in the workplace to recognize that we've had to first take care of ourselves before we can take off somebody else and and it reminds me that you know not that long ago we used to have this activity called flying on an airplane if you recall that before kovit came around and and and one of the things that they'll tell you is that you know if we have a decompression and the air mass were to fall down help yourself first as the adult before you can be able to help your children or somebody else and i think that's a good reminder that we have to take care of our own mental health wealth being as well and and then finally the last a would be assistance i i think that as it's not just the social service agencies have recognized the government has recognized and so there is formal support mechanisms that's out there that we as in the work environment can be able to point out colleagues and team members too lien has shared some of that mind line is one that was just introduced not that long ago by the government and i think they are certainly tools and help that's available so from from that perspective i would just encourage everybody to think about the workplace in in this perspective and with this mindset of the four ways of awareness of acceptance of activities and of assistance uh yeah so those are the points that i i wanted to highlight and uh happy to take any questions thank oh you thank you jeffrey you can mute yourself um really very interesting i didn't realize we have so many things in common like addiction to internet and um so as a small question small follower question for you that came so um for a while we have been imagining what technologies could do for our future and today we are bombarded with information and a new term that we are hearing is digizofrenia and it's said to be linked very heavily with mental health could you comment on uh probably the biggest influencer of the modern day mental health issues i i think it's a it's a question of trying to segregate work life balance and and daniel and bm can be able to talk to that technology is supposed to serve us and to be able to give us a lot more time to serve our own personal needs i think there's been a conflating and the bleeding of our personal lives in our work life and the technology that's supposed to help us i think is also starting if i can use that a strong word starting to hurt us and harm us and i think the only way that we should respond to it is to respond with a a a discipline as it were in terms of trying to define time that we would have for ourselves as opposed to things just circle on i don't have a commute now from the office from the home to the office which used to be about 15 minutes where i could have a down time listen to music and clear my head whether it's going to the office or coming back now my commute is from my bedroom to my study which is less than 30 seconds so how do i replace that to be able to get myself re-centered i i think it's important so those are some of my thoughts lovely thank you and thank you for highlighting the importance of creating environment and organization that promotes awareness of mental health and again that again brings very well to um rebecca and before i ask you a question can i just remind everyone to please uh continue populating q and a's uh we will try to address them as after after rebecca spoke and rebecca turning to you so if you could share how your company pwc has helped employees to navigate through this unprecedented times in fact i think the word unprecedent has been reported by google as the most uh searched word for the last half a year thanks elena um just checking so can you see my can here can see okay perfect i just put it on the screen okay great so um i was given the room of two slides so i've tried to pack it all into two but so forgive me um so i think just to understand how companies in general but pwc specifically have dealt with what's going on in the last six months um it was usual to look at kind of our well-being journey over the last year or so and where we were pre-covered um because that's also when we look at this it's important to look at you know where we're going to be when we emerge out of this as well so um i think for us really first of all looking at you know what is the state of mental health in the workplace in singapore the the business case is very well established for investing in employee mental health um in singapore the ncss study showed 5.6 times return on investment for investing in employment health in the workplace so but i think that's something that's not really been internalized necessarily by the business community here um as much as it could be um the message that it's not just a nice thing to do it actually makes business sense um so when we talk about mental health in the workplace um you know the 2019 study in singapore showed 92 of the workforce in singapore are stressed um but more importantly 12 percent said that they had an unmanageable level of stress so there's about risk of burnout and and this 92 is above the oecd average so in general not so singapore workforce were more stressed before you came in jacob than than the average and so that's kind of the backdrop that you start on but um as we were saying it's not just there's kind of the mental health um whether you have distress or a problem but there's also the clinical side so with one in seven people experiencing a clinical mental health condition uh not just distress during their lifetime and actually most most studies show it's about three quarters um have an onset by your mid-20s so that means that by the time you're in the workforce the likelihood you know that that a significant number of us are living with either mental health distress or actual full-blown mental illness it's actually very commonplace in the workforce and we just don't talk about it so it's not an other people's problem it's actually it's an everybody's problem um so what does that mean for pwc well uh so globally we have what's called be well work well which is kind of our framework for for well-being in the workplace which really focuses on four aspects of personal well-being so your physical health your mental health and then emotional and spiritual aspects but we looked about a year ago and said how do we really uh localize this and make this relevant in terms of the maturity of you know in singapore and we really wanted to acknowledge that workplace mental health is a two-way street so you have your obviously individual mental health affects the business right because um it affects engagement performance absenteeism presenteeism retention you know all of those things um but also work is a huge part of our lives particularly here i mean people work extremely long hours um and there's often a huge link between uh a huge amount of kind of um your identity and sense of purpose and sense of um of yourself that's very linked to to work and so uh what you do at work doesn't stay at work it also affects you at home and so it's a hugely important factor you're kind of what we call professional well-being is a huge factor in your overall mental health and well-being so that's why we have them kind of interplay of the two together so yeah so we look at it as both you're as as a as an organization but also as an individual you're responsible for your professional and your personal well-being and they're intrinsically linked so i think many of you may have heard before the daniel pink framework where he would talk about you know autonomy mastery and purpose well when we talk about professional well-being it's sort of similar we talk about you know your growth journey so for us that's is what you're doing um do you do you feel that what you're doing is is part of a longer career does it fit into your goals and aspirations and that's that kind of sense of purpose in what you're doing and are you getting kind of progression then really um the learning and skills so are you getting skills to get better at what you're doing are you really mastering something and feel that you are you know an expert in a topic and then the the huge part about you know the work culture and environment that has a huge um effect in terms of belonging so do you feel heard and valued but also do you have the tools that sort of enable you to do your work so all of those aspects really um on a pre-code on a normal situation or very uh have a very big link to your your mental health and the the employees responsibility to that so for us well being really um including managing your mental health it's not just a soft skill and a nice to have the the clear message from us is like it's a critical business skill to maintain your performance and engagement so that's also why we're part of that as i mentioned earlier the work world leaders work group and we hosted in last year the first ceo dialogue on mental health to really make sure that um you know this is a strategic priority that's been dealt with at a c-suite level so um you know in terms of the challenges we already touched on them before so stigma is a huge issue so we did the you know the beyond the label campaign internally um and we had an internal campaign last year where we had our leaders uh do a video where they were really saying why mental health is important to them and role modeling and saying and making a pledge and explaining like this is personally what i do to invest in my mental health um which was great but then we sort of realized realized that having asked everyone to pledge to talk about mental health the actual level of mental health literacy was too low to do that people don't have the basic uh understanding and language to be able to talk about mental health or mental illness so since then we really worked on increasing that mental health literacy um through trainings awareness and things like that um including doing a training for all of our uh front sort of front end um hr staff and some of our leadership so it was a full full day training on mental health mental illness and what that means in the workplace so that they're equipped to be able to actually deal with situations when they come up but then the other thing i think is around culture so [Music] the the type of organization we are and i think also in singapore in general there's really a kind of stress as a badge of honor kind of culture that means that um working unsustainably is kind of rewarded um and that's really seen as a you know that's a success that's a a great thing if you're sort of working yourself until you can you can barely function so how do we get around that um that aspect of it so you know places to start as an organization so you know as i said we started with a lot of awareness stuff but then it's really about leadership setting it as a priority so you'll hear a lot i hear a lot you know i don't have time i don't have time to invest in my own mental health and well-being but what that's really saying is i haven't made it a priority because we all have the same amount of time it's just that you're allocating your time based on the priorities and if it's not set as a priority you're not going to give time to it um so that's one thing where leadership's really important to set it as as a as a priority and then role model that so um yeah as i said we also did you know full day training for our leadership in our hr frontline staff um but then really you have to support it with policies so make it official so we've got you know flexible medical leave we've got which you can take a sort of mental health phase we've got insurance coverage that covers mental health and we have our employee assistance program and things like that but also practical tools so i was involved as i said the wellness guide from the work work world that um lee jan mentioned but also we have a mental health manager's tool kit and things like that so but fundamentally if you don't embed it embed mental health and well-being into how you recognize performance it's never going to be a priority so we've now just launched a revised professional development framework which builds um into our whole leadership portion we've really built how you manage your own well-being and how for more senior grades how you manage the well-being of your team um is actually one of the attributes that's measured in terms of your performance um and your yeah and so that's and your progression so that's that's um that was sort of where it was at pre-covered uh and then obviously uh covered 19 happened um and we've already touched you know the others have already touched on how this um affects your affects individuals and the workplace in different ways but i think many of you might have seen that meme that came out which was like what has advanced the digital transformation agenda in your organization more your ceo your chief digital officer or kobit um and the answers obviously covered 19 as we all went digital but i think that that also stands for mental health um because having been um it's really pushing the agenda to talk about mental health in the workplace um it's a for a long time suddenly there is a conversation that's happening um kind of naturally sort of opened up pandora's box really and even small things like on call you know ending calls with people and they'll say you know stay safe stay sane and you know for all that you know it's it's trite but it does mean that people are really acknowledging that there are physical impacts but also mental and emotional impacts of what's going on right now um and that they're that's something that's coming into the into the workplace sorry this alarm going off oh rebecca that fits really well with your timing and i need to kind of we're coming close to kind of an hour so do you want to close in with the next sort of a 20 seconds sort of on the key message and i think you're actually there's a question from cara sort of anything you're answering just nicely and uh if you could help me to round up your your slide sorry what was the question um i will read the question i think you did answer that but um i love the term step in not step away but a lot of managers don't know how to step in and know what to say when an employee opens up do you have any practical tips on how best to respond so actually that's something um that yeah so i was gonna get you so obviously the individual part of this in terms of you know resilience but really the critical part is getting managers and leaders it's that middle part because if you don't bridge what you're doing as an organization to through managers to the actual people it's it's there's a real gap there so that's one thing that we have had a lot of questions on so we're already working on it but essentially now instead of me going to people they come to me to ask so we've had some sessions on how to approach these conversations um where with someone who is showing signs of distress or who's actually come to you to disclose that they're really struggling or have a mental uh or facing mental illness as a coach or a manager so the the key message there is really on listening to understand not listening to reply or to give advice um and that you know and empathy is really key and also acknowledging you know we're equipping managers to have a conversation where they're listening with empathy and then can refer people to the right to the right sources of help you you're not expecting all of don't expect your managers or don't expect an individual to be able to counsel someone you're not you know beware you're not a psychologist you're not a counselor you're not a you're not a trained doctor um but what you can do is make sure that they it's around that psychological safety aspect that they really feel comfortable to voice their concerns and feel that you're listening to them and want to get to a better outcome and then you can on their behalf find find where to go next but really um the key there is really just listening to understand thank you so much rebecca i really appreciate and um um i know we're running out of time i wanted to address one of the questions and uh i know jeffrey you wanted to uh to to answer it we have a question from yvonne that would like to know how one can participate in the mindset jardin ambassador program thank you very much um the program right now is within the group itself and we've been talking amongst the x-com as to how we can be able to extend that outside of the group but i think i've sent a response to whoever was asking that question i think was nora my email please feel free to reach out and i think we can continue that conversation as to how we could get you involved thank you there is one question before i pass to uh to andrew and this question also from ewan and if possible uh dr fung would you like to take this question i'm thankful for the panelists sharing while what is the percentage of the employers in singapore that really care of aware of the importance of the mental health at workplace where most company hr hardly mention about it from my understanding that's a difficult question like i'm not aware of how companies look at this um but my own point is uh i think it's important to have not just engage employees and and workers in the in the companies but um employees uh and uh um workers who feel that um they are being um they are doing something that they enjoy you know it's almost like uh in healthcare we started this movement called joy in work and the reason was that uh in in at least in healthcare organizations there was an over emphasis on getting things done uh and not remembering the people the providers of the service that that needed support for themselves so i think trying to find joy in work is probably quite uh critical for overall well-being and that's that's something that i i hope that every employer would think about you well that concludes our event and i really would like to thank all the presenters and we could hear all the passion uh in the room and before we close off um if i may go to andrew um for to close off the event andrew uh chairs the dni committee of uh british chamber elena thank you and thank you to all the panelists i thought that was a fantastic and really fascinating discussion so thank you to all um for for taking the time to talk to our members about this very important topic um for me some of the takeaways i took from the discussion um i think the difference between mental health mental illness is very interesting and very important for us all to be aware of and i think we've all got a role as as business operators in the singapore community um we all have a role in protecting our employees in in in really looking after employees um but it's also interesting that the healthcare industry is is highly involved and charities are also very involved and there's clearly some some very good resources out there that we can use um to to really support our employees during this period and also i thought it was fascinating to hear some of the best practice initiatives um that the companies operating here in singapore are following and doing to support their employees and mental health was an area that has been highlighted by our members um as an area people would like more help in addressing and raising awareness so i think hearing from from companies on practical tips how to how to support your employees during this time is is really important so thank you both to to draw dean and pwc for for really giving us that overview of what you're doing um this is an area that the the diversity and inclusion committee are very focused on um it is an area that has got a lot of um interest from our members and we feel is important to to carry on this journey really to to improve the um the understanding and the awareness um of this issue uh going forward so you will see more um more initiatives from the dni committee going forward um but on that note i'd like to say a huge thank you thank you first to all our expert panelists um it really came across that you serious you are experts in your field and very good tangible advice that you gave to our members so so thank you to our

AIB_pFuSfpQ,COVID-19: Singapore authorities on how the mental health of migrant workers is being looked after,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2020-08-06T11:32:40Z,How are the mental health needs of migrant workers living in Singapore's dormitories being looked after? MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak ...,uh so my question is about the number of uh recent suicide and attempted suicide incidents involving workers living in dormitories right um so my questions uh are what uh you know what is the mts assessment of the anxiety and unhappiness of workers especially those in more badly affected dorms and how had their welfare been looked after mentally and also whether is mental health increasingly an area that the mtf is looking into by formulating a more comprehensive plan to address these budding issues thank you thank you very much for the question we're indeed concerned about the fact that our migrant workers have been accommodated in in facilities uh under vetted regimes they have not been allowed to come out of the dormitories into the community freely and that prolonged period of isolation will obviously have potential adverse effects on any individual not just the micro workers but anyone who in fact has to be cooped up in isolation with very limited opportunities for social interaction so this is a concern for us the in inter-agency task force working with mom and various private stakeholders partners have in fact been looking at how to support the welfare of these migrant workers in a variety of different ways they've taken pains to help the migrant workers to celebrate holidays to make their stay within the lockdown dormitories as meaningful as is possible albeit within the the lockdown regime that they are in they've also offered help through a variety of ways with an opportunity for them to call in hotlines for help there are staff that come down and encourage workers to step forward if necessary for counselling so mental health has been a concern for that particular task force for quite a while ever since they started work in the dormitories we continue to work on this piece and they have the task force has a work group looking very specifically at mental health issues and they have involved various partners across many domains including counselors social workers psychiatrists psychologists to see how to better improve the support that can be provided to men uh to migrant workers in this regard uh the uh we are aware also of incidence of self-harm or attempted self-harm through suicide in some of the individuals in the dormitories this is a cause of concern and task force continues to look at it to see how to reach out to support migrant workers who have a needs uh uh that have to be addressed in this regard uh and they're looking at ways to to reach out and support them further uh this continues to be a work in progress so i i do not pretend that that work is completed that we have a very comprehensive system of support but the task force is committed to making sure that the mental health needs of the migrant workers uh are looked into supported not just now but there is a sustainable framework that would continue in the dormitories even after the outbreak is comes under control within the dormitories ,True,True,True,True

h2JWw3I8XTs,Students Answer Tough Questions About Mental Health,UCKfxN9DXLUDvGnAt59RF9rQ,Tropic Monsters TV,2021-05-12T10:00:32Z,"The best way to remove the Stigma of Mental Health is to talk more about it! These students say it best! ☺️ You are not alone, if you want to speak more about ...",hello everybody so today we are here at republic poly where we are going to ask students some questions regarding a very serious topic mental health so mental health is a topic that people often shun away from as it is look to being a very touchy and sensitive topic however today we are here to show people that hey it is okay to talk about mental health and in fact we should talk more about it so this video is in collaboration with imah republic poly and is supported by ncss under the beyond the label project all right let's get on with this interview let's go what is probably very big i don't know where to start so actually today i'll be asking you guys some questions regarding mental health in singapore just answer them in the best of your ability like there's no right or wrong answers first off what course are you doing at rpe currently we are in the diploma of health management and promotion all right we are in diploma in business it's about science yes for science all of us i'm from dhmp i'm also from dhmp i'm also from dhmp right so the first question i want to ask is what is mental health to you guys and what are some of your thoughts about it for me mental health i think it's an umbrella term so it can stretch out to emotional psychological and my thoughts about it is just a simple phrase is very very underappreciated what many people don't know is that everything around them the environment physical and all that work school family it actually affects your mental health the question of mental health is a very broad topic you know health we often think about physical health and we throw aside mental health think mental health is about your well-being also at the same time it might be from since you were born or developed i think it's just like our brain's response to whatever happens around us maybe share with us how keeping up with your health and fitness relate to mental health that's like a scientific standpoint when you exercise you'll feel like endorphins and happy hormones will all go up and then at the same time your cortisol level will go down which is your stress from a more social standpoint you get to work off your friends or you get to work out alone with like music that you like you know it makes you feel bumbler have you or would you talk to someone regarding your mental health needs do you feel that it is a topic difficult to bring up probably won't speak to anyone about my own mental health because i feel like they won't be able to empathize and understand from where i'm coming from there's definitely a stigma against mental health sort of like oh if you have depression or something similar to that extent not as many people are as kind of caring as if like if you broke a leg i think mental health should be discussed with your friends your close friends and of course you should know who you're talking to because some people might just laugh at you but some people might be the best help you can get in your life it's a very intimate subject i would only bring out something about mental health to like my close friends or like my partner it's hard to share about my dark thoughts and all that you should really seek help if let's say you can't afford to see a counselor or you don't trust counsellors right you can just go to your closest friends or if you're close with your family that's even better some people would rather keep things to themselves because they are afraid of being judged or being made fun of i should rather not close my information with you if you're not comfortable because it will affect both our relationships so next question i'd like to ask is would you be a friend or remain as a friend or even date somebody who has a mental health concern or condition i don't mind actually i'm looking for one oh okay i will go to the extent of being a friend first understanding his or her feelings and their mental state before proceeding to dating them i will be your friend i'll remain as a friend i'll even date someone who's diagnosed with mental health issues they're still humans after all and i believe they're capable of getting better i think this question is also in line to whether i would be friends with someone who is like physically disabled i feel like it's the same thing just that one we can see one we cannot see her it's really a test for your relationship if you can really like handle someone else's feelings and communicate with them i think for me i don't really care much because i mean you don't pick to have mental health as long as i'm okay with my partner and my partners okay with me then i believe that kind of abuse our relationship everyone is flawed in their own way you know mental health should be more receiving to them in fact so next one i would like to ask is what do you think are some signs that may prompt you to pay more attention to a friend like perhaps some signs that may indicate they need some help regarding their mental health attitude towards you or maybe they can be a little bit more aggressive hostile or sometimes they'll just shut themselves up when people get surprisingly a bit too happy every day so like i think this has been brought up by the death of robin williams and all that some people may be suffering from manic depression they might feel extremely happy and high today so that's actually something to look out like people use jokes as a coping mechanism so you should really pay attention in small details frequent mood swings as well as the fact that i guess if something tragic happened to them a lot of family member someone they know well i think it's definitely good to check up with them someone changes their lifestyle or their personalities maybe when they have like a loss of appetite when like my friends actually start to like self-harm or like they talk about very negative stuff like constantly or have like suicidal thoughts then i'll know that they are in distress those friends that i hang out with and one day they like then they don't wish to come out that shows me a sign of them social isolating themselves when i see my friends doing activities that they usually don't do and they do it like very frequently over that period of time adding on to that how would you react if let's say a friend comes up to you guys and reached out to you guys let's say i'm your friend and one day i came to you and i say like hey i think you know recently i've been having some mental health conditions i can't take it anymore and i think my whole world is falling apart so maybe share with us how would you react to that i'll just say i'm so sorry you've been feeling like that i'm always here for you regardless of the time just give me a call i'll always pick up and listen to you don't ever think that you're a burden to me because i don't want you to suffer in silence because i know as well if the roles are reversed he'll do the same so i'm always here for you as a friend i won't like disturb you or i won't criticize your thinking because i know that this thing is a real thing i will personally go with you to the specialist and be there for you if you need me they may not open to whoever they want to so maybe they trust you that much to actually share their things with you maybe referring them to a therapist and i try to guide them along in this tough period of their life i'll ask if they are comfortable enough to share their own issues with me and i also promise that i'll keep this private if they wish to and i'll respect whatever they have to see so you shouldn't say that you understand how they are feeling we mostly don't i think it's best to just be a listening ear to them i think it's best to be there for your friend and listen to his troubles for me as a friend i provide them with the support when they need i was asked them like would they rather have me to help them solve the issue or would they let me be there listening here because i'd rather see how they want me to approach it rather than i assume what's the correct way to them that i'm interested in listening to them and also try to understand their situation just be there for them like be their listening ear instead of like throwing their one side on the other hand do you know what are some of the things that you should not say to someone who reached out to you with their mental health condition and one thing that you should not see is like oh just get over yourself or like not that bad because you really don't understand what they're truly going through oh don't think that way you don't have to think so much you'll be okay you should avoid saying like be independent or why are you so weak yeah same life being true that we fall uh stop playing around and this thing doesn't exist like you it's just inside your mind i think we should avoid uh words such as like sensitive someone out there has it way worse than you because like you're just invalidating their feelings everybody's feelings is valid no matter how petty is no matter how small or big it is don't say suck it up this is life telling them you are fine and everything will be okay you're able to handle it it's nothing not not a big deal you shouldn't tell them that they need time to relax let them have their own time but more instead to ask them out and join time with you if they reaching out to you that means that they're becoming very vulnerable and and saying that it's nothing would maybe affect their mental health even more it's just a face that they are going through it is normal it's cause it's not like do you know any places where people can reach out to when they need help regarding their mental health conditions the only place that i know as of now is imh yeah also apply for like a rp counselor can book a session for them yeah or you can ask your mentor for help then they will go through the steps behind that or you can go through your poly clinic local quality and ask for psychiatrists not really sure but you think there's like a helpline i'm not sure what's the number but then i think they offer some help we have a chatbot that also helps with counseling so if you're not very comfortable with meeting counselors face to face you can text them yeah and it's not a bot like it's an actual person or like if they are not really open there's actually an email or a chat where you can talk to an online mistake i'm vaguely aware that this uh there's a hotline the suicide hotline in singapore i don't know the number of the top my head but i know if you google it you'll show up for sure or they can call the image hotline or something like that in conclusion how do you think we can lift the stigma of mental health in singapore do you think more people should talk about it yeah definitely because the more you talk about it it's the more normal it is i think the key thing is to make exposure for you because when we talk about other health issues everybody knows how to tag and all that but maybe the society is not so exposed to things that we don't see that people are suffering with always listen with an open heart open mind and never judge i think people need to know more about mental health and what it really concerns they need to find within themselves you know the acceptance to be able to accept people for whatever issues that they might have to fellow singaporeans because now currently in our studies mental health is actually not something to be judged of just because you have mental health gives the person some time and maybe if it is really severe they can actually go and seek a professional help but take it step by step and not rush them we should normalize mental health because like everyone is going through rough times so the least we can do is be there for them and like understand the situation even though we can't give them advice we should open up so that we can share with each other advice and give each other some motivations yeah okay thank you guys for your responses they are really very good i'm sure a lot of people are listening to your advice it will benefit them a lot okay yeah thank you all right that's it we are done with the interviews hey i just want to say if you think you have mental health needs or know someone who does please reach out to somebody about it i just want to let you know that you are not alone we have included several links as well as help lines in the description where you can reach out to for assistance don't be afraid to all right there is help available i want to do a big special thanks to imh republic poly sos ncss for this collaboration also if you want to know more information about mental health more links are provided in the description alright that's it for us ciao first pmtv out boom [Music] okay [Applause] [Music] you ,False,False,True,False
mdX61H4Rsnw,Inside Tan Tock Seng Hospital&#39;s Fight Against The COVID-19 Pandemic,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2020-09-13T16:46:52Z,Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) are ground zero for the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore. (Update: On ...,[Music] more than 26 million infected around the world hundreds of thousands have died that's a world war type of scenario world war casualty figures the first case of covet 19 emerges in uhan china in november 2019. in january 2020 singapore confirms its first case of the novel coronavirus the fight against what will become a global pandemic is about to get tougher and last much longer than healthcare workers can even imagine overnight we saw three times more singaporeans coming to our screening center my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited wart we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases i didn't sleep that day how do i feel one word sums it up tired tantoxing hospital is one of singapore's largest multidisciplinary hospitals next door under the sea management is the national center for infectious diseases which officially opened its doors just four months before the biggest public health crisis in the recent history of the city-state over the course of eight months in 2020 both will screen a total of more than 35 000 people for covet 19 and award thousands of infected cases almost every single staff member will be pulled into the war on the virus and it starts like this on the 30th of december there was reports from china that there were clusters of atypical pneumonia happening in muhan and the cost of it is unknown that signals that there could be something unusual happening and it's something that we need to watch closely for dr angela chao heads the department of clinical epidemiology at ncid one of its tasks is to look out for data on infectious disease trends around the world so every day they were monitoring for diseases very closely and receiving influenza and it also tells you where the countries the areas where there are active transmission or even users three days after the news from china singapore begins to screen all inbound travelers from uhan although the cause of the outbreak there is still unclear ttsh and ncid go into full outbreak mode it was never in any point in time in doubt in our mind that it would spare singapore professor leo eason was at the forefront of singapore's fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in the early 2000s which claimed 33 lives two of them were her colleagues at ttsh a very painful experience taught us that our systems need to be ready in the sas aftermath the hospital developed a comprehensive outbreak playbook every staff is assigned a role to play in event of an outbreak and hospital-wide drills are conducted at least once a year planning is an essential part of our state of readiness it makes an outbreak a known unknown realistically speaking dr ang hao who joined the hospital shortly before the sars outbreak now leads its emergency department which is singapore's largest and busiest emergency department has a long established history of running screening for outbreaks during peacetime we already screened partners yellow fever monkey pop ebola plague lassa fever and now kovid 19 this is new working closely with dr ang is dr charmaine manawas who develops the instructions for healthcare staff to screen patients there was a particular period where we had to screen for certain provinces in china so of course everyone isn't versed on where the provinces are so that's why they put the map here once we pick up a travel to these certain countries than they are triage to the fever area four days after screening begins ncid opens its first outbreak award to isolate suspect patients margaret soon is its nursing director with almost 30 years of experience the initial cases definitely is with a lot of anxiety because we know very little we also could tell the staff very little it's a tense period on january 8 chinese officials identify a new coronavirus that's related to sars and mers as the cause of the epidemic a day later its genome is made public scientists in singapore begin their race to develop a test kit among them is a team comprising staff from ttsh and the agency for science technology and research so when the first case arrived we could use our own in-house detection kits to be able to make the diagnosis in china the virus has spread from wuhan to other parts of the hubei province people begin to die from the infection and medical workers are contracting the disease in the line of duty in singapore ttsh isn't taking chances with the safety of its staff its infection control team ensures that everyone from doctors to cleaners is properly trained and equipped to protect themselves [Music] these strict protocols have been meticulously developed over the years by dr brenda aung another sars veteran the role of infection control to limit the spread between patients and also to try and prevent transmission to healthcare workers even contractors are mask fitted [Music] over the rest of january cases emerge elsewhere around asia on january 23rd the same day the chinese government put cities in hupei under lockdown singapore confirms its first case a 66 year old chinese national from uhan who is awarded at the singapore general hospital the day after case number two is confirmed this time at ncid it was actually a tourist from ohan so of course she couldn't quite remember where she's been what she's done finding out where she'd been and who she'd met is the job of dr chao's team in the weeks to come the role of thorough contact tracing will become even more apparent as more is learned about when and how infected persons transmit the virus from the point when they are symptomatic we look back one incubation period so 14 days the history can go back like two three weeks a lot of time to slowly joke their memories to recall where did you go with your daughter you know here i think who have rather active social life that is definitely good it's just it's a bit more challenging when you're trying to do the contact racing um to know exactly where are the places that you went to and what times you went as more close contacts of infected patients are identified the screening load at the emergency department increases ttsh decides to activate the dedicated infectious disease screening center ncid it was a very busy chinese new year for a lot of people not because we were going around celebrating furniture had to be moved in computers had to be set up we actually managed to cut two days off the activation time more nurses are also needed to triage and swap patients we have to draw nurses from various areas including nurses from operating theaters the clinics our nurse educators some of them volunteered actually the whole kang phong is involved so this is my night shift let's go and have a look a nurse at the cardiology department is one of the volunteers we practice and we do the swap on each other i tell you you won't think about do it again so far all confirmed cases here have been travellers from china singapore will restrict entry to all new travelers who've been to mainland china in the last 14 days regardless of nationality but on february 4th the inevitable happens a cluster of infections emerges from a chinese medical hall serving tourists from china the four cases signal the start of communities spread in singapore it also sparks a change in the definition of a suspect case to anyone with recent close contact with travelers from china taxi drivers tour bus drivers people who worked in tourist attractions or hotels and airports casinos they were all flooding in today it was three times more than what we saw the day before the task of making sure they stay ahead of this massive search and demand falls to this place [Music] welcome to the command center of tandoxing hospital this is where we have visibility of the entire operations industry hospital and the national center for infectious diseases this military-inspired command and control center is the first of its kind in a local healthcare facility it's overseen by dr jamie lim the hospital's chief operating officer the screen gives us visibility of the supplies that we have at the screening center how many patients do we have at that point in time we use colors to depict status when it crosses a certain threshold it either turns yellow amber and then the next threshold will be great we don't want to be reactive but we want to be ahead of the signs and sickness on that pivotal night of february 4th c3 system triggered an alarm in a span of 24 hours we open up an additional five words we had to open 100 bids within a day that was really stressful there's just a lot of coordination to making sure that the medications are there lyndon is there but when the bits fill up quickly with suspect cases who present as clinically well the team proposes a new strategy [Music] ncid clinical director sean vasu keeps the health ministry updated regularly we proposed to the ministry a swap and send home strategy where patients who do not in hospital care would receive that diagnostic test an adequate amount of medical leave to go home and self-isolate to the results come out within the next 8-24 hours at home these patients are closely monitored by the surveillance team to see if they develop symptoms those who test positive are brought in straight away by ambulance for admission to ncid we have also trained up our data analysts our biostatisticians pathologists our psychologists they were helping us with phone surveillance soon as the patient load increases as many as 50 staff are roped in to call more than 500 people a day as part of surveillance and contact tracing efforts another team working round the clock in the background is the department of laboratory medicine led by dr patha day we very quickly had to go to 24 7 operation from normal office hours right now i'm labeling the samples that we will be extracting for the next round of extraction they are another crucial link in the chain racing to provide timely confirmation of whether a suspected case has been infected or not even a negative result enables the doctors and nurses to discharge patients and free up beds for the new incoming suspect and confirmed cases almost every half an hour there will be samples coming in my busiest night throughout the night from 8 30 to the next morning 8 30 i didn't even have time to rest it was continuous running of samples [Music] the team uses the test kit developed by scientists from ttsh and a star made available to hospitals on february 6th and it comes none too soon [Music] the next day singapore raises its disease outbreak response system condition to orange alert level the disease spreads easily among people but is contained and not widespread visitors to hospitals will now have to fill in declaration forms and have the temperature taken staff are redeployed here from other departments to make this possible and as a safety measure the hospital cuts down on elective surgeries and closes some clinics i came from a acupuncture clinic a business office health department some staff like dietetic technician collis yap now work twelve hour shifts instead of normal working hours at fps is very draining my family members always remind me why i do this and why is it important thank you very much for coming on a saturday other medical staff are directed to support the screening center and outbreak warts obviously we needed more manpower the whole hospital had to cut down and leave and off days in fact i was planning for my honeymoon but i got cancelled and i came back to ncid to care for my patients but on social media accounts are shared of ambulance drivers and nurses being shunned on public transport and in public areas this paranoia however triggers the unexpected an overwhelming flood of love and encouragement for healthcare workers so we've received a lot of stuff from kids and from the public so this one is from little footprints preschool um look they have the babies uh these are the babies footprints and then the older kids wrote us letters so it's very heartwarming [Music] patients too express their gratitude mrs jung spent most of her 18 days in ncid under intensive care [Music] oh [Music] meanwhile the virus continues to spread in the community and new clusters emerge but the infection rate remains low compared to countries like italy and to some it looks like life could soon return to normal in singapore i suppose to the public that may seem like a loud period but that that silence was very worrying for us [Music] countries other than china go into lockdown and who declares covet 19 a pandemic [Music] we knew that it was a matter of time before we see the second wave we didn't know how big the second wave was going to be so we made a decision with the ministry to set up a tentach just outside the screening center if ever there is an overflow of patients coming in for screening the lab is also trying to ramp up its capacity from 500 to 800 tests a day with more staff and equipment but its efforts are hampered by a global shortage of reagents on march 21st singapore reports its first covet 19 deaths the icu team is no stranger to dealing with mortality but handling death from covet 19 is different what usa is outside the ico world what we see is the reality and the sickle cell patient unfortunately we do lost patients despite every effort we put they still pass on that was very very difficult for the families because none of them could come and see and you had to tell them over the phone what was happening and that your father or mother brother sister was was likely going to die you can imagine this is my love once i would actually want to hold their hand to see a proper go by we do have a relative actually funded during the video call we just feel a bit helpless yeah but we try our best to do what we can to help the patient and the family everybody does that yeah in the icu well spain is now emerging as a new hotspot for covet 19. by march 22nd the death toll worldwide from covet 19 is more than 11 000 and in singapore infection numbers have crept back up mainly from imported cases for the first time ever singapore closes its borders to tourists and short-term visitors the next day dr jamie lim's fears come true we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases we actually had to open tentach until 3 a.m at night with a lot of patients having to wait a little bit longer so that was a struggle i i didn't sleep that day this search in cases is due mainly to students and travelers returning home from countries going into lockdown what's it why suddenly so many patrons yeah then oh yeah we just chong mao we are 80 people if there's a job to do then we just do it ncid immediately enacts its plan to expand the number of bits in the outbreak wards so let's move to 5f okay we will go down to level 2 the capacity here at baseline is 330 bits we can expand the capacity to 586. the rooms in this building are designed in such a way that we can double stack or in some rooms triple stack but many of the bits are also being taken up by infected patients who are recovering well and in the clinical team's view can be cared for outside the hospital setting at the national level the decision is made [Music] there was a turning point in outbreak in terms of our isolation strategy this is where clinical data informs policy we knew that clinical presentation certain demographics about the patient their age and their medical history which means that we can now have younger coveted 19 cases being taken care of in the isolation facilities and most of them would recover without significant complications over a month three more community isolation facilities are set up all these are all like kind of draw plans already increase flexible it may not be already in your drawer plan but you must have a system where it is flexible enough so that it becomes situation based and we can still respond effectively on march 29th a porter who transports patients in ncid is confirmed to have contracted covet 19. an outbreak within its walls would be any hospital's nightmare it happened to ttsh during sars when some 100 staff visitors and patients were infected following exposure to the virus in its warts but this time nearly 20 years later the hospital came prepared to the fight and despite the more infectious nature of covet 19 the stringent measures from personal protection protocols to staff surveillance have prevented disease transmission so far now i can do it again everyone who enters into ncrd wears this tech all patients and staff within ncid wear a real-time tracking device which allows the staff surveillance team to quickly trace people who are in contact with the porter you can just open up all of them so you can actually see all of them have been in contact with every other people it provides granular level of visibility of where each patient is and where each staff is so this is the floor plan it shows this portal's movement history on this date the information helps ncid to identify staff at risk of contracting the virus and to quarantine them to stem a potential hospital cluster you could say this is big brother watching you but just say there's a friendly father hospital observing people again for staff a lot of safety happens as of september 13th 10 staff from ttsh and ncid have contracted covet 19 but none in the course of their work but elsewhere in singapore a time bomb is about to go off the coronavirus has been quietly spreading among migrant workers this was the dormitory with the bangladeshi workers dayden before he tested positive for the virus meanwhile though nowhere at the levels of countries like the us or italy the number of unlinked community cases has crept up on april 3rd prime minister lee sien long announces that singapore will go into circuit breaker mode closing schools and many workplaces we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period because this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus we do not want to wait for a situation where the cases rise sharply and then we get overwhelmed the streets of singapore have never been quieter but the scene at ttsh is very different [Music] each day up to 300 migrant workers come here to be screened the basic difference is that the migrant workers are unable to self-isolate because they live in a dorm we will have to hold them until the swab results are out if the patient is negative then they have to be transferred to a clean dorm if the swab results are positive then they may be admitted or they may be transferred to isolation facility on april 20th singapore sees 1400 new cases of covet 19 the highest numbers so far in a single day the majority of them are migrant workers i remember coming to work and overnight my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited what because we have to increase our capacity just to cope with this increase of infection cases it was then that we saw some of the most sick patients it was a emotional period for me personally because the patients that we see are usually fit young construction workers they had to be hospitalized for quite some time [Music] only i think about my family plus how to say my life i can i can continue my life i also very very my inside very question mark really daily new cases of covet 19 remain high throughout april and ncid warts are almost fully occupied again triggering its plan to expand into ttsh my name is nadia i'm an assistantness creation here in sandboxing and i'm a nurse working in the kobit award this is the first time when we have both covet patients and business as usual patients in the same building the first thing that we have to do is to make sure that the pathways are segregated that includes mapping of the rules and locking down the leaf or the kobe pathway so these are the two areas that is actually designated to nurse our kovid patients so let's go six general awards there are converted into outbreak wards one what is actually allocated to be the clean area the first shift is like you go in right it's not even five minutes you are like wet everywhere and then you feel like so stuffy and then you have this like fainting spells like you cannot breathe so well every cubicle there will be three big exhaust fans this actually to create negative pressure because the cubicle doesn't have an extra glass doors or an extra room finally after eight weeks of circuit breaker the rate of infection starts to slow with the reduced covet 19 patient load the additional outbreak warts at ttsh are no longer needed but for one department there is no easing up in fact our workload on microbiology for pcr has gone up a lot more it's doubled to cope the department hires additional staff and acquires new equipment that simplifies the testing process there's people who need to be cleared to go back to work like school teachers goods delivery drivers essential goods like groceries and so on the emphasis has shifted to screening which is a good thing which is part of reopening covid19 will eventually become the new normal respiratory virus that we will test for every year just as swine flu h1n1 on july 14th the lab makes a mistake a confirmed case of covet 19 has been found to be wrongly diagnosed due to a mix-up of test samples at the tantoxin hospital's laboratory to ensure that a mistake like this doesn't happen again the lab has automated its patient registration process i've got a thousand specimens to process even if we tell them take your time do they know there are patients waiting at the end of this and they want to do their best so we've had to try and manage all of that the psychological as well as the physical demands while the hospital still isn't going back to 100 business as usual it has managed to resume some elective surgeries and open certain clinics other inpatient warts have also continued to run all this while compared to sars when ttsh was designated the central treatment hospital enclosed to all non-sars patients in an outbreak people still come in with a heart attack people still break their leg and they need treatment emergency surgeries will still carry on we run essentially two hospitals tantoxin as the business as usual and ncid as the outbreak center with the same team of doctors nurses and administrators can you just page for me if there is any problem i will be in the office okay um nipping did not really reduce the illness patient ratio either at bau side and also at ncid side we deliberate plan for the ratio to be at one is to four especially because we think that adequate stuffing is important for both patient and staff safety but the months-long fight has taken a mental and emotional toll on staff and the war with covet 19 is a long way from over there's one day my husband actually come back from work having high fever i'm not scared for myself i really scared for my love once and what i don't want is because of me he got covered there is actually something really made me emotional at that period i realized that running the screening center takes a lot of effort and each of the different family groups contribute so much um [Music] yeah it's been tiring this one sorry [Music] everybody has been pulling together responding to this terrible pandemic you do a fantastic job not just during the pandemic you do a fantastic job all day every day i'm tremendously proud of my colleagues they are marvellous they are kind-hearted and you know they they really give the best in their care i think so far singapore has coped reasonably well and that again is the work of the entire healthcare system the ability to respond to the challenge however i think we shouldn't be complacent because i think the road ahead is still long and windy you ,True,True,False,False
MUQs6chbiGc,"COVID-19: Singapore healthcare workers had increased mental preparedness after SARS, says expert",UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2020-04-14T18:10:09Z,New research has found that healthcare workers dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore are experiencing lower levels of anxiety and psychological ...,new research has found that health care workers dealing with the Cova 19 pandemic in Singapore are experiencing lower levels of anxiety in psychological distress when compared with previous outbreaks that could be due to increased mental preparedness following SARS for a closer look we're joined by associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma in the NUS a young rule in School of Medicine and by sociology professor Pauline strong from the Singapore Management University thank you both for joining us I will come to you first a pleasure Vijay how much correlation is there actually between increased mental preparedness and stringent infection control measures versus anxiety and psychological distress levels among healthcare workers you know it started from the South period when in 2003 we were attacked by us there were about 238 individuals which got infection and surprisingly 97 which makes about 41 percent of them were healthcare workers and the mortality at that time was 14 percent so there was a lesson to us and that prompted us that we should be prepared that something like this can hit us again so in the car you know I take it back like this that probably we were anticipating there's something like kovat 19 we'll be coming back again so since 2003 we had implemented an Hospital very strict infection control measures they were training programs for masks hand-washing and they were very frequently done almost like six monthly everybody has to undergo that kind of training so that prepared us so what happened the as soon as we got this Cove in 1900 at least our all health care workers they were immediately mentally prepared that we can jump into this war field and then we can battle it out definitely so this was actually this showed that we were mentally prepared now one important thing in this fighting you know such an outbreak like covert 19 is that we should have knowledge and we should have confidence so we were prepared with the knowledge because Hospital had prepared you know education programs there was a transparency we were updated on a daily basis what was the condition of it 19 how old 19 gets infected how people get infected how to prevent yourself from getting infected all these things they were in place so that prepared from knowledge point of view and confidence we were trained strongly and for a very long period how to fight infections how to be clean how to prepare ourselves for this infection probably that prepared us to fight this battle so we were both strong in another confidence as well as mentally preparedness from our experience so professors Vijay saying that then how is the situation here in Singapore compared with other parts of the world that are also struggling and you know dealing with cover 19 so I can talk about the healthcare workers so I I told you about the about a Singapore story but what happened outside there are very very few studies which are available on healthcare workers what is psychological impact of this illness whatever we have we have got a couple of studies one came up from Italy one came up from China and it was seen that almost all work health care workers they were having some kind of psychological impact and it was at least moderate in severity you know it is big it's to be taken in account that both these countries Italy as well as China they were massively hit the the you know the magnitude of impact of covenant infection was immense the Italian studies showed that about 10% of those who got the infection they were actually health care workers so this was such a heavy toll they will definitely be having much more psychological anxiety stress depression and all kind of emotional reactions which was seen in media you know from Italy and China they were probably reflection of the magnitude of the scale of this event and we know we know it that Europe and best they were never prepared for such kind of attacks they never have suffered these kind of attacks its Asia Africa which have been going through all these attacks in between you know the epidemics they keep coming so we were definitely mentally as well as physically as well as from resources point of view are definitely better prepared and professors drawn we're one week into the circuit breaker now and already some tightened measures have been kicked in as a result of some who've been so testing boundaries if you like based on what you've observed so far are people behaving in in a way that's sort of expected during a time like this office let me thank all our healthcare workers I think that they really deserve our admiration and praise and for keeping things in control so with regards to the general public right I think we had the opposite right Vijay said that the health care workers the professionals were prepared for for the next infectious disease you know attack and therefore when Kovac came they were already the lay public on the other hand we've been so safe in Singapore we have been so used to having you know a very peaceful life so this came as a big shock to us right and when the measures stepped in that we had to vary our normal everyday life it took the Singaporeans along the time to get used to it because I just don't understand at one lever you know that this disease is so infectious and at another lever it is also difficult to break from norm habits because we we have lived in the very very densely packed society we're used to rubbing you know elbows with each other so therefore if I'm not touching you that's already the social distance in my mind right so what more there's 1 meter 2 meter thing so I think we had to learn and I think the way Flender had laid out you know the rules as they're lay it on was quite remarkable it demonstrated to me and made me realize that it was a step by step calibrator approach and in every stance you know government had trust the Singaporeans you know to to abide by the boundaries and when we failed then most stringent rules had to be stepped in had to be Roden because we had to protect the vulnerable so I think that at the end of the day most Singaporeans okay obviously when you go out to the streets now it's very empty people are law-abiding no one is crowding you out in the supermarket or in the hawker centres and we're trying our best to to be good citizens and to do our part we hear of you know those who are you know who break the rules because for whatever reason but most of them I think most cases because they don't understand but by and large I think the community has pulled together this is certainly one of the better places to be in at this time in this global crisis I think all of us who live in Singapore are very grateful that we are here so or in oh I think we're doing what we're doing out our best we can do better and I'm sure in the weeks to come we will demonstrate that we will be able to do better okay well thank you both for speaking to us this evening associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma from the NUS young Newland school of medicine and sociology professor Pauline stron from the Singapore Management University ,True,True,True,True

This is according to workers and aid groups CNA ...",prolonged isolation with a lack of clarity is taking a toll on the mental health of migrant workers here that's according to workers and aid groups we spoke with who say it's exacerbating anxiety among workers who are already worried about income and employment a bit amid the pandemic isabel limb with more abdul qader used to stay at a dormitory in mcpherson but at the end of april he was moved to a hotel in novina where he says he remained in quarantine for three months despite testing negative for covet 19 twice it's very fast that if you are in jail and you don't know why why you are in jail that makes the thing much worse and do know why you are in quarantine and how long you have to stay in quarantine when you can go back to the dormitory finally you can go back to the work abdul managed to get through the quarantine by taking online classes and staying connected with friends and family but some workers may not be faring as well charity health serve says it saw a rise in anxiety cases among workers who had to stay in isolation facilities for prolonged periods of time when they were some negative that was where there was a bit of a gray area of what do we do with them and then in turn that led to a lot of them being left in these isolation facilities for a prolonged period of time because some of these facilities they weren't allowed to even crack open the window just to have a breath of fresh air they couldn't open the doors or step out of the doors and it's not just the feeling of being left alone that's weighing on their mental health the stress and anxiety of course is due to loss of income due to the financial burdens on their families another thing with the with the long period of time of the lockdown is also that um the anxiety caused by uh the lack of clarity the lack of information about what is going to happen to me next when can i get back to work over the past two weeks the police have responded to a string of incidents in dormitories where workers who were apprehended appear to have attempted suicide healthserve says it has seen a tripling of cases of suicidal ideation among its clients in the same period it has counseled over 700 workers since april another group the migrant worker centre provides assistance through its helpline it's a network of 5 000 worker ambassadors also ring their countrymen to provide emotional support to workers including those in isolation facilities the manpower ministry advises workers not to put themselves in harm's way should they encounter problems with dormitories due to be cleared in the coming days more workers may be going back to familiar environments but they say what could really make a difference is returning to work i think everybody wants to go back to their world if you are alone people think too much about their past and while too many stops going on your head but if you are in work you actually keep forget these kind of things and move you forward ,True,True,True,True

Pandemic: Dr Tam Wai Jia shares with a WHO webinar audience the art and science behind a ...,we're going to move on to the next um portion of our webinar today where we're going to hear from yj tom who's the founder and ceo of kitesun global she's the deputy also the deputy lead of global health and community service at the national university of singapore uh singapore's recent outbreaks of covert 19 where more than 53 000 diagnoses were made and a total of over 300 000 migrant workers proved tremendously challenging in the area versus communication and community engagement uh let's join as she shares a glimpse of an innovative multi-modal approach to community engagement during the migrant worker outbreak in singapore harnessing the power of art and storytelling she illustrates how i created and participatory approach can catalyze agency fuel resilience and inspire positive change in empowered communities so what yeah thank you and welcome all right so hello everyone my name is yja and today i will be sharing a creative approach to rcce in an outbreak just as mindy has had introduced so just to start off i'm just going to prepare all of you that today's sharing is going to be a little personal as well but bear with me because i will bring this to an ending point now the question i mean whenever someone starts a presentation we always tell other people about who we are but today i think the question i like to reverse it to become who am i and what is my place in this outbreak i'm sure many of you have been intensely involved in the kovite 19 outbreak and the question i'd like for all of us to consider as i continue with the slides are who am i and what is my place in this outbreak and how did i get here now who i am for start um well i started to coordinate the rcc efforts in singapore and leading student engagement efforts in the outbreak but i did not start off here at the beginning i was a medical educator and i tried as far as possible not to get involved in the outbreak because although i was i graduated as a medical doctor i had been out of clinical practice for seven years however while i was teaching my students in an elective i had called health and humanity to help to rekindle the art of humanity back into medicine i started conducting these participatory kite zone workshops with them and as they started to rediscover their dreams in themselves i had the revolutionary experience of this rediscovering the dreams that i had buried myself so there was an external crisis of 53 thousand migrant workers in singapore being infected with cobit 19. however inside of me there was also an internal crisis and what led to the participatory success of the rcce efforts i think was the connection between the crisis i had in me and the crisis that was going out of me singapore was known at first for keeping our uh you know keeping the outbreak very well contained however by april it was very evident that things were going out of hand and so there was a turning point not only in the society you know in the government policy making level but i think many healthcare workers experienced the turning point because for one everybody knew in their hearts that while our country relied heavily on foreign workers and migrant workers to construct and to clean and to maintain this beautiful immaculate country that runs on efficiency we suddenly realize that the invisible people behind these walls were not so invisible anymore and so came the decision where everybody had to make do we want to be involved or not and for myself having a husband who had a liver transplant before and who was immunocompromised i took a long time to decide whether i wanted to go back to the front lines when they started calling um you know doctors back to the front lines to help but what happened was a decision that i made internally because deep down inside there was a dream and so there in me all the nurses were laughing at me that after seven years of not being in clinical practice my first worry back into clinical work was in full-blown ppe so i started off like everybody else doing swaps for migrant workers but it soon became apparent that as we swapped patient after patient person of the person that there was a huge sense of development in the community now there were migrant workers from you know different countries from bangladesh from india from um from thailand all over the world and yet there was very little that was communicated with them at the start especially when the outbreak was acute and fresh at the beginning and there was as well but all of you may know a sense of chaos but i remember what happened was my mentor was overseeing several of the community isolation facilities professor malcolm he texted me one morning and said why jia you're good at drawing aren't you can you do me a health booklet for all the migrant workers coming in and at that time when i he gave me this request i kind of scoffed at it i thought to myself you know i'm a public health person why is my mentor asking me to draw stuff for for migrant workers and i soon realized how important this work was and i put my heart and and effort into it and very soon the students that you had seen in the earlier slide they became a powerful powerful force behind these this movement which i'll show you in a little while and so what started off as just an idea um became articulated to me by professor dale fisher who soon became a mentor after he had seen those cartoons i had to i had to really clarify myself when he first heard about me and saw the booklets he said are you the cartoonist and i said yes i am but um i would love to know more about how all this fits into the big picture and he very quickly showed me the pillars of an outbreak response and the importance of ircc and that's how i got involved so what we've developed over the months has become a full-blown multi-modal toolkit which i would love to share with you today it started off with just booklets but very soon it became posters and different types of engagement so these are the booklets that that you saw um my little my terrible scrolls had become um little cartoons that have been run past migrant workers you know we we did kp surveys to find out what they really believed what they wanted to know we ran past um some of the cartoons and through through groups with different ethnicities to see if they would be offended and what was culturally sensitive or health literate with and what was health literate to them so my students did the amazing job of translating having them translated into eight different languages and so in the early part of the outbreak really the health institute although i work i do work in a health institution but because things were moving so fast and there were different levels of bureaucracy i relied on um the very organic structure of my my non-owned non-profit and with the volunteers there who are from different fields of work not just medical but from graphic design from art and they put all this together to become a series of health booklets for three different types of migrant workers one those who were housed in general geometries two those who were in swap isolation facilities those who had just been swapped and did not know whether the tests were positive or negative and last but not least um it was for migrant workers who were tested positive already so each of them had slightly different concerns and then um the booklets became posters because we thought you know while migrant workers are waiting in line what better way to you know put up visual posters that you know speak to them not only through the booklets but also in the um on the walls farewells near the atm machines etc and very soon of course we realized that digital engagement was just as important so we put together these booklets as well as posters on the website this is a the general website but when you go into it it's language specific so we really wanted to tailor it to migrant workers and of course throughout the way we did our best to get feedback from migrant workers to to hear what they thought so when you click on one of the um the men in whatever language it is it goes to a language specific page where you can find all the different resources that you need and then we also had to start partnering different kinds of stakeholders from different levels to disseminate this through soft copy now this then became a little bit more exciting because i started to realize that what really really moved people and what really helped to amplify these efforts was a personal face and so i remember going to one of the dormitories and sharing with them um you know i mean what's a chinese girl like me doing in like migrant worker dormitory where these are the men which i don't speak and yet during that time when i shared with them some of this information they shared with me that some of their friends they told me they said you know my brothers they are so scared of coming down to the medical poles out of their rooms because they think that if they're positive bad things will happen after that and we don't know what's going to happen and so what we did in response to that was we got a migrant walker himself who was isolated in a community isolation facility so he has been tested positive and if you can read the subtitles here he was telling his brothers about the amazing experience that he had while staying in the community isolation facility and this video of course was shared among the brothers and received good feedback so of course then you had the other challenge of having a medical post now filled with people which was a happy problem to have at that time rather than having nobody show up in the medical post so you can see how these different interactions come together and the two-way feedback is really really important so these face-to-face engagements were something that i really did my best to advocate for only because in our time and age of technology it is so easy just to rest on the fact that digital engagement is so much easier it's cost effective it's easy but the fact is many of our migrant workers come from societies that are extremely communal and this face-to-face contact is so important so some of the concerns that they had shared with me was only shared through these face-to-face engagements however short they were if they could be planned with especially with a translator or with a doctor from the native country who spoke their native tongue was so so powerful and so i called this campaign just casually at the start called socially distanced humanly connected because i really wanted to drive home the point that while we may be socially distanced there is so much that we can offer when our own personal stories and our personal humanity meet and collide in the same place so these were some activities that were created you see i don't i don't speak much of their language but using these um posters that i've done um front you know in tamil and back in bengali we would ask the workers to guess what was on the picture while showing them the words in the wrong language and then after the guest we would flip it over and show them the right language and get the migrant worker himself as you see here explaining what the poster was to his friends so it's a sense of empowerment a sense of autonomy and of course a sense of agency that we want to give them because ultimately while we can do all the risk communication that we want um the message that they share with one another is most powerful when it comes from them so these phase engagements um were amplified when we started doing reproducible training curriculus on the right on the left you see my other colleagues conducting this at different sites on the right is empowering uh migrant workers kind of a training video that we started to circulate now this is one of my favorite things and we're going to have a taste a little teaser of what um this is all about because you've heard me talk about kite song and my the ngo is called kite song but what what happened at the community isolation facility was really eye-opening to me because what you see here are bangladeshi migrant workers on the floor and all of them are putting their hearts into expressing their thoughts and aspirations and dreams during the covet 19 outbreak and what you see over here on the right side where where migrant workers holding the microphone is after watching the kite song video he was you know giving his brothers a rousing speech about what he had learned and how we all needed to overcome this time of adversity this is an example of one of the kites that a migrant walker showed me and this picture is the most poignant picture that if i could just keep one picture of what covet 19 this outbreak meant to me would be this because he showed this to me and said the little green tree that you see on the top is not a tree at all but his daughter and his daughter was the same age as my daughter and he said i drew my daughter for my dream kai because she'll be a year old this month and my dream is that she'll be a doctor because all the doctors i've met here have been so wonderful to me they always help us so i want her to help others too thank you for everything and through these messages and pictures that they're so powerfully penned down we received glimpses of what they were thinking and feeling and as they put up their kites on the walls of their isolation facility it was a message of empowerment and a message of mutual encouragement and this picture is particularly poignant to me because a kite which is a powerful symbol of freedom was made by this worker with a kite string made with barricade tape a symbol of quarantine so these are some of the subsequent workshops that we conducted and of course migrant workers are holding up their kites and at the end we we give them a health ambassador badge which you can see as the round white thing on there on the chest and we tell them that you know when you leave these isolation facilities back to your dormitories you are a health ambassador and you have the power to make a difference to your communities and so with that um my medical students came on board and they asked me you know how else could they help because they were not allowed to participate first hand in the outbreak at those isolation facilities and i said there's so much to do in terms of digital engagement so we came up with my brother sg and this was it started off us as you know a means to get out some health messaging maybe comics or whatever but these conflicts then grew into something different because the comics gave us a platform not just to you know share fun fold or share fun pictures or messages but rather give us a channel to really talk to the migrant workers find out what their concerns were how they expressed themselves and we realized very quickly that visual pictures meant and spoke so much to their communities and so these were different kinds of health messaging somewhat inspirational as you saw before and some were you know had important messages especially to to convey to them at key times especially when they were returning back to work for example this one stay vigilant now this one is one of my favorite slides so on this poster that you see on the left hand side the green poster it was created not by me or my team or my ngo but rather by the migrant workers themselves and on the right side where you see me and all the little pictures over there is our very first webinar called keep hope alive and it was co-hosted by myself a bengali doctor and a bengali speaking doctor and also three other bangladeshi workers and in fact in this particular webinar they were the ones who taught me how to use streamyard so they had set the whole thing up we had discussed what the title would be and our thoughts were rather their idea was to have you know regular sessions where we could invite expert panelists such as this you know like when we have when we have a webinar like this all over the world they wanted to do it for their own communities and so well i didn't want to invite like you know a superstar the first one without knowing you know how it would turn out so i did the experiment on myself and well it turned out interestingly because i wondered what would i actually talk about would they actually be interested in health messages and you know could i really pull this thing off with them and the amazing thing was all i shared was the story of kite song and i'm getting to that um i just want want you to hold your thought over there because as we share you know these different fancy campaigns and all that i realized the important thing was that personal connection with american workers and that sense of trust that needed to be built before powerful health messaging could be worked around so this um poster is actually for this sunday and you see over here it's uh that the chinese doctor um on the circle he's he stopped to go very long and he was he is a very prominent singaporean who founded one of the leading you know migrant worker ngos and now he has stepped down but the migrant workers were dying to have him on on their webinar so you know before when when we first started we were surprised at 14 000 uh migrant workers were listening in and they were watching the the video and it soon grew to 23 000 when we had professor dale fisher on board and then 30 000 when we had another bengali doctor on board so these are some of the um the other initiatives the mental health booklets that were done in response to the mental health crisis that was happening because of the extended isolation so again it's rcc effort efforts evolving and responding to this kind of two-way communication of what's happening on the ground and of course it gave us the opportunity to partner widely so that was in during the early parts of the outbreak nobody was doing any coordination of all the rcc efforts and through friendship through relationships i think this was how um all the different efforts from the different stakeholders were galvanized and it was through a very interesting platform it was actually through the comics so through that we are actually now galvanizing a local steering committee so as to strategize the way forward but it was interesting because when i look back it was the comics something very harmless something that you know didn't need to go through bureaucratic kind of corporate communications structure structural approval that one and galvanize a national community together so the long-term strategy really is to create a team of people that can respond um to relevant ministries above but also to ground needs and that is the important part that's what we hope to do moving forward more and more so as i shared this before um keep hope alive was that with the webinar we had done and this is the part where i hope all of us would just you know open our hearts and minds because we're going to do something a little creative here for the next segment i don't have a lot of time but i hope it will work and i hope that you will be blessed now when i first started out just keep hope alive um webinar program with with with the migrant workers i thought to myself maybe you know i'll just do what we did at the community isolation workshops we will just play the video and hope that it it pans out but very quickly just a few minutes into the conversation with the migrant workers on on facebook live i soon realized that there was such a common bond of humanity and i felt led to share with them why kitesam so they interviewed me as you know ceo of kite song but and so i shared with them that when i was 18 kai zong began when i lived with these girls who had been abused and abandoned and while i was there these girls had to be evicted out of their out of their home and i soon learned that this happened year after year after year because of the rising land costs and these girls had topped their classes and topped their schools and they had this boundless immeasurable joy which i could not describe and put my finger on and when i left nepal i left with such a heartache because i thought to myself surely there was more that we could do and i thought to myself perhaps painting a picture book might be able to raise funds for a permanent home for them and with that silly silly idea i shared this with migrant workers with that silly silly idea in a time of faithlessness but the book kite song because just one person believed in the idea and within three months more than a hundred thousand dollars was raised to build this prominent home for the girls and now these girls are grown um they have you know they've grown up into young women many of them are teachers one is a nurse and you can see in this picture they are um the same they are almost the same girls in nearly the same positions except that this is 10 years apart approximately 10 years apart and so as i showed this and i shared this with the migrant workers i shared that you know it doesn't matter how small or how big your dream is it matters that you believe in it and when i shared that you know just as a session to to trial to pilot you know i just thought you know we're just winging it suddenly a connection with me and i realized that this partnership with the bengali workers who had asked me to come on facebook live with them this risk that we took was a partnership with 60 000 migrant workers following this page and with that passed a channel of trust because there was vulnerability and there was humanity and with that about the movement and so i began my presentation today asking all of us who am i and what was i created for in this outbreak and i asked that question might seem really you know what has that got to do with participatory approaches you know but it revealed to me this revealed to me that if we can be honest with ourselves and if we can discover that dream that was inside of us that exposes a sense of openness and humanity then that that link of vulnerability opens the way ahead for trust to be built and that is measureless so i gave birth to a movement that was participatory that was inclusive but it was also empowering because a sense of connection was made and because of that there was friendship and so the migrant vloggers requested for more and more and more and so we we started to to you know do do sessions of chronic disease to answer the questions or you know on mental health awareness etc and we always tried to engage them to make sure that it was two-way thing so the movement was socially distanced but humanly connected and right now i'm just going to show you a short glimpse of the kite song video which we had translated into the migrant walkers languages i like kites [Music] i like to fly kites because they make me feel so free [Music] so free there is a kite song within me that will not be still [Music] higher and higher my kite goes but [Music] how unpredictable the winds can be like dreams slip away so easily run run for your dreams keep running don't stop it's never easy to realize your dreams sometimes it feels like everyone is laughing at you and nobody believes in you okay so i hope you enjoyed that little segment so you get the sense it it's it's it's poignant and it's it's visual and it's metaphorical and this resonates that deeply as well with the migrant workers and from there that's how they share their experiences that you saw before so the key really is that there's no dream too small and that was the message that they left with so right now although we don't have much time left but we'll do a little um a little experiment just a little glimpse of how the workshop runs but you know with sharing this right now we're doing training videos as well we asked migrant walker some key questions and right now i just want you to pick one question that stands out most to you and in a short while in just maybe you know two minutes i'd like to ask some of you to if you're comfortable to share how this has impacted you so you can type it in a group chat or you know feel free to unmute yourself and share but please go ahead and share you know was there a page of the story that resonated with you the most so you know what was your what was your kite song moment um in in global health independent you know would you you draw or write your dream on a kite um if you have a piece of paper and a pencil you know if there is something in the visuals really stood out to you would you just take a moment just to pin it down and write it down and i'm just gonna give everyone just two minutes one and a half to two minutes just to ponder over this please you don't have to be artistic yeah you i'm just going to let it cool for another minute while people are working on their answer to um why dad's questions here if you have an actual question for her please just go ahead and put it in the q a area on your screen okay and then we'll ask a couple people to share their um their feedback on these questions in just a minute okay okay i think i want to make sure we end on time is there anyone who would like to share um something the lens or and i'm going to just you know tie this in with you know any comments and thoughts that you might have i saw so many wonderful comments on the chat group thank you so much um sure well while some of you are plucking up the coverage well i'll show you this picture that migrant walker shared with me uh you can see here me and my family and the kite is my dream and colbert 19 was like the storm or like the scissors storm of uncertainty and cut off the cut string but now um he said he had tied it back is it singapore government is with me i can achieve my dream so this was his you know his take away and he and and this was up on the wall if you can see it he stuck it up on the wall yeah anybody want to share maybe one or two people thanks thanks maja um i think we have somebody's hand up on martha would you like to share hi everyone um i will i would just say i think um a kite song moment in the pandemic for me um actually have to say i i know my experience of the pandemic maybe was very different than for so many people but there was actually so much about it that's been positive for me because as a as a public health person and working on risk communication community engagement at the beginning of the pandemic i just really wasn't sure how i might contribute or where or you know what i might really be able to do but i ended up working for such a an amazing team with the team um at who in europe and also with um headquarters that it actually really did feel like being lifted up with the with the kite um and just the amount of of working together and and what i feel like we were able to do so that was really positive for me thank you for sharing martha that's beautiful as i learned friends that you're making the pandemic are friends you make for life wonderful should we hear one more and then i'll just found out thanks martha um do you ever want to share um here melinda i can i can definitely share my my thoughts if it's okay great thank you should i go ahead yep please do yeah um ygr this was a brilliant presentation and i loved the the way you presented and also all of the concepts that you talked about and uh i just that's what i want to respond to mainly i love the use of the word kite as a metaphor for all of the concepts that you touched upon it was a it was it was a really touching metaphor for the idea of dreams which for me also implies discovery self-discovery connection the emotional vulnerability that you talked about which is the pathway to making authentic human connection which in turn is then the pathway to really getting together listening finding solutions moving ahead communicating all of that it was it was very very good and and you can see the integrity of your approach of who you are with how you presented it so i think that has also communicated really beautifully across to us and certainly to me that it's it's it's a very very genuine presentation that you made and it's as much about you and who you are as much as it is about your work and the concepts that you presented i think there's a lot to learn from all of this in terms of our work with communities out there whether in emergencies or even otherwise i think it's got the essence of what it takes to to work with human beings you know on on whatever be the context so that's what i really loved about your presentation thank you thanks ross um i think we have one more uh if you would like to share their experience uh later hi everyone um yeah thank you for the lovely presentation um i think for me one of my dreams has always been to find a way to balance out doing um this public health work that involves a lot of travel and and going to interesting places but also with being rooted when being able to spend time with my friends and family and i remember the moment when i was living in rwanda at the beginning of the year and seeing these this rolling in of different travel restrictions and realizing that i was going to have to make a choice between staying away from home or coming close and i think the the amazing opportunity of this of this pandemic for me has been going from being far away for a year to actually spending a lot of quality time with some people i love very much um so yeah i think that's it for me but thank you so much for this presentation leila that is beautiful because you just brought an important theme which is loneliness in times of isolation and i think that would be such a powerful and beautiful personal story to share even not with with migrant workers because many of them feel like you know the outside world don't understand their pain so thank you so much for sharing that so vulnerably with us thank you so with that um um mindy would can i bring it to a close would that be all right i think the way forward really is um it goes through through this this season where i think you know things have been coming down and a little bit we're trying to consolidate all that we have learned um with as a reflection and evaluate what has happened and moving forward to package all this as part of a consolidated toolkit so that you know share this with the region so what you saw here as a toolkit and we're hoping to put it together with instructional videos and training videos so that this may be um shared or replicated in other places as well so with that um this is my my contact number my i'm sorry my email um you're welcome to to to write to me if you have further questions after the presentation and of course none of this could have been possible with without all these wonderful people um who are behind all these efforts so thank you all so much for yeah thank you thank you you ,True,False,False,False

How did he overcome this trauma? 24hour helplines: ...,[Music] so sleepy you're getting very very sleepy that's right now the thing about hypnotism is it doesn't really work that way [Music] and one person should ask a question is it true that when you go into hypnosis souls or ghosts might possess you i'm like what oh generally speaking right people think about hypnotism we think about the mind control or even black devil's magic uh we think about the cornmen on the street now what happens is this when we talk about hepatism we go into a few classes there is self-hypnosis that we do hypnotizing ourselves then there is hypnotherapy where we use hypnosis to do therapy for other people to help people resolve their issues so generally speaking there's actually a conscious mind and an unconscious mind when we talk about hypothesism we are bringing the conscious into the unconscious to solve problems hypothesism only works when you want it to work we cannot hypnotize you against your ethics or values now there's also one more misconception so i used to go networking business networking and they always ask do you think that thing and no i don't do that now the thing is in traditional hypnosis may use the pocket watch to help you focus so other than the pocket watch i can ask you to focus on my hand on your own hand on the spot on the wall on the light so we can actually do this as long as you have extreme focus you are able to enter into the unconscious mind much more easily [Music] on a particular day or night with my dad uh just watching tv he was drinking at a point in time asking me to remember to study and stuff like that and take out her family and stuff even back then um we were practicing again kissing good night that's our way of family so i felt very sleepy and i wanted to go to sleep and then i'm hugging kissing good night he helped me a little bit more tighter than normal and then he said again remember to take her family and then the next next morning my mom woke me up it's a sentence king your dad killed himself i was i was i was shocked yeah i couldn't believe it [Music] oh his name is a very strong person and and i got up i went out to the living room and i saw him on the floor and my mom checked that my dad he actually hang himself in the balcony there were some members of my extended family that sort of blamed me for not recognizing that my dad was going to kill himself they were thinking that the way he hugged me was a signal but now overcome with grief and guilt i start to withdraw from the law i guess i wanted to escape from that reality even from the very beginning i wanted to escape from the reality that my dad just killed himself [Music] i was particularly traumatic so i had like pushed my stress disorder i found a depression i didn't even know that i was going to discount mental health issues i just suffered all the way through it wasn't until many years later i learned about neurobasic programming in the nlp course they talked about the history of nlp and how hypnosis was incorporated into it so it got me wondering hey wait a minute i thought immortalism was black magic but we're now talking about how hypnosis was incorporated to nlp so it seems to suggest it's more of a science or psychology behind it so i was very curious and i decided to explore the topic of hypnotism and so when i actually decided to work on myself look into my own mind how i actually formulate all this anxiety depression and stuff and figure out which techniques to use to solve my problems that made me realize hey wait a minute if we can put a name on to it it means i can solve it some of the times when i think back about my past about different incidents there will be moments where you feel like crying if you hurt and when i actually do the hypnotism of myself to resolve my issues when i think about those same things i realize that the pain has perhaps reduced or it has probably gone away i feel more peace and happiness after i've worked on myself i decided to hey you know what i've got this pretty cool skill set so why don't i just help some people i mean understand how the mind works how words can influence the mind then to a certain extent everybody's hypnotizing everybody i want to raise this awareness that actually hypnotism is not something that is also scary or whatever that's why with each client i will always give them time to share their issues so that i can understand how their mind works and i think that having my own experience with so much when they share that experiences with me i can understand a little bit better and i think i can help them better you ,False,False,True,False

in ten people say that they wouldn't want to live near or work with a person with a mental health condition [Music] if your mental illness you apply for a job but who in the right sense will really want to take you if possible i will just stay away as far as possible [Music] hi everyone a warm welcome to hope church singapore we are based in singapore but every week we have different people joining us from all over the world we're so glad to have you here in our online service today is our special service weekend we take a break from our usual sermon series to talk about a relevant topic that anyone can hear and learn about today we are talking on the topic on mental and emotional health mastering our mind a very relevant topic especially in this season of the pandemic and economic uncertainty if you are new here with us we truly welcome you because you are important to god and to us thanks for making time to join us in church so if you are new can you type the word new n-e-w in the group chat and our online ministers would love to get connected with you it is our privilege today to have a special guest dr daniel fung he's here with us on zoom and dr daniel is the chairman of the medical board in the institute of mental health i am h and his experience in speaking about this topic especially in this season so without further ado let's welcome dr daniel and let's go straight into the interview so hi dr danny fong hi hi so glad to have you here with us thanks for joining us in church today you know maybe for a start you can just introduce yourself and maybe tell us about more what you do well i'm daniel fang i'm a child psychiatrist by trading so i work with children and of course the psychiatrist the simplest way of putting it is that we are feelings doctor we help people with their feelings so i work with children uh in in my clinical work uh in my other job at the german medical board of the institute of mental health that's like the chief psychiatrist of the hospital and i had to look after the 2000 overbids that we have for inpatients and about 40 000 our patients that we look after for very serious mental illnesses i'm a father of five children they're all grown up and my eldest is pregnant and gonna have a baby so i'm looking forward to that new phase in my life thanks for the introduction can you share with us more about how this pandemic has affected many people especially in the area of mental health yeah so uh i i think if you you think about the effects of the pandemic um how are we affected by um all the the the changes that occurred the moment we uh our government announced um you know dos corn orange and uh shortly after uh we went into uh our version of the lockdown circuit breaker um that had put a lot of restrictions on what we are used to i mean most of our social activities have been changed and um and even our interaction now remember i have a family of five kids two of them are married uh getting the whole family together in a regular kind of a meeting and we meet you know every week uh was was severely curtailed and it was difficult even just their meals so some of these restrictions has created a lot of fear and anxiety and certainly has affected people it's even in some cases almost traumatizing traumatized by this whole event which has changed our lives completely now i think the the the greatest piece that hasn't really played out is uh the economic recession and how that's going to affect our lives and on the jobs and that in itself may have a lot of impact on our emotional uh health and our feelings and how we you know we cope with life so that there are a lot of impact and it's it's very largely stress related indeed these are stressful times for many people in their lives how can we understand this area of mental health better i think it's helpful to talk a little bit about mental disease and disorders and illness and give you a better understanding of the various dimensions of mental health so first mental disease is actually a pathological process so if you take cognitive as an example if you catch the virus you can have a cough you can have a fever or you can have a raging pneumonia illness is your experience of that [Music] virus infection so the disease is the virus the illness is your experience mental illness is insane what about sickness sickness is actually the role negotiated in society so if you have kovit19 and you are infected and you have a fever what will happen is you'll be isolated people will put you in a place where you cannot spread to other people so the same with mental sickness people are sometimes afraid of mental illnesses and therefore they have what i consider a stigma towards it so sickness is really the role that society takes now um overall of course is mental health the state of complete physical mental and social well-being not merely just disease absence and that means no disease doesn't mean you are mentally healthy it's broader than that first there is mental illness which is the experience of a mental disease so we put them as one there's mental sickness which is what society thinks of mental illness and then there's mental health which is very broad um people talk about mental health as though it is interchangeable with mental illness it's not the same thing right let me explain one good example of mental illness is depression for example if you have um something happening in your life and something bad happens you might get a little upset on the point if that bad thing gets very bad to the extent that it affects your life tremendously you might even be heartbroken you become unhappy stress causes unhappiness uh kind of a destabilizing effect and you can have a mental illness like depression but being unhappy with your life is not the same thing as depression they can coexist but they're not necessarily the same thing so just remember mental illness and mental health are two sides of this um this pyramid so mental illness need treatment mental health needs support to get up thanks dr daniel for that um explanation and understanding it really gives some clarity on the various terms that we know i'm sure in this season there are many of us who are faced with lots of stress and with some of us might be facing some mental health issues and there are some of us that are unsure if we are really having a mental health issue so what should one do if i think that i suffer from a mental health issue the key thing is really to be able to talk to someone and you know if you can't solve it yourself most mental health distress issues you can solve it yourself when it gets to problems sometimes you can't but if you talk to someone you trust you know your friends your colleagues and together you seem to say well you know we can't quite explain this then it could be a mental illness that's where you go and seek professional help and in singapore we've created a an ecosystem of support um there are a number of support systems firstly we have a national care hotline which you can call uh it's 24 7. uh we also have some websites the most um well-developed one is done by the mental uh the the ministry of health uh technology site it's called mine line m i m-i-n-d-l-i-n-e remember mental illnesses is not that common one in seven singaporeans get a lifetime risk of this it's not something that you know happens every day so most of the time it is mental health problems where you need to find ways to quote and manage the difficulties in your life especially if the difficulties are very obvious to you for example if there's financial difficulties when your relationships are in trouble these are very obvious things that you need to address that's really good dr daniel i'm sure that many of us will find these various channels and helplines really helpful especially for some of us that we know someone around us that needs help i know they know who to turn to now could you also share more with us how every one of us can cope better with all this covid19 related stressors and the impact that it's having on our mental health i i thought i'd share a little bit about the determinants of health most of us know this as the basic determinants of health biological factors like our physical well-being so are we are we fit um do we have a good lifestyle for example do we eat well do we sleep well um do we have good habits and don't smoke and then and then social determinants which is our interactions with the people around us our families and psychological determinants of health uh what's our thinking like how you know when we have stress how do we cope with it what do we tell ourselves uh so these are the basic things that most people will think it's called bio psychosocial but um alongside this is uh which we seldom talk about is the spiritual aspect now some people say oh special should come under you know social cultural you know um but i think it really um deserves a place as a determinant of health and it's an important place because it is an aspect of our life i always say that uh when we are stressed we need to have a support system so the most important support system like like a chair the chair has four legs right so you must have a support system like a chair you know at least four elements if not more so what are the four elements well you must be able to um you know have time to relax what i call fun you know things that you enjoy doing you must have um a family support system that or um that you know provides you with the kind of emotional support and i think as christians one of the things that the most useful uh in my mind is really the fellowshipping with fellow christians and your friends and then finally i think it is also important to have some glance and some glimpse of the future that you hope for yourself and i think that's a very important support system a lot of people work for certain things um in this world in this very secular world people work for money um but we are working for something different right and as christians uh working for god's kingdom um and what it means you gotta help people you gotta show compassion and those aspects of our life actually helps to support us when you're helping people suddenly you feel you know a new energy you're better able to do things so i think those are quite critical so having those support systems in place very important for example you've got a headache or your body is aching you can't sleep well sleep in fact is very important those are signs that you are you know you you're struggling and you may have some mental health problems and that's when you start to sort of share those problems i think it's a good start to be able to share with your your family your friends and of course you should pray as well because you should share with god you know if that's a concern for you and then of course if after you've done all that and still not working um i think some professional help is help uh is useful thanks for the practical tips and insights just now you mentioned about this spiritual aspect of our life what is the difference between spirituality and religion spirituality is actually an inner subjective awareness concerned with matters of meaning and purpose in life truth and values while religion really is about a grounding of faith and the basis of life that ties us to god to put it simply spirituality changes mood but religion changes life i really like how you say religion changes life it's true that religion is more than just being spiritual as a christian i have seen how many people's lives are being transformed from their relationship they have with jesus and i know you two are a christian for many years and your faith has definitely influenced the way that you help people and there are many people who might be watching us right now that they do not know jesus yet now what what would you say to them um to all those people who do not know jesus yet well i would say first of all i mean um you know the the if they are open to reading a book there is one book that they should be reading it's the most popular book the best seller in all the world it's called the bible it's a good place to start and i'd recommend that to people that you know who are curious who want to know about what this who is this god and what is this jesus then read the bible that's the word of god so that's the best place to start uh then the second i guess you know one of the effects in the pandemic is that it allows us to visit all the churches my wife has been visiting uh many churches online doing the during the uh the pandemic because you can in the past it's kind of hard to visit and if you're new you kind of feel very stupid should we go to a new place but now you can visit a church and experience uh the church service read the bible and visit church online that sounds like great starting steps thanks dr daniel for your time and your wisdom that and your knowledge that you've shared with us we're so blessed by you today thanks okay our time together have not ended yet i really hope for you to stay on because i love to share with you some more thoughts about god's perspective into this area of mental and emotional health there will be this wonderful story towards the end about someone who has struggled through this challenging season of depression and even contemplates suicide in his life you don't want to miss that so whether you are a believer of jesus or not yet there are two things that i love to share with you firstly god is a personal god and he understands what we go through now when we go through or rather when we are going through some of the toughest mental and emotional struggles no human being can fully understand what we are going through have you ever experienced that before when you were sharing your experience to someone and the person you know tried to say i understand and the person trying to tell you something that is common to their experience in yet in their experience to you and they try to identify with you but you know that they come from a good heart you don't mind them saying this because they're trying to understand you but you know that no human being can fully understand you but god is different because he knows exactly our thoughts and what we are going through the bible tells us in this verse oh lord you have examined my heart and you know everything about me you know when i sit down you know when i stand up you know my thoughts even when i'm far away in the book of psalms 139 it says this god is a personal god and he knows every single one of us he hears all your thoughts he fully understands what you are going through and that's why we say christianity is not a religion where you merely follow a set of beliefs and values in the hope that it changes you but christianity is truly about a living real relationship with god that we can have through jesus when jesus came onto earth he was a hundred percent human he experienced the kind of pain that humans go through physical pain of torture the mental pain of facing the crucifixion the emotional pain of rejection and betrayal the bible even describes him as a as a man of sorrows who have gone through many pains jesus fully understand our human sufferings you know when i go through such time of stress in my life i cry out to god and say god why why do i go through this god help me save me lord i need you i do not know what to do i cry out to god and it doesn't matter he gives me a solution or he delivers me out but i know this he hears me and he understands what i'm going through friends i want to tell you that god hears you you can cry out to him every one of us can just do that and he understands what you are going through the second thing that i would love to share with you is that god longs to meet us in our pain and suffering when we go through such stress and such pain in our life the human thing to do is to run away you wish for your situation to change you pray that god will take away the pain and the issue and the human thing to do is to just numb ourselves and just distract ourselves with all the pleasures and the business of life but what if what if god is using what you are going through what you are feeling right now as a loud hailer hello to call you to draw you close to him he is shouting into your heart right now to draw you close to him to your very situation in psalms 34 18 it says the lord the lord is close to the broken hearted and he saves those who are crushed in spirit he is close to you rather he longs to be close to you in your suffering and pain he can give you what people can he can feel you with more than what the pleasures and the business and life can he can fill you with true peace with true hope with true meaning and he is the only one that can bring healing to you only only god can do that we have some of us we have tried many ways to master our minds many human methods like science like psychology we've tried all these things and sometimes they seems limited sometimes they even fail us and perhaps it's not by mastering our mind that we ultimately gain freedom but it is by surrendering to the master to god and his word and allow god to become the master of your mind because god is the creator who truly knows you who truly knows how our mind works how life works and god truly loves you today i hope to share this story with you of someone in our church that have allowed god to do just that in his life when he opened his life up to jesus and allow jesus to come into his life let's hear the story of chan singh hi my name is chan singh i'm a businessman and i like to run i like to swim and sometimes cycle seven years ago i attempted suicide it's sliding in a bottomless pit whereby you just drop down further and further and all you see around here is darkness you don't see any light you try to reach out and there's no one there it's just dropping in deeper and deeper it's sinking in and uh yeah it's it's quite a very uh depressing feeling [Music] i joined this company as a what they call a junior position so because i want to prove myself i was quite uh [Music] quite a overachiever so within three years i actually got promoted twice style was pretty bad because actually when i mentioned i did work 12 to 16 hours a day and basically i treated my house more like a hotel it's like i just go back to sleep rest and then i get to work so before i leave her and by the time i reach home basically i don't get to see my parents a lot so that's i can say at that point in time that was almost like zero communication so somehow i managed to have a girlfriend which i met during my studies but i guess the the work issue also led us to be quite distant [Music] i think with this unending work and this feeling in relationships i i felt i felt really depressed and i felt very alone because there was really no one i could share my [Music] sorrows or joys with i finally decided to to take leaf during translucent period however on the eve of me taking leave my boss came up to me and told me that i was quite an important client starting a new project and asked me whether i could take over this project so at that time it just so happened that i found out that my girlfriend was still timing me and i had a break yeah i broke up with her at that time so i decided to just cancel my leaf to to try to work my pain and sadness away it made me feel even more alone because on my supposedly own time or leave time i was working i thought it could help me get away from the pain but instead i felt even worse this is meaningless why why am i doing this to myself like why am i working when everyone's enjoying why do people have friends when i don't and why do i have to suffer all this i'm not a bad person i'm smart i'm capable but how come my life is so alone and such a mess that's i realized that life is really meaningless why should i live for this i might as just and it goes on yeah go just end it and maybe i'll be happier somewhere else yeah so that's when i decided to yeah kill myself yeah this was when i was in my research job so i went on a work trip to china but while in an airport i actually met a young christian who actually said that she was on a mission trip she actually went to a mountain village in somewhere in china to teach the kids the village kids english and then she did all her on a own accord her own money she saved up to go for this street for herself and um initially i was quite skeptical i was wondering why someone who is sacrificing so much um yeah and getting nothing in return i think that that's the beef getting nothing in return giving out so much yet find joy and yet i was looking at my own life by the end i i just couldn't find that the inner joy that i sensed that this girl this christian this young christian was having and i i'm guessing she had it much harder than me and i'm just curious why someone with such a hard life and yet could live with so much joy but i was living the life yet i felt totally alone lost and empty inside because all that she was sharing she attribute to this god who gave her strength and courage to do that oh curiosity i i tried to download i i did download a bible app then i started to read a few verses here and there by the time i guess um some of the words are like typical self-help books kind of sayings and i was like okay but it didn't really make a lot of sense and i probably didn't understand what a lot of the passages mean at the time i was just reading them like a storybook even though i was very curious when i came back to work i got i got caught up back in my long hours of work and all that so the chinese new year period whereby i was i came back to work and when i was contemplating suicide and when i finally decided to do it actually i planned a date to to commit suicide but on that day when i was about to jump something stopped me somehow a verse that i read before came into my mind and this verse was from philippians um chapter four it says about do not be anxious about anything and in all things give your petitions to god and then he will give you peace that transcends all understanding so when that word peace that transcends or understanding flesh across my mind i really felt something strange a sense of um total peace and comfort in my mind in my heart and that stopped me from wanting to to kill myself i suddenly see a light in the nr tunnel i wasn't feeling that hopeless anymore so i stopped my suicide attempt and then i realized that i need to find out more about this god yeah i think i was looking at all the material things of the world and trying to feel it to make me happy to satisfy me but i realized all these things one last but when i experience god's peace that feeling lost lusted it never went away and it continued to change my life daily i could get a new gadget or get a new hobby and buy new equipment and all that i could get happy few days weeks months but eventually i'll get tired of it look for new things but with this piece that i felt it was lasting it must not have come from just myself because i try so hard to change but i can't and then when i read the verse and this verse came to me in changes it transformed my life entirely so i know for sure that you must come from a higher being i have grown to be more loving towards people and especially towards my family i realize i don't have to work 12 to 16 hours anymore because a lot of times i realize this is more on because i had nothing better to do but now i realize hey there's so much more i could give to others so when i started devote my time i wanted to serve this god that i know i was like started to serve in industry and from then i never looked back because surveying hope kids also gave me a meaning or purpose because i also want to disciple the next generation well and throughout all this um know god has been very faithful and god has been has given me a lot of blessings and enabled me to also find my spouse and also really help build out the relationship with my family you know that yeah the things still work in progress but then i trust that and i believe that what god did for me that god has really saved my life and that no matter what i'll continue to to trust in him and be obedient to him the god who gave chan singh the kind of peace is calling out to you the god that works in chancing's life is the same god that can work in your life as well god is tugging at your heart to ask you to open your heart to him what does inviting jesus into your life means it means that you recognize that you're a sinner that you have turned away from god but today you decide to come back to him you know that you can't do life by yourself anymore you need a savior believing in jesus means that you believe in what he has done for you on the cross you believe that his death on the cross have bought the forgiveness that god had for you and you can and your relationship with god can be restored to what jesus has done by inviting jesus into your life you are saying yes to this new life that god has for you this new life that god has this new purpose this new life that god has for you and today it is made possible through jesus death and resurrection so today if you hear if you feel the nudge of jesus in your heart if you know that he is touching you today don't hesitate today if you want to invite jesus into your life you can say this prayer together with me just pray it together with me wherever you are dear jesus [Music] thank you for dying on the cross [Music] for my sins [Music] right now i invite you to come into my life be my lord be my savior help me to become the kind of person i was created to be and i pray all this in jesus name amen amen i know some of you you have prayed at prayer you have opened your hearts to allow jesus to come to your life congratulations that is the best decision that you can ever make for yourself those of you who have said yes to jesus you can type the word yes y-e-s-yes into the group chat or you can click the button that is on your screen right now and we would love to get connected with you and as a church we would love to send you an e-starter kit to help you get started in this new journey with jesus bye-bye ,False,False,True,False
SmxwIxumKII,Mental Health In The Era Of Covid-19 | Dr Ganesh Kudva,UC1hp0pDwWzZPeKqq4K0LoeQ,Brahm Centre,2020-08-05T14:21:35Z,"For the third year in a row, Brahm Centre Singapore is the proud host and organiser of Asia's largest mindfulness conference, the Singapore Mindfulness ...",thank you everyone for tuning in uh today on this sunday afternoon um allow me to share screen um so that i'm able to show you my slide okay so um i'll be taking you through um the body of work uh that has been done exploring uh the various themes of mental health in the era of covet 19 and i think as as angie has mentioned um kovitt 19 is really an unprecedented crisis a year ago even seven eight months ago we would never have foreseen ourselves in the situation in which we now are uh but well here we are we are now about seven months in and um humanity as a whole is facing many challenges uh and this is uh these challenges are not just confined to the virus itself but also the various ways in which the virus is changing our lives i mean the very fact that we're having this uh conversation over this platform i think uh says it all about how these how these viruses changed our lives um so the facets of today's talk are basically threefold first of all i'll be looking at the effect of illness contagion illness spread on the broader public's mental health so i've termed this the worried well number two the effect of quarantine on mental health and number three it would be the mental health in the post kobe 19 world um before i go on let me just qualify that a lot of the data i've brought together is global uh doesn't really specifically pertain to singapore i think so far in singapore we've done a very good job in terms of being able to control our community spread and with the various stimulus packages and so on they have been released somewhat being able to cushion the economic impact of the virus so far but we are highly plugged into the rest of the world and we see unchecked viral spread in so many countries you know in india brazil the us uh that it does make one wonder whether these issues might someday come to affect us a little bit more it's good to talk about it now hence the talk today so part one would be the effects of illness contagion and the public's mental health so i termed this the worried well people who do not yet have the virus but are naturally worried by what it means so this is from a paper that's published in the asian journal of psychiatry earlier this year it basically theorizes that for every single spike of cobit 19 cases and it's likely that we will have multiple spikes of covet 19 cases around the world uh that you have two uh peaks of mental health problems the first peak happens soon after the virus makes its presence felt and cases rise and so there's understandably a lot of fear a lot of anxiety people that will be struggling to adjust to the new normal we call this the adjustment disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders as well but then humanity where a resilient bunch and so eventually societal resilience will kick in and people will adjust to the new normal but then unfortunately we know that the virus does lead to a loss of life but not only that loss of jobs and various other things and so eventually over time people may then develop a second peak of mental health problems and this would be more related to loss and grief so it's nothing but grief post-traumatic stress disorder depression and suicide and i think one of the concerns that was articulated in this paper was that the number of cases of people who may suffer from mental health problems may be far in excess of the number of actual cobit 19 cases in a population and this may go beyond what a mental healthcare system is able to manage so covet 19 and distress so i think as we have mentioned it is an unexpected unprecedented unknown we still don't know all that much about the virus there is a lot of uncertainty still about the rate and mode of transmission and there's unparalleled spread no definitive treatment at this point and there is a greater psychological fear than during sars i mean a substantial available impact about more than half of respondents from a study in china actually reported moderate to severe psychological impact and the fear of phobic 19 increases levels of stress depression and anxiety and in turn reduces the level of life satisfaction so why might this be happening part of it of course is related to the virus and the nature of the virus and its spread but also the fact that today we live in a very polarized world if not singapore at least in the rest of the world you look at the u.s for example and so media coverage may actually amplify anxiety there may be a lot of distrust towards governments and healthcare authorities to control the spread i mean if you watch the u.s news you would see that this is very much in play uh there may be a lot of stigma and blame towards individuals who are deemed to be spreading the disease and also a concept which i shall go on to explain called the behavioral immune system which i'm going to talk about a little bit because i feel it explains a lot of things that we are seeing today so the behavioral immune system we know that we all have an immune system so this is what kind of kicks in if we get infected by any bug a body mouse and immune response but it isn't just the cells in our body that produce this response it's also something that's seen in our behavior and what this immune system is meant to do is it's meant to protect us against potentially getting infected and so to reduce the work that our uh body's immune system then has to do so and the degree to which we activate this immune system this behavioral immune system really depends on how vulnerable we feel to the disease um coming back to the to a point that we see across the world you might see a lot of young people congregating at bars and going to malls and queuing up at you know restaurants you don't necessarily see people who are more elderly doing that and that might be because the elderly might perceive themselves to be more vulnerable to the disease and they take steps to protect themselves far more than younger people who view themselves as being innately immune might you know might might adopt these steps so what are the benefits well first of all it creates vigilance of one's external environment and it creates it values conformity and obedience over eccentricity and rebellion so these days if let's say there is a lockdown or you know there are restrictions social distancing and so on we tend to follow because we are worried about the virus and sickness behavior in itself when someone is sick they don't go out as much generally they adopt social withdrawal and a loss of energy may actually help to limit the spread of the disease and that's a behavior in itself too and so and also distancing behaviors from those are potentially unwell may reduce the probability of catching the infection and this actually lessens the work that needs to be done by the cylinder immune system however uh there are a number of downsides so first of all of course is the fact that avoidant behaviors may actually come at the expense of interpersonal relationships and daily activities we might go out less when i talk to people less we might not meet our colleagues or our friends as much and we get more distant it is stressful so that taxes our metabolic system we're always in a state of stress uh and and chronic anxiety and stress can lead to problems we might stigmatize certain communities we know of reports for example in the uk of asians being attacked and um the greater disgust greater activation of aversive cognitions with the working memory and greater motivation for behavioral avoidance so basically we view the world then as a more threatening place we start to adopt behaviors to keep ourselves safe it might help to keep ourselves safe but it's not necessarily something that's good for the long term or in excess so what are the groups that report higher distress levels and this is from a collection of papers from around the world so uh female gender it's been shown in a number of papers to actually uh be a group that is associated with higher distress levels um respondents age 18 to 30 and above 60. so above 60 i think it's you know perhaps because they perceive themselves as being more vulnerable to their disease and for respondents age 18 to 30 remember these are young people their studies may have been disrupted entry into the workforce they have been disrupted they're just about earning their first paycheck they'll be struggling to support themselves so this is a very stressful time for them students and migrant workers not surprising that they would be under a fair bit of stress there is higher distress in places with inadequate public health resources and limited containment measures if the virus is spreading everywhere and there isn't a hospital that you can go to then you are going to be very distressed by the fact the virus is there those with poorer self-rated health status and with medical problems will have higher distress because they'll perceive themselves to be more vulnerable and having an acquaintance a family member who is infected especially a family members infected with kobit 19 can be stressful as well you might worry that you might catch the infection there's caregiving responsibilities that you one might have to take up and of course there's that worry what might happen to my family member so part two uh focuses on the effect of quarantine on mental health i'd first of all like to qualify that it's very hard to exactly differentiate which aspects of mental health distress are due to the virus and which aspects are due exactly to quarantine because the two are so closely interlinked but nonetheless i've tried to look through the data to to kind of provide an overview on it so the effect of quarantine so i mean it's needless to say i think we're all aware now that the distress from pandemics not only stems from the fear of the disease but also from the effects of quarantine quarantine measures may worsen anxiety it can cause boredom anger and loneliness we might feel cut off from our social contacts and this can be stressful when you're at home all day perhaps not able to further one studies or do the things that one might normally do it might affect your self-esteem boredom and stress might affect one's ability to exercise self-control uh it affects sleep quality if you're in the house all day and it increases the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder there was an article in the guardian newspaper in the uk that actually said that one-fifth of vulnerable adults in the uk actually considered self-harm during their coronavirus lockdown distress related to quarantine is associated with inadequate information inadequate supplies and a longer duration of quarantine i think during our circuit breaker period you may have heard of minister lawrence wong talking about why it was important to time the onset of the circuit breaker properly and not have it for too long because you're worried about population fatigue and that's a very real thing and the longer longer you keep a population locked down that can have a lot of problems in and of itself quarantine and national lockdowns actually have a profound economic impact as well and this may actually cause a rise in unemployment and financial stress which in turn may increase the risk of suicide so with that i've actually kind of collated the literature to talk about some of the pathways from quarantine to suicide now i must emphasize that not everyone who is quarantined uh is at risk of suicide and it certainly is not something that happens you know it's not an inevitable progression but it is a concern and i think we need to bear it in mind because it's best to prepare for a problem rather than react to it so um first of all it's important to remember that there are certain groups that are at higher risk of you know suicide mental health distress and suicide when under quality so they're basically people who endorse being lonely those are living alone those are single and certain behaviors that might increase one's distress so more time exposed to news and kobit 19. if one has fewer positive emotions you have less perceived self-efficacy so you don't feel you're capable of doing things and you feel almost you know vulnerable to this to the quarantine uh lower quality of sleep and negative self-perceptions upon aging so these are some of the risk factors and some of the pathways so basically quarantine is a very isolating experience and this can result in a sense of thwarted belongingness so this is from the interpersonal theory of suicide so the person may feel separated from the group to which they normally belong so for example if they feel they belong to a certain church congregation for example or a certain group of friends now they're not meeting them anymore so they lose this sense of belongingness there's also that loss of social interaction and with that there is a sense of diminished mental health well-being there's also the very real problem of poorer sleep abuse is a problem i think the world health organization issued a an advisory about the fact that global rates of domestic abuse were going up during the period of quarantine so this is a very real concern victims of abuse are likely to manifest diminished mental health well-being there also may be a feeling of being trapped and the economic consequences which will be stressful so all of these things together may potentially increase the risk of suicide and the reason i'm bringing this up is because proactive interventions are needed to assist those under quarantine so things to uh to counteract the effects of social isolation to shelter those who are at risk of abuse to um you know to basically reduce the economic consequences of quantities so these are things that need to be looked at so approach and therapy i think i'm just talking about this uh more because later on i'm going to talk about the importance of self therapy but these are some of the cognitive processes that i think we can have in mind uh in order to kind of buffer ourselves against the mental health impact of quarantine and of the virus so first of all it's important to realize that virtual modalities are more practical and present yes face to face would have been good you know it would have been nice to meet your friends would it be nice to meet your therapist but right now that may not be all that possible and not be the safest it's important to address the reality that we live in extraordinary time it's also important to reassure the patient in the event of a therapist so how one would a friend that there will always be the person will always be there regardless of the crisis it's important to maintain eye contact um and you know basically to suggest using virtual platforms uh like zoom or facetime to maintain contact with one social contact so have a zoom dinner for example uh it doesn't mean just because you cannot meet that social gatherings have to stop um and for those in therapy it's perhaps perhaps important to bear in mind now may not be the best time to terminate therapy it may be good to continue it at least till this crisis is a bit better and to reframe to look at the pandemic not as the end of one's old life and the you know kind of the end of everything but as a role transition a change in which the person yes mourns the loss of old roles but then you adaptively restructure activities and relationships in this new novel so use it as an opportunity to start a new and to to adjust and to adjust other interventions so i talked about digital technologies and how important they are places of congregation should actually replicate their activities via online platform so this is like places of worship gyms employers should actually create a buddy system and ensure a daily reach out to employees routine creation is essential especially for children not in school to kind of give them the rhythm and routine mechanisms for surveillance and decisive intervention in cases of abuse must be created basically so that the victims of abuse were now back in their homes often with you know their abuses partners must have places of help and shelter um and that really leads me to my next point these shelters in and of themselves must be safe must have social distancing so that this vulnerable group doesn't itself become infected mental health system actually needs to be bolstered in anticipation of a surge of cases which may happen and telehealth may need to be expanded and communities should be encouraged to create informal support networks amongst themselves to provide support to each other how to help to help us well basically i've talked about this because uh i think we all recognize that um you know i'm not sure i think many of many of us may be therapists we may be caregivers um and it's it's a stressful role at this time to care for others um so how does one help the helpers so you know basically it's important to have a proper diet regular exercise and sufficient sleep clear communication uh basically providing the psychological and financial support to those who are on caregiving roles uh and psychological first aid which is um the main reason why i'm actually talking about this so if you look at that that box to your right you'll see that these are the themes of psychological first aid it's something very simple and basically the main focus is to emphasize to the person to whom you're giving this first aid that number one um they're safe uh number two that they're not alone someone is there to link them up with supports so that there can be more support in the days to weeks moving forward and to provide them with information about how to cope and how to manage their distress it's useful because it's very applicable in this time and psychological first aid is certainly something that i think is a good tool for a lot of people to learn much as we learn uh medical first aid to deal with people you know who are going through a medical crisis psychological first stage should be something that should be taught to help people who are going through a psychological and since this is a mindfulness workshop i thought that include something about mindfulness as well and there are some studies that have talked about mindfulness in a pandemic so focused attention mindfulness based cognitive therapy and mindfulness based stress reduction have been shown to reduce anxiety depression post-traumatic stress disorder and the physiological markers of stress they basically offer a helpful way to cope with this constant change over pandemic rising cases lockdowns and so on daily mindfulness practice actually improved sleep duration and reduced anxiety amongst the population of quarantined individuals in gohan as compared to those who just had mind wandering so basically just kind of unfocused attention and rumination qualitative study of nurses in china actually showed that they endorsed mindfulness as a helpful way of reducing stress we know that nurses are under immense stress uh these days in a lot of countries where the cases are you know you know surging uh and meditation and mindfulness apps may actually be helpful uh to in order to deliver this this mindfulness to to the broader community um and mindfulness micro practices can be used to promote wellness and reduce burnout example whilst performing hand hygiene so now you may have heard a lot about washing your hands and uh and so on so whilst washing your hands how about practicing using that moment to focus on one's breath once uh center one's mind and body and visualize the kind of calmness and and presence that one would want to have at that moment in time so while cleaning your hands how about also kind of focusing on cleaning some of your thoughts and kind of promoting that wellness and peace i know it's abstract but it's perhaps something that can be um you know elaborated on further by you know other speakers or maybe even during a conference itself about how these micro moments can be used to promote wellness so part three is about mental health in the post-covet world and i think that that really is um a question that's foremost on many people's minds so we talked about the kovitz cycle um so covet cycle i think as we are all familiar you have a rise in case numbers there's a lockdown case numbers drop and then there is a gradual reopening of society but unfortunately then case numbers rise again and whilst not linked in the ebola crisis in west africa in liberia and sierra leone they actually talked about the presence of a fear apathy cycle so when ebola cases rise there's a lot of fear but then ebola becomes a new normal and then there's activity and then cases rise again and they talked about this in terms of how aid agencies may sometimes render support to uh or government they render support to people affected by the ebola virus there is somewhat a similar trend seen with kobit at least in quite a number of other countries overseas uh and this is from the economist that basically kind of sums up uh this whole covet cycle and how there is this pattern of re-engagement followed by a spike of cases and then unfortunately shut down again so what are the possible social economic scenarios that provide 19 might have so first of all of course borders may actually remain far more tightly controlled than before you may have countries that they have as an aspirational goal suppression a mere suppression of the virus so some level of spread but uh but fairly low versus countries that may say well we want to eliminate the virus so countries like new zealand or taiwan or south korea and is it likely that a country having taken all that effort to eliminate the virus may then open its borders readily to countries that merely state as a goal their desire to suppress so this is a question that that might be seen in the months to years ahead uh there's also a concern that you know jobs is short-term contracts they become more commonplace as employers are unable to plan for the long term and this might result in a transient workforce and governments may need to institute a series of stimulus packages to support the most needy uh but this may be associated with an increase in spending and so tax rates might go up uh and you will wonder future generations might actually have to put the bill of all the stimulus packages in the present day please and quite a number of other countries that don't really have the reserves in singapore do this is a particular concern uh there may also be sizable disruptions educational progress i think school closures and online learning is is important but can it really substitute actually going to school um financial strains actually force younger people to forego higher education in favor of earlier work communal activities and large scale social events may not occur as freely as before and unfortunately as we know is human nature certain entities mister feelings of ill will towards certain countries and communities and as we know if history is any guide the ensuing friction may lead to global conflict we hope it doesn't but if past pandemics and crises have shown us anything it's that for every good reaction that mankind seems to do there is also an unfortunately a negative reaction as well so what are the mental health consequences and i've divided this really looking at the spectrum across the lifespan so um i talked about the increase in domestic abuse so this is likely to affect the young and the elderly the most but there may be other issues as well in the young so i think uh uh prof daniel fung we're talking more about the mental health impacts of the young uh so i'll be brief here but basically there may be a rise in adolescent mood and anxiety disorders you know due to stall educational progress dim prospects unemployment and the lack of social interaction and that may result in an increase in adolescent suicide and an increase in delinquency in the elderly we know that many elder care centers have had shuts and so this is you know because you do need to keep the elderly safe from the virus but then that creates increased social isolation and many people the younger folks may be familiar with zoom and online platforms but our elderly may not be so familiar and so they might really really be cut off uh and it as was seen actually uh post-sas there was actually an increase in elderly suicide driven by disconnectedness and fear of contracting the illness and this was seen actually in hong kong post stars so this is something that we need to bear in mind across all ages we are still finding out more and more about the direct impact that the virus has on the brain uh we still don't know all that much but there is a concern that it may be causing some behavioral changes in and in people who are infected um there may be adjustment disorders depressive disorders grief um ocd and post-traumatic stress disorder may rise across the board and anxiety disorders may as well may become more common and as was seen in west africa after ebola there was actually an increase in the rates of addiction especially the alcohol so this is something that we also need to think about and plan for in the future and so for the mental health care system uh i suppose it's it's more it's important for us to look at um the groups yeah so i've divided it based on the various um groups at risk so for the worry well those who are worried about contracting the virus but do not yet have any mental health illness mental illnesses at this point uh you may want to talk about increasing the outreach or mental health apps familiarizing oneself with their youth so this would be self-help cognitive behavior therapy or mindfulness we want to integrate mental health advice into pre-existing social media networks so maybe remind us on facebook or instagram in order to kind of ensure that they're well or checking on their friends to make sure that they're well and also having support groups in the workplace as we've talked about before for those who have mental health illness symptoms or some stress but do not yet meet the threshold for an actual disorder or illness then they may help from counseling services and increase in the scope of telecounseling services that might be helpful for those who have mild to moderate mental illness then i suppose having easier access to psychiatric services or scoping out your tele psychiatry services may be helpful and for the very ill i suppose it's the one major thing we need to think about is how do we get back get them back on their feet uh as soon as possible after they've had a period of illness especially given the silent employment prospects that would would be there as a result of this virus so my reflection and this is my my last slide is you know much has been said about hand hygiene washing your hands wearing a mask to stem the spreader of the illness but what about psychological hygiene to stem this emotional contagion the spread of of stress and of distress mental health effects of covet 19 are likely to linger within society long after the virus is suppressed because the economic after effects will not just go away the day a vaccine is found it will be there and talking about the vaccine much as a vaccine will inoculate or protect people against the virus perhaps you also need to think about a vaccine for emotional wellness perhaps this will involve teaching people how to practice mindfulness or cognitive behavior therapy on their own to manage stress teaching them how to have proper sleep hygiene for example or how to talk about their feelings how to recognize mental illness that's important too and telemodalities will be important in this way so if that will allow people to reach out to each other and eventually once the whole of society is aware of what mental illness is is aware of how to help oneself and how to help those around us then perhaps we would have built up heard pandemic related stress and uh and that's perhaps something that we need to to um build ourselves towards uh also it's important to remember that societies do have a responsibility to act collaboratively and manage the spread of hate and division which may happen but we must actively work to prevent this from happening so with that that brings me to the end of my presentation thank you for listening you

LDjpksGf8Ig,Ask Me Anything: Mental Health,UCRaAh2wVFawLO2jT15XBUNg,Spotted! Media Singapore,2020-12-08T08:04:45Z,"What's the big deal about mental health? Well, it's time to ask. We're here with Hunny and Lummy from ThisConnect to discuss this often-shunned topic and ...",so you know at the end of day you know the question that i want to ask you is this what does connection really mean to you hello do i see it okay guys hello hi hi my name is julian liu hi hello oh my god another person across there okay hi um can i get to know your name please my name is bing guan you can call me mk and you are i'm faith nice to meet you faith nice to meet you and i'm one of the artists you know for the disconnect we are the people behind the work i feel you question how old are you what does it matter oh okay um tell me something it's just only a number isn't it i mean you know a person could be 50 years old but you know their psychological age could only be up to 50 cents um why not you know let me just open the flow up okay um have a look at the video that you know there's going to be pass to you okay and you know let me know how you feel sure thank you oh so cute okay i'll press play yeah sure anytime do you guys know each other the deepest loss in my life is kind of an ongoing loss it's not something that has happened in the past my dad and my stepmom were about to go through a divorce when i argue with other people or like friends or even like partners things like that uh i always remain like quite level-headed i'm quite okay with conflict management but like with with my mom i really see like the darker sides of myself and there was this period of time whereby i felt like i was the shittiest person in the world and i didn't deserve any love because of the way i treated people especially somebody that has loved me with all her heart i felt angry at him for what he did to my mother to this day i cannot imagine the amount of shame he has and how he can still be proud to be my mom's husband oh i was crying out i never learned how to cry i never had not to be angry and i should be angry i never knew how to speak for something that's important to me and the only thing i know how to be is happy for other people even i got nothing to be happy about i don't know man like sometimes i talk about these kind of things actually i force myself to sound very like strong or very positive i'm not sure you know on the inside whether i'm really believing what i say that's the worst thing i've ever done i've never said this out loud before i just wanted to take a moment one last moment to feel everything before i say goodbye [Music] how is it oh i'm a bit taken over it's a bit too early in the morning for this i think it's it's uh very honest and very real i would say felt like a really hard to hard moment something that you don't really get in everyday life it's quite emotional like you because it's like there's a lot of people being vulnerable in the video and you can almost feel them through just watching what they see so many emotions um yeah i think that was beautiful um i think there's like a heaviness in the in the knowledge there's there's such a straight experience in like pain and endless what did you experience as an experience um well as somebody who is you know more sentimental i cry a lot more than you would say then then other males out there it kind of felt like i was there with them i mean even though i was watching through a screen i think hearing them and seeing them yeah i think it really felt like i was there in the room with them any personal takeaways that came up for you wow things that you're reminded of you know as you're watching it because i'm sensing you know there's a lot of emotional tensions you know i wonder what this about i'm the kind of person who i feel a lot you know and i used to tell myself that you know you are not supposed to feel too much uh you know but then i i realized that the first step to going through these things is to feel like what you feel and and um just be very real with yourself because um only you know what you feel inside and then i guess one person will take away i would say is a lot of um personal strengths and you know anything can happen to you it's just how you wanna flip it and put it in a more introspective light and you know carry on with things well give yourself the permission to be present to whatever you're feeling whoever you're feeling it is real to you and you're the only person that can be authentic to your own emotions i'm lucky i'm not wearing makeup oh thank you i asked the crew if i should wear makeup well i guess dan says no one i think sometimes people just need to be held you can say a lot of things you can do a lot of things but to be present to hold someone's hand i think that sometimes is more than enough you don't even have to say anything yeah but to so intimately be connected not just physically but emotionally with someone i think that is so often a lot more powerful than anything we can do what is connection really really to you truly it's like you go deep into someone's personality and their thoughts and stuff they don't really feel or say out loud every day it's like it's just getting to know them on a really deep level and you just feel them it's quite unexplainable it's um it's something that sometimes you know when i meet somebody which i dare say i have met somebody and i touched my heart and i was like why does this person have you know in such like a i would say like you know people were all masked in all this cool world what does this person genuinely want to you know know about me like why i mean i got to know this person as a stranger and i was like why i mean you're a complete stranger right and then why do you want to care so much like who are you are you are you like an angel sent from above and in return i you know touched my heart and i was like let's get to know this particular person it's really like you know you touch your heart you close your eyes like who are you you know what do you want to be are you putting on a mask you know what are you not showing what do you not show people when you enter your room you close the door it's those four walls and we talked about that so throughout the course of when i knew this particular person there's genuine connection and that's connection to me i think connection can mean a lot of things like i can feel connected to a stranger who like wears the same shoes as me on like the train right because he has like similarities but i think connection to me is two people who are willing to take the risk of getting hurt or being seen or being hurt and and allowing yourself to truly be with another person now it's the review time okay [Music] hello hi [Laughter] hello hi wow what no i imagine you do that for you no you know so how do you like it it's something really hard to pull off in singapore because of asian cultures you know it's like kind of a taboo topic to just post out there and just show everyone like normally you wouldn't even tell your kids that like i saw a lot of adults there and it's like if they were telling the children that they wouldn't want to expose themselves like that because it's not how they want to portray themselves as a parent or like a role model so it's like yeah it's interesting how do you think this is a reflection and an indicator of the current state of our mental health today i think a lot of us just don't want to be seen with it and so i think the video really encapsulates that like the need to like that deep longing to be connected but then not wanting to be seen yeah i think of like platforms like like social media platforms where people like bear their souls and it's like really the darkest deepest secrets yeah i think it's a reflection of how we struggle but we don't want to be seen with that struggle yeah as compared to you know last time it was a very it was a topic that was being subdued you know like like don't talk about it you know um it's it's it's uh it's just you over it's just it's just in your head i think as we progress now and the year is ending actually i would say yes we are more open um yes we have plenty of hot lines you know as much as we try to open about this you know whole mental health thing it's still quite close i think it's very interesting how you put them in such a scenario and they actually reacted positively it's i it's not something i expect from singaporeans it's a personal thing and normally singapore's wouldn't share it so easily let alone to a stranger within 10 minutes and like the clip does it it feels like the people talking in the clip were like talking for hours you know it's not like a sporadic like short time frame it felt like they actually had to work to get like this was like so substantial build up beforehand and then boom the really deep personal stuff i guess singaporeans are capable of such things it's just that we need to have more um dedicated or like structured things to help people expose themselves like that but let's see if there are three people that you know you think might be able to benefit you know from the works itself just by watching the trailer not even the full works itself just by the trailer who would you recommend to watch i think i recommend it to my mom okay there's like if we experience stigma so much worse for their generation even now with their help available it's something that's so terrible for them and the things that they've gone through the things that they've had to shelf and keep suppressing it's not fair for them to have to carry it away like i mean i can't go to my mom and be like here share your struggles with me right but a video is a good segue to be like you know if you want to sit down and do something like that i would be willing to do that with you two other people i think um sharing it with like my church community um i think car activating authenticity within like your religious organizations i guess your communities in general is so important yeah and like all arms everything out everything there i think that's the way we connect and that's the way we grow together and lastly would be a school friend of mine because she's um she always i don't want to tell you later i burden you you know what if you are tired yeah so i just want to show her i will listen to you stop saying sorry quite hard too hard for a morning thank you thank you for being here no

cT_MTc0jdpE,Keeping our mental health in check during this pandemic | Hush WFH Special Part 3,UCEAGCuChX7adlus-NQOamog,itsclarityco,2021-06-26T12:00:30Z,HushPodcast #itsclarityco The pandemic has taken a significant toll on our mental health. More people in Singapore across different age groups are reportedly ...,"Hi I'm Hazelle, hey it's Azura and I'm Germaine
and welcome back to Clarity's Hush podcast~ Welcome to the last of our three-part work from home special! That's right look at us, we're in similar outfits today! We really got a lot of outfits ah girls? Very comfy outfits today, I love it okay Ok, today we are gonna end this three-part
work from home special with something a bit more serious compared to the first two parts. We're gonna tackle something that has been
on our minds since COVID-19 started it is about how the pandemic has impacted
our social and mental health in the many good bad and ugly ways, so we are going to talk
about a lot of things but before that one question for you girls, okay both Germi and
Zura, what is one of the big losses you have experienced due to the pandemic? Wow... where do we start yeah? Okay I think I know mine for sure, 100% I know the answer. Really? We say together ah. Okay, one two three - Travel. 
- Traveling. Honestly, you know Singapore is so small and
travelling was such an escape for a lot of Singaporeans and we haven't been able to do that in over a year. Exactly. I managed a trip in February and back
then right the virus was already around, it wasn't so rampant right we didn't know
much about it so I was like okay I'm gonna get one last one out before shit hits the fence lah. And where did you go? Uhm I went to...okay I went to Bandung (Indonesia)
for a music festival *laughs* Girl... if only you had known how serious it was, I don't
think you would have dared to even go. I know because now that I think about it right,
like 30,000 people, oh it's a miracle. What about you Hazy? For me, I'm gonna say happiness... happiness
in this in terms of hanging out with my friends you know what I mean? My social life as you all know I'm a very
extroverted kind of person, I love spending my days outside with friends, with my colleagues,
I love the human interaction and I think the pandemic just sort of like took all of that away. In this sense, yeah, I think I lose some happiness
but in other ways, this happiness comes back to me... I have more time my family I spend
more time like working out via zoom with my friends which is something fresh it's something
new that I've never done before. So I think yeah COVID-19... we gain some,
we lose some I'd say. I think that is exactly what it is you know
it's been really tough on a lot of people for the last year, so today we really want
to talk about mental health and dive deep into it What are some ways you can you know take care
of yourself during this pandemic. Right we also found and would like to share
with you guys some resources online on how we can better cope with the ongoing pandemic
and hopefully, they can be beneficial for you Definitely but we're not experts, yea, we'll
share with you you know what worked for us what we tried and what we think you know might
help but I think if you feel like you require that bit of extra attention and help, please
seek advice from the professionals That's right so um just now we mentioned some
of the things that we miss, so for Azura and Germi, it's travelling. For me, it's the human interaction with my
friends, so how do you girls cope with this loss? Okay honestly for me right I'm very much like
Hazelle as well we're always outside and for me I gain inspiration and it drives me when
I'm with friends you know when we sit down for conversations, it's something that I do a lot, So when last year happened and when the CB
(Circuit Breaker) hit us right I thought that you know I was going to be okay because at
the very least I was still going out to work every day while people were at home right
but actually, I found that after a while, it really took a toll on me because I couldn't
sit down with my friends, I couldn't have the exchange of ideas and hence there was
a lot of like pent up you know... There was no release and I was very
uninspired, I was absolutely uninspired. I think there was a time where maybe like
for two or three months I wasn't on social media at all but then when I saw people like Hazelle,
she really was one of them and she was so active I still remember she continued her
subscription Style Theory although she wasn't going out so she takes pictures and her pictures
were like her staircase lah, and you know... It was like I literally recognised those places
but like the fact that she could still keep going and like do stuff like that it really
made me like okay I need to find other sources of inspiration now that you know conversations
or like sitting down hanging out is off the table Exactly I think sometimes you know when we
think about oh we can't travel we can't see our friends it does seem like such superficial
things but this is a very very serious loss right? I think a professor at Monash university they
did say that all these are things that we... it's normal to feel sad about so validate
your own feelings and don't think like, ""oh I shouldn't even be feeling sad about these superficial things"" And the other thing I feel right is that there
will be some people who will invalidate your feelings and tell you like oh you know all
these things that you're talking about, that you're complaining about, these are privileges
that some people don't even have But you know I think because we were so accustomed
to it and yes obviously you know, hanging out, travel and things like that they are
privileges and we do acknowledge that But I think because it was a respite for us
right you know it was a release for us right so when you take that away it becomes
... everybody tries to cope in their own ways I agree finding release like an outlet for
all your negative emotions and feelings it really really helps, so like what Zura mentioned
for me during the Circuit Breaker period, I was actually more active on TikTok, I have had a TikTok account since like years
ago but I never ever put it to use it was only until the circuit breaker period, I started
to scroll TikTok out of boredom and I tell you that [ __ ] is it's so addictive it's
super super addictive and I started to do more dance videos
and workout videos on TikTok and you know what it actually helped me get a better kind
of regime in my lifestyle and that's incredible I never thought like TikTok could do this for me. Can you imagine going through a pandemic without
the internet that would be so lonely oh my goodness Imagine our parents time oh my gosh what would they have done? Even my mom is on her phone now every
day, her smartphone, playing different games watching the news talking to her friends via
WhatsApp she has so many group chats now Wow mama Hazy~
She's very cool She's so hip~ But I'm so thankful for TikTok because that
is where you know during CB, Hazelle and I decided to do a dance together and that's how our
friendship started exactly yeah Exactly! We decided to sort of do a duet it's
like very popular on TikTok right we never knew like an app like this could help us bond together in the first place In a pandemic! And remember when everybody was on um what's that? House party 
Right! Yeah yeah right So mental health experts have mentioned how
loss of access to a lot of coping activities due to the restrictive measures and being
stuck at home in an unconducive environment, like poor family relationships and or abusive
parents for some others, they are unfortunately contributing to our emotional health and I'm
talking about the negative aspect of it So some of our listeners, have actually
contributed their own opinions on work from home so someone said ""my dad plays mahjong
every day and it's so damn loud"". ""Pong ah!"" Don't talk about your dad, even my neighbours
from the next block playing mahjong, I can hear them hear them! Eh, you can hear? I can hear, it's super loud. That's crazy, being at home truly does
open you up to a lot of different things especially because we do a lot of recordings at home,
live streams from home, then I'll have dogs barking my mother's shouting from outside, oh my goodness Hey but I can relate to this other listeners,
one of them actually said ""Stuck in the same wall 24/7."" Hey, why are you in the wall, come out lah! Stuck in the same space lah
Confined. Yeah, yeah yeah, So maybe it feels a bit like... Suffocating? Suffocating, yeah that's right that's right And my sister, for example, she's on work from home so every day she faces that same wall, just the computer and that wall and I can't
even imagine you know 9am to 6pm daily... it's tough lah we got to give it to them. I really cannot imagine, first of all, I can't
imagine myself with a desk job much less having to sit there in your house and I think throughout
the pandemic right, something that I thought about a lot was you know we're very .... at
the very least we're very privileged that we have good homes to be in but imagine people
who are stuck at home in environments which are not great for them if they're stuck with perpetrators for example I think that's very very hard and I think
that's also the reason why we've heard many cases in the past year, we've also you know
seen statistics of you know the hotlines having a major increase in callers. I read this thing where this person said staying
at home social distancing keeping yourself safe from the pandemic all these are privileges
and all these can only be done when you have the means for it right but people with less
than that, I think that's where the challenge really comes in. Yeah I think Azura is right if you're stuck
in a bad situation at home maybe it's an abusive situation, there's no escape because you're
confined to your home right? And I think a lot of people that work from
home also find that they are expected to still work after office hours, still reply the emails
because you're at home. That's right so this is when I want to share
with you earlier in April which is just two months ago a study by AIA Singapore found
that 9 out of 10 Singaporeans have said that their mental health has declined in the last
year and this is very scary ... This 90% of Singaporeans you know That's a lot Exactly and experts have also pointed out
how people are also anxious and losing jobs and unable to find another due to the current economic climate In fact, my mom lost a job because of the whole pandemic last year oh wow
oh How did she take it? I don't think she took it very well so she
spent every day at home and she's just like you know craving to get out because she's
like me, we have to go out every day but i think she made good use of the time she likes
to chant and pray right... So she just made use of the time, staying
home, chanting get getting her mental state back to how it was previously and fortunately
for her, now she has found a new job Oh that's great So yeah now she's going to her office every
day because her job is not it's not one where you can work from home but to her it's great you know So what about you girls do you know of anyone
who got retrenched due to COVID-19 not necessarily but I think it was really difficult for parents
right especially if they have young kids because the kids are home from school, home-based
learning and I've seen like on meetings with my boss where the kid is literally coming into the meeting yes and just asking her like ""mommy mommy can
we play?"" and you can just tell the parents look defeated Oh no.... while you're doing your Gua Sha huh? Yeah but I'm doing my Gua Sha But yeah I think a lot of people you know
faced job insecurity over the last year and because of that, that's probably why mental health declined as well Absolutely and you know when you talk about
mental health it's not just one thing right it's a build-up of many things and I think
this pandemic really released like every single thing that it had for us because first of
all your releases were taken away from you and then these other challenges were you know
placed upon you right There was like job instability people were
worried, they didn't know what was gonna happen and then you have kids running around uh with
HBL and I know that a lot of people are complaining about HBL as well that it was more work for
their parents than anything else and there were also, people were coping with
working from home like completely something that they probably didn't do in the past,
the hours suddenly it was there was no fixed hours people expected it to be available all
the time, people were doing work at every single like time right because there was no boundary anymore there
was no more like separation between work and home and then the release like all gone you
can't sit down outside you can't go out you can't you can't shop outside if that helps you can't travel and I think a lot of people tend to travel
so a lot of us are just like losing our minds right now right? Right but like what Zura mentioned just now
about the working hours, a lot of times we are stressed because our bosses email us or
text us right but we don't reply but if it's out of your working hours then
don't you know this is your mental health at stake so this is just my personal opinion
I know it can be hard to not just reply to that text or the email but you have to be
disciplined you have to be focused in order to get yourself back in shape Exactly you have to set your own boundaries
even though you know this is a situation that none of us ever expected but I wanted to ask
you guys right so what in terms of like what you feel you worry most in this pandemic? Is it your job, your health what's really
gotten you guys stressed? What I really worry about a lot is the health side of things. I have to say circuit breaker feels less scary
than phase two heightened alert (P2HA) to me for some reason yes, um phase two heightened
feels a lot more worrying for me because i think of all the unlinked cases Suddenly there are clusters building up everywhere
the reason Bukit Merah one and then like there's ION orchard, there's Westgate, JEM and it's just it freaks me out yeah exactly and I think for me personally
and maybe for a lot of people in their 20s especially I think no one expected this pandemic
to go on for as long as it did and many people had to celebrate their milestones,
graduations, 21st birthday all in the comforts of their own home and a lot of people felt
like wow most parts of my 20s are being wasted by the time this is done we'll all be done 30. Noooooo Tell me about it you know what I actually
had a dream to go to China to just sort of learn some more things but it obviously cannot
happen because of the whole COVID and by the time this pandemic is over I think I'll be too old for it No no no
No lah Never say never! But it's a fact it's a fact Yeah and remember how you know at the start
of 2020 we were all like ""this is gonna be my year!"" Yeah my ass more like Eh, no lah! Just kidding! Okay okay so it's health for me, what about you girls ? What do you worry about the most about this pandemic? Actually, I have a bit of regret leh Yeah now that I look at it right because so
many people were so quick to adapt during that time, that many people actually managed
to make full use of it and leverage out of it We saw so much creative work come out of the
pandemic they've been like tons and tons and tons of songs that were clearly written during
the pandemic about the pandemic and you know Hazelle has mentioned before
this that you know she managed to do something in the comfort of her own home digitally but
I think for me right because I was stuck in that ok, so for people who know me personally they
know that I'm a boomer lah right It's true But she's on TikTok now! Yay! She has three videos so far! Join the Gen Z, woohoo~ Yes three videos it has been three months
still three videos you'll wait lah until the next one okay but I think because I was so.... it was
hard for me to get out of that funk for a bit, it took me a little bit longer um I really did struggle in that time I feel
to just get out of that funk and get you know inspired, I was so uninspired nothing was inspiring me so there was a period of time during the CB,
around the CB was when I started falling into this rabbit hole .... in this rabbit hole
called Korean drama before that I never watch I tell you (that first) Which one did you watch last year? Many many many I can give you a whole list ah Crash landing on you! That was the first one, that was the start
of everything, that was the problem So that was when I fall into this rabbit hole right So there was a period of time because I had
no release for my emotions I know I wasn't sad because I had nothing to be said about by right and I just wanted to get it out so there was
a bit of time every day... I... So embarrassing... Tell us! So I have these very dim yellow kitchen lights,
so I would turn off all the bright lights, I'll sit in the kitchen I don't know why the
kitchen don't ask me why nobody knows why So orange lights and I'm there on the floor,
and I'm weeping my eyes out I'm bawling every single day, I sit there crouched in the corner
and I cry and cry and cry over people who don't even know I exist la... Like Song Joong Ki? but it's Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin? Ah! Hyun Bin oppa! Oppa? 
Oppa! That one can cry, no problem
That one can cry ah? That one can cry
I can recommend you a whole list of others But I'm sure you're not the only one you know
indulging yourself in Korean dramas just to let out some emotions, in fact, I think that's healthy I don't know leh, it made me so sad at some
point, Irwan (Azura's husband) was like honestly I don't think it's healthy But you know what you came out the other side
and you live to tell the tale, so good job Azura! We're proud of you! But you know what on that note right, I am
very very worried about something, with this pandemic I'm worried about the loss of culture
because you see all of our old hawkers they're all shutting down one by one they can't really
support themselves they can't go digital and this is culture essentially that we're losing slowly but what's heartening to see is some hawkers
with the help of some young teenagers, they just helped to put up a Facebook post
or an Instagram post for example and many people flock down to the stores to support them There has been more than one case that
I've seen it on Mothership already and that's really really heartwarming to see Exactly, actually right okay because I had
this discussion with a friend sometimes I think a while ago so there's something that I do
on my radio show once in a while of which you know because these hawkers they
don't have the technology or you know they just can't adapt to it right they don't know
how to use delivery apps and things like that, so I get people to call in and tell me where
their favourite hawkers are and that people should check it out so I hope
that helped, I don't know if people actually went but you know I think we all try and do
our part to sort of just you know when we are given the opportunity I think conglomerates and huge chains, fast
food chains and things like that they will be able to withstand this, no doubt, but it's
your independent hawkers your independent small restaurants, cafes I think those are
the ones that really really need our help right now If you can just you know run out to get it
instead of ordering, if they don't offer delivery, I think that really helped For sure so that's for our F&B hawkers and
here in Singapore, but I have one question for the both of you what do your family members
or your other halves worry about most about this pandemic? Okay so my boyfriend runs his own business
right and I think businesses have really taken a huge hit after Circuit Breaker last year
they were really struggling, I think and this year he actually told me, ""dear i
don't think I can survive another circuit breaker"". That really broke my heart to hear because
I don't own a business personally it must have been so ridiculously stressful for those who do My goodness, it made me so sad to hear... Asaph, I got nothing to do with my car* but I'll still come lah hor 
(Germi's boyfriend runs a car detailing workshop called Coatconut) You want me to do what? I come Asaph, I buy you coconut! That's how I can contribute But yeah I guess like that's for business
owners, so for my sister herself she's an employee, I think she really worried about
losing this job, getting retrenched due to the entire economic climate I think this is the woes of employees all employees out there. Even us for example like who knows what will
happen tomorrow right? Eh! Choi choi choi Touch wood ah, touch wood! But I think it is a legit concern a legit worry It's true actually, I think somewhere last
year Irwan had a little scare as well I think he had a little like retrenchment scare and
that freaked the [ __ ] out of him because at that point, I think we just bought a house as well So it was a very big concern right because
you know the financial market was not great at that time and because his company has been
in the process of sort of shifting their operations overseas to places where labour is a lot cheaper and things like that So when the pandemic hit and the CB and everything
I think they were downsizing teams in Singapore they thought that okay you know what this
is the time we cut all the Singaporeans, we move everything overseas Then what happened? I think he was very stressed and he's like
kinda will get stressed, anyway um Irwan's bosses listen to this because sometimes Shout out to Irwan's bosses! Irwan rocks! He's a great worker! Yes! He's a great guy, great guy It has happened a couple of times now
where they're like, ""hey Irwan! I was listening to this thing yeah I was thinking,
is that your wife? and then suddenly she mentioned your name and I was like oh yep"" Hello Irwan's bosses! Hello! We love him! Yeah we love him so much but what happened what happened? So, he was very stressed and he was very scared
I think and he's the kind who will think and think and think right and can't function when
you stress whereas I'm the thought who will like aiya, you're stressed also, and think
(so much) you can't do anything right? Yeah it's beyond your control exactly exactly but I think we're very thankful that it didn't
happen that they still retained teams here so he still has a job we're still okay right so you know moving on if listeners out
there listening to us you're experiencing this anxiety, this stress, we're just gonna share
with you our tips on how to keep your mental health in check in just a while but before
that here's a note on how seeking mental health help is not all doom and gloom so psychologists have pointed out how the
increase in those seeking help may be due to the COVID19 for sure but it could also
point to greater awareness of mental health issues and reduce stigma in seeking professional help so please don't feel paiseh or like xiasuay
you know don't dare to just make that call if it helps you go ahead go for it yeah and this increased awareness of you know
mental health issues can also contribute to lots more initiatives lots more funding in
this area so let's keep talking about it and let's really make it an open and honest conversation that's right and I think if you're afraid
about what people might think you know the stigma and things like that I hope you just
remember that you don't owe them a living you do what you need to do for your own self Worddddd Word babe
Louder for the people at the back! Okay so here are some helplines where you

reducing stress while you're working from home and we all have our different ways, Hazelle
said that she likes to write down everything she needs to do yes
yes yes I actually do it Can I show you guys, can I show you guys? please do show and tell? Okay while you do that I'm gonna tell you
about Hazelle, please lah Eligible guys out there wife this woman already She really is the best leh, she will message
me right a whole list, she'll tell me, baby don't forget do this do this do this, bring
this bring this bring this okay and I'm like oh my god I love you so much! Then you marry her lah! Eh? Eh cannot Taken, taken by Irwan But I really enjoy making lists so this is
like my to-do list okay you're kidding
oh my gosh Why so neat one huh? It's very therapeutic and I like to draw little
boxes here so whenever I'm done with it, i just check yeah and I've done it for like a long time already wow
this is like journaling you know For a to-do list, it makes you look very it
makes you feel very calm when you look at it yeah yeah it does it does and I look back
you know um I see what I have accomplished for the day and I feel good about myself so this is a very easy trick for you to relieve
stress, never underestimate the power of freaking to-do list. There we go, there we go because when you
check it off it's like yes I did something yeah
yeah, exactly I made my day productive! When I grow up I want to be like Hazelle
yeah same, but we are already grown ah You realize we've already grown
Yeah your boob's bigger than mine already So speaking of her boobs, Azura! You mentioned that you like to walk around at home? Yes. That's your way of relieving stress? Yes the two-hour idle period that people
say I spend on every day right, so when i get very stressed, it's sort of like a way
to organize my thoughts, you know sometimes you just like so many things
in your mind that you don't really know where to start, what to do, so what I do in that
time while I figure out like for example, I'm gonna start on task one but
I'm figuring out how to get task one done that's when I pace around the house I see, I see what other you know tips do you
guys have for our listeners to reduce stress while you're working from home? Well I think my answer is super apparent is
like almost every day on my Instagram story, go for an exercise session nyeh like I really enjoy my why I see that judging face why? No really I really enjoy my workout sessions
be it just like a post-dinner 30 minutes walk or a session in the gym or a five-kilometre
run for example if I'm feeling like it Or sometimes
Hey Hazy... Yeah? We live right near leh, can you jio me, please? Jio you to run? Azura I'll give you another easy tip and trick. We host every day for four hours... Stand up for the entire four hours. Firstly it's easier for you to project your
energy, secondly you're actually burning more calories when you're standing, instead of
sitting, so for people working from home or in offices, you know you can just get a higher
sort of like table just do your work standing up What if Mediacorp (where the girls work) bought us all those treadmills Yeah, that's why I said this ma! Because I want Then we can walk walk walk while we're talking on air Exactly! Sure fall down! Me at least. But yeah you know you can like take a slow
stroll while doing your work on the treadmill Good idea ah? Really really yeah I think personally for me I would say makingTikTok, but to be truthful with you sometimes making TikTok gets quite stressful. I would think so as well the number of drafts man... Exactly but the time flies when you're making a TikTok. But last year I think what really helped me
down when we were all at home was kind of like cooking dinner with Asaph for the whole family So we would make like take our time to make
really really nice meals and seeing the enjoyment on their faces that kind of made us feel a lot better too Hey don't bluff lor, you also online shopping Both Germi and Zura! They really indulge in online shopping but
there's no right or wrong Yea I don't know what you're talking about Yeah you make your own money, you spend them
the way you like it you're happy it's great hey but honestly right nowadays when I go
to like MBS and stuff like that the queues are so long it's crazy I'm just like, is it
your travel money that you never use that's why you're spending so much? Yeah, I think so leh! The queues were never this long in the past
but now it's just like snaking, even on a weekday. Remember that day? Germi! Oh! Remember we were there like on a weekday afternoon
and the queue was like to the other shop do you remember? Yes the queue outside Chanel
It was ridiculous Were you all there we were there shopping for my birthday gift? Yes! Awww so sweet! Sorry we couldn't go into Chanel the queue was too long Too long, so long! There are so many ways to practice self-care
and really keep your mental health in check and I always believe in positive affirmations
it's something I've started since last year so every day right you may call me crazy but
I'll look in the mirror and I will say um I'm a bitch, I'm a boss I'm a savage!
no, I'll just say that ... Be very specific about the things that you
want to happen in your day for example, ""my shoot will go well today it will all be great!"",
""the client will be happy"", ""I'm going to have a great day"" And I really feel like it's a self-fulfilling prophecy Especially if you smile and you say it, it
makes a difference yeah so can I share with you guys something that
I've been practising only um since the past week? Okay so uh now I have been um sort of like
getting myself to write down three things that I'm thankful or grateful for that happened
in the day so I will share them on air what I'm grateful for today it can be something as easy as I had a great
meal at home, it can be something as easy as it's raining today but I got to Mediacorp
safely and I'm thankful for that or it can be something like I managed to squeeze
in time for like a 30 minutes quick brisk walk after my dinner before my show simple things but once you put them down into
words or you verbalize them you will feel that, ""eh I actually feel better about myself"" That's so nice
Such a good practice She's so wholesome
I love it Wife her! Then today on your show can you tell them
that you're thankful for Hush recording? Of course! More specifically can you be thankful for us? Always! Always. You girls are always in my mind, what are
you talk about? Oh my gosh. Ok, actually on a more serious note right,
I just want to address that, while we're spending a lot of time at home and while a lot of people
are struggling you know to get out of what they were used to and to adjust to this new norm I think there are also people and it's also
very normal for us to fall into this little space where we feel or we see how much people
are doing and we feel like I'm not doing as much, I'm not doing enough, you know I'm not
getting my life in order at home and things like that and I think it's important that you cut yourself
some slack and not feel bad about it that you don't compare your progress with someone else's if taking the day off to do nothing if that
helps you then so be it, it doesn't matter if somebody else I don't know ran a marathon
that day it doesn't matter exactly and it could be something as simple
as putting on a face mask, lighting a candle and basking in the smell of the candle right
and there are so many different things you can use for self-care if you are someone that
loves journaling and smelling candles and all that definitely I think you can go into
ZALORA find a whole bunch of different items and just take care of yourself there are even tech items like headphones
if you love listening to music, I know we all do and I think on that note I also want to share
how important it is to document your day, so for example you went online and you bought
a bunch of stuff when the parcel arrives take a photo of you unboxing them I think it's important to... I don't dare Because Irwan will scold you hello! No, but I think it's important to keep track
of the little things in life, you know so when you look back like what Zura mentioned
just now when you see someone else like ew her day is so packed you know where does she
get so much time? but you feel like you did nothing, it's actually
not that you did nothing you know maybe you forgot about them, maybe all the
little things they slipped off your mind, so it's actually important to document them
and then look back on your day and things like oh actually I did this today, I received
this today, this made me happy many many little things that you can do that's true and you know let's not compare
ourselves to other people we're all unique we are all different and we all have different
ways of coping and helping our mental health I think personally for me sometimes getting
dressed up you know wearing nice clothes even though we're at home in frumpy yeah so I just wanted to show you guys I think
we're all in similar outfits today! yes, all of the trimmings is so cute right!
yeah look at mine yeah! very nice!
yeah yeah so these are all really comfy work from home,
I'm literally just wearing a blazer you could wear anything on the bottom no one knows right
and these we all... Germi's wearing her panties, nothing else. Hey, excuse me! I am wearing panties lah, but Inside or outside? Wash already or not? On my head lah later! Yeah so all these we got them from ZALORA
and I think they've got such a huge range of very comfortable loungewear great for work from home At very reasonable prices Exactly I also want to shout out a Z-mart
where you can get snacks! Germi! for you to replenish your snack tower in your room. Expose me sia... Oh right remember we had like candles on one
of our episodes of Hush podcast? Candles also serve as a form of stress relievers
and you can also find them on ZALORA That's right and if you want to save a bit
of money when you're shopping on ZALORA for any of these things clothes, snacks, tech
items you can actually use these two promo codes especially for our Hush listeners the
first one is HUSH30 for new customers you get 30% off and 35% cashback no minimum spend. That's like 65% off hello! That's incredible but if you are existing
customers like us you can use HUSH25 for 25% off plus 5% cashback with a minimum spend of $80 That's right and that one you can use multiple

stuff I can cart out again! Are you okay? Okay so these promo codes are valid from 24th
until 30th of June so make sure you don't miss out okay so for about um from today la to 30th of June That's right all right go get it my girls that's right and guys! correct everybody can shop at ZALORA and the
best thing is you know the range of stuff that they have they have kid items, home stuff
electronics, like they mentioned earlier the best thing is they deliver so quickly right
if you need it like urgently they even have next day delivery and its free returns so if it doesn't fit you just send back lah yay! All right with that, we have come to the end
of our three-part work from home special before we end a reminder to all to be socially responsible okay so that everything will go back to normal
and we can hang out with our friends outside yeah that's right I think you know we really have
to think about the community as a whole and being socially irresponsible could mean like
for example, you don't want to wear a mask when you go out or you hang out in groups of more that... Why you sovereign meh? Got badge?! and you know like hanging out with people
more than the gathering limit, breaking the rules flouting the rules and stuff like that
let's just do our best to try and minimize social contact, so that we can all go back to normal that's right see a doctor if you're unwell
and most importantly wear your mask and wear it properly, cover your mouth and your nose
area okay everyone has a part to play in the fight against COVID19 and being vigilant is
critical if we want to keep our freedom absolutely and we hope that you take care
of yourselves as well, take care of your mental health you know put yourself first as selfish
as that sounds but you know if you're not going to be happy people around you can't be happy, if you can't you know be happy and take care
of yourself, you can't take care of people around you as well that's right also shout out to our front liners,
people who can't work from home to stay safe and stay healthy thank you so much once again for listening

Z3-XSUjMUk4,Living in a Psychiatric Ward for Two Weeks for my Mental Health,UCAZ7NfSRX1reSpRUw0xtEmg,Something Private,2020-10-10T04:45:01Z,"This World Mental Health Day (10 Oct), we want to know, how are you doing, really? On this episode, Nicole speaks to Belle, who admitted herself to a two week ...","Belle: so when i went in i was very fearful everyone 
was looking at me because i was the newbie   they didn't allow me to walk in they had to push 
me in on a wheelchair yeah so they pushed me   in and because i was on suicide watch i couldn't 
even go to the toilet by myself when i went to pee   the nurse had to stay outside with the door 
slightly ajar it was very awkward and do   you know that even the toilets they don't have 
mirrors because they're afraid that people might   Nicole:break it 
Belle: break it and cut themselves and if there is it's actually made out of metal yeah and   you have to keep all your belongings even your 
skin care soap you have to keep it with them and   you have to request for it every time you want 
to shower they're very very strict about them   Nicole: in her words it's a sub-series from something 
private featuring lesser-known stories of women   who've survived unspeakable pains and triumphed 
women who succeed despite and against all odds   this is their story so october 10th is world 
mental health day and it's really important to   us at something private we've done a couple of 
episodes previously on mental health awareness   one with a lovely psychiatrist named dr kamini at 
the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic this year   and dr kamini wisely told us that self-care is 
really important and it is whatever you define   it to be today we speak with a young woman 
named belle who shares her experience living   in a psychiatric ward for two weeks the kicker she 
voluntarily admitted herself in hopes of getting   better something belle said that really resonated 
with me in this particular episode is that you   don't have to wait until your mental health 
deteriorates before you seek help it's good to   have good mental health all the time and i think 
i'm i feel very guilty of this because i often   overwork myself and i harbor a lot of guilt around 
seeking help because you know i think i'm this   strong independent thing who can handle everything 
on her own but i think listening to belle's story   was a really good reminder for me and i hope that 
when you guys listen to this episode that it will   be a good reminder for you as well here's belle's story Belle: hi everyone i'm belle i'm 24 this year so i just came back from australia not too long 
ago i studied there for four years so i was   studying occupational therapy and i'm currently 
working in a hospital as an occupational therapist   or an ot so i think everyone might be wondering 
what an ot does so an ot usually helps people with   an injury and illness or those who have a 
disability to become independent in their   daily activities again so be it by using equipment 
by adapting their activity or their environment   Nicole: okay so like i mentioned just now we are doing 
this episode in awareness of mental health world mental   health day which is in 10 days and you have a 
very unique experience that you'll be sharing   on the podcast so um i think maybe what 
you can do is to first tell me like   um like to briefly sum up like uh what was 
the experience that you went through Belle: so after struggling with anxiety and depression for a while 
as a new grad occupational therapist i was um   admitted to a hospital to stay in a psychiatric 
work for two weeks just to be safe so yeah just   like anybody who started off their new job 
i was very nervous i had difficulty sleeping   but everyone told me it'll go away 
because you know it's normal to feel anxious   about being in a new environment meeting new 
people and especially for a foreign grad it would   normally be a culture shock at first so i thought 
it would go away but it didn't instead the symptoms   just became worse so other than just having 
difficulty sleeping i was also quite breathless   i started to have gastric issues as well gastric 
cramps i felt very nauseous in the morning and   afterwards i started to even have panic 
attacks so it could be no reason at all i'd   just be lying in bed and then i was feeling very 
uncontrollably fearful and just felt i was gonna   die can't breathe trembling shaking perspiring 
crying so yeah just became worse after that   Nicole: and how how do you i mean like when these these 
symptoms like manifested like what was like your   response to it like did you just like oh this 
is normal i mean there must have been some point   where you were like i i don't think this is 
okay like i'm not in a good state like i need   like did you seek help from like your immediate 
like family members or like people around you   yeah so initially i thought that anxiety was 
normal so feeling breathless or you know just   feeling fearful about the day in general but i 
think i started to realize that it was becoming   more and more unhealthy when i started to become a 
lot more depressed so i was a lot more withdrawn   i didn't want to see my friends anymore i didn't 
want to do the things i like to do anymore   yeah and so i started to rely on more 
of i guess my immediate family because i   didn't want to go out so then my sister and i 
started to rely a lot on my boyfriend as well   so he had to come over every day after work just 
to make sure i feel more comforted after a long   day at work i was very avoidant about work 
at first so the moment i stepped out of the   hospital and i went back home i wouldn't want 
to talk about work at all i just wanted their   company to maybe have dinner to watch tv but that 
meant that i wasn't facing the problems at all   so i just wanted to come home see my boyfriend 
sitting there waiting for me he didn't even have   to say anything yeah but I gradually realised that 
it was quite unhealthy after a while because then   it was that over reliance on him as well he 
has to be there otherwise i'll feel very very   anxious and very very depressed um and later on i 
think that this the doctor described it to be like   sort of an enmeshed relationship 
which is sort of like a co-dependence where   um we can't i guess the most the easiest way to 
say it would be like we can't live without each   other we don't we cannot give each other the 
space and time apart um i really need him to   be here and he feels like he needs to be 
here as well otherwise he'll feel guilty   because if he leaves if he goes home if he 
meets his friends then i'll be crying and feeling suicidal Nicole: i'm interested to know because 
like it seems as if like it started out as uh like symptoms of anxiety depression but like 
it seems as if like along the way it started   to fester and then into something yeah it 
took a wrong turn yeah yeah yeah i mean   you you acknowledge that like um 
there is a situation where you   didn't want to face a problem right so i mean i'm 
assuming that would have contributed to i guess like a decline Belle: yeah i guess you're right um for 
me i'm not really sure when it took a wrong turn   i think it was just very overwhelming the whole 
thing um and it started doing circuit breaker   as well and with circuit breaker comes with a 
lot of changes not being able to go out at all   and then i even had him live with me for a while 
during that whole period so then i became very   very reliant yeah and because i was feeling more 
and more unwell i took a lot of mc's as well   so then it felt like i should be 
at home and i shouldn't go to work   so that's how i started to max out my mcs and 
my leaves yeah and it became very unhealthy   because then the only thing i can think 
of is just spending time with him and not   thinking about work at all so just escaping 
the problem altogether even the thought of   him going home for dinner wasn't an option the 
moment he stepped out the door i'll be crying   i'd be texting him non-stop i'll be calling him 
crying on the phone saying you know i feel like   dying i feel very depressed i can't function 
without you can you can you please come back   Nicole: and i'm guessing that took quite a 
bit of a that put an emotional like toll yeah on him  Belle: definitely it's very very 
draining um i started to see how it impacted   him negatively as well so you know i break down 
so often but then to see him break down and   be a lot more teary emotional crying as well 
um then i realized that you know i really   need to do something because otherwise we'll 
just i'll just be dragging him down as well   Nicole: was there like like did he have that 
conversation with you or like how did it pan out Belle: because i was feeling very very suicidal 
and i can get quite specific in detail as   to what i want to do so i think that's quite 
can be very scary for the person listening   it's very overwhelming for the person as well yeah i think my sister overheard our 
conversation and she said she said you   really need to stop look what you're doing 
to him so then i really reflected on it   Nicole: and from that like what was the what's the 
takeaway so with that i think we knew that   i needed to speak to someone who's more trained i 
think the easiest way to go about it would be just   to contact a family service center point of time 
i was very fearful and very very tired of speaking   to people and explaining so again i was very 
lucky that my sister and my boyfriend were both   very supportive and they were the ones that did 
their googling and they were the ones that called   the fsc and my boyfriend was the one that had to 
describe the whole situation to the person with me   just sitting next to him yeah because i i was very 
fearful i didn't want to share at all so i went to   speak to the counselor at the fsc and because he 
was a circuit breaker it was more of a phone call   and she taught me techniques like deep 
breathing or like trying to distance yourself   from your thoughts but it didn't change 
the fact that i was still having a lot of   panic attacks yeah so i felt then it was 
a lot more biological physiological than   than just my thoughts yeah and i think she noticed 
that as well because i told her like i really   can't you know think straight when i'm in that 
state like i'm just so overwhelmed that i can't   start doing my deep breathing and counting 
you know just like rolling the floor crying   so she then recommended me to uh see a doctor get 
a referral to see a psychiatrist and that's what i   did they managed to push the appointment forward i 
think by month because it was getting quite urgent   i was really getting worse so they called them 
up and then i went to see the psychiatrist there   and um i was crying while i was talking to 
her yeah so i think that shows that i was   really really distressed yeah and she asked me 
then if i wanted to be admitted but i said no   because she said if you admitted then you have 
no phones and we are not sure if your family   can visit or your boyfriend can visit because 
it's covid so i said no i don't want and at   that appointment she diagnosed me with anxiety 
and depression and she gave me some medications   and then she advised my counselor and my family 
members to just watch out and if i were to   have any uh worsening symptoms or if i became very 
suicidal then to bring me to the A&E  Nicole: is it like normal for them to like immediately prescribe like 
a stay in the hospital once you're diagnosed with   Belle: i don't think it's all the time 
that you'll do that i think it's   when they ask you do you have any thoughts 
of killing yourself um do you have a plan   then that's when they decide that you know maybe 
hospital admission is a safer option because then   you're in a safe space you don't have access to 
any forms of killing yourself whatsoever so that's   when they will offer it to you and i think my 
behavior then was already quite evident that i was   very very depressed and i think for her to 
diagnose me it has to take a while and it has been   my symptoms have been there for a long time that's 
how she diagnosed me and that's why she offered   hospital admission because she thought then i 
would get a lot more aggressive treatment i'll   get psychologists and ots to see me there more 
regularly yes compared to if i were to be waiting   um outpatient which might take like months Nicole: okay so you mentioned that you didn't you didn't   decide that you wanted to you want to stay yeah 
it wasn't an immediate thing so but i knew that   it was option and option then okay so yeah what 
what led up to the actual stay or like a rather   like what happened after that after that you 
went home so i went home i took my medications   every day but i was still very anxious yeah 
i think there's a limit to how effective the   medications can be especially towards because if 
i took it every night then towards the evening   evening then the symptoms will come back and 
when you first take the medications actually   there are a lot of side effects as well so 
the first few days of taking my medications   um i was very very dizzy and i was very drowsy 
i couldn't even get out of bed and did you know that   actually sometimes taking antidepressants 
can make you feel more depressed first before   feeling better i didn't know that i didn't 
know yeah so until i experienced it for   myself and my friend who works in the mental 
health industry she told me that yeah as well   so i was actually a lot more depressed 
afterwards and that was when i really didn't   want to get out of bed i needed my boyfriend 
to physically pull me up to get some breakfast   yeah because i had no appetite yeah so 
after that i tried to go back to work but um the symptoms were still there and i think 
another major change was that because at first   initially my boyfriend was still looking for 
a job so he was there most of the time but uh   then he had to move out to start his new job 
so that was a yeah so that was another major   change for me to adapt to which is that your 
boyfriend yeah he had to move out yet to leave   and you know i was still so overly reliant 
on him so that was a very very big change   for me that i couldn't handle yeah i went to 
work the very first day of his his first day   of work and then i broke down so even walking 
towards the hospital i was already crying   and then i walked straight into 
the toilet and i stayed there for   an hour even after work started yeah so i i texted 
my colleague and i think she told my supervisor so   she had to physically go to the toilet and 
get me out and i was still crying non-stop   so my when my supervisor came to find me and she 
got me out of the toilet and she sat me down and   tried to comfort me i didn't stop crying because 
i was still feeling yeah i was i was still crying   because i didn't feel better crying didn't make 
me feel better so as i was crying she asked me   so was i feeling very suicidal and i thought 
i was and that's when i think she said that she   didn't feel safe for me to go home myself i had to 
call my sister to come down pick me up to go home   yeah and the next day i was still very 
depressed didn't want to get out of the bed and then i think because i 
maxed out my mc's and my leaves my workplace supervisor told my sister to 
bring me to A&E so that's how i ended up in A&E and the doctors there and asked me if i 
wanted hospital admission again and i said yes   i was very fearful at the clinic they got 
the psychiatrist to come down to see me   and she then offered me again the option 
of staying inside in a psychiatric ward i only said yes because they said that 
they will allow my sister to sleep over   and when i went in i was very fearful 
because you know i watch a lot of   movies and then they paint a very bad 
picture of how psychiatric words are   um like people banging their heads on the 
wall or screaming but it wasn't like that   but you could tell that that look that people give 
you when you when you tell them you're in ward 33   because that was the one i was in um was it in it 
was in NUH yeah so i live in the east everyone   was asking me why i went all the way 
to NUH for my treatment but i think my   boyfriend my sister did some googling and they 
had a lot of good reviews from NUH so i went there   so when i went in i was very fearful everyone 
was looking at me because i was the newbie   they didn't allow me to walk in they 
had to push me in on a wheelchair   so they pushed me in and because i was on suicide 
watch i couldn't even go to the toilet by myself   when i went to pee the nurse had to stay outside 
with the door slightly ajar it was very awkward   interesting yeah um it's quite annoying but 
yeah i understood why they had to do that   and being in a ward means following their rules so 
apart from not having access to my phone um even   having your family members like pass you their 
phone for video calls or what it's not allowed   and you're not allowed to leave the ward as well 
so because i think also because of the Covid situation you don't allow patients to go out yeah 
um and of course the usual rules like lights out by   9 30. so you can only use the ward phones 
from nine to nine yeah and then because um my boyfriend was only available after nine 
even that i couldn't speak to him at all   yeah i could only speak to him if he had 
very very short break times during the day for me i think the main thing was being in patient   pajamas it was a very new experience because 
you know i've been a healthcare professional   i've been working with patients but i think being 
a patient myself was a very different experience   i think wearing the uniform the pajamas everyday 
constantly reminded me that i was there for   treatment and the fact that the nurses were so 
strict with the phone rule so i they constantly   came in and like kind of like reprimanded me for 
using my family's phone to video call my boyfriend   i was very very irritated and then after staying 
there for a while i also felt like sort of like a   cabin fever like you know i come and leave i can't 
even go down for a meal to get some fresh air and   do you know that even the toilets they don't have 
mirrors because they're afraid that people might   break it break it and cut themselves and if 
there is it's actually made out of metal yeah and   you have to keep all your belongings even your 
skin care soap you have to keep it with them and   you have to request for it every time you want 
to shower they're very very strict about it yeah and there's no soap 
Nicole: so if the circumstances 
i mean it's not actually they didn't tell you from   the start that like like they laid out the terms 
from the stuff for you right and they don't seem   like entirely like favorable in that exactly you 
say it's like camping fever right like industrious   if you are trapped in that space
Belle: it does but i guess um it was a good it was a good thing   that i admitted myself um it can be a very safe 
respite for you so having that space away from   everyone not having to go to work sometimes 
going home can be a source of stress for you   so actually i think that the hospital walk 
can also be a really safe space for you away   from all your stresses yeah so having 
the help of the multi-disciplinary team   within the ward is very helpful like the nurses 
the doctors and the therapists the psychologists   so always having easy access to 
them is a very very good thing   rather than waiting for months outside 
Nicole: so i guess like you kind of traded like a bit of freedom for   access to like healthcare 
Belle: yeah i mean at first it 
felt like i was surrendering my autonomy to them   which was true yeah but if you really focus 
on getting better that's why i said you know   the whole idea of even wearing the patient 
pajamas reminded me why i was there my purpose   which was to get better so then i felt a lot 
more motivated to participate in the treatments so as the psychiatrist the doctors they were 
trying to figure out what was the cause of my   behaviors and my symptoms the psychologist was 
also working with me to kind of challenge my   negative thoughts people don't really understand 
what happens in there and that's why i want to be   here to share where when you're in there you 
are supposed to be safe seeking treatment so i said that i didn't want any medications to make 
me so drowsy that i can't even think straight   yeah and i didn't want to be tied down and 
i told them that right at start and they   can only do that when you start being very 
aggressive to the staff and other patients   because that's to keep them safe as well yeah 
but otherwise they wouldn't do that to you   and you mentioned just now that like 
i didn't know that i assumed that   where you would have been admitted to 
is like IMH Belle: yeah i think a lot of   people think that only IMH would be able 
to help mental health patients but there are   other hospitals that also offer a psychiatric 
ward like the one i went is a lot smaller   but um they also have a team of doctors who are 
specialized in psychiatry and i think the other   hospital would be CGH i'm not so sure about the others
Belle: so two weeks does seem a bit like a   short time what were some of like the 
biggest challenges and takeaways for you   yeah i guess the idea that i'm stuck there 
became very apparent after a week there   because i guess you're stuck in the same 
space doing the same things over and over that's when i felt like it was safe 
because i couldn't kill myself so i could only become stronger like when my friend asked me about 
how my experience was in there   i said that it was so difficult and i really 
wanted to kill myself but because i couldn't   i could only become more resilient and also 
realizing who will be there for you i think   knowing i really kind of realized who are my 
stronger forms of support when i was in there   my sister acted like my pa because i 
couldn't have my phone she was the one   organizing who would be visiting me because of 
their strict visiting policy so only two people   can be in the ward at a time and the whole 
day you can only have up to five visitors   and before they took away my phone i sneakily 
texted all my closest friends and i said hey i'm   here like come and some of them didn't even know 
that i had this diagnosis so they're very shocked   and they later on my sister had to explain to them 
Nicole: it sounds a bit as if like they were helping you   it's not only like to get better but to have like 
measured steps towards like getting well    Belle: yes so only when i was admitted to the hospital what then 
they kind of revised my diagnosis to adjustment   adjustment disorder and that's actually just so 
from anxiety and depression they kind of like   made it more specific to adjustment disorder and 
i haven't heard of that before and i think it's   just like uh it's supposed to only last for about 
six months usually after a major change in your   life like there's this very abnormal excessive 
response to it and it can come in a form of   symptoms that are like anxiety depression yeah 
so that's what i understand of adjustment disorder   yeah and they kind of use the addiction model 
to describe my behavior it was very strange at   first so i told the doctor that i really need his 
physical presence and suddenly he had this like   eureka moment so i said you know i can't it 
doesn't make me feel better when i speak to him on   the phone or when i see him over video call i need 
him to be here i just need his physical presence   when he talks to me i don't feel better and he 
was like let's all start using the addiction model   then he started telling all the other doctors they 
was like what is going on it was like oh like it   so happens i'm the addiction specialist and um i'm 
gonna be very blunt it seems that as though you're   addicted to him like he's a substance drug or a 
drink that you can go to when you feel stressed   so when i start feeling very anxious i'll cling 
onto him like a koala so you know then he sort of   becomes more of a physical entity than a person 
i was like oh my gosh that sounds terrible but   now it makes a lot of sense so when he leaves 
i start to have withdrawal symptoms and   then that's why you can see me crying shaking 
all this it really looks as though i'm a drug   addict you know not getting my drug and that's 
why the whole no phone thing started to make a   lot more sense because if you think about seeing 
or like seeing him that's like my family giving   me access to drugs so that's not gonna help 
me yeah so what would help me to get better   is to kind of have a more cold turkey approach 
where i have a lot more stricter boundaries and um yeah boundaries as to when i can speak to him 
and when i can see him yeah i guess because i was   sort of pushing my limits over and over again so 
just before i was admitted i told him like what   can i do before you can see me should i should 
i hurt myself should i attempt to kill myself so   because it was almost his 
first day of working then   he was apart from me so i said that i was very 
desperate i said what can i do before you can come   should i be at the edge of a building 
should i cut myself what should i do   and what did he say yeah and that's when he 
became a lot more emotional and said just   please stop this yeah i think knowing when 
to stop when your limit is is very important   yeah so that's why i admitted myself 
because i wanted to give him that space   yeah so it's not just for myself but i 
feel like it's also for his well-being   and the doctors also recognized that so during 
my stay they also contacted him quite frequently   sharing with him the plan saying hey can you 
stop calling belle so often she needs to get   better because i guess you're not helping me 
there's that co-dependence as well so he feels   like he's quite concerned so he every time he 
has a time or a break he would try to call me   but it's actually not advisable so 
Nicole: okay i mean you mentioned that um   you guys started to in your psychiatric stay 
there like the doctor decided that oh we   applied the addiction model right so like how did 
things turn up after that yeah after you i guess   like this the eureka moment he realized that 
this is what's going on yeah so knowing that   um it has somehow turned into an 
addiction um being in the ward   really helps because cold turkey treatment 
is actually very effective for drug addicts   so i guess um i was very motivated because 
and i was also very desperate so yeah so   at the one week mark i became very very frustrated 
at my own situation because i didn't feel i was   getting better i was still breaking down 
some nights and i called my boyfriend   i called my boyfriend one night and i said like 
i'm already here i'm already subjecting myself to   this like what else do you want me to do so 
that was what happened like halfway through   somehow the days there felt very long so even 
though two weeks might seem like a very short   time but after a while yeah each day 
because it becomes quite repetitive felt quite wrong    Nicole: so how did the rest of the stay 
go about
Belle: i was following the plan religiously so   um when they left i started writing yeah so 
the first few days was very difficult because   as usual i was very very anxious the woman i was 
left alone i was crying and i called my sister   and said get me out of here this is a prison and 
then the nurses tried to calm me down and say girl   this is not a prison i'm like this is worse than a 
prison i have to pay to be treated like a prisoner yeah so they're like oh can i give you 
some medications to calm you down and then   if you want to leave you can because 
this is a voluntary admission   you can speak to the doctors tomorrow i said no 
i want to speak to the on-call doctor because i   work in a hospital i know that they have on-call 
doctors but they're still trying to calm me down   until the next day yeah it was very difficult 
but then i started to see some progress   and when i spoke to my counselor so my counselor 
actually came all the way from the fsc to NUH to   speak to me as well she said you know that 
it's okay to still break down sometimes   you have to be kinder to yourself and see actually 
see the progress that you have been making so then   i realized actually yeah it's true there's some 
progress i started having lesser panic attacks   i didn't feel so breathless anymore um so she 
said you was like taking two steps forward   one step back you're still making progress 
at the end of the day and you have to praise yourself for that and be kinder to 
yourself in that sense yeah so acknowledge   any progress that you're making 
Nicole: so i guess like with that mantra i helped you through the rest of   the remaining days there yeah you i realized after 
that that you really just you only have yourself   to rely on at the end of the day to become more 
resilient you have to be more self-sufficient   so i guess not allowing my family or my friends 
to stay over the night really forced me to become   more independent again so then i realized you 
know i was studying alone in australia and i   didn't have any issues and yeah so the doctors 
actually asked me in their very first interview   so how would you describe yourself then 
i was like what kind of question is that   um then i said before this all started i would 
say that i'm quite independent person because   you know i chose to go to perth because i knew 
that lesser singaporeans were going there for   the occupational therapy course i wanted to be 
away from singapore and really be immersed in a   new culture and do things by myself so i would 
say that i'm actually quite independent person   and my sister also said you know you just 
forgot how you were but we we know how you are   and you know that you can go back to that 
person that we know yeah so then i started   think when i was in australia i also had 
to manage stress on my own so what did i do   then i realized i really like writing typing or 
writing doesn't matter so that was what i started   doing so that day when i broke down and then the 
nurses tried to calm me down with medications and   i was still like like sobbing right i went to 
the content i said can you give me some paper   in my teary state then then the nurses handed 
me like a thick set of paper and i started just   writing non-stop and i wrote until i was tired 
and i realized that that was the only time i was   comfortable with being alone and then i felt like 
hey that's actually a familiar feeling you know   feeling better after writing down all my thoughts 
yeah and that's what i did for the remaining time   i was there yeah i said i guess everyone 
has their own ways of coping with stress   and what i did when i was in australia was that 
i wrote and typed a lot when i was feeling lonely   or feeling stressed and the very night when 
i was left alone after my family left at nine   after sniffing and crying what not then yeah 
i got to the counter and asked for a stack of   paper and i started writing and i kept writing 
until the medications made me feel drowsy and i   started to feel like hey actually writing is the 
only way i can feel comfortable with being alone and it really helped so and writing really 
clears your mind puts you into perspective   so that was what i did for the rest of my stay i 
think the main takeaway from that would be that   then i could set clearer boundaries for myself 
and for for my boyfriend as well because i think   the boundaries became very blur after a while 
especially when he started to move in with me   um that's when i sort of expected that hey 
like since he's really moved moved in like   actually he's my boyfriend he should be able 
to drop everything for me that kind of thing   yeah um yeah you know what that was 
when i realized that you really need to   know what you can and cannot control so i 
really wrote down things that you can control   like your you can be prepared for the week 
to come so you can you know make sure that   whatever you can prepare for you do so like 
you know for my work then make sure that i prepare my clothes and i make sure that i 
try not to use my phone too much before i sleep   um you can prepare for a week that you can 
look forward to so you know insert days where   you're gonna meet your friends for dinner or 
go for a movie things that you look forward to   and acknowledge things that you cannot control 
so i guess the source of my anxiety was because   i felt so out of control all the time i was so 
scared of the things that i cannot be certain   about so i really wrote down things that i cannot 
control which is external circumstances like   covid the culture the environment the 
rules even the medication side effects um   things that you cannot control would be also like   i guess other people's reactions and 
expectations but what you can control   is your own expectations and your own behavior 
so i told myself you know you can be patient   you can be understanding you can be supportive 
and i even wrote down examples because you know   sometimes when you feel so overwhelmed you can't 
even think straight and i also wrote down things   what people can tell me when i'm 
feeling very overwhelmed so i wrote down   and i actually gave it to my boyfriend and 
one day when i was feeling very distressed i   actually handed him the paper and i say can 
you just read this and read it back to me   it felt very awkward at first but i wrote things 
like um please don't offer me solutions like   can you show me some empathy can you name and 
acknowledge my emotions can you say something   like you know i know it has been very difficult 
for you you must be feeling very anxious or angry   because of so and so and then you insert the 
reason to show that you have been paying attention   so i think that really makes the person feel 
hurt and feel like you know their experiences   are valid i actually wrote down what my boyfriend 
should say to me when i'm upset because you know   he struggled to find what to say to me so 
i wrote like can you please not offer me   solutions when i'm upset because more 
often than not i really thought about   it and doesn't work for me or at least 
i'm not willing to accept any form of   suggestions or solutions at that point 
of time i'm just very overwhelmed so like i said can you please 
name and acknowledge my emotions   can you show me empathy can you say things that i 
know it has been very very difficult for you and   i know that i can see that you're feeling very 
anxious because of so and so insert the reason   because the reasons might change every time and 
to show that you're really listening to the person you have to sort of figure out why they 
are feeling the way they do as well   and i also kind of analyzed why 
i was feeling what i was feeling   so you know anxiety is usually because 
you feel like you're not in control   um yeah same for anger yeah so that's 
why i thought that writing down what i   can and cannot control was very helpful 
for me 
Nicole: let's talk a bit about after you   were completed your psychiatric stay and 
then you reintegrate them back into your   life how's the transition like for you and i 
guess like how are you hoping now actually the   medical team suggested at least two weeks so it 
can be up to a month it can be up to three months   usually for addiction you need at least three 
months to get better um but i think by the   end of two weeks i was like i have had enough here 
i'm gonna leave gonna spread my wings and fly away   because i i guess i started to really understand 
the plan and i felt that there wasn't a need for   me to be in the ward anymore i could just do that 
outside with the help of my friends and family   i told myself that two weeks is 
enough so after writing down my plans and how i'm gonna you know prepare for the 
week to come i showed the doctor the list   of all the things that i wrote for myself 
and then i said i want to go home today   yeah and he said yes okay yeah i think 
you've shown me that you are ready to go home   i think because i also had sort of some 
knowledge in school um previously on how   the importance of having a recovery plan so 
i think they call it like a rep plan so it's   like a wellness recovery action plan so before 
a patient can be discharged from the psychiatric   walk they have to show that they have a plan as to 
how they're gonna manage if they experience their   triggers and their symptoms again and if they can 
prove that they have a safe and healthier plan   then they can go what was your plan so i 
wrote down the things that i'll do when i'm   out that's why i said you know it's important 
to be prepared for the week to come so and i already know what my triggers are and 
i already told my family and my boyfriend   how to react to me when when i'm feeling 
distressed so i thought that i was ready to go Nicole: i want to know like so from then on after 
let's stay until now how has like the journey been like for you  Belle: i guess i want to emphasize that like 
recovery is definitely not a one-way street like   it's definitely gonna be a very long and arduous 
journey i think even now i'll tell people that   i don't think i'm 100 recovered yet there's still
days where i break down and i feel very suicidal   um it's definitely not going gonna be easy for 
me or for people around me so yeah even though i   tell people that i don't think i'm 100 recovered 
yet yesterdays where i feel uncontrollably sad   fearful or angry and even my doctors 
said that you know medications only form   30 of the equation and the rest of the 
70 is actually just you so i guess you   really need to pace yourself and have more 
realistic expectations of yourself like for me   i think they describe me to have like a very 
anxious and rigid personality i can be quite a   perfectionist and i don't allow room for mistakes 
and that can really create a lot of unnecessary   stress from for myself so um i have gone back 
to work but i've only gone back part time   so i guess really slowly easing yourself back to 
a more a healthier routine would be very helpful   and keep yourself busy with things that you like 
to do of course don't tire yourself out by what   i did while still on leave so even after i was 
discharged i was still on leave for about two weeks   yeah and during that two weeks i kept myself busy 
because my boyfriend was away for work so i just   met up with friends i joined a gym membership 
i went for f45 like every day um i even tried   painting with my mom so i guess like reconnecting 
with the things that i like to do and reconnecting   my friends and family because i guess while i 
was so overwhelmed with my anxiety and depression   previously um i only thought of sticking to my 
boyfriend and i kind of forgot about everything   and everyone else so i guess that was a good 
time for me to sort of go back to the things that   i used to do and i was very hesitant to start 
part-time work because then i'll be thinking   oh no my pay is gonna be sliced in half you know 
then what about my plans for you know getting a   house or this savings are gonna take a toll 
and even the thoughts of you know going for   um medical visits they're also gonna cost money but yeah i realized that these are 
just important steps that i need to take to   become better and i went when i do become 
better again then all this will be worth   Nicole: i want to ask like i think for love 
like everything that you have experienced right   i think as a member of like our generation 
i think that we are quite self-aware of like   mental health as a whole right and like it's 
important but i think sometimes the there's quite   a big barrier to like seeking help or like taking 
that step taking that first step out of i guess   like a bad state or whatever state that you're 
in to want to improve right or like i think one   i once spoke the psychiatrist who said um quite 
accurately that you know people are willing to pay   like 200 for like a retail session but like they 
aren't willing to pay the same amount of money to   seek help for like their mental health right so i 
want to know like what first of all like what is   your take on that second of all like how would you 
encourage i guess like somebody in the same shoes   to maybe spend 200 a bit more wisely you know 
Belle: okay mental health is definitely a spectrum that   you can have good mental 
health and you can be mentally ill and that's i   would say at the extreme end the moment if you're 
struggling with something and you feel anxious   it's really okay to seek help then yeah you 
don't have to go straight to a psychiatrist   if you think that that's too much i guess some 
people are more hesitant because they think   the idea of seeking help means that you 
have to be very ill or very unwell to go to   go to someone for help but if you think 
that you know speaking to your friends   and family aren't very helpful to make you 
cope with your stress or your hardship then   yeah it's always an option for you to 
reach out to other forms of support   actually there are a lot of other supports 
available just that i don't think people are   that aware of it give me an example just like you 
know that there's a help bot called belle as well that   actually you can just type too you don't have 
to call so some people find that they don't like   calls they don't like speaking to somebody yeah 
you can even just type yeah you just go google   belle the help bot and then you can actually 
type and share and then they will offer you um   services that you can access based on what you 
need um and if you don't mind calling somebody   because some people feel more comfortable speaking 
speaking to a stranger because then they won't   feel judged then i guess there are helplines 
out there as well that you can reach out to   and for me like what i did was that my family and 
my boyfriend helped me to speak to a counselor   from fsc i think some people find that it's 
gentler when they start off by speaking to   a counselor rather than having the idea that 
they're going to speak to a psychologist or   psychiatrist because that makes them feel 
like am i mentally ill or something yeah um   yeah so i guess you can always take baby 
steps if you think that the moment you   feel like whatever you're doing is not enough 
then you just have to try something different   sometimes speaking to a friend is good 
enough sometimes trying something new   is good enough yeah you just have to try and 
try until if you find that you're in a better   state so i guess what i wanted to share was also 
not just in a perspective of a person that is   struggling with anxiety and depression and wants 
to seek help but also to reach out to people who   who may know people who are struggling with some 
hardships or struggling with their mental health   and i just really wanna like have a shout out to 
them and say like you know thank you so much for   for being there um it's very very important that 
there's someone like you who cares for them and   it's not going to be easy but if you know and care 
for someone like that please don't give up on them   yeah it will be very draining and tiring 
for sure but it is very helpful to know   that there will be someone who will be there 
regardless of what happens so for me i know that   yeah i know that my sister my boyfriend are 
my rocks like you know they'll always be there   and if you are struggling to know what to say 
to a person and to get them to seek help i think   one good way would be to say that you know as a 
person who generally cares for you like i'm really   concerned about your well-being um if you think 
that you know what you're currently doing is not   enough then maybe you should try something 
different so i guess you just have to be very   you have to be very caring very gentle yet 
inquisitive and persistent yeah yeah because   sometimes even i was very stubborn at first 
about speaking to a counselor like i was like   oh why should i speak to a counselor i really 
learned about things in school i know strategies   to help myself and my anxiety so i don't have 
to go to someone and pay them to tell me things   i already know but i think what's different is 
that obviously what you're doing is not enough   because i know i realized that obviously 
what i was doing was not enough because i   still experience so much anxiety yeah so having 
someone like someone that will you know bring   you for your appointments make your phone calls 
arrange appointments for you it's very important   yeah sometimes you're just so overwhelmed that 
you just don't even have that capacity to reach   out for help and you just need that person there 
to guide you and say hey you know don't worry i'll   accompany you and if you are struggling to find 
words to see i'll help you yeah i think that's   very comforting and that's very important yeah so 
having that strong network is very important and   if you feel like you know i don't have any 
friends and family that i can rely on then   know that there are other outlets that you can 
options that you can go to as well like the   hotlines yeah you can go straight to them they're usually very helpful
Nicole: so i think maybe to sum it   up like i want to talk about like this episode is 
intended to come up in in conjunction with world   mental health day right is there like a something 
special that you like to say in light of this   day of commemoration
Belle: in commemoration of mental 
health day i think uh what i want to share is that   you don't have to be mentally unwell to seek help 
yeah as long as you're struggling with something   i think we have to really normalize 
the idea of speaking to someone   speaking to a therapist yeah sometimes that can 
be a weekly thing if you can afford to actually   just organize your thoughts and to kind of have 
a third person perspective as to what happened   and to have a better relationship with 
yourself in general so the idea of maintaining   mental health and well-being should be more of a 
focus yeah rather than having the idea that you   have to be unwell before you seek help i guess 
like everyone has the idea that you can only   feel unwell before you go to someone but i 
think the idea of really maintaining your   mental health and wellbeing is also very important 
so everyone no matter like whether you're facing   hardships or not is i think it's very important 
to be kind to yourself and to spend some time   to reflect and to give yourself a pat on 
the back and to celebrate the small wins   because i mean this year is not easy for a lot 
of people so really treat yourself and reward   yourself at the end of a long day of work or 
long work week and do something that you like   go for staycations because people are doing that 
a lot now yeah just do things that you like and   remember that you can only be healthy before 
you can work yeah so if you are constantly   working to the point of burnout you're gonna 
spend a lot more time and money then to get back   to your good health so just remember remember 
to take care of yourself even while you're   working and studying right now

Hear stories of tough decisions and fast action to face the ...",[Music] covid is coming to our shore so that actually put us on high alert doctor told me that a positive call week 19 i was so scared there were occasions whereby we paid but someone else came with a bigger bag of cash and we decided that we would organize ourselves on the principle of leaving no singaporean behind the first time i saw my son is so happy yeah that is over [Music] pneumonia outbreak in the central city of wuhan the outbreak 11 of them in serious condition [Music] early morning on the 1st of january 2020 i was officially informed that there was a cluster that is worrying and we ought to watch it very carefully a lot of times we read it from the public media but we also realized the important thing is that if there is a potential transmission from animal to human and a human to human transmissions then i think we will be really into big trouble it was december 31st i remember the moment distinctly reading about it on promed which is a an email list serve of people in the field about 80 000 people across the world i emailed colleagues in geneva and said what's going on and there was clearly a lot of activity i could just imagine the the chaos the need to try and find out more information we have a very close colleagues who has already long term established his working relationship with the researchers in in china as well as our own colleagues locally who have built up these connections over the years trying to get a little bit more insider information so what could this virus be at the same time people in singapore were contacting me saying do you know anything about this and my answers were yeah it's uh it looks significant and um w.h.o is a buzz authorities are still working to identify the virus the outbreak in wuhan has affected at least 40 everyone is wondering when the situation stabilize or even improve and i think a little bit of informations and hint came out that this could be a corona virus and that was a very important message for us to be able to get our laboratory ready it was eerily similar to what we were getting in early 2003 about the information coming out of guangdong about the sars outbreak when it became clear that there was widespread community transmission in wuhan itself we knew then that this would likely impact singapore because there were air links between ohan and singapore and so it was very likely that the virus would be coming to singapore and therefore we set up a inter-ministerial committee basically a multi-ministry task force in order to monitor and to coordinate a whole government response but when it really crystallized for me was when i was in davos in january 2020 and it was about three am in the morning davos time when i got a phone call and it was minister gun kim yong on the other line telling me that we are establishing this task force asking me to be a member of the task force and i think from that point on the gravity of it really sunk in i suppose the moment that i recalled most vividly was minister kang kim young was urgently trying to contact me and i was at some event and i couldn't answer his call immediately so he says jonathan we are going to have to form a task force to manage the situation will you be okay to join the committee so immediately i say sure what do you need me to do just let me know this is a new virus i remember when the task force was first set up there were cynics and people are skeptical and saying were we overreacting why is there a need for a task force but i'm glad we did it and we anticipated set it up because we knew that with a virus like this potentially it could end up in a situation that would be like sars or perhaps even worse well in the beginning as we had our first meeting we had very little knowledge about the disease there was a lot of unknown basically and it is very challenging to try to make decisions and try to navigate our course of action in absence of knowledge there was a lot of trust between us that we knew that we had a big job to do no questions we'll just get on with it and get on quickly singapore has confirmed its first case of the wuhan virus the patient is a 66 year old chinese national and a resident of wuhan and very soon after that the second case was detected and was then admitted to national center for infectious diseases and we knew that from that point in time singapore will be into the fight against covenanting [Music] and we decided that we would organize ourselves on the principle of leaving no singaporean behind wherever they are in the world regardless of what situation they were in if they wanted to come back we would have to find a way and because wuhan was locked down we had singaporeans who were also stuck in wuhan so there was again another flurry of diplomatic activity again behind the scenes to get permission to launch what i think was one of the earliest repatriation missions into wuhan in order to extricate singaporeans from one who wanted to come back everyone on those flights volunteered they knew they were going into a potentially dangerous situation we knew far less about covet 19 than we know now so in a sense that in fact required real courage and i saw that in action [Music] i mean i have to confess that during the call with my boss i think there was a slight hesitation on my part initially anything today is a singaporean who is currently facing difficulty to return to singapore from south america does he have all his travel documents with him my main concern then was that unlike the other consular missions this one sounds like it's not just about me right i mean if i was infected with the virus i there is a risk that i may spread it to my love once fortunately i think at that time my wife joyce was next to me she understood what was happening so she nodded and gestured for me to proceed [Music] on the morning of our flight to wuhan we were sent to sgh where we received a crash course on how to wear our protective equipment or the ppe [Music] i tried to catch some sleep on the plane but on the way there i think it was difficult because my mind was still active running through all the contingencies and responses i tried to relax by chatting with the school crew and that was the time when i found out that oh the entire crew for that flight were volunteers were all volunteers by the time the wheels of the aircraft hit the ground in wuhan the first thing that i did was to turn on my mobile phone that was when we received the good news that all the singaporeans were eligible to be evacuated back had made it safely to the airport we were not supposed to interact too much with each other other than what is necessary and we have a couple of singaporeans would come over to us bring us a bottle of water asking us what do you want to eat you know because some of them have instant noodles with them so uh even in such moments our fellow singaporeans they themselves are tired you know they are also worried whether they have the virus they still thought of others like us i thought that was one of the more heartwarming moments for myself and and for my colleague when the plane eventually landed at changi there was no sense of euphoria amongst the passengers like applause or cheering actually the mood was a bit subdued understandable because one people were tired two there was still some anxiety about what comes next the testing the quarantine whether they have the virus or not and then during the quarantine itself both myself and my colleague at separate times we develop some flu-like symptoms not taking any chances i think we will rush off to ncid i guess the strongest most vivid memory must be my time in ncid because it was a long time since i found myself in the hospital we completed our 14 days and were finally let out on the 14th of february yes valentine's day when i reached home me and my wife we did not go for any candlelight dinner in a restaurant we just put on our flip-flop walk to the nearest coffee shop i ordered my favorite black pepper chicken shop i think we both felt that after what we have gone through we appreciate this simpler things in life [Music] better easily the most stark memory is arriving in beijing and seeing clear blue skies empty streets occasional cars you could walk down the streets not see a person for 10 minutes it was eerie it was shocking to learn how this country had had to respond to deal with with this virus in short the virus had brought china to its knees we learned that the virus was at the highest load early on in the illness and this was critically important because we knew that if the virus is shed in high amounts early on and potentially even before you had symptoms then this was going to to be a disease that was spread through the community so i knew singapore could deal with this as well as anyone else i also felt that other countries were particularly vulnerable whether that's just because they they lack the capacities anyway but also did they have the the mindset to be able to conceptualize what was coming their way and subsequently we realized even before the symptoms starts and asymptomatic infections and once you put all these characteristics together i kind of knew that this is going to be a hard battle against this virus and it's very likely that you will never be able to fully get rid of this virus [Music] foreign [Music] oh without ncid i think we'll be in trouble today so i was grateful to my predecessors who have decided that learning from sas we better have our own center for infectious diseases so that we can consolidate all the resources build the knowledge build the capacity and build the [Music] capability and here our closest partner is tandook singh hospital they inject in the manpower allowing ncid to escalate very quickly almost three to four times of his regular capacity [Music] so at the same time i would say that it is a very stressful period but we are ready for it we are able to bang together as a team be able to support one another we also have a team of psychological medically trained individuals to be able to help them the most common issues faced by most of our staff is the long hour of work fatigues can set in the other thing is that it is the fear elements and a lot of times i think most of our staff feels very safe and that is our sole purpose to provide our staff a very safe working environment but the fear may be from their close relatives or from their family members which is very understandable because you are working in the front line basically in a war zone and they will have to also handle their own personal fear as well as the family [Music] outside of clinical work i also deal with preparation for mass casualty exercises how to do disasters as well and i'm also involved with moh in terms of disaster planning actually i think that pandemics are a bit more difficult to handle because you do need a lot of endurance you need a lot of patience to deal with the different things that it shows at you so it's more of a marathon rather than a sprint the first kovit 19 patient i saw essentially was a returning traveler from china and i think the main emotion i got from her was the fear i mean i could see in her eyes i mean it was an unknown virus she wasn't sure whether she could go back whether there was any treatment available what was the prognosis of the disease so the main thing was that we had to deal with two different sites so both the screening center and the a and e [Music] [Applause] so there was one night in particular i remember and i was the senior doctor on night shift and we had about eight to ten doctors and student nurses as well to deal with about 300 patients in the screening center there were five different zones and two outside tentative areas and it was really challenging because i think to oversee all of them to make sure that they are actually safe and stable is really difficult [Music] so this is the extension of the screening center it's really quiet now it's so much different from how it used to be of course i don't want the screen center open again because if it opens means there'll be another pandemic that's happening i know that if it opens we'll always be prepared and i'm confident that we will be able to do the next pandemic as well one important lesson that we learned in the early days of kobe 19 is that every outbreak is different we have sops what we call sop standard operating procedures and every time when something happens we always take out the sop dust it off and check what should we do next every upgrade is different and therefore we cannot just follow the plan blindly we must be prepared to adapt to change to [Music] move [Music] [Music] morning now i cannot go home even my children they want to come here they cannot come so it's it's really heartbreaking for me because i miss them [Music] first time when they air it so everybody's texting me sister you make us cry but one thing that really strikes me most is my mom how she reacted when she watched the documentary she really cried us and cried very hard because my brother is here also and my sister-in-law is also working here so she keep on saying verbalizing while crying so hard and telling tell them to go home tell them to go home tell them to go home i told her nothing to worry because the government and the management of our hospital is really looking after us how are you let's hit the white mother [Music] wow so quiet i've got goosebumps i'm having goosebumps this was where our first few patients got admitted to well suddenly everything is flashing yeah i can still see the patient doing going through the conversion from a normal compost to a covid facility was very organized madness real organized madness i think the first wave of patient coming in was the most scariest it was something that i think all of us have not had experienced nursing such patients before definitely there's a lot of anxiety a lot of fear but very fortunate on our first day we did have support from ncid who actually gave us a lot of assurance a lot of hand-holding to to tell us that we are in the right direction so i remember when we are doing the exercise with them one of the patient cried and he's trying his best to communicate in english because i got some communication barriers and then he asked me sister what will happen to us what will happen to me am i going to die there's a lot of uncertainties but you know what i answer to them don't think too much take one step at a time [Music] what we have done is to have a record plan if the hospital needs to stand up again to accept a patient we will be able to do so in very quick time within 24 hours our staff have been told who will be recalled by batches a few of the patients here i think they've been here for a while they just want to see how are they getting on this few days so moving it was a difficult move for me because from a kampung going to a condominium sort of feeling but it's a good move so when i move i move with a positive note and here i am now currently i still work as an infection control nurse so activities wise same thing like for example i'm still doing infection control audit doing some trainings staff education can you show me the seven steps of hand-held you put it's either water or your hamburger then you do something and then your wrists definitely i'll come back when this whole thing is over when we have no more patience we will definitely come back to black vision so i think what is very very significant is the kampung culture that we have in bright vision is something that i can never find anywhere it can't be too much longer now till they figure it out but tell you honestly my plan is to go home this is the reality i want to be with my family and i am looking forward for that because life is very unpredictable we don't even predict this thing will happen right no one even predicted but it happened so i thought to myself maybe donna this is the sign for you to be with your family because we don't know what will happen tomorrow [Music] [Music] it was a self-preservation all of us need our basic needs to survive and when we find that their scarcity or we think that there's going to be scarcities of resources or supplies like food something as basic as that you want to make sure you have so i think we need to understand that the kind of self-preservation is about preserving yourself and the loved ones around you that's the first psychological factor the second psychological factor is one of a hurd mentality sometimes you don't really need you're not sure if you do need but when you see everybody else doing it you do it as well right so that is how the contagion works i'm a former tv editor who got into food production a few years ago because i saw the importance of being able to produce food where people live i'd never seen empty shells of vegetables before it was quite a remarkable site and i think seeing that made people realize how important having local production is because if the board is shut there's no replacing that supply you need to be able to supply locally and and vegetables are not the sort of thing you can store for a very long time you can store rice and canned food and things like that on the shelves for a long time or even frozen food but fresh vegetables need to be constantly produced and replaced and consumed because they don't have a shelf life [Music] yeah how's it going good okay do you think because there's been a bit more cloudier slope growth or so as we expand out our greenhouse capability we need to be able to move from the 2000 packets we're doing a week to over 2000 packets a day and that's going to make a significant difference in what we can supply to the supermarket [Music] so even before kovite 19 we'll be building the foundations for singapore's food security apart from diversifying our sources we've been raising our local production and that's why we have the 30 by 30 goal which is to raise singapore's food supply uh to produce 30 percent locally by 2030. so as a response to the pandemic and kobit 19 we decided to accelerate that goal and that's what the 30 by 30 express grant is about where we have high-tech farmers they are ready to raise production we funded them to a tune of about 40 million to nine companies and you'll be able to see more local produce in the next six to 24 months [Music] i'd like to see us aiming much much higher we're trying to produce as much as we can and i think collectively we should be aiming for 150 and while that might sound crazy i don't think so i think it's important that we produce not only for ourselves but be able to produce in a way that we can become an exporter and then if we come and export it then we have a buffer we have a shock absorber to global prices like covert so if the borders get closed we can divert our export into local consumption so this is just the first of what we plan to be many rooftop farms in singapore we want to do this in every neighborhood [Music] so we'd like to see more of this urban farming rooftops of vacant hdb multi-story car parks in commercial buildings you know even like shopping center rooftops and all that and even industrial buildings and why this is important is because you bring the food closer to the consumer you cut down the carbon mounds and you cut down the transportation required to bring the food from the farm to the consumer and that in fact can make local production more affordable in the long run [Music] some of them could produce it but they couldn't get it to the ports and the airports and ship it to us some of them could produce it but they weren't willing to sell and there was a worldwide scramble to get mass medicine and food we need to activate our global supply chain networks really to call up all our contacts from all over the world to try to secure mass the food the essential supplies in fact on many occasions our people both the government officials and also the supply chains players they have to physically bring with them cash to the place place the order and there were occasions whereby we paid for it but moments later someone else came with a bigger bag of cash and took away what we had bought so we could never relax until we have secured the stuff that we want get it onto the ship of the plane and monitor it closely until it comes back to singapore malaysia is set to close its borders at midnight to fight the spread of the coronavirus it's the first country in southeast asia to impose a two-week nationwide lockdown [Music] so again if i cast my mind back to that time i remember speaking to the foreign minister hisham speaking to the chief minister of johor astley and those conversations were also important to you know update each other and what was happening and the fact now in retrospect that in fact there was hardly any disruption to essential supplies [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and of course we have our first case of uh an infected crew that came on board the ship and january uh one day or two days just before uh the state of emergency being declared that that actually brought us you know uh into sort of a reality you know it's coming to our shore and at that period there's already travelers coming into singapore with uh with covet cases so that actually put us on high alert okay rock i've been about 35 years as a sailor my main role is as chief engineer i am in charge of the engine department actually we are scared but we are only follow some protocols and uh protection to avoid this scuba so now since we arrived here in singapore uh me and my crewmates are very thankful because we are very safe and accommodation given to us by singapore government after singapore we're heading to portland after that one we heading for colombo sri lanka to date now for example we have facilitated more than 80 000 crew changers signed on and signed off and they have gone on board 6 000 ships so i think it is for us a major accomplishment because it is not easy to balance that public health risk protect the seafarers protect our local population and all this gives a commitment to the shipping industry that they can come here and do business in singapore and that keeps our pot open which continues to fuel the economy of singapore one person even told me that he has not seen his son for one year he was stuck on board the ship and he was really very glad that they were all praying on board the ship every day for a port that would allow them to do the crew change and they will get that it was singapore and he was glad that in about eight hours time he is going to go home and and see his son after my six months contract i will be going home to take a vacation with my family and uh hoping that everything will be okay so i like this contract for my family and we could earn much more enough for our needs and for the future of my family and i hope that one day or [Music] time will come i want to visit against singapore once again [Music] there was a great reshuffle of humanity occurring at that point in time now although our airport was close to tourist arrivals one fact which people may not appreciate is that we kept changi open and functioning as a key transit so i recall many conversations with many different foreign ministers who wanted to get their own citizens home and they had to transit in singapore i think the other point i would also emphasize when i look back at that time is when the mco came into effect there were many families who were desperate to go to one side or the other and it's not about economics or jobs husbands or wives or parents who are ill who are in icu or who have passed away and people aren't able to say their final goodbyes so there was a very very human dimension to this separation and again to the maximum extent possible we tried our best to to help to get families reunited say the final goodbyes either in the icu or at the funeral people realized that singapore was reliable even in the depths of a crisis we continue to be a key focal nodal point for the transit of essential goods services pharmaceuticals food and most important of all people [Music] [Music] we did say that we hoped never to get there but the situation was such that we had to seriously consider it and the task force debated at length the pros and cons we knew from the beginning that it had we imposed this circuit breaker it's going to impact lives of many people and the livelihoods of many people because the economy will grind to a halt it would also have impact on well-being of people their sense of isolation particularly for the elderly and vulnerable groups it would have impact on children too because if schools were closed some parents may not have the ability to look after their children if they are in the essential workforce working and some and the children may suffer but we realized as the situation worsened we had no choice we have to explain to the cabinet because our cabinet colleagues are fully aware of the implication and the impact on people and economy so we presented to them with charts and with numbers with projections and say this is what we're going to be seeing if we don't have a circuit breaker but i'm happy to say that the minister for trade industry and minister of finance were fully behind circuit breaker because they also know that if we don't do that we're going to have a protracted multiple waves of infection the impact on the economy on the people will be even worse we will therefore impose significantly stricter measures this is like a circuit breaker and undergirding all of that is the point that you know you needed a calm and cooperative collaborative response from the broader society because we were essentially asking them to do things which is out of the norm and we needed their cooperation and compliance for it to be effective and that is why i think the foundation of this is trust and confidence you can only foster that trust and that confidence if you have clear communication that is provided in a timely manner that is transparent and coming from an authoritative source in a regular fashion and in part this is also in my mind it was influenced by experiences in the past because very often uh in you know in crisis situations one of the concerns of the general public has been the lack of information [Music] there has to be a near real-time feedback to policy makers decision makers about what the population at large is thinking i think for covet 19 there is this intermediate concern that some people might have a longer term health issues after recovery so during the circuit breaker we found that the proportion of people who saw a doctor for the illness had dropped from a high of about 90 percent before the circuit breaker to as low as about 50 during the circuit breaker when we saw this we started to probe further by launching additional surveys asking people what are the reasons or the key reasons why they did not see a doctor for their illness firstly there was a group that was concerned about the length of the sick leave that they would have to undergo if they saw a doctor for the respiratory infection there was another group which was actually concerned about catching the infection if they stepped out to look for care during a period that was supposed to be dangerous in terms of covet spread so we fed back some of this messaging to the ministry of health and along with other inputs which i'm sure they receive from other agencies they actually undertook a messaging campaign to reinforce the need to seek care and also subsequently they did revise the sick leave policy okay so this is the question why would you get vaccinated and then all the options are listed over in text over here i have taken the vaccine but we have to hide until the vaccination starts we need to be on a gut against fake messaging we need to figure out if the population has any concerns about the vaccine we have noticed that a lot of our participants in past surveys have actually reported that they have received fake news or messages they suspect to be fake on other aspects about this virus so this is one of our chief concerns as the vaccines start to be rolled out in singapore singapore has reported its first two deaths from the coronavirus they are a 75 year old singaporean woman and a 64 year old indonesian man our folks are with their families and their loved ones during this difficult moment i decided that i had to do the announcement myself call the press briefing and brief the press about the two mortality but it is also important at that point to rally singaporeans together because i think this bad news will affect everybody it's not just the family members but the rest of singaporeans too i had to prepare myself because i know i will also get emotional during the press briefing words are not sufficient to express our appreciation for all of those who are i didn't go into the parliament making a speech planning to break down obviously it rarely happens to me but i recounted how i've seen so many instances of singaporeans responding valiantly to the crisis and i've seen so many of these instances everywhere when i go out to meet uh the people on the front lines if i could allow singaporeans to see through my eyes what i've seen i think everyone will be similarly overwhelmed [Music] i was 27 weeks pregnant my first symptom is i had bad cough itchy throat and lost sense of taste i think i got it from my father-in-law he worked in airport that time we had a family gathering he already showed symptoms but we're really not sure he really had coveted 19 then most also suggest me to to pack my things and my son things and convict us to end uh because i'm pregnant [Music] my son was different with me we separated waiting for the result thankfully the nurse there keep addicting me i call them i can hurt background that he's crying that makes me more worried the next day doctor came to my walk i can see that from his expression something is not good i ask him doctor is it a good news or bad news doctor told me that unfortunately sheila you positive kovic 19 i was so sad i cried the first thing i think is about my pregnancy and my son also was waiting for the result after some time they transferred me to another ward with other pregnant women that i was so happy and it's less worried also because i'm not alone they also together with me like fighting the virus together [Music] the day we left hospital i was so happy what touched me is that the nurse there clapped hand and said take care like i ask my husband to go to my indoor house i go home i wash my clothes the bags all i wash and i throw some of the things that from the hospital to make sure i really like the virus is not with me anymore after all that then i asked my my my my son and my my husband to come back [Music] the first time i saw my son it was happy [Music] that it's over [Music] now my daughter is six months old she is healthy and now we are going for her six month checkup to see her progress on high weight and blood for antibodies anyhow the development so far she's speaking yeah okay so far can sit nicely on her [Music] own [Music] [Applause] i feel happy i think it's a blessing so she had an empty body because of me but she no need to go through as what i experienced [Music] it's so nice to be back to be with my family and taking care of my family i'm back at work now as an auxiliary police officer i'm so happy about it in future i want to be healthy always work for my family and my career i'm proud to be a singaporean also like how we fight the virus together what i learned is things can be tough but we make it through and things is getting better now [Applause] twenty-two new cases from the s11 the vast majority continues to be migrant workers living indoors and twenty when we notice clusters forming in the dormitory we are aware that it's going to be a very

Karageorghis (Brunel University London) present ""Stay Home, Save Lives: Physical ...",today's talk is physical activity sensory behavior and mental health during coping 19. and this seminar series is jointly organized by brunel's sedentary behavior health and disease research group led by dr daniel bailey and the health behaviour change research group led by myself dr emma loris and dr kai long chung all at brunel so today we're very lucky to have two presentations from professor mark hamer from university college london and professor costas clara georges from renault university in london so first i'd like to welcome our first speaker today professor mark hamer from the institute of sport exercise and health at university college london mark's research focuses on physical activity and population health especially in relation to heart disease healthy aging and mental well-being he is involved with a number of world-leading cohort studies including whitehall 2 study the 1970 british cohort study and the prospective physical activity sitting and sleep consortium professor hamer will present on the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for coping 19 using prospective cohort data with national registry linkage hospitalization so thank you to both our speakers and thank you first of all to mark for your presentation we really look forward to it so over to you mark thanks very much emma um and it's thank you for the in invite from dan uh it's a pleasure to come and uh speak this morning um so as emma mentioned um going to be talking about some of our work on physical activity and community acquired infection from some of the large epidemiological cohorts that we've been working on so the prime question i'm going to ask this morning is can a physically active lifestyle reduce the risk of serious outcomes from community acquired infections and um what we're not obviously trying to investigate is whether being physically fit can stop a person from actually getting infected with a virus but what we're more interested to know is whether once that person gets infected with a virus if they're fitter can they actually cope with it better and just to put this into context why would this be be relevant to the current pandemic um well pre-pandemic we know that a large proportion of the population do not meet the chief medical officer physical activity guidelines which is 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous physical activity um and you know if you even lower that recommendation down to what proportion of people are active for at least one day a week there's still a large proportion of people that don't meet that guideline so these are some data from sport england from their active live survey and they were actually able to look at what was the impact of the first lockdown on physical activity and and you can see that they've got this year-on-year data so they can make these comparisons from 2019 to 2020. and they estimated that in that first lockdown about a year ago physical activity levels dropped by around about seven percent which um may seem trivial but in england that reflects around about three million fewer adults being active so if in the backdrop of a population that is already relatively inactive the pandemic has clearly further reduced that and so potentially this could be a a recipe for for disaster with a highly contagious virus and a pretty sedentary population so the whole area of exercise immunity is certainly not uh it's not a new area the first studies in this area uh probably took place around about 100 years ago and these early studies were in animals and they looked what happened when uh you you infected an animal and then you got the animal to perform exhaustive exercise and actually the animals didn't fare very well because those that went through this exhaustive exercise protocol um had much worse outcomes following the infection and and this has led researchers to look at how elite athletes fare when they're under very high training loads um what happens happens to their immune function and in in some athletes um when they're under high training nodes this has quite an adverse influence on their immunity and and their risk of catching various infections and so this has really led to this um what you would call this u-shaped hypothesis where what we think is happening if you look at the y-axis as risk of infection and on the x-axis you've got level of physical activity when when athletes are under very high levels of intense training they're possibly at high risk of infection whereas people who are not doing any exercise at all are also under a similar greater risk of infection but actually we don't really know very much about this in the general population because most of the work has been done in in elite athlete populations so the aim of our work was really to explore this association between physical activity levels and community acquired infections in general population cohorts and some of the key advances in in our approaches have been the the use of some of these very large representative large-scale data sets um we've got prospective linkage to clinical records so we're not relying on uh symptoms we've actually got clinically verified uh infection data and and hard outcomes such as mortality whereas many of these previous studies and athletes have actually simply relied on symptoms to define uh for example an upper respiratory tract infection um so this is a general overview of the sort of design that we use in these the studies i'm going to present to you um these are prospective cohort studies so we start off at baseline where we recruit our sample and this is where we collect our data such as physical activity and some of the other important covariates such as smoking body mass index social status etc we then sometime in the future perform clinical linkage which may consist of hospital admission data mortality data and what that captures is all of the events that took place between your baseline and your your follow-up linkage so i'm just going to start firstly talking about the study that we did uh pre-covered using health sofa england and the scottish health survey um these are both household-based surveillance surveys um they that we would say this is probably these are our best representative studies that we have in in the uk because of this multi-stage stratified recruitment methodology that we use on average obviously these surveys take place every year um with a different set of participants and you you get of a sort of like a quite variability in the the proportion of people that actually take up the uh the study although what is really good is we get a very high proportion of participants that consent to prospective linkage with mortality and so the analysis that we did with with this data set was to look at associations between physical activity and risk of infectious disease mortality now in the uk by far the most common um infectious disease type of infectious disease mortality is pneumonia and these are the the the the basic unadjusted numbers uh looking at the association between uh physical activity and uh infectious disease mortality so on the y-axis we've got the number of events per 10 000 participants and then what we've done on the categorization of activity we've put people broadly into three categories those that didn't report any moderate to vigorous physical activity um those that weren't sufficiently active so people that reporting some but not reaching the current cmo guideline and then the active people are the people that do reach that 150 minute mark and and you can see just from the quite crude look at the data um that the the rates of uh infectious disease mortality are far lower in those people that are physically active now when you dig into this a little bit deeper and to look at the sort of detailed dose response pattern and also obviously start to adjust the models because one of the things we're concerned about with this sort of analysis is obviously confounding um so in this analysis we split the group into into five categories using metals per week um so that first category less than 1.6 meta per week is literally people who are really reporting very little activity at all that's that's less than half an hour's walk a week and that's reference category and you can see these are hazard ratios with confidence intervals we can see even with some physical activity we have quite a large reduction in risk of infectious disease mortality that continues to go down somewhat although really you can see with these high levels of activity there's lots of overlap with the confidence intervals so um when i look at this i would say that's really an l-shaped association it's certainly not linear so the biggest benefit is certainly moving from that inactive category to the category where people are doing some activity and these models were adjusted for these key confounders such as age sex existing illness at baseline social occupational strata body mass index smoking and alcohol so just wanted to move on now to the second study that we performed which is a similar type of study but we actually performed this during the pandemic with covid19 data um and we we did this study using uk biobank uh uk biobank started back in uh 2010 when the the the team recruited uh knit over half a million people across 22 different research centers in the uk this cohort is restricted to participants who were age 40 to 69 at baseline and you should note that the response rate was was very different to what i've just shown you in health survey for england the response rate was much lower which which would suggest that uk biobank is a far less representative cohort in terms of outcomes for this study we used linked nhs records um with which reflects uh kobe 19 admissions between the 16th of march to the 26th of april of 2020 so it was really in that first sort of six weeks that first lockdown period that we had and just in a similar fashion we've just presenting this in exactly the same way as i showed you for the hsc analysis we've got these three groups for physical activity the inactive the insufficiently active and the active and we've got events per ten thousand you can obviously see that the uh the absolute number of events per ten 000 is far lower than the previous analysis because um don't forget that the previous analysis was a follow-up uh over nine to ten year period whereas this is a follow-up uh this this reflects um an outcome follow-up period of six weeks um so uh like the previous analysis when we look at this in a survival model with um covaria adjustment these associations between the protective associations with physical activity with kobit 19 remain very robust so we went on to do a further analysis which was to calculate something called a population attributable fraction um and just to put this to explain this in in a simple fashion the the population attributable fraction really tells you that if you were to remove a certain risk factor from the population what effect would that have on your outcome of interest so in other words um if i were to remove smoking from the uk population um what proportion of serious covert admissions might that prevent so the calculation is based on two key factors it's firstly how prevalent is your risk factor in the population of interest and secondly what is the strength of the association between your exposure and and your outcome um so because i i mentioned that uk bike and is not hugely representative so we have taken prevalence data from health survey for england which i'm showing you here so the current figures from hsc suggests that uh in england we've got around about 17 smoking um um just over 25 would be considered inactive that's based on a 30 minute per week uh guideline so quite a generous uh cut point there and in terms of obesity it's just under 30 so those are the prevalence data that we used in the calculation um and the uh the relative risks were generated from the previous analysis that i've just shown you so these are the actual paths um so if we were to no so so i should also say that a key assumption of this calculation is causality so the calculation assumes that our exposure is causally driving our outcome so that's something to bear in mind so if we were to eliminate smoking in england then um we might expect to see to remove just under 15 of serious covered admissions if we were to to remove all inactivity in england uh we might see just under 10 reduction in admissions uh and and the but the really big one is obesity so if we were to eliminate obesity um we may see a reduction uh in 30 percent of serious code admissions and the reason that number is big is that firstly obesity is highly prevalent in england but secondly uh there's a very strong association between obesity and covid so morbidly obese have over three times increased risk of a serious kobit 19 admission so just the last piece of work i want to show you is actually something that's currently uh impressed and this was a meta-analysis that we did to look at associations between physical activity and various immune markers um but one of the outcomes we looked at was um infectious disease mortality and there wasn't very much data in this area but you can see the the data that we do have is all pretty consistently showing that physical activity is associated with a protective benefit in terms of reducing risk of of serious infectious disease so just to summarize uh our findings um habitual physical activity uh measured in the general population was associated with around about 30 to 40 40 lower risk of severe infectious disease outcome and that's after you account for these confounding factors when you when you control for these covariates what's interesting is this association doesn't really seem to be linear um you seem to see quite a sizable reduction in risk even at that very first part of the curve so when someone jumps from doing zero first activity to doing something we certainly didn't replicate this u-shaped association which has been found in athletic samples um and that's probably because we are working on a general population cohort obviously some of that code those co will be will be into quite heavy devs of exercise but um we certainly don't replicate that u-shaped association and just to summarize our population attributable fraction calculations um if we were to get the british population uh healthier in terms of their lifestyle then that that could certainly prevent a large number of these severe admissions if indeed these associations are actually causal i just my last slide i just wanted to talk about the sort of biological plausibility um is it really plausible to think that physical activity could could improve our immunity to the extent of uh reducing very serious illness i think there's a number of plausible mechanisms there's been a lot of talk about covid19 being quite a a peculiar virus in that it's um seems to have been associated with the endothelial function and if if it is indeed having that sort of origin we know that physicality is extremely important for cardiovascular health it's been linked to improvements in the endothelial function and blood pressure and vascular health in general um we know there's lots of data to suggest physical activity is very beneficial for metabolic function in terms of glucose control visceral adiposity reduction and so it may well be that physical activity is very important in mediating or moderating this link between obesity and covert risk and lastly we know that physical activity is a powerful anti-inflammatory mechanism and there has been talk about this cytokine storm or an over inflammatory response to to covet so maybe that physically trained individuals are better able to control this sort of mechanism once they are infected um so i'd just like to thank you for listening and i just want to acknowledge um some of my colleagues that that were helped on these various analyses uh david batty mika kivamaki thank you very much thank you so much mark i think the one takeaway message that we can all take from that presentation is basically the biggest improvement is to go from no activity to something so if we can all take that kind of key message away from mark's talk i think that's really important um so i think we've had a few questions uh to mark so we'll have some time now and then some time at the end for kind of overall um questions and discussion as well so the first question that we receive mark um is why does high intensity of activity make someone more susceptible to contracting the virus i thought that the more active you are the more preventive the effects would be yeah so um just just to highlight that we didn't actually find that um so i think um i referred to prior work in athletic samples that has found um athletes under very high training loads uh do seem to more susceptible to infections um but as i said we we didn't find that um one of the reasons for that may be that our outcome was a very hard outcome so we were looking at um uh you know death we were looking at hospital admission for for infections um the previous data that has generated this sort of u-shape type uh association has used symptom-based measures so when these athletes are contracting infections um we're talking about them coming down with common cold maybe flu but it would be very very rare for these athletes to actually get be hospitalized so i think there's a really important distinction there um you know this this earlier work showing the u-shaped curve was really not looking at very hard outcomes which is which is what we have been doing [Music] thanks mark um next question is for the activity to be considered physical does our heart rate have to be of a particular number of beats per minute i.e 220 minus person's age or does the beats per minute not matter thank you okay yeah thanks that's really good question um sourcely heart rate's very individual um it will vary with age um and training status um i think often um a better guide to use in terms of how how intense you know the interest the whole intensity issue is um whether you can still manage to have a conversation when you're exercising so um if if you you know reaching that sort of like moderate um form of exercise a good guy is that you should still just about be able to have a conversation but obviously you should be you know breathing quite hard once you get to the point where you're not able to have the conversation with with somebody then you've probably moved into that vigorous zone um and as i mentioned you don't need to move into the vigorous zone to get health benefits um keeping it that moderate level is is certainly going to give you benefits and in fact brisk walking is probably one of the most popular forms of activity uh in the uk at the minute from our uh health center for england yeah so probably uh don't get too worried about heart rate i would use other more uh subjective markers of effort and with the question from from ruth would these findings help explain some of the variance immortality figures between different countries e.g japan and where they have much lower rates of mortality yeah that's a really good question and um interesting the um world obesity federation um have just released a really interesting port last week that didn't last is based on each country's prevalence of obesity and they compared that with their number of deaths relative to their population and what you see is there is a round about a correlation of 0.5 between a country's prevalence of obesity and their death rates so there absolutely is a very plausible and good link between um you know obesity levels in countries and how they've you know how they've fared on on the covered front another question this time from christine immunity is a complex phenomena and it's great you looked at a range of confounders however is it possible that part of the association is psychological factors which draw people to exercise and these are also linked somehow to improved immunity yeah so um in in this in observational epidemiology residual confounding is always a big worry we can never possibly adjust for everything we want to because we we haven't measured it um i think it's absolutely plausible that there are unmeasured confounders that we haven't accounted for that could partly explain some of the associations um i haven't seen we know that mental health has has probably suffered during lockdown um i'm not aware of any really convincing evidence that has suggested a link between um mental health and serious risk of serious covert admissions um but but i may well be wrong and it um i may ask costas to pick that up if if he knows of any data um but i think it's very very plausible uh very plausible suggestion um and another question so given that physical inactivity is higher in ethnic minority groups in the uk did you explore this in your studies yeah so we in health survey for england we have previously shown that um participants from with south asian backgrounds so bangladesh pakistan india tend to report much lower levels of physical activity so that would be an obvious confounder in our associations and ethnicities is something that we adjust for in our analyses particularly um in the uk by bank analyses because we have um pretty good data on ethnicity having said that in these cohort stories i've presented um 95 of the cohort is actually white british so we we don't have huge options we don't have a huge um level of statistical power to actually examine that question um but obviously ethnicity is a really crucial factor uh in in covid for sure it's actually a related question um which is the last one that was asked so could you explain what you mean when you say hate to see data is more representative than biobank so i guess yeah yeah sure so um hsc um has a very um particular method of recruiting participants in the study um which is designed to in essence it's a random postcode kind of lottery so they try to to pick up people randomly across the entire country um this is quite different from the uk biobank approach and the main problem with uk biobank is although they sent out random invitations only five percent of those invitations that were sent actually got picked up um so if you look at the basic characteristics of uk biobank compared to the general population it contains people who are probably from higher social strata they are a bit healthier than what we would normally expect from that age group so that's why we would say that uk biobank is um not considered to be a particularly representative of of the english population compared to something like health's over england which is not perfect but it's it's it's quite a bit better thanks mark and just for one more question before we move on to custer's presentation from maria since obesity is the biggest risk factor that is strongly associated with kobit 19. is there any data of how much obesity has increased since march 2020 should advice about being more physically active be shared with gp practices and with people who are considered obese by bmi standards yeah i mean that's excellent question and i completely agree um you know i think i think this has been recognized i think the prime minister uh recognized this and he released um or he's supposed to have released some some money for focus research on this this area um you know if you look at the data i think you'll find that some people have put on weight um whereas other people haven't they've you know they've fared better so i i don't i think it's quite complicated um the data are probably quite more complex than they than they seem it's not simply a case of everyone as put on weight but obviously i think there has been a potential to put on weight we've all been stuck at home um if i think about my own kind of lifestyle i you know that incidental activity has all gone because you know i'm not walking to meeting rooms anymore walking around campus um you kind of get up go to your desk um i may get out and do some very structured exercise but i think what we've missed is all of that sort of an incidental movement um so yeah i think obesity is an absolutely crucial issue in this whole uh pandemic thanks so much mark um a really great presentation so we'll pick up on some more general questions between the two speakers at the end so now i'd like to move on to our second speaker um professor costas curry georges from the division of sport health and exercise sciences at brunel university london so kostas is divisional lead for sport health and exercise sciences at brunel he's internationally known for his research into the psychological psychophysiological and neurophysiological effects of audio visuals stimuli in exercise and sport classes will present on the effects of kobe 19 lockdown on physical activity sensory behavior and mental health across four western nations ussa uk france and australia so we're really looking forward to a presentation costas and thank you again uh emma and dan i'd like to thank you very much indeed for your kind invitation i was delighted to be preceded by professor mark hamer professor hamer was actually a student of mine believe it or not i know i look quite fresh-faced but more than 20 years ago i remember him as a young triathlete wearing quite garish all-in-one uh sort of lycra body suits he was sort of a slightly less ostentatious version of mr motivator um so yes a great pleasure to follow mark and it's interesting how our paths have crossed over the last 20 years in various projects as emma mentioned my main area of research has to do with audio visual aids in the physical activity sphere but about a year ago almost to the day i had three experiments in train and the physiology technician at brunel burst and summer into my office while i was in the middle of a tutorial and said cost has cost us all of the experiments they have to stop at once you need to get all of the students out shut everything down and of course that put paid to all of the work that i had in train at that time and in the days that followed i had to really refocus and and think what i would do during this um this health crisis covet 19 has been the defining issue of our generation um and so what i did do in fact was that i made contact with many of my colleagues around the world with whom i had collaborated over many years in the music and audio visual aids sphere and i asked whether they might be interested in doing a study around physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health during the pandemic very early in my career i did have an interest in psychometrics and physical activity i worked with um peter terry andrew lane simeon vladovalos in the sort of mid to late 90s so i had a little bit of a taste for that sort of work back then but mainly working with people who's 40 that was um so in the uk i collaborated with dr jonathan bird at exeter a formal doctor of students of mine and of course i've already mentioned mark with whom i've collaborated for many years on a variety of projects and he's a very fine colleague there's a group that i've been working with at springfield college in the usa they're probably in the land of nod right now two colleagues at the university of lille in france uh professor ivan de la voir tyrell and segoline quaran and of course from australia peter terry with whom i've worked in the music sphere over three decades now um and uh renee parsons smith and victoria terry so i think it's worth just acknowledging the uh the assistance and guidance i've had from my co-workers uh in relation to the work that i'm going to present i did try to get a group from um brazil as well to collaborate in this study but things were really going off there in terms of covid and i didn't manage to get the brazilians but i was happy to get samples from the uk usa france and australia so in terms of some background to this particular multination study clearly as mark alluded to earlier lockdowns by their very nature reduce opportunities for physical activity so that is a given and they encourage greater sedentary behavior such as sitting playing video games watching tv netflix i know a lot of my students were immersed in against what we have learned is an existing backdrop backdrop of very high levels of sedentary behavior in developed nations i was reading a paper just this morning published in bmc public health um which stated that obesity has caused more deaths in england and scotland since 2014 than smoking so i think that follows on very well from some of the data that was presented by mark earlier so of course a concomitant of sedentaryness is compromised mental health um and a very interesting study by mark and his colleagues in bmj open looked at associations between objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary time with mental mental health in adults so uh marketal's uh sample was drawn from the 2008 health survey for england um they used the 12 item general health questionnaire which is actually one of the instruments that we used in the study that i'm presenting today they had over 11 000 participants who self-reported their sedentary time and around 2000 from whom they collected objective data by use of accelerometers now the highest turtle the highest third in terms of objective and subjective sedentary time were associated with higher risk of psychological distress in accord with the general health questionnaire so you know that that was interesting and provides part of the background for the study but in terms of my own mental health and my own anxiety um some of the aspects that really got me going was just seeing the physical damage that people were suffering at the hands of covid what i've presented to you here on the left hand side is a healthy heart versus on the right hand side the heart of a coveted patient and what you can see on the right hand side is the splintering of blood vessels it's quite an extreme example here that of course makes oxygenation so difficult and lies at the heart of the problem if you pardon the pun if we also look at the image here of healthy lungs versus the lungs of a covid19 patient again a very stark and worrying difference the infection causes uh alveolar damage capillary congestion necrosis of pneumocytes interstitial and alveolar edema that is fluid in air spaces of course the lungs can't function as they should we can't breathe properly we can't absorb oxygen into the bloodstream we experience hypoxia and it leaves patients needing ventilators we saw this with our local mp of course the member for oxbridge and south reislip the right honourable boris johnson who was uh admitted to saint thomas's hospital and made many of these uh issues that the sort of mechanical issues um he served to make them very public so continuing with the background to the present study sedentary sedentary behavior is associated as we've learned with greater risk for cause mortality that is death from any cause cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes diabetes which is a combination of type 2 diabetes and obesity and of course some cancers and early covet findings that i was seeing in may june showed sharp reductions in physical activity even among people who were habitually active increases incidentally behavior particularly sitting and screen time decrements in mental health and the effects of the pandemic on mental health were particularly acute among women so this is a theme that will pick up again later now such changes in key health outcomes are probably not evenly distributed within populations and across nations and this provided a rationale for the purpose of the study you can see here the sort of public messaging this is an exercises medicine infographic that were common in the uk encouraging people to move more and we'll pick up this theme again in a short while i just want to touch on some international data um from tyson itself that's not iron mike by the way on daily step counts across the world on the left hand side we can see american cities uh and on the right hand side we can see international cities uh and what is stark within these data is a very sharp decrement when regional orders were placed such as lockdowns in terms of daily step count there were decrements in the order of two thousand to two and a half thousand steps per day in cities if you look on the right hand side top right such as seoul tokyo stockholm where there were not such strict restrictions or no restrictions at all um you can see people's physical activity levels in terms of daily step count being well maintained so this is the backdrop against which we were working the primary aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects although we did have some objective data as well in the form of step counts of the initial covert 19 lockdowns across four western nations the nations i mentioned earlier the uk usa australia france with a specific focus on physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health we've already had an excellent introduction to these from mark a secondary aid aim was to look at some key moderators such as age which was the main moderator that we looked at in terms of age groups but also we looked at sex as a moderator with a specific focus on mental health so we collected a lot of data in this study and i just want to be very clear i'm going to present just a portion of the data today but there are other studies nation-specific that have emanated from the data collection that took place during the spring and summer of 2020 across the four nations so first hypothesis we expected reductions in planned and unplanned dimensions of physical activity and steps per day from pre to during lockdown and we thought at the time that this decrement in physical activity would not be moderated by age we also expected increases in sedentary behavior from preeta during lockdown again with no age moderation um and we expected a decline across the board from preeta during lockdown in mental health but a greater decline among women predicated on data that we were looking at a year ago or just under a year ago so that means a significant lockdown by sex interaction now we did include nation in our analysis this was uh a descriptive study that looked across four nations but that was purely explored and we didn't have any our priory hypotheses in relation to nation so in terms of methods our study was approved by the brunel research ethics committee but also by each of the individual local ethics committees in each nation um we made some sort of cultural tweaks we ensured that each of the surveys was culturally specific using a lexicon that was specific to each nation and using demographic factors such as socio-economic status specific to each nation so i want to make it clear that we cannot infer causation from the findings i'm going to present today this is a cross-sectional study and in terms of perceptions of behaviors of mental state pre-lockdown we employed a retrospective frame so many of the researchers listening in will be aware of the error variance that is germane to the use of retrospective frames in research of this nature in terms of eligibility criteria we only sampled from adults residing in the four target nations and they needed to speak the main language of their country of residence we translated the suite of instruments into french for the french study in total uh we managed to get around two and a half thousand responses which we thought was pretty good um this is in the strict period of lockdown and you can see the nation breakdown a limitation which i'll touch on again later you get this self-selection bias when you conduct survey type research and we had many more women respond to our call thank you women relative to men so around 2 000 women responded and around 600 men and you can see at the bottom of the slide there some of the e-leaflets that we put out on a variety of social media channels in order to recruit okay so in terms of the measures um i want to highlight that we did think about exercise motives as a relevant predictor in the data i'm going to present today i'm not going to mention exercise motives which we measured uh using marklond and tobin's behavioral regulations in exercise questionnaire 3 which many of you will know is predicated on self-determination theory um we did use an instrument predicated on the theory of planned behavior by uh ajahn an instrument we developed here at brunel 16 years ago we published it in the british journal of sports medicine the brunel lifestyle physical activity questionnaire which taps planned and unplanned dimensions of physical activity so you know we were we were interested in this distinction um we were mindful of the fact that many people's planned schedules of physical activity would be interrupted by lockdown but we wondered what the ramifications would be for unplanned or lifestyle physical activity measures of sedentary behavior i'd say were fairly crude in this study we actually pulled the study together and got ethical clearance very very quickly in the matter of two or three weeks so we got um estimates of daily sitting and screen screen time in hours and as i mentioned earlier we assess general health using the general health questionnaire 12. those of you who are familiar with this instrument uh it's a four point scale uh i like her type skull and it taps depression anxiety and social dysfunction in terms of data analysis we did a very thorough screening of universe multivariate outliers we examine the various assumptions that underlie mixed model manova which was our test of choice and we used a two by four by four series of anovas and man overs but with the general health questionnaire data we used a two by four by two anova lockdown by nation by sex so looking at the results now i said that we were very thorough in terms of data screening and diagnostics in our screening we identified 200 univera outliers which we modified slightly to bring them in the range of minus 3.29 to plus 3.29 in terms of standardized or z scores we also identified 44 multivariate outliers so these are cases with an unusual pattern of scores so in this instance we took care to only screen out those multivariate outliers in the multivariate analysis to which they pertained so they were not deleted altogether they were only screened out in the analysis to which they pertained except for three cells that exhibited moderate negative skewness and 13 that exhibited moderate positive skewness we were fortunate in that we found normal distributions in the remaining 160 cells of the analysis so more than 90 cells in the analysis exhibited a normal or napoleon's hat type distribution you can see a normal distribution at the bottom of this slide there also as part of our screening we looked at boxes m test for equality of multiple variants covariance matrices all right so it's time now to have a look at some of the data so this is a stacked dot plot if you're not familiar with this uh type of data visualization it's fantastic in so far it allows us to present a large amount of information that the reader can pick up at a glance um you can see all three factors of our analysis in terms of uh preeta during lockdown the nations and the various age groups um you can see where differences lie they're marked by brackets you can see 95 intervals so with 95 intervals that doesn't mean that they cover 95 of the data but we're 95 certain that the mean of the distribution is contained within those um so what we've done here is for each age group the darker plot is the during lockdown and the lighter plot is the pre lockdown you can see quite marked changes to begin with just across nations there was in fact a main effect of nation and we did relatively well in the uk in terms of maintaining our planned levels of physical activity um also you will see that the planned physical activity levels of older adults above 60 years of age was fairly stable other than in the usa but the thing that is slightly concerning about these data if you look at the blue plots on the extreme left and the extreme right in the usa and australia you see a very sharp decrement in planned physical activity among young adults and this is a theme that we will pick up again later um we conducted a very similar analysis uh for unplanned physical activity so this is activity that isn't scheduled and there's an even more dramatic drop that is evident across nations in terms of decrements in unplanned unscheduled physical activity for young adults if you have a look at the blue plots to the left hand side of each nation that comes across quite starkly again relative stability for the older adults this is a little bit of a recurring theme in these data so now we move to a rain cloud type plot this allows us to look at the 95 percent confidence intervals to gauge differences and we set those in opposition to histograms what we've done is we've set the pre-lockdown distributions in pink and the during lockdown in in green you can see there that in terms of the interaction that is plotted it's a two-way interaction of locked down by nation for uh steps um that we get a significant lock down by nation uh interaction because it's driven by a very sharp decrement in steps per day in france note that there was a main effect of lockdown in terms of steps so across the board there was a decline in steps similar to the international data that i showed you earlier and if we switch to the rain cloud plot for lockdown by age group we see a sort of convergence as we go down the age groups there's a very stark difference in the steps per day from preeta during lockdown for young adults the difference is less marked as we progress through the age groups so the older adults above the age of 60 years were better able to maintain their physical activity in terms of steps per day this more objective marker here we move on to sedentary behavior this is a lockdown by nation a two-way significant interaction now you can see that across the board in terms of sitting and screen time there were marked rises in sedentary behavior but in some nations such as the usa for example if you have a look at sitting time in the usa you get a very very sharp increase in sitting time in the usa versus for example in the uk or if we compare screen time between the usa and the uk we can see again that there is a marked difference let's now move on to the two-way interaction of lockdown by age group for sedentary behavior we can see that pattern of sort of convergence as we come up in the age groups there is a very stark difference in the young adults age group huge difference from preeta during lockdown in both sitting and screen time but if we look at the older adults again although there is a significant difference when we look at the confidence intervals we can see that it is a less stark difference and here we look at a two-way interaction of lockdown by nation for the mental health scores now i just want to make it clear that higher scores on this particular instrument are indicative of compromised mental health so there's a significant lockdown by nation interaction it's a relatively small effect but it's significant and what we can see is that there is a very sharp decrement in perceived mental health from pre to during lockdown in the usa the difference was least marked in france these particular data reveal least marked in france um and now we look at the interaction of lockdown by sex for ghq 12 scores and what this is showing is there was a main effect uh there was of course um a decrement in mental health across the board but the way that women are perceiving lockdown seems to be causing a greater decrement in their mental health when compared to men it may be having to work at home having to homeschool caring responsibilities taking maybe a larger proportion of domestic responsibilities is having a detrimental effect on women's mental health and this is something that we need to pay very careful attention to this is a little brucy bonus this is not part of the data the international data that i've been presenting today but just to finish this highlights and and shines the spotlight on uk data this is using the exercise motives as a covariate and we see sharp decrements in planned and unplanned physical activity from preeta during lockdown top left we see a decrement in steps per day of around 2000 and if we look at the bottom there we can see increases in sedentary behavior sitting in screen time with these being most marked among young adults so this is an important and recurring theme in these data so moving on to our discussion um what is clear is that planned and unplanned uh physical activity as well as steps per day declines significantly um but there was an age moderation actually so h1 is only partially accepted um the um locked down by age interaction that emerged for unplanned is attributed to a steep decline among young adults as i mentioned earlier interestingly the decline is least pronounced in the uk so we did relatively well with our messaging in the uk across all nations there was decline in step counts of around 2000 so in calorific terms that's around 100 kilocalories or around the equivalence of maybe walking a mile a day there was an increase in sedentary behavior um and a lock down by age group interaction for sitting and screen time so given the um moderation of age group the second hypothesis was not accepted there was a strong moderation of age group as we saw in particular with the younger and older participants and we did encounter this lockdown by sex interaction so we accept the third hypothesis the largest decline in mental health was in the u.s sample and the smallest was in the french sample as we saw in the visualization and lockdown was particularly deleterious particularly harmful for women's mental health this is something that we might pick up in our discussion so in terms of strengths and limitations we've got strengths at the top here and um and limitations at the bottom we did make cultural adjustments for each sample and we were quite nimble we moved quickly to capture the data during the initial period of strict lockdown across the four nations given that our survey took around 20 minutes maybe 25 minutes for some to complete and that we didn't offer any incentive for completion the sample size was relatively good now the limitations i mentioned about the self-selection bias that pervades cross-sectional work of this nature we clearly had an over-representation of women um you know perhaps if we had in-person administration of surveys we would we'd been able to recruit more men but that wasn't possible under the restrictions we had a severe under-representation of ethnic minorities fewer than 10 percent of our respondents represented ethnic minorities people of color and also lower socioeconomic groups were highly unrepresented in our data particularly in the french data remember the problems of retrospective recall for all of you young researchers you're going to to get a greater error variance with retrospective recall of things like physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health but um interestingly the pandemic created conditions for what we call a a natural experiment and in our group we had to abandon existing research we had ongoing and take advantage of that natural experiment but i want to make it very clear that we cannot infer causality from the present design we can talk about associations but we cannot be sure about causality i think that needs to be made very clear so in conclusion lockdowns are associated with very negative consequences for physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health the world over it might also be that decrements in mental health prevent people from being physically active that might be a topic for discussion later the present findings provide particular concern in terms of the physical activity and sedentary behavior of young adults hopefully i've illustrated today what sharp decrements there were in physical activity and what shop increases there were incidentary behavior in this group relatively stable for older adults but marked increases in young adults and women's mental health was harmed more than men's by lockdown we might seize out the reasons for that later so what should future studies do they might provide incentives for hard-to-reach populations we just didn't have time to apply for funding and to provide incentives to our participants so that is something we might do in the future simply encouraging people to walk an extra mile a day would overcome those decrements in steps per day that we saw so 2 000 steps are roughly equivalent to walking a mile so that very simple messaging to the public could have a significant effect i think that intervention should be targeted specifically at young adults and using media that are popular with young adults such as tick tock and instagram um i'm going to stick my neck out here we heard japan mentioned earlier i think it was ruth who mentioned the lower levels of mortality in japan during this crisis well what do they do in japan they have designated time slots for physical activity so in many large companies people down tools at a certain time in the day and they all engage in physical activity just like the chap i've got in the image here during times of lockdown and national crisis should we consider a national time slot for physical activity when i was a a young boy mid-morning every day at school we'd have this movement for music and music piped over the speakers from bbc radio and we'd all move in time to the music we'd all be physically active do we need something similar at population level so that is my parting thought thank you very much for listening thank you very much costas for a really really interesting unique and really comprehensive study there of those four countries in particular and i'd like to start with some comments and questions that have just come in on the chat and just to make sure we don't miss those and ruth has asked um a really important question which she did the lockdown rules very much between countries that might have made it harder to make comparisons in the study and she also reflects that walking in in the usa is much harder than in other countries um so we have questions what is thoughts on that yes i have a couple of thoughts on that indeed there's less of a culture of walking in the usa um i studied in the usa for a while and there was a culture of going to the y that is how people generally got their physical activity it was very institution based at least at that time that was many years ago and we had certain phenomena in some of the countries so for example many of the french participants were recruited in paris where a very strict lockdown was imposed and people couldn't even go out for a walk so they there were indeed differences across nations and as i've mentioned again and again during the course of today's presentation this is cross-sectional cross-sectional data it's descriptive it shines a light on some of the differences across nations you saw from some of the earlier data that um some of the nations in the far east were hardly afflicted by this crisis but it had quite deleterious effects um on some of the western nations such as france such as the usa and this is borne out not only in the data that i presented today but across hundreds of studies that i have read in recent months including work that's been done by mark and his group at university college london thanks costas and some other comments and and kind of questions in the chat as well mostly relating to demographics of the sample which is kind of what you're alluding to as well that we would definitely want to pick up now so particularly so ruth's comment about you know be interesting to see women by age group for example so what are your kind of thoughts and reflections i guess on the gender composition of your sample and the findings that you've got specifically around gender i think to start with that would be really useful to discuss because i'm also thinking why in the first place you receive more female responders is that something that you might have reflected on and thought about um and your thoughts was also on the findings for gender yeah um so the the issues around gender are something that mark and i and our colleagues around the world have been reflecting upon a great deal um women generally were incredibly helpful and forthcoming uh in terms of responding to our questionnaire um women in general seem to be very um generous with their interactions on social media and picking up the sort of messaging that we were putting out in relation to the study men less so it seems that men sometimes require more badgering to participate in a study of this nature so just to make it clear that women were incredibly generous in giving up their time to participate in the study now from a statistical standpoint once you start looking at interaction effects and you have such a gender imbalance as we did with the recruitments in this international study it makes it very difficult um to look at for example lockdown by gender interactions okay it creates imbalances in the cells of the analysis and also in the way that data are distributed within cells of each analysis so from a a purely statistical perspective that is problematic in terms of generalization so if i were to do the study again and just remember this thing happened suddenly i had to abandon experiments and try and find a an outlet for my um desire to conduct research if i were to do it again i would get funding um and i would ensure that there was some stratification in the sampling so that i would have equal numbers of women and men but even more importantly still personally i was very interested in how the lockdown afflicted different sections of our community i grew up in a very poor but colorful enclave of south london and among the people that i knew from my childhood i noticed that the lockdown wreaked devastation in terms of people being hospitalized and unfortunately even losing their lives so i had an intrinsic interest in teasing out what those differences were across socioeconomic groups but in this type of sampling and doing it quickly and without resource i could not tap those groups and i'm deeply frustrated about that thankfully other groups with funding have been able to and their findings really bear out what i've had what i suspected from the outset which is that in terms of physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health this pandemic has had a sharply disproportionate effect on people from ethnic minorities and people in the lowest echelons of society so many of our interventions going forward should be targeted at those groups yeah i think and there's lots of kind of congratulations in the chat as well for for pulling something so comprehensive together in it with limited resources so i think you know other researchers etc appreciate it i can't see the chat but um oh yeah but thank you thank you for any any comments thank you um and there's there's been a few more kind of additional questions around uh well women specifically so i'll go to one first from maria um women's mental health and physical activity declined due to covic-19 compared to men can this be explained by hormonal changes more prominent in female physiology compared to male physiology an idea for a future study perhaps um in the in the present data the data that i presented the declines that were evident were more in the realm of mental health not so much in the realm of physical activity in fact in some instances and i've looked at some swiss and french data women from quite an affluent background a middle class background saw their physical activity levels even rise slightly because they had more time available not having to make the daily commute and with us able to to exercise so hormonal issues which was the thrust of the question um what we noticed in women in particular was this decline in mental health um and there could be this reverse causality wherein declines in mental health and the increase increases in responsibility in the inhibitions that are perceived by women are perhaps impacting on their physical activity levels i want to go back to what i said earlier about women from deprived backgrounds women from certain ethnic minorities maybe in patriarchal societies um in some religious groups it may be very difficult for some of those women to be seen to be physically active in the home and so i think beyond the hormonal and the mental health there are certain cultural barriers that i know some of my colleagues professor louise mansfield for example have been very active in investigating and so i've been sensitized to these barriers these data do not tease out these barriers but i'm nonetheless very mindful of the memo thanks costas and i think what you've just said picks up on christine's question already so i think rather than going back to that we'll skip to a slightly different question at the moment ten minutes left from shah um did this study account for physical activity in regards to season so during winters in france and uk i'm guessing there's a reduction in steps per day whereas in australia it would be the opposite that is an excellent incisive and insightful question thank you very much indeed given where we were with this study and the haste with which we had to bring it together we didn't have an opportunity to account for season and you're quite right to raise that as a potential limitation um i've done other research for example um i've done research on music interventions with older adults in physiotherapy rehabilitation and i know from that body of work that rehabilitation programs that are set during the summer month have higher attendance and adherence than those set in the winter months so this is a salient factor um and i thank you very much for bringing it to the fore i think at this point mark would you be happy to rejoin and we'll do some more kind of collective questions just to close and one question that i'd observed earlier that i thought would be good to get both of your um thoughts on was from siana and did your studies look at the effects of physical activity on long coverage and and if not just your general reflections on on the effects of um physical activity on like lancome would be good here um we we did assess covert status in our series of studies both within each nation and across nation at the time that we conducted our research long covered was not a phenomenon that we were aware of um and this is a term that has only recently entered the public lexicon um so i wonder whether from his more epidemiological perspective mark has some data upon which to draw and with which he can comment yeah unfortunately as you said costa says it's quite a new thing that's cropped up and um you know a large amount of funding has literally just been released to um to start to look at long covered so i don't think we actually have any particularly good data even at the moment on it um i just from a perspective of uclh i have colleagues at uclh with long covered patients um really struggling to know how what is the best intervention with some of these patients because even thinking about physical activity many of these patients are literally struggling to get out of their house and you know physically get out of their house and walk um you know 500 meters um so i think it's very early days for long covered and i don't think we do have very much data at all uh another question so describes a bit more of a general question for you guys so what are your thoughts on ways to improve representation in cohorts yeah i can speak to that briefly to begin with emma as i mentioned earlier we didn't have an opportunity to win funding to do the research relating to this international perspective during the strict lockdown but had we known how long the crisis would actually last for and the fact that there would be a second and third lockdown we would have applied for funding in order to incentivize the participation of those hard-to-reach groups in fact we would have been able to incentivize all participants the way that we approached it i realize now was not optimal in terms of democratizing the process and that is something i would seek to do in future and i just comment on how we deal with this in a very large scale cohort studies um the bottom line is it's it's a massive problem we know that the people that don't take part or you know decline our invitation to take part are um always from lower socioeconomic groups um they they also are less healthy they they're more likely to existing disease um obviously you you can't force people to to participate um what you can do to do though is to use certain statistical techniques to get around that so you can use not wanting to go into too much complexity you can use things such as weightings you can use imputation techniques and these techniques although not perfect they are designed to try to get around these sorts of uh selection biases thank you both and just for the final question um chairs honor i'd like to ask you both it's basically just to give your final takeaway thought i guess or take away comment that all of our attendees can can take with them and share to their friends and family about you know the the kind of overall relationship between physical activity and covid from your perspectives and your research from the full breadth of work that we've done it would suggest that physical activity has a role to play as a prophylactic in this pandemic it prevents the onset of obesity sedentariness inactivity diabetes it also serves to prevent the onset of uh depression and anxiety even if we can exercise impairs at a social distance it might counter to some degree social dysfunction so my message would be that any type of habitual physical activity during this pandemic is positive and as uh exercise and physical activity professionals we should be keeping our messaging as simple as possible so my message is walk a mile a day yeah and i absolutely agree with costas i think uh the clear message here is is anything is better than nothing um our data certainly support that and i just one final point for me is that um you know thinking ahead in future years it's very likely we're going to have further pandemics and i think as a in terms of prevention and public health policies we have to think very carefully about the the health of our population in in the uk um you know if if we'd have had a more physically active um less with lower prevalence of obesity uh who knows we we may have fared uh much better so i think there needs to be a a real push on that thank you both for those concluding comments so just like to thank you again both so much for your presentations today and there's lots of thank yous in the chat as well so thank you all so much for joining and thank you very much again to costas and mark for their time today and we hope to see you again soon ,True,False,True,False

She is a creative director and founder of a visual arts studio. She is a freelance hand poke tattoo artist and a co-partner ...,[Applause] i didn't really know what is actually mental illnesses when i was growing up because it was always taught that like if you go to uh beach hospital you go to imh it means that you are just someone who is on the street talking to themselves so when i tell people that i have mental disorders they will always tell me say oh you don't like it you look so like okay then i'm like what do you think mental health suffers looks like like they just look like everybody come on i do appear confident mostly but not because i totally am confident okay that's like a misconception people like oh you look like so put together we are cool whatever it is i hate it everybody's like don't put me in a part whereby i'm so invincible i'm not like i'm just a human being who is like probably going to break down at any time [Music] hi my name is jazz and i suffer from various mental disorders my motive here is to shine some light in mental health awareness as you may or may not know i suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder disassociative identity disorder borderline personality disorder anxiety depression mult bipolar and mild psychosis i think currently my ptsd is the one that i struggle with the most because the ptsd is actually the one that caused me to have depression to cause me to have other forms of like [Music] disorder it kind of rooted all the way back to like when i was a kid i guess i can remember things that are from 3 years old 11 years old 5 years old it imprinted in my mind very very badly sometimes i feel that i'm trapped there and i couldn't run out of it my mental health issues were the worst when i'm around like i say 19 all the way to like 24 year by year of accumulation of all the traumatic experience that i've had with my family my peers with schools with workplace it was just one thing after another and then just parked through like a whole chunk of like a load they have to carry so we are going through the first track right yeah what's the idea behind the song the idea for the first track is about like the past like a bad dream when i can't differentiate what is real and surreal so yeah i tried many ways to do it but then it's like it's not going anywhere so i was really like depressed and stuff so dino kind of like encouraged me to write songs and stuff to sort of like divert my anger and fear and sadness to something else then give me courage to write songs like with my broken grammar [Applause] is actually she's not like a trained professional singer but i i guess she she she loves music yeah just like me she she loved music from young like from the start so i guess that's her inspiration to want to do music now it's like and a creative outlet for her so bedroom is about the past like okay i see my life as a dream i don't think that like my assistant in this world is like a real thing it might be just a long dream that i cannot wake up from just another disappointment i really feel that like back then life was pretty pointless and meaningless and i wouldn't mind just at ending it kind of thing everything just so green it's just so so green and like you just couldn't get out of this black it's hole just a dream [Music] i work better with a lot of my suicidal thoughts so my suicidal thoughts will talk to me like a friend but suicidal is my toxic friend it's like an imaginary someone it just creeps in like you're not good you're not good that's where the bloodline of the um surreal and real thing like you sometimes you cannot tell i hope [Music] suffering for all these things uh it's like your mind is so tired and so busy and drained because your mind can work like point a to point b you have to go through like this whole part of mesa for you to dissect everything first to understand that this is actually what it is then you push through to it and say like oh okay don't get panic because that's not real yeah but it takes a lot please [Music] jess's condition has improved since more than one year ago but her depression ptsd and anxiety is still affecting her like sometimes during the day she still feels like a wave of depression anxiety so it can be a few days but then in the daytime she has to go and work so she has to sort of suppress or bury her feelings in order to do her work properly i own two basic studio so it's like a creative agency where i help brands to do their brand's content and also branding can you help me do like one shot right with three bottles together three bottles just plain with pink background here also can you know yeah for me it's like if the project is small i will do everything myself i will actually take charge of all the executing i like to have like my freedom my creative freedom to actually sit down and think what i can actually produce the best for the client i don't see that lamented illnesses is something that makes a person non-functional i have a very strong desire to get better because i always feel that my mental state is sort of like a blockage in whatever things i want to do when i feel depressed right i feel like not motivated and then i would be very sort of just self-deprecating kind of like mentality he's like oh i can't do anything i'm not good at suck and every and all these feelings it just like harvests me and bury me inside i just want to break through this whole blockage of mine which i actually since last year i saw a breakthrough that a lot more and then like now it's like i really can do a lot of things and i don't have all these things that's holding me back [Music] joy helps me to sort of like take my mind off things and then like helps me come down and also like solve like an escape so i will draw whatever i want and then nobody really can like say that what i'm drawing is wrong because when it comes to art it's like you can be expressive and stuff and it's something that like there's no judgement to it i'm actually drawing a nose with like bubbles blowing out of the nose so why is there a noose blowing up bubbles because like i always look at the new shrine it looks like the the thing that you put from the bubble up so i better with a lot of suicidal thoughts and it sometimes made me feel so pain inside to the point that i just hope i just really hope that like um i could just disappear from the face of the earth and so-called like dying is kind of like a fantasizing way of like sort of a release of myself so when you blow a bubble it's like you are like blowing your soul away going to my family in my childhood looking back it was pretty dysfunctional the punishment wasn't very lenient sometimes i feel that i don't even do anything wrong and then like the punishment was just like not good i guess it kind of gave me stresses and caused more disorder like a lot of things that even today i also have the anxiety when like there's a loud bang or like when i was like at my friend's house i would like scared that like you know their parents to school or whatever like i couldn't do this couldn't do that but actually like their house is actually okay so it kind of like still have this like sort of ptsd feel in my back of my head yeah i guess my family makes me feel that like i'm not good enough mentally i feel that like whatever i do is wrong i feel very like drained mostly because i feel that i always have to keep up to this standard it kind of makes me really feel like i'm just not loved where i wanted like the loneliness is like i guess it was like a big hole um when i first got diagnosed uh my parents think that it's like a taboo so they just feel that like i shouldn't talk about it i shouldn't um display elsewhere or whatever that is i shouldn't even go to a doctor i shouldn't even take my mess i should just like deal with it you know don't think too much okay i think back then i was pissed off there why didn't they support me and stuff but now when i look back it's like yeah they can't because they don't know and it's not their fault they don't know because my parents come from a generation that don't use internet i would say that the only reason why they sort of accept mental universes more was because the tv actually like sort of deep some awareness about mental illnesses and then that's where my parents sort of chanced by and washed it and then that's where they first realized that like what i'm going through wasn't a joke yeah and then they realized that it was actually a real thing so that's where they started to accept it more okay you know [Laughter] currently the relationship with my family is better than last time i think after i moved out things just like sort of get better it because they miss me also so i guess like that's how things just slowly changed for the better [Music] i love drawing a lot when i was a kid as i draw i feel like very relaxed very free very like like i escaped so a few years back i kind of like want to reconnect back to that part of me so that's why i started drawing again what that doing is like sort of the best way to go because i can actually earn money out of it while doing the things that i love and people are buying my art forever permanently on their speed so that kind of makes me feel happier okay just so how have you been lately great i think so far so good i mean i don't really have any much breakdown anymore but you if i have i will call you what that's true so sandra knew about my issues i realized that like the whole relationship was like a lot of times it's me telling her a lot of things then she's very patient to listen yeah i've seen like actually nowadays you're more significantly like better like more stable have lesser like outbreaks it's been like two years already yeah actually if you think about like how you've been since last like the first time i know you it's like a vast mass like vast difference before i met jess no i didn't have much of a knowledge about how severe mental illness could be i always just thought that people were you know it could be sad it's just emotions right it's like you just said for like a while then you can get better i didn't really think that it was a perpetual thing so when i met her i think it kind of educated me about the stigma of mental health and how important it is to destigmatize it what a lot of people with mental illness i feel that they lack something in their life that they are craving for i think it's important to just be there for them that would really help a lot in their um journey to recover there sandra you killed a bit more to the front of yourself oh you're closer yeah yeah i think that everybody has their own issues and it's not like they choose to have this mental illness jessa's mental health journey has definitely contributed in a very positive way to her work because i mean she's an artist right okay looking into the camera one two three did not remember to open your eyes for art it's never like something that is like a plain and simple by the book kind of thing every artist has their story that they want to tell so this is definitely her story and she wants to help other people like in similar situations as well to tell them that you know you're not alone you will get through this you just need to like find your way and find the right people to be around [Music] it's a baby stress i feel like tearing everything down i feel i don't want to do it i felt so troubled [Music] okay i want to bring awareness to mental health issues because going through mental disorders i feel very discriminated it's just that the hole is judging you like work place like you just judge me then i have like a family feel very judged by their friends that who doesn't know any better to feel that you are judged by them insurance also judge me in a sense that i can't get insurance also discrimination comes from every angle a baby stress i feel like tearing everything down actually i feel i don't know what to do i don't know i just feel everything very pretentious yeah i feel very like like like judgey and i it's like putting out a show everything just don't feel like me and then like i don't know i just felt this whole very overwhelm feeling because of i want to bring this awareness right then i have to actually put myself here to do this it's like yeah i feel like crap also i'm just like oh anxiety is like oh my god i'm so nervous and everything i'm anxious but then i have to do it because i think people need a voice to change the mindset of people so that is like so-called i have to actually put up with myself let's talk about discrimination many forms of discrimination can come like directly and indirectly so when it comes to the direct discrimination was getting rejection from insurance with um like from plans like hospitalization and as well as life insurance i think that is very uncaught for because personal thoughts and dreams right now is to get insurance like i really hope that my work here can really create enough noise to sort of alter the law a bit to solve no more discrimination from the insurance side [Music] hey what do you want give me a hug no schedule skip we met on a dating app and after that we we started hanging out as friends so we actually became friends first like recently we started seeing each other as like more than friends uh yeah it's been going slowly so as of now we're not really in a relationship but we're like friends but we're seeing each other i open my heart get crushed again i would say that i wouldn't mind being in a relationship with him but i think that he on his end he's not ready i think there's a lot of fear within him that like i have mental issues so like yeah i think he's scared that he's not up for it i dated myself but it boils down to loneliness so sometimes i do feel that like i shouldn't even tell the person that i'm dating that i have issues and then maybe i'll be accepted better but then it's wrong to think that way also so of course i try to be more honest i try to be more honest and be vulnerable since i get rejected a lot so of course that kind of makes me feel a bit like feel i mean you know try his best in a lot of things you try to take care of me be caring and stuff by scared that is a lot to us this is so [Music] surreal please just wake me i'm not gonna lie it can be tough like being in a relationship with someone with depression anxiety or mental disorders like in general so it's a lot for me to do i have to watch what i say i have to do the right things like i have to be extra careful and mindful not to trigger any of her traumas and and anxieties and all that so sometimes it can get very draining because i'm not a therapist i'm just a human i hope dream in certain sense i feel like i'm less of a human being i feel like i feel upset of course i don't think i'm rejected first time because of this so i feel that like generally i'm not good enough for anybody sometimes i feel that spring alone is better to be discharged means that you don't need to go back for follow-up it just doesn't mean that you're like fully recovered or anything it's just like you discharge from the hospital that's all when my psychiatrist wanted to discharge me i was happy but a bit worried i very scared that like i would relapse again and then i can't help i don't want to have an emergency and panic again but i feel very relieved that i'm much better now i guess i could let go a lot of things that i used to hold on with a lot of crutch so it's like a lot of things are let go and i guess i feel lighter [Music] whatever i've been through with the mental health journey actually got me to be a stronger person so i don't think i will be fully recovered but i feel that like that is actually made me a stronger person and i think that that should be something that we should celebrate instead of discriminating that you can never be better you will always be sick you will always relapse you know we should celebrate the fact that we have come so far and we have reached upon a stage where we can be contented with ourselves sometimes when people tell me to say i inspired them to give them like a hope or certain things to even help them speak up i feel very happy that like i can be an inspiration for someone else to help someone in their journey in recovery [Music] [Music] what's up ,False,False,True,False
Yeg687C9hGY,Overcoming Eating Disorders | Can Ask Meh?,UCsiZ4QJyWTdbtB2cfyDPApA,Our Grandfather Story,2020-05-28T13:00:13Z,"This video contains discussions on weight, body image and eating disorders - Are you trying to look hot? Did you lose weight? Were you proud of yourself?","What? Huh? [Inaudible] How do you begin [Laughs] answering this? Being completely honest at least 10 percent was that way like, most of the time. But the other 90 percent of it was just trying to fix myself. I think I'm trying to look decent. [Laughs] Not 'hot' per se, maybe just presentable. I was overweight (80kg) and I could only fit into guy's clothing at the time. I mean the girls in my class they were so much slimmer than I was they could fit into all these nice clothes and I couldn't. So I didn't think I looked presentable and I couldn't fit in with all of them just because I was too fat. No, not 'hot' but like I think just to look pretty on stage on film. I do have a lot of friends and classmates who do look good on stage so I felt like I wanted to match up to their standards. So I remember when I was 12 I went shopping with my mum. We were trying to find jeans or something but nothing fitted me. And the salesperson, she looked at me up and down and she said, ""I think she should just go somewhere else. Nothing is going to fit you here."" And I was like, ""Okay..."" And then it started. It just went downhill from there. That was the trigger point. When I was around 14 years old I went to a friend's birthday party and we were all wearing bikinis. And then we took a lot of photos Then we posted the photos on Facebook and then my friend told me that this guy saw my photos and then he said something about my body. I suddenly felt conscious ""Oh people actually care, people actually give a shit."" The main (trigger) I remember was this family friend. He asked, ""Have you eaten?"" And I said, ""Yes, I have."" and he said, ""Yes, it's pretty obvious you've eaten."" It was from then that something just clicked like ""Oh, people see me like this people see me as the 'fat kid'. So I have to do something about it."" It's all through people's comments like, ""Oh hey, why do you suddenly look a bit chubbier? Did you eat a lot? You look fatter."" That kind of thing from parents and relatives especially. I guess those words kind of took a toll it kind of affected me a little bit. Like, ""Shit, did I gain weight?"" and that's when I realised ""Hey, why don't I try purging?"" So, the first time I purged (out food) I used a toothbrush. Because I actually didn't know how to do it so I realised that if I just kept gagging, it would come out. Looking attractive was definitely part of the reason. But, after a while it transforms into something else it's way beyond the desire to look attractive. It is an obsession, an addiction. Like it is an obsession with (being in) control. Yes, definitely. I lost a significant amount of weight. Within a span of 2 months I lost close to 20 kilograms. So maybe in the morning, I would have a slice of bread (for breakfast) that was it. And then maybe for lunch I would have Milo and then for dinner I would have Milo again then that was it. [Laughs] Yes, I lived like that for, I think close to 3 years of my life. Looking back I really don't know how I did it but yes, I did. I actually lost about, 6 to 7 kilograms over 5 months. (My weight) was about 51-52 kilograms and that's really underweight for my height (171cm). But for me, I didn't care about (being) underweight. I just cared about the numbers on the weighing scale. If I didn't look a certain way that I wanted to look like I would take (my actions to) an even further extent to do so. Like, I would go to the gym to do excessive exercise, do really intense workouts and just not eat as much after that. So I would do anything just to reach that limit as fast as I could. I think I was about 60... 69, 68 (kilograms) for my height, I'm 175cm. I feel like I always have to explain myself. Like, ""Oh, I'm tall."" I hate that, but anyway. My lowest (weight) was 52 kilograms yeah, around 50 kilograms. This was when I was restricting my diet and I was running a lot. What did I do? I didn't eat. The less I ate in a day, the more shiok (satisfying) it felt. Go on Tumblr (for diet tips), it was so screwed up. (The Tumblr pages) would tell you ""Day 1: Eat how many calories Day 2: Eat how many calories."" I would just follow it. But it came to a point where I didn't even need to follow it. I just didn't eat. Don't eat, and then exercise. It was a very simple (way) to live. ""This is my goal, these are the steps to get there to my goal."" And it was working. It felt so good, even though the goal made no sense. From the period of 12 to 13 (years old) I lost (around) 10 to 15 kilograms and at that point I was quite small-sized already. Those feelings of, ""I still need to fix myself. Something is wrong."" It just didn't go away. That's when it transitioned into bulimia because I felt so (angry) and disgusted with myself. I knew for a fact that this level of self-disgust wasn't normal but I didn't know what to do about it so I started purging and throwing up (food). It was just a lot of self-hatred. If you had looked at me back then, you would've thought that ""She looks perfectly fine, perfectly normal-sized."" But I still didn't think I was (normal-sized). So I couldn't physically bring myself to the (clothing) store and try on clothes because I knew that if I tried on clothes and it wasn't an S (Small) or it wasn't an XS (Extra Small size) I wouldn't feel good about myself. So my mum would always tell me ""(You) look so good. (You're) beautiful."" I mean, I'm her daughter. I'll always be the most beautiful girl in her eyes. But, to me it's just empty words because at that point it wasn't even about how I looked anymore. It was about (having control over my life), it was like... finding an identity. [Laughs] I feel like that's a very dangerous question to answer. V: Yeah.
I feel like that's a very dangerous question to answer. But in a nutshell, yes, I was very proud that I was doing something to fix what was wrong with me. I don't know why I found pride in suffering. It's like, ""I'm purging, I'm not eating I'm hungry, I lost my period, my body is changing I'm growing random hair."" When you get very bad anorexia you start growing hair in random places because your body is trying to keep it warm V: Yeah, yeah.
or something like that. I was like, ""Yes. Like, look at me."" I was just so empowered that people were noticing that something was wrong with me. It was a silent victory you're just like, ""Yes, something is wrong with me."" I was very proud of myself for losing all the weight. I felt like it was an accomplishment. Everyone was complimenting me, asking me for tips on how to lose weight. Nobody thought it was a problem at the time. I didn't think it was a mental condition at that time. I thought I was picking up strategies from this disorder to make it work for me. When everything felt like it was in control, in my life then yes, I was proud of myself. But when everything went south when I became bulimic that was suffering to me because I was completely out of control. Like, it was so bad and I was not proud of myself, I was disgusted. I finally acknowledged ""Okay, this is a problem."" In the past, yes I knew ""This (orthorexia) is a problem but it's a problem that makes me feel good."" But this (bulimia) was actually a problem that was hindering my existence. I couldn't do anything but binge, and purge, and think about food. I had the mindset of not telling anybody at all. Thinking back about it, I just think to myself ""How?"" Like how did I reach that extent where even when I was out with my friends I could take the opportunity to go to the toilet and purge successfully without them completely realising about it? I just wanted to go through this by myself. Because I felt like, if I told them they would tell me the same thing ""You know, this is unhealthy for you. You should really stop."" Every time when my friends would talk about anorexia (or eating disorders) I would just say, ""Oh, why would people want to vomit their food out?"" ""Why do people have anorexia or eating disorders?"" In a way, it's for me to hide like, disguise myself so that people wouldn't suspect that I had it. It's very hard to make real long-lasting connections because there's this V: Yes I agree.
long-lasting connections because there's this big part of your life that you're just not telling anyone and when they ask, ""Oh, how are you feeling? How are you doing?"" And you're just like, ""I'm fine."" And like, by just lying like that you cut off 90 percent of potential friendships. For eating disorders, I feel like the reasons are always very shameful V: Yeah.
are always very shameful V: Yeah.
or like we feel very ashamed of it. It's like, ""One day when I get to the place where I feel comfortable in, then I will show the world who I am."" But it never got there. I don't think you will ever get there. Like, if the reasons are  not healthy, you're never going to get to a healthy space. What happened was I started passing out all over the place. Once, I passed out in church and then once, I think I passed out at the airport and then once, I passed out at the supermarket. So, at this point my parents had had enough with me. I think, my parents at the time they didn't really know how to handle the situation. And it's not because they didn't want to it was because it was very foreign to them the concept of an eating disorder. So to them it was just ""You eat. Eat and everything will be okay."" I got caught by my current boyfriend. He actually kind of, sort of realised it because every time I came out from the toilet I would have watery eyes. So I told him everything on the spot because I felt like there was no point hiding it anymore. Eventually I'm going to run out of excuses and can't be giving the same excuses every time. He was just there, comforting me and just trying to get through this with me together. I didn't really go through therapy or anything like that. But, I guess I got tired of purging. And tired of feeling pain and soreness in the throat. I was afraid that this would affect the relationship maybe we would fight more or something. I guess with him being more strict it's kind of a good thing for me so that I can get my mind straight. Like, ""This is serious and I have to do this."" What made me decide to seek help was that I knew I was going to shut down soon. I wasn't able to put up this facade for any longer. I wasn't able to go to school and do well anymore. I told my mum I told her like, ""I really, I think I cannot (handle it) anymore."" So she contacted a psychologist a psychiatrist, everything. So I went to see a psychiatrist. I'm so thankful because (my mum) is always there to make everything better. When I was 18 (years old) the insides of my throat and my oesophagus got burned so badly I went to the doctor and he said, ""You need to stop or else you'll need to go for surgery."" In my mind, I was thinking ""Okay, I need to stop purging because my parents will worry"", and I didn't want them to worry (about me), I didn't want to go for the (operation). And then it transitioned into a panic attack disorder so I was having panic attacks all the time. It was during the season when I was seeing the counsellor for my panic attacks and trying to not get back to bulimia. When it turned out I'm a... like, I'm a survivor of sexual abuse from when I was younger V: Mmm.
from when I was younger V: Mmm.
and I think, knowing and I think, knowing what I went through before explained a lot of things for me. It explained a lot of the self-disgust, the shame, and the image issues and the panic and the fear. The main reason why I try to fight my eating disorder or all my mental battles in my head is because I have a daughter now so, she's ten months (old) and I mean, I can't be the best mum to her, if I myself am struggling. So I try my best to stay physically and mentally healthy. I want to be a good example to her in the future. I want her to grow up happy, healthy and confident. I used to idolise supermodels and used to glorify eating disorders. It used to be my screensavers. Now, she's my main inspiration. I think recovery is never in a straight line there's no end point to it. You can't say that you have fully recovered because there will be days when you slip a bit you fall, and that's okay. It doesn't mean you've failed in your recovery. I try to avoid triggers by telling myself that no matter what other people say it's just their opinion just don't think about it. I haven't encountered that moment yet that I had to lose weight for an (acting) role. If I do encounter that I'm scared that I will go through this eating disorder again. I feel like I've come to a point where I can I'm learning how to love my body. Like if I have a double chin or my arms are flabby it's still me, I'll still love myself. After I dropped out of JC (Junior College) I went to a (polytechnic) I picked up a sport, touch rugby. So having a sport to work towards really pushed me in my recovery because it changed my mindset about beauty. Instead of working towards being smaller I work towards being stronger, being faster, being fitter. It was about shifting my goals into something that was healthy for me, for my body. I have a weighing scale, but I don't actively weigh myself because I don't want that to be a definition of what I am. Like now? A bit of fat here and there cellulite here and there it's not so bad. I think ultimately if you feel good inside and you like what you are doing with yourself then you are beautiful. This is going to sound so lame and cliched but like to me, if they are beautiful it's not about how they look. It's about how you feel when you are around them. It's the aura that they radiate the energy that they put out. They just start to look beautiful also. It's really internal, inside-out rather than outside-in. I feel like I see the beauty in a lot of different people in different ways. It's like, I will notice the small things about someone that they might not even like about themselves. So for example, some girls have very small eyes and I think that is very beautiful I like to make it a point to tell people that I like something about them. Whether it be their smile or like ""You have very cute ears."" Or something like that as long as it doesn't sound strange like, I will try to point it out tell them, like you know positivity (is important). V: ""You go girl!""
positivity (is important). V: ""You go girl!""
S: ""You go girl!"" S: ""You go girl!"" Wow okay. There was actually this one woman who DMed (Direct Messaged) me I think a few months ago and she was asking me for help like, how to (help her) get through her eating disorder. She's a mum of three or four kids and she said that it's making it very difficult for her to be a mum because she's so focused on her eating disorder that she cannot do anything else beyond that. And it makes me so sad because she was so ashamed to have an eating disorder at this age. She said, ""I feel like I'm too old for this. I should be smarter than this."" That's what a lot of people don't understand an eating disorder does not choose anyone of a certain gender, a certain age. It can happen to men, it can happen to women who are over 50 It's not about whether you're smart or stupid you're rich or you're poor, it's a mental health condition so it can literally affect anyone. If you are suffering (from) an eating disorder I would say, try to go to someone who you trust. Talk this out with them and if you need their help to control you from purging or constantly eating then let them help you and just keep reminding yourself that you can get through this and it will end someday. Don't know when, but you can get through this. Yeah. I think because we have been taught to downplay it V: Yeah.
""Oh it's just anorexia, just give her a burger. V: Yeah.
Eat a burger."" That's why a lot of people don't acknowledge it and that's why it's hard to treat. I feel like my eating disorder in the past perhaps was me trying to find a grounding in life trying to find an identity. Like, if I couldn't be anything else at least I could be a skinny person. So even though I am still figuring out who I am as a person I try to focus on what I am rather than what I'm not. And what I want to be what I don't want to be. Focus on the things that I can work on rather than the things that are completely out of my control. Yeah. Hey guys, hope you enjoyed this episode. Eating disorders aren't always associated  with anorexia. You don't have to be severely underweight to be diagnosed with one. The symptoms can be invisible too. Overcoming an eating disorder requires a lot of willpower and courage and if you are struggling with an eating disorder now we hope this episode can encourage you to seek help.

Learning how to cope with the stress in ...,actually uh let me just say um i have you can see the slide here in fact it just tells you i have just three things to say uh to add for this whole talk and it's gonna i'm gonna repeat them because i think they are very important and i think that everyone can actually do this um and so um it's not complicated and the three things are so this is why i call beginning with the end in mind at the end of this talk i hope that everyone can be a little bit more aware about mental health issues and how it can affect ourselves and the people around us people that we care about people in our family and our work the second one is the need to do a mental health check self-check once in a while you know and uh you know just now when we did the body scanning and and angie asked us how do you can you feel your breath can you are you aware of your feet and your hands where they are can you are you so that's that's doing a check and she asked what is your mind what is going through your mind but how are you feeling and i think it's useful for sometimes for us to do a mental well-being check of ourselves so that's the number two the third thing of course maybe many of you came to this talk because you want to do something to improve your mental well-being so take action there are many many things that can be done i'm going to talk about quite a few of them and some of them you may already have done been doing some of them you may learn something new from this so really i hope that everyone can take a little bit away from this session so these three things actually this is what my talk is about uh be aware of your mental health issues be aware of mental health issues and it can affect you do a mental health self-check from time to time and if you think you're not doing as well as you should be do something about it take some action okay now um angie introduced me just now and i am a psychiatrist i've been working in mental health care i think 24 25 years now and it's been a very enriching and rewarding experience for me uh because i've been able to journey with many people who struggle with mental health issues and help them along their journey of recovery um she talked about experience and really it's i just thought i'd tell you that it's not really about the the research that i've done or the journals that i read or the textbooks it's some of that but a lot of it is really learning from my colleagues learning from other practitioners in mental health care and really learning a lot from the patients and the people that i come into contact with because each and every one of them has something to teach me and to teach themselves and that's that's one of the points i wanted to bring across everyone who has gone through a mental health experience actually and have come out of it has got has gained something that you can you can it's a skill that you have you can take away for the rest of your life and you can actually impart that skill to someone else so each of you and i'm sure every one of us has gone through some mental health difficulties emotional difficulties you can help you've helped yourself you may not realize it and you can also help someone else the next thing i want to talk about really was about imh a little bit you know people ask about what do we do and uh what's how image has been affected by covet 19. so i thought just spend just a few minutes talking a bit about the work that we do um so this is a one snapshot with some numbers about imh so we are singapore's only tertiary psychiatric institution and we focus on three main pillars clinical services education as well as mental health research okay now we are very large hospital you start seeing numbers below and i'll try to explain some of that to you later but really we're designed to look after people with quite severe and serious mental health conditions uh we provide hospital services uh for both uh acute as well as what we call recovery care so maybe i just wanted to just let you know that there's a numb that's a number that's in green uh actually we have 2 000 beds in this hospital that means we can have 2 000 people staying in this hospital every night on average this is 2019 figures we had 1700 people every night staying overnight with us now and you can see if you took on the right the of the 1700 people actually about 600 to 700 of them are what we call acute care they've come in for a short in-patient stay we work closely with them to monitor them and help them to get well enough so they can continue their recovery at home uh but there's some thousands over patients who stay with us on a longer basis and we call that recovery care because they take a longer time to get well uh some of them have stayed with us for many years and our responsibilities to provide care for them as if they're part of the family now i just wanted to let you know that there's a bigger number the biggest number of all so sometimes people associate image with just the hospital and that we look after inpatients actually we have 47 and a half thousand out patients this is a much much larger number than the people who sleep in the hospital at night uh 47 and a half thousand people who just last year visited us at least once and many of them more than once in the year and they have come to us because of various mental health problems and our work really is to support them help them uh give them the right treatment and and and journey along that of their with them on their road to recovery uh of this forty seven and a half thousand actually about five to six hundred of them visit us in our various clinics every day so you know so that's the number on the left and uh of that 47 000 again uh 24 on average 24 of them have to be hospitalized every day and then they get discharged again so i you know i thought i just wanted to let you know that we are quite a large enterprise uh and we have an important role to play in singapore so therefore how did covet 19 image i think i have many friends and people who do ask me oh what's happening in your hospital how has covert 19 affected you and i thought i wanted to just share with you how what we have gone through as a hospital my team and i all my colleagues during this period now we have decided very early on that imh must continue to function and play its role in singapore as that national mental health center you must remember we just cannot stop and say we all work from home and then we also close down 47 and a half thousand people our patients and our clients and we need to continue providing for them also the 1700 who need to stay with us on a nightly basis so these are the three things i want to make it simple for everyone it is for you to know as well really i think the number one thing that we must continue to do is to continue providing our services so our hospital has never closed down during this period of covert 19 we've continued to keep our inpatients open our clinics have still been open and our emergency services happen as well right we had to scale down some of it but really we had to make sure that people who needed care will continue to get care the number two thing of course in order to make sure that number one can continue we must make everyone in the hospital our patients and our staff and our partners and our vendors who come and work here with us everyone must be safe from infection so that means a lot of additional infection control measures so you know you would know that you've got children going to school or you're going to work place everything and you've gone to a mall in singapore so many checks uh social safe distancing lots of checks going on and we've had to do all that as well here in imh uh and then the third item really is to make sure that all the changes that we are making we can continue for as long as kobe is around and is a threat to singapore and to our hospital and our people now just these three things that we've had to change has made us do things quite differently and you can imagine has brought about quite a lot of stress to everyone in the hospital how many colleagues do i have i have two and a half two and a half thousand uh 2 500 colleagues staff working in this hospital and we together collectively have to change the hospital to make us ready for covet 19. and you can imagine trying to keep us open our services and essential services on keeping ourselves safe as well adhering to infection control practices and making sure we have enough resources to go on for the last few months and next few months if we need to it's quite an effort and it's been quite stressful and then on top of that we just came out of circuit breaker uh we have to make sure that our staff and our partners and our patients also can participate in the circuit breaker measures so that is basically if we don't want them to travel and public transport and come to us we need to find a way of delivering care to them maybe by a teleconsult maybe by telephone maybe we can deliver medicines to them instead of making them come and queue up in the clinic so that additionally and the last one really is mental health obviously became an issue and a concern for many people who had to go through the stress of cobit 19 and circuit breaker and many of our doctors and psychologists participated at allied health professionals also volunteered their time to work in the national care hotline to pick up the call for people who called in who had difficulty or emotional problems and needed some help so really look at these things really a lot of additional things that we had to do at institute or mental health why am i telling you this i guess i wanted to let you know that we as a hospital are just like you and your workplaces we've had to go through lots of changes as well and really what does that mean um two things one is it can be stressful and back to my first point we need to know that it can be stressful and we need to look after ourselves as we go through this period and the number two thing that we have learned is that collectively when we work together and help each other we can get things done that's the second thing i've learned so we had to do all these new things we had to do teleconsults uh psychotherapy providing therapy to zoom like this aha we had to make sure medicines were delivered we had to go through patients who couldn't come calling them to make sure that they're all right at home and we still had to do home visits for patients who were in crisis so these are all the things that we have to do right so back to this point so i wanted to just tell you a little bit about imh because we have learned a lot about ourselves and that these three things too actually we have to be aware about the mental health of our staff and of course patients what's going to happen to them during this period we need to check ourselves from time to time how are we doing and the third thing is we need to take action to make sure that we are doing all right and this is the third thing i want to the third thing i want to talk about you see so our psychologists and many of our clinicians came together to say that's how let's see how we can look after ourselves better during this stressful period and they came up with a whole series of tips and help uh tip sheets you know and a little self-help tools which is going to be what i'm going to share with all of you because it works for us and i'm sure it will work for many of you as well and so some of the little things i'm going to tell all of us that we can all do came from our psychologist designing little self-help skills that we can all apply in image and i think they will apply to you too okay so now let's talk about how covet 19 and the changes that we're going through in singapore is going to affect is affecting all of us um i'm going to talk about different groups of people and i think many of you in this audience probably fall into this category you're adults and you're part of singapore's community right and uh you know i think you've gone through a difficult time all of us have and some of us have struggled through this period more than others um i've had people who told me how difficult it is because they were very outgoing they had many social contacts they had many activities that kept them out of the house almost every day and suddenly they were confined at home and they couldn't even go to work and they were asked to work from home it's a loss of their sense of freedom um the the need to have face-to-face contact with other people and you know some people just find that the phone or a zoom meeting is not the same and actually even more is to worry about how long this is going to last now these are certainly things that can cause quite a lot of stress now so what how does that translate into your emotions so i think this is the part about knowing about the mental the feelings that you can experience yes talk about you experience frustration anger you might be irritable you might snap at someone or you might feel an overwhelming sense of worry anxiety wake up feeling very anxious some people cannot sleep because they are feeling very anxious and some people feel alone and very lonely or they feel very bored it can rise bring bring about strange relationships i mean of if you're feeling very stressed and you become irritable then you're not very good company and then you may cause a lot of stress to the people around you right and so i think that's the first point you must be aware that the feelings that you're going through are a result of the changes in your life now i bring this up because the imh has done several studies and one of the studies we did was what we call mental health literacy and we realized that we as singaporeans are sometimes not very good at identifying emotions or being aware of mental health problems we ask singaporeans to tell us whether they can recognize different mental health conditions and only 60 6 out of 10 people could you know say oh this is you know some someone like this is going through depression or or anxiety four out of ten couldn't figure out uh how to how to understand the person who's going through a mental health problem so i think that's very important so the awareness that's that first point uh and um so the next thing is that of course what do you do right if you have some of these emotions um so you know again we have seen actually some of these mental health issues exploding into the public anger management people being unable to adjust you know comply with the need to have safe distancing or even to wear a mask in public because if you so frustrate the anxiety and depression i think we put these clips because i wanted to let you know that it's not a silent or a hidden problem i think as a country we have uh a much more aware than we were before about mental health problems and today there's a lot of public debates there's a lot of newspaper articles and social media comments about mental well-being and that's a good thing because we all need to be aware that first point be aware of mental health issues and how it can affect us so that's great i think it's good that we acknowledge that these things can happen we need to be aware whether it's happening to us or not and that's the main thing we'll talk about next now we'll do a little bit of self uh self check later but let's talk a lot about tips that you can do if you are experiencing some of the things i just talked about just now the frustration the worry anxiety depression uh irritability etc uh and i talked about the tips that uh my colleagues in imh have come up to help us continue working well in our image and so these are two little posters that came up in our hospital uh and let's look at which one first i mean the third the one on the left-hand side really is about you know exercising i know many of us think they know this but i don't know how many of us actually do it um so these things are not rocket science they're not going to tell you something that you don't already know in fact some of the things many of the things you already know it's just whether or not you are actually doing them hopefully after this little session that we have together you may take some resolve to actually do one of two of those things exercise regularly to get you some time for kindness a simple kind act um look out for good news i mean uh many people who have told us my patients as well as my colleagues have told us it's endless news about covet and gloom and bloom and terrible things are going to happen to us and really it's sometimes you feel that i need to know more because just in case i need to do something about it um my advice is if it's affecting your mental well-being too much information is not helpful look for some good news uh that we have one of these tips that says go and look for those youtube kittens and funny puppies it does work just helps to relieve the tension for that moment um we have to socialize creativity creatively you know video calls phone calls whatsapp uh videos and things like they do work uh the little picture at the bottom there you can see is what ng was just doing really it's censoring ourselves relax doing a bit of a relaxation exercise slow breathing counting your breath being mindful of the fact that there's breasts going in and out of you and everything else is actually all right for the time being at the moment so these are things that you can do um the the the the poster on the right are more ideas really it's about self-care they talk about writing a journal i'm not sure how many of you do that um exercise again playing games with people and actually there are some online games that you know some people have told me are quite fun actually um and on the the right-hand side of that house says trust and gratitude now this is something that i think we talk a lot about but i don't know whether we actually do it um and it's really about reflecting having some quiet time to talk about think about the things that we are grateful for that could have gone wrong but didn't go wrong we unfortunately um you know i've noticed that people tend to focus a lot on all the bad things that happened and they don't praise or celebrate or commend or acknowledge the good things that happened or in fact the bad things that never happened despite all the worry that they did and in fact if you prevented something bad from happening well done you know so that's great uh prepping yourself you know making sure that you're going to be working from home uh you need to make sure that and i i think under phase two many of us will still be working from home you still need to um perfect that art or working from home to make sure that uh things are okay uh and that you have a workspace and that your you don't mix up everything so that basically you find that you're working from from day to night and there's no end and no boundary difference between work and home life recharging everyone has a different way to recharge whether it's exercising whether it's connecting having a good meal having a warm shower and um and the last point really in this slide i thought is something that we don't do enough it's connecting just texting someone to ask how you are and telling them how you feel i think these are very simple things but i don't know how many of us actually do it all the time more tips that came up from my own colleagues really i thought i'd share with you um if you are starting to feel down there are a lot of things that you can do to help yourself you can pick yourself up on a little on a daily basis to give yourself a bit of encouragement it might not work all the time and you may need additional help but you can certainly do some of this even if other people are helping you you can still help yourself uh simple tips if you're going to be feeling down and out and you're feeling you're you're moving around in your pajamas the whole day and you don't feel like getting out of bed get out of bed get dressed and and try and stick to a daily routine it may be difficult for some but for other people just the act of doing that and self-care tells you that i do care for myself i'm going to get help it's a tough time but i'm doing the best i can for myself a little treat for yourself um you can have bubble tea now so i know that seems to be a big favorite here uh so you know a lot of pictures there are the same along the same vein actually of trying to be kind to yourself treat yourself kind you know kindly do something fun even if things are difficult it's all right for us to take a short break and be kind to ourselves watch our funny idea this is the one about cute animal videos take short walks um you know um um said you know where your favorite skincare makeup for the guys we should shave yo i've seen people who didn't shave because they're working from home i don't know if that makes them feel better or worse actually so um yeah so the impact of this really is uh you know i think people feel stuck and trapped and so you should realize that you are starting to feel that way let's do some of these things okay so you know i'm leaving the rest of the slide for you to read and i'm sure you've had a good look at them and i'm sure you're starting to realize that hey i couldn't do some of these things you know i didn't try or you you may have said oh yeah i've tried some of these it doesn't work then try some of the others okay now i thought i talked a little bit about kids because many of you are home with your kids now shouldn't that be very nice unfortunately sometimes it's quite stressful and we've seen articles about this in the papers and in social media but all tracked together and sometimes they call this cabin fever right and people who are not used to being together are now together and for the kids it can be a frightening or un anxious time for them because suddenly they cannot see their friends in school they have to adapt to technology at home and and have home lessons and then you know they've got their parents with them all the time and it's a different feeling um let me just share a tip with you my colleagues who work with children have told me that actually children are actually more adaptable than adults in many ways children need just a few things actually they need to have a sense of security they need to feel safe they usually feel safe when the people who they trust and they love are around them so actually just being the parents being at home with them is half the battle one and the parents mustn't be anxious or feeling very angry or very you know distressed though i mean if your the parents are in distress then if the kids can feel it but if the parents are calm and they are able to explain the situation and the kid knows that there's not much danger to him or herself that's half the better one kids also uh just like to have someone to follow they model so if the parents are doing something that is rare mask they practice social distancing the kids will pick it up quite quickly without questioning too much um and um you know so it's it's it can be challenging but it's also not impossible um so you know some of the points here really are the kids can feel overwhelmed if the parents are feeling very upset and emotional and keep talking to them about commitment changes and they can't do this they can't do that focus on what they can do and what are the fun things that have happened instead of having to go to school and they can do some things together right at the bottom is again being aware so when kids are feeling stressed they get angry anxious or depressed too and they can throw tensions so this is not again um your kid being bad or being naughty they're just expressing the emotional distress that they've been being aware that's the first point i talked about so many of my colleagues have kids uh and uh and we came up with a lot of tips as well uh to help uh the kids uh of uh our staff i mentioned i'm sure they apply to all of you as well right so right on the top right hand side it says parents can make a big difference and i mentioned just now we as parents need to stay calm if we're panicking the kids are going to pay you need to find out or you can observe uh you know i talked about the number two do a mental health check see how your kid is feeling if you're you know if your if your child is is fretful and anxious you know that there is something that you need to do something about um what you can do is provide them security and safety that this is all right it's okay that we are together at home now it's okay that we stop going out to our usual playgrounds or or fast food place it's all right because we have we will be fine and safe as a family and we'll do new things together uh and that's that is the that whole little squares at the bottom about having a new routine for the family you know um and it starts off by saying have you had regular check-ins with your children on their feelings towards what's going on give them a special space for them to do some studying uh remain calm uh let the children stay in touch with their friends if you can right give them a lot of encouragement actually some of these apply to ourselves as well when we do something well we don't pat ourselves on the back and then our kids uh do something they completed a school assignment and they managed to do state you know they managed to to to go out and wear a mask throughout the period and there was no we need to congratulate them and give them a pat on the back as well routines are important for children uh have meals together as a family in fact many people who said that actually this one of the good things about uh well good things one of the things that were not so bad uh that came out of the world from home was they spend a lot more time with their family and their children and um with adolescence it's sometimes a little bit more stressful but actually it works too um adolescents do like to be with their parents too uh and they it's a it's a changing time for their relationship but being together allows them to understand their parents in a new light and for you to understand your kid as well who is uh transitioning into a young adult right so i think we talk about helping adults helping children um so it's the same female we'll keep talking about being aware of mental health issues do a mental health check and then take action so i'm actually going to ask us to do something together now which is i'm going to ask you to tell me how are you doing uh chiang san from uh brahm is going to help us to start a poll uh qing sun are you on ah yeah okay so i think okay based on what we're doing you can start doing this now you should be able to uh yeah you're supposed to be able to vote yeah that's right it will come so i think there's a 360 of us in the room and uh let's see how it's doing um okay i don't think you can see the results now we will show you the results when it's all done uh and i'm telling you now that 130 out of 360 have have voted very good uh let's see how far we can go um ng how are you doing tell me how you're doing i'm good thanks prof and uh yeah i'm seeing the results most people are actually feeling fine so that's really good now i recall you mentioning about the parents and kids um somehow i think a lot of parents think that you know their kids would just know what to do but i think as parents we need to guide them like help them plan their day because they've never spent every day at home and this is a usual unusual uh way for them to be spending their time so it's actually very helpful if parents would sit down with them and plan out each of their hours uh even when they don't have any classes on yeah indeed so that that part about routine right it's a simple word but actually it's a very big thing to do because i think the whole routine kids love routines not they love it they sometimes struggle you don't want to go to bed but actually having regular bad times eating times going to school times is actually very good for your children so basically when they all get get disrupted it's very important for parents to understand that they need to build that structure around the advocates again they're right ng yeah okay so it looks like we have stopped a number of posts almost 300 out of 360. i think it's fine well done thank you very much for participating let's let's show the result can we show the results to everyone can okay you can see this right okay sharing poll results so i think there are 360 people in this room and almost 300 participated and you know the numbers are actually there so 157 of you 53 of you say you're fine well done i must say uh i don't feel fine all the time and i'm i i think how are you feeling now and i'm very very happy to know that okay feeling a little stressed up to 30 percent you know 90 of us i feel and honestly before this thing start this this webinar started ng and i were going to a little bit of stress because we had some technical difficulties and i couldn't get on my point is um feeling a little stressed from time to time is more than normal every one of us should feel that we should know that we are stressed oh and and angie told me uh we were preparing this don't worry there's time you see and that really helps to diffuse the tension and i say okay we'll try again and log in again right ng and so it's recognizing it and taking a quick action to calm each other down so that's not feeling a little you know of course feeling stressed sometimes i think all of you know is actually quite helpful huh because if uh sometimes we don't feel a little bit stressed we do doing things a bit too slowly having a little bit of stress to make sure that the meal is is is ready on time or the or the kid gets to bid on time really it's useful because it helps us to get things done or get assignments um 15 of you 43 said uh it's quite stressful uh but i'm hanging in there thank you for acknowledging that feeling i hope you can pick up a tip or two uh from this seminar and uh you need to practice more self-care and some of two or six of you say is really very stressful uh and yes it can get very stressful and that's why there are people and organizations and uh that can help you and i will talk a little bit about that next so can we stop sharing the slides uh the the poll results uh okay i can do that yeah okay i'm gonna go to the next slide really and uh summarize really you know uh the findings that the the results that we had from the survey if you're feeling fine that's 50 of you well done uh that's great keep it up and in fact i'm going to ask you at the end of this webinar to share your secrets because if you can do that other people possibly can learn a tip or two from you feeling a little stressed as i said that's quite normal stress can sometimes actually help us to achieve more stressful but hanging in there let's pick up a tip or two from each other today really stressful maybe you should get some help uh try helping yourself if it doesn't work and in all those things you try uh and you cannot manage get some help and the last one no one today put that category but i've done a talk before and people have picked that category and you really really shouldn't reach out for help and we put on this slide here but this this information was available quite readily that uh you should call for help if you know someone who is in that situation you know the help i can't cope um these are the numbers to call take a screenshot if you want uh because you can help someone to help themselves uh to reach out the national care hotline is the number we put right at the top and that is the uh the hotline set up by the ministry of social and family development msf really to serve singaporeans and all of us at this time of crisis uh during covet 19. okay i'm going to finish up the talk by talking about some special groups i won't spend too much time because we have a little we can have a little bit of a dialogue at the end of q a if we have some time but really it's about trying to recognize that not everyone is just uh you know an adult or a child here i think we need to recognize in singapore there are some vulnerable groups who are maybe experiencing additional stress and how we helping uh usually in the talk i'd ask my audience how many of you are healthcare workers uh and um and i mentioned right so a lot of this work comes from the fact that we learned from our own experience which we got stressed too and i i i'm my my thoughts and uh uh reach out to my colleagues in other health care uh organizations in singapore whether it's ncid or all the other public hospitals uh who are out there uh dealing with patients with cobit and also setting up a medical post in the community and serving uh many people who are affected by this condition so really it can be questioned and you all have all seen pictures of the healthcare workers in full ppe right they call that thing where they wear the whole gown and gloves and and goggles and masks um so if you're a healthcare worker uh it can be exceptionally stressful i know many other healthcare organizations have put in place various things to help their employees to work more comfortably and more safely and to feel more secure about their work and um you know all of you who meet a healthcare worker really please show some appreciation because it can be very tough for us so dealing with anxiety changes in work routines and of course there's always this fear if you are dealing with you're working in a hospital that you may come into contact with someone with a virus and then there's always this fear of bringing it home to your family members so i think this is important uh healthcare workers are really stepping up now to do a lot more and they are at risk for burnout and fatigue as well so in fact we do have quite a lot of uh this one is the imh one uh staff wellness support framework so i think we we do need to make sure that you know if you're a healthcare worker uh you need to do that self-check as well and you're not feeling so good emotionally uh reach out put your hand up and tell someone in in your team uh your manager your nurse manager your your head of department i need some help and say i went to this talk and the doctor said that it's normal for me to feel stressed and i need some help so these are the things that we can do um so healthcare workers um there are some other vulnerable groups and i'm talking about persons who already have mental health struggles and mental health issues um and so this is part of our work we need to be aware that many of our patients and their caregivers may experience even more stress um some of my patients uh and i'll tell you different stories because you know of course in the last two months or so three months i've still been seeing some of my patients and they've gone through different experiences some yes have struggled through and felt even worse than they already were feeling uh and felt that really you know the the cutting off of social ties and helplines and their regular routines made them feel even more anxious uh or even more depressed and we were helping them to overcome some of these difficulties um interestingly um what i wanted to bring across this point that what happens today doesn't necessarily mean it's going to continue for the next week or the next month i've had patients who have initially had a tough time with the circuit breaker measures because they just found that was such a disruption in their lives and they couldn't do all the things including work uh and and then they were left by themselves and they were overwhelmed by their emotions but you know interestingly over time uh they allow themselves to adapt and just accept the changes and some of them actually felt better after a while in fact some of them who have been experiencing a lot of stress from work said that now actually working from home and the boss not being there or looking over my shoulder and asking why is that not done actually was a bit more uh uh less stressful than before so after the initial change of having to adapt to working at home and couldn't check with other colleagues they found that she was quite okay um so uh for people who do have mental problems it it can cause a change it has not necessarily becomes worse it can actually get better for some people um and um some patients have relapsed and again we have asked reached out to our patients to contact us if it's affecting them badly and they are having worse symptoms and they may need to come back for urgent care right and so if any of you know someone who is struggling with mental problems you know this is additionally special difficult time for them so ask them how they're doing same principles apply you know they can also help themselves or they may need to get additional help for their problems um this is a group that's often talked about individuals who are in difficult situations at home uh with already broken down or difficult relationships to handle with abusive relationships uh and uh the circuit breaker which is over now you know spending time at home uh in a confined space with people who there's a lot of tension can cause problems and uh more frequent uh or abuse and in this group really we ask individuals who know of such people or if you feel you're affected you must reach out uh you must call one of those hotlines or make your way to uh well i'm not saying to imh but necessarily you need to go to get help whether it's one of the family service centers a community center make a call go and see a gp a family physician you need to just let them know that you are in a state of distress and um you need some help okay so we need to recognize that this is a group that is vulnerable um there are also persons with special needs um these are individuals with uh maybe uh physical disabilities or intellectual disabilities um and um circuit breaker as well as all the changes in uh covert 19 can cause some distress to such individuals you know i listed them down there really confusion also disrupting disruptions to routines um lack of sensory stimulation and again so the last three points is really recognizing that this is a mental health tissue that we can do something about because you get tech tantrums uh the behavior changes uh and so you need to recognize that this is not normal and that we can do something about it uh try some of the techniques we talked about earlier you know putting back that routine asking them how they feel try to give some explanation uh and see if it works if it doesn't reach out for help um there you are so supporting individuals with special needs in fact some of my colleagues together with colleagues in nuh as well as singh health nuhs and singh health actually had come up with a little care kit for people who are caring for individuals with special needs i think if you go to the imh website you can get a link a copy of this resource which is a which is uh online which is a soft copy uh book that you can have little tips that you can help if you are dealing with someone with special needs um one last group i wanted to talk about really uh you know people who have been going through a particularly difficult time in singapore and you know it's our uh migrant workers who've come to work and built singapore do many many essential jobs for us um so of course we know it's been an extremely stressful time for them from fear to being infected uh and the uncertainty over their future um just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten about this particular vulnerable image has got doctors and nurses who work with a leading ngo health serve that's that supports uh the migrant worker population uh during this difficult time right and uh so we mentioned that as well last group to mention really is uh the elderly amongst us um all of us have uh older friends or relatives that we care about and we mustn't forget that this can be a difficult time you know many of us are doing okay today check in on someone that you know who's older it can be an auntie uncle that you know or a parent grandparent uh your neighbor just checking with them to find out how they're doing we read a lot about how some of them get disconnected from their children especially during the circuit breaker period and they don't know how to access them using technology and they they feel very isolated and they don't know what's happening around them um so reach out to them the same one two three be aware that they can go through a mental health challenge because of the current period ask them don't assume that they're doing okay do a mental health check on them and say i know uncle how are you feeling you know what's happening with you can i help you which is the third point uh you know can i give you some you know can we do something together that you know i can i can help you with so that you can feel better help them and try and get them to help themselves or help them to get help if it's necessary okay now um i'd like to really end on uh two points really that you know um that as a country uh i think we have recognized that this is a difficult period many people have come to ask me so are we going to have more mental problems in singapore and the answer is i think we have to be prepared for mental health issues because it's going to be a difficult period over the next few months or even in the coming years not everything is what a psychiatrist calls a mental illness we have mental health problems because of the things that have changed around us the circumstances about whether our work will be the same whether our families will be affected whether our children's schooling will be affected if whether we can we can travel to visit people overseas and our business our work involves traveling there's so many uncertainties uh and we also know that we may be facing uh economic issues in the recession so all these issues are going to contribute to our mental well-being now just this slide shows you that as a country we are coming together to we recognize this that first step we have to recognize that there can be mental health issues and so these things which are all about budgets and supporting us through this difficult time all of us in singapore is actually one way to help to prevent mental health problems from overwhelming us right so it's it's something that we're doing together um these pictures of course are what i think our government is doing for us but can you do something for your friends and your community can you step up and do something for yourself and your family too i think everyone can do some of that and that helps prevent too many mental health issues from becoming a problem um there will be some people who still need help and again uh in anticipation that is going to be a difficult time that are help lines available so early on that was that slide that had the helplines and i hope maybe you needed information it is all available on the internet anyway but this was one i wanted to talk about the national care hotline that number there 1800 202 6868 uh when it's set up by msf uh my friend vivian who's uh helping chief psychologist there and really it involves many professionals from many agencies many from imh uh participating in the hotline and um it's a good resource if you need help or you know someone who needs help give them this number ask them to call because they get someone on the other line to talk to them it's a real person who listens to them finds out what that problem is and if it's a mental health related issue they are they are channeled to a mental health profession to speak often times though it's about uh you know financial issues or economic problems about work issues i've lost my job what do i do and the helpline is also able to help direct them to the right resource okay now um we have come to 12 o'clock i mean you've been i see you you guys are still there 360 of you amazing thank you for listening i hope you picked up a tip or two and uh actually i thought now we can do something together um just reminding us actually i wanted to summarize because basically this are the three things i wanted to say angie uh and i wanted all of our participants to to and i'll say them again a bit a bit boring but actually really important please be aware of mental issues two is do an occasional mental health check the way we scanned our bodies just now do a check and then take an action to improve things okay so now i'm going to ask all of us again to participate um can you go use the um stop the share right so maybe you can stop the share oh can you use the q and a section there um um okay we'll go back up later to see about answering questions but i thought maybe at this point in time let me i thought it's useful for all of us to help each other um by sharing each other's tips angie what do you think should we answer some of these questions first or get everyone to help each other yeah i think it would be good to have some of these questions answered but i just wanted to chime in that it's so important right now that we focus on what we are able to do rather than lamenting on the things that we can't do uh including just checking in on your neighbors and if you are cooking something cook something extra and give it to your neighbors it's a shame that uh in the work that we do supporting the elderly in some of the communities we found um one of them had died and the body had to be taken away by the police because the the neighbors were not even aware another man had a heart attack and was lying in his urine fortune was found by one of our staff we called the police and he was then transported to the hospital he died a few days later but that's much better than dying lying on his uh urine and feces and and being in you know starving and and feeling thirsty so i would really urge all of you to show some concern and care to the people who are just living next door to you and do an act of kindness by even just saying hello or sharing something that you have if you're going to the market buy something extra and give it to the uncle auntie next door at workplace as well uh i've seen uh you know we okay image are very fierce it's guys it's very strict now we cannot we cannot close each other but it doesn't stop us from delivering cookies uh and giving someone something that you may made at home uh and i think we can all do a little bit more so i think this is the time let's look at the q a um i'm not sure how how because shall i read it to you yeah you may i can wait which one should we answer pick one or two how does any patients who don't want for common appointments and do you want to take medicines um it's a tough one i think really it's about having a relationship with them so they they feel that they are unsafe about coming to us and they are maybe they don't even recognize that they have an illness that needs help really i think we we have many partners uh in the community uh that you let us know who they are and we will reach out to our partners brahms is a partner for example when they will do a home visit try and make friends try and get them to come help us if there's a crisis there's actually a helpline that you can call to imh and basically then we will if it's a crisis we do send help immediately um and um i'm just picking some other questions anxiety from unable getting support and resources easy and fast i.t support oh yeah this is about the work from home and don't we all know it um first of all can i just say that anxiety when things change uh when circumstances change and the way you work and the way you you live your life suddenly has to change is anxiety provoking so first of all i think applying some of the mindfulness uh principles accepted there's nobody there's nothing wrong about feeling anxious because things have changed uh so like just now i'm trying to log on and i couldn't and we i said oh what are we going to do and we just accept that okay this is going to be a bit of a glitch we have some time and slowly we'll fix this so uh be kind to yourself be kind to the situation i think angie and wrote an article a couple weeks ago about not judging and not you know judging or blaming and saying all this work from home is it them you know nuisance and i blame my boss i blame the i.t support um actually i think they're trying their best as well so i think the answer to that question is stay calm i'm sure your boss will understand that you cannot get things done as fast as you normally could uh explain why uh ask for help wait uh for the i.t support to come and get those uh things that you need to get done um prof do you have some tips on how we can establish work from home boundaries stop the earth to check email uh okay sometimes uh i'm a bit guilty of that so i tell you what um you should try really to to silence your phone or or stop checking at a certain time i'm not gonna tell you what time i have to do that i have to stop doing it um but it's a bit of discipline you know and i think the anxiety of course is i might miss something something urgent might happen and i i i won't i won't hear about it um but i think you need to give yourself that break time so i think the boundary is important uh yes my colleagues have told me sometimes working from home it's actually stressful because there's no boundary between work and personal life um set your office hours uh if you're if you're starting later and you end later but there's still an end time if it's six o'clock or seven o'clock that's the time you break off and spend time with your family and log off and maybe you can tell your colleagues that i'm not going to be checking my my emails anything just call the phone so if the phone rings then it's an emergency everything else by message or whatever you're going to check later um i know it's it's easier said than done but i think sometimes we don't even bring this subject up because we are so pricey and shy to be the first one to say that in the office so i think i'm giving you permission to do that and any of my colleagues out there please do that as well tell me i'm not picking your call after a certain time ceo okay angie any any things to mention there well i think this is where we have to set our own boundaries right in terms of self-care so we say eight o'clock is the time then we have to make sure we observe it because it's not like our boss sometimes is the one who insisted yeah indeed um someone wrote about caring for seniors and then serious misconception and i image about i image that person is that that someone goes to image that person is no is lost and no more functioning is like a dead yeah it's very sad um i i'd like to think that you know imh together with many of our partners including brahms and and many of uh ncss uh many i would like to list some of them here but there's so many partners the singapore american community services singapore association of mental health silver ribbon i don't know if you're out there listening uphill uh resilience collective um family service center so many of our partners agency for integrated there are many many partners today they're really trying to change people's perception of mental health and mental well-being and seeking help is not okay i think if you if you don't get help and you don't do anything until it's really late and it's bad of course then if you go to a place and and it's so much harder to get better than the idea really is my three points again recognize that mental health issues can happen to anyone and it can really happen to you or someone you love do a check don't be shy to ask how are they feeling and they're not feeling good try to help they can help themselves you can help them and if they need help bring them to a professional image i mentioned we have recovery we do a lot of work with people who have acute crisis they get well they improve they recover they get back to on their life what they were doing before and you know we support them and even if it takes a long time we we i'd like to think we never give up uh we always work with our patients as long as they continue to stay with us and i think maybe that's the message you can share with people who have concerns about mental health care um so many questions uh how to manage it just got very how to manage it just got very upset and worked easily and bp spiked up to feel busy ah i think this is uh right up ng's path so this is something that happened and we get really worked up and and you get you lose emotional control and you find your whole head is going to burst what do we do well i'll put in the plug i will be running the next mindfulness based stress reduction course starting tuesday so if you'd like to learn how to manage your stress or relieve your stress uh it's important to have the right techniques and skills to do it because we can't just leave it to our own coping skills if we don't even have them right now indeed well done so are you doing this next week or there's the course right that you're helping us that little thing we did at the beginning that mindfulness that relaxation exercise really i wanted to just say you know that practice makes perfect oh don't worry we got time to do one more round of that near the end okay there's so many questions i wish we can answer of them but i really wanted to hear from you um i i just one last question how do you think we can reduce the stigma of seeking mental health for those who do not have severe mental issues i think you can be an ambassador tell them what you heard today that mental health can affect anyone and that then you if you check and you find that there's an issue you the earlier you find and do something about it the better and not everyone has to go and see a professional or psychiatrist we can help each other there's a lot of resources available online and so you know if we all talk about mental health in a very positive way that we can improve and help each other it doesn't have that stigma of oh people who have mental illness must be really you know in a bad state and nobody can help them that kind of thing is the talk that that brings about the stigma okay okay maybe i really wanted to do this you know i really want all of you as many as you can in the q a section please share with me and share with each other the things that have kept you going during this difficult covet months uh so that other people can learn from you i've been i've been talking to you and i'd like to hear from you what have you been doing uh just type in uh under the question right and q and a right yeah well ching can you turn on the chat so that people can use the chat it might be easier okay we'll turn on the chat function uh ng uh unfortunately the meeting have to restart if we turn on the check no worries okay all right yeah coming in uh cherishing family time i'm going to read them up uh family time really yeah signing up for webinars okay i think it stopped raining though i think you need to go out for some fresh air we'll keep swallowing them yeah exercise every day at 6 00 pm 20 minutes to one hour well done john i think um you know i think i don't know i mean a lot of people say they do but when you actually ask them do you actually exercise or not then they'll say oh yeah already once a week or maybe once or twice uh so i think really the discipline of doing it every day really helpful well done john baking is such a common thing that we've got a crisis in singapore over flower now right now enough i'll tell you a funny story one of my patients tried baking and it was very stressful for her because she couldn't get the flash she lined up then later on she made the thing and the family didn't like it so fast but you know what there was a happy story to that see i'm not gonna do baking it's horrible and she ended up doing uh um knitting instead and she said that one no one was competing with her she could get the wool and she could do it and everyone was appreciative taking masks i've seen many people have been making masks and i think that's one thing to use uh well you can fry noodles and uh make way spirituality meditation uh uh and i guess you're plugging the mindfulness concept pet therapy works wonders yes indeed uh if you don't have a pet you can see other people's pets on youtube or adopt a pet from spca thank you for reminding us to be positive there's many many things to be thankful and grateful for sometimes we don't look at it and it's just looking at all the negatives that we have spirituality and religion thank you for sharing that um

it's for and for someone for any age can do running as well or jogging yeah uh hi nice to see you in this chat i know some of you uh mindfulness from manhattan uh tip that helps me from frank do periodic checks on how well i and my loved ones are satisfying our basic needs yeah so that periodic check is really what i was talking about isn't it because sometimes we just assume that everyone is fine uh and we don't ask and um just ask how are you doing uh and you're not listen listen carefully and let people express how they're feeling uh so a check that's very helpful for my family cooking for my parents i told you a funny story because i went to the hawker center and i i asked the guy that usually buys food from and he said this is no good huh and uh i said oh why but uh you know people can tap out right he said no but people nowadays they learn to cook themselves you know so i think that cooks my business you want me in trouble i won't say it's a funny story because on the

this time with us and me and angie we really appreciate this uh keep looking down and uh and looking up the list of the various things you've mentioned all wonderful thank you all very much angie uh how shall we end this you want to just do a quick censoring ourselves in fact look at the list gets you back and sometimes you know i think we should come i was excited sure i'll be glad to uh let's do a three-step breathing space which is uh taught by oxford mindfulness center as part of the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course and uh this might be very helpful in terms of centering ourselves and just kind of regain that little extra calmness uh for our mind to have more space uh in order to see things in more in clearer form as well to make better decisions so um three-step breathing space starts with being aware of our body which is slightly similar to what i brought you through earlier on and then centering on the breath and then back to just um being aware of the entire body again so those of you who may be signing off thank you for joining i'd like to acknowledge turbo1 for sponsoring this talk in particular mr alberto and those of you who are staying please join me in this mindfulness practice of three-step breathing space so find yourself in a comfort position nice posture supporting your lower back closing your eyes and let's start with three deep breaths and just be aware of how you feel in this moment right now if there's any presence of emotions feelings and what's the weather like up in the mind and noticing body sensations that may be present so we do all this without any judgments it's just be aware and if there are sounds that you can hear take note of what the sounds are it could be dropping of the rain doors opening closing and just to take note without any judgments now let's become more aware of our body starting with our feet knowing where they are and just feeling into your toes other feet happy where they are if not adjust the position move them flex them and then noticing your bum in the chair adjust your upper body if you feel that one side of the bum is carrying more weight than the other side and just slide up your back into your shoulders and your shoulders tense so relax and move your shoulders gently slightly release any tension that may be present notice where your hands are and move your hands to a position that your hands are going to be happier and are your fingers open and relaxed and sensing into your abdomen your chest and be aware of your facial expression any muscles that are tight the cheeks or the jaws the forehead so this is the first step of the awareness whatever is in the present moment and the second step is focusing on the breath wherever you feel it the most just observe this beautiful breath going through your body keeping this body alive and feeling a sense of gratitude for the presence of the breath without this breath nothing in life matters so feeling a sense of gratitude that this breath is still here every moment giving us time time that we can use to be useful to value add and to serve others now step three expanding our awareness back into our body noticing our feet again and the length of our legs our torso our head and from our right hand spanning across our shoulders to the left hand and really sensing into the entire body that we live in a sense of gratitude for everything that's working in this body even if it's not perfect it's good enough and now just sensing three more beautiful breaths and opening your eyes with a new sense of gratitude for this body and the breath so i hope that helps to relax you a little bit more thank you right so with that uh like to thank professor cho hong chun for giving his time and sharing his uh experience and knowledge and in this guidance uh to how we can maintain better mental health and not to take our mental health for granted and we can certainly help each other maintain good mental health by uh being cheerful being kind of being grateful and not indulged in being angry and volcanic in nature because that actually causes a lot of stress to other people so tomorrow we will be

director health and social sciences at sit professor wong please thank you elijah good morning warm greetings from the singapore institute of technology health and social sciences the singapore institute of technology or sit is turning 12 years old this year this is our seventh year as a autonomous university as a university of applied sciences we have been running health sciences program since 2011. our pre-registration health professions program started in 2016 and today we offer programs in physiotherapy occupational therapy speech and language therapy radiography and dietetics we also offer a post registration program in nursing for those who are registered nurses with diplomas in nursing from nanyang and neon polytechnics there's never been a better time to join the healthcare sector we are currently living in the midst of a pandemic the world health organization declared the corvit-19 outbreak a pandemic on 11 march 2020 so we are most one year into it singapore has seen spites of cases over the past year but these are now mainly controlled and we now have vaccines against kobe 19 but whether we can achieve her immunity and which to be seen many countries including ours are now busy working on immunizing the populations health professions we call allied health have been making important contributions to healthcare for a long time for example radiographers have been instrumental in providing timely medical images that allow doctors to make diagnosis and timely decision on treatment there are important people to alert the diagnosis of pneumonia in people with kobe 19 infection physiotherapists occupational therapists and speech and language therapists are pivotal in the care of patients with chronic diseases they provide rehabilitation for people after acute diseases injuries or surgical procedures and even for people who recover from corvid 19. you may have seen in the news about the bangladeshi worker who spent nearly five months in the hospital including two months in the intensive care unit and five weeks of intensive rehabilitation and finally dietitians provide medical nutritional therapy and they make significant contributions in advising the populations on healthy eating healthcare professionals such as these and doctors and nurses are recognized by singaporeans and our government recently our deputy prime minister announced that public health care workers would be getting a raise in their salaries being a healthcare professional is not a walk in the park there are many challenges in healthcare and some of you may find wearing a mask for an hour tedious and undesirable but imagine wearing it for eight to ten hours a day in your job but the most meaningful part about being a health professional is making an impact on the lives of patients helping them restore their health and independence and getting them out of the hospital beds and back to their homes with their loved ones i hope you will find your calling to be a health professional because indeed that's never been a better time to be in healthcare sector and find fulfillment in a career as a healthcare professional this morning we are grateful to mohh for allowing us to share with you about the health sciences programs offered by our university you will see how our campus teaching and learning spaces and labs look like you will hear from our students on what it is like on a typical day of learning anyway experience how we conduct our lesson please do not hesitate to ask questions and we will be happy to address them i hope you will find the session helpful thank you thank you paul from for the opening for our next speaker associate professor tan being lead will be giving us a health and social sciences program talk proftan is the director of programs health and social sciences cluster proof time please hello good morning um it is still the chinese new year period so i think everybody is still in the festive mood and for those of you who have just received your a-level results i'm sure you are now thinking about what is the career path you would like to take some of you may have ib some of you nus high and some of you have a polytechnic diploma so it's not actually at the crossroads of your life whereby you're going to decide what kind of degree do you wish to pursue which may determine your career in the first few years and for health sciences you will realize that a lot of people who pursue health sciences degree they make it their lifetime profession and you will see why okay prof wong just now mentioned about the kobe 19 situation and how healthcare professionals rise to the challenge to contain and manage this disease this virus and at the same time i'm sure you have also heard about a lot of work dedication sacrifices that healthcare workers have to meet i'm sure you have been touched by them and i think all of us here at sit health and social sciences faculty we are very proud of being a healthcare professional because we think we can actually contribute to the society to our family to the family and friends to keep people safe to keep people healthy i think beyond also covet 19 there is also a realization that healthcare professionals have a huge impact on chronic diseases chronic illnesses as you are aware a lot of chronic illnesses such as diabetes chronic heart conditions stroke they are actually affecting a large proportion of the singapore population and several of these chronic illnesses have a huge disability burden and allied health professionals are actually the ideal profession to work with people with these conditions and this is why when we first launched our allied health degrees in 2016 we had a very very huge uptake and that is also of course the the projection that more allied health professionals will be needed in the next few years okay as i said there are a lot of people vying for places in our health sciences courses later on i'll talk more about these programs as well as our selection criteria but i think what we want to see is that people who are interested in being a healthcare professional to take a leap of faith to go into this profession okay and i've said just now that we launched our health sciences our allied health degrees in 2016 and our first four allied health programs are physiotherapy occupational therapy diagnostic radiography and radiation therapy and in 2016 we launched the dietetics and nutrition program and in 2020 last year we launched the speech and language therapy program we also have a post registration nursing program as profound as mentioned just now okay so for last year we actually have more than 3 000 first choice applications and about 1 1000 or so are shortlisted and in the end we offer about more than 600 places to our students so as you can see here our programs are highly competitive but we hope that people who are interested in this profession will still try and go for it because later we'll talk more about these programs as well as our admissions criteria but these are our programs again in a snapshot i will start with physiotherapy i think most of you will have heard of the physiotherapy profession but just to give an overview physiotherapists restore normal human movements and many of you may be familiar with the profession of physiotherapy in the area of sports sciences but physiotherapists actually work in a variety of clinical settings and with different specialties and with different patient population from the very young the new next to the very old the geriatrics the older adults so it's not just with a sports men but we need a lot of physiotherapies given the aging population so besides sports rehab center physiotherapists has a huge role to play in acute hospitals physiotherapists works in icu with in high dependency wards in acute wars to help people with severe medical conditions to get back on their feet again a lot of physiotherapists are now also working in community settings community hospitals state rehabilitation centers in nursing homes we also have physiotherapists working in special schools and also other outreach services as well as private practices so as you can see here the role of occupation of a physiotherapist has actually extended to emergency services so we have actually physiotherapies working in the e-room and also intelli rehab now we've covered 19 physiotherapists have actually moved their services through the to online online help is this is to allow older adults with people who are unable to actually travel to the rehab facilities to still receive their therapy so this is one of the innovation that the profession has made so as to how physiotherapy classes are conducted we use a variety of teaching methods there are lectures there are labs and there's a use of equipment we also have a hydrotherapy sessions and of course using very authentic learning and experiential learning to teach physiotherapy students because it's a very hands-on program okay so now i move on to occupational therapy occupational therapy is a client-centered health profession concerned with promoting health and well-being through occupation a lot of you may be wondering what's the difference between physiotherapy and occupational therapy just now you can see that physiotherapists they have to restore human movements for occupational therapies they are more concerned with promoting health and well-being through activities so looking at what are the things that people do in their everyday life so for example for babies for children the things that they are important that are important to them are play for school going children the things that are important to them studies for adults it can be homemaking it can be work for older adults it can be activities of daily living and leisure so occupational therapies help people to overcome difficulties in performing their daily occupations or daily activities after being affected by different health conditions okay it can be autism and other developmental problems fractures mental health issues stroke force or dementia so occupational therapies work with a huge variety of population of people so occupational therapies help to fit the person is just not looking at the person's medical condition or disability but also looking at what are the things that are meaningful for this person and what are the environmental barriers of facilitators and through looking at the person's factors whether or not he is he's able to perform his daily activities even with one-sided weakness coupled with the environment that he or she is and with the activity we try to maximize the best fit okay so like physiotherapists occupational therapies also work in a variety of settings from physical rehab to pediatric to mental health as well as older adult setting and occupational therapies have been receiving increasing attention in the media so we have occupational therapies we have actually specialized in low vision in driving rehabilitation and even using pet assisted therapy we also have occupational therapies in the area of mental health working with children and also really going into dementia care our occupational therapy students have also been the spotlight occupational therapy program is very exciting they get to learn from the people who are in the community with disabilities and they also engage in a lot of service learning initiatives okay next i move into speech and language therapy this is our newest program so speech and language therapies help influence children adults and the elderly who have difficulties with swallowing feeding the speech both in terms of articulation as well as pronunciation language people with difficulty in fluency in stuttering as well as to work on voice so some of you may really enjoy languages some of you are very good in the expressive language so this is an area that you may be interested in the speech and language therapies also work very closely with the medical team to carry out investigations for diagnosis so there are investigation techniques such as a video fluoroscopy as well as endoscopic evaluation to help to access and diagnose the different conditions and to enable proper treatment to be conducted for swallowing difficulties okay so slts can work in hospitals a lot of speech and language therapies are really needed for people who have suffered from conditions such as stroke because of people with stroke they may be unable to receive information language information or they may lose the ability to express language some of them will have swallowing difficulties so speech and language therapies are crucial in hospitals and other than that they are also very important in early intervention centers in preschools particularly to help those with speech and language development delays besides that speech and language therapies are also in demand in nursing homes elderly day care centers and of course some in mainstream schools and speech and language therapies do also go into teaching and research as well as communications and consultancy so there is a huge scope for people who are trained in this area okay so this is a a newspaper clip of how somebody's life has really improved through the use of first speech and language therapy sessions and this is somebody with a severe cerebral palsy so a child with a long-term condition how to enable him to have a better quality of life in terms of communication in terms of being able to live in a meaningful way it's something that speech and language therapies will have a huge impact in so in this case the speech and language therapy such as device a communication tool to help this child here with a cerebral palsy to be able to continue to to engage with people okay next i'll move on to dietetics and nutrition dietitians they apply scientific knowledge of human nutrition to maintain and promote the health of individuals and the community they also manage and treat medical conditions and are consultants on all aspects of nutrition care within the medical setting as well as the food industry and the media so dietitians are different from nutritionists in the sense that they are certified to work in the clinical setting because our program enables our dietetics graduates to be equipped with clinical knowledge therefore they can actually treat patients in hospitals unlike nutritionists who cannot therefore dietitians can work in acute hospitals community hospitals private clinics nursing homes they can also work in areas that nutrition needs work in such as food services and in public health in research and teaching and they can also work in nutrition consultancy such as sports performance centers okay so a trained dietitian will be able to have the knowledge about the nutrition requirement throughout the lifespan okay from pregnancy to childhood to adult stage as well as older adult stage so dietitians do work with again all age groups okay and dietitians will then perform medical nutrition therapy to work with a huge variety of conditions such as diabetes heart disease people with kidney issues people on wage management program and that's where they work very closely with the medical team to prescribe the appropriate diet for someone who is post surgery for someone who's on the nasal gastric tube feeding for someone who needs to manage his or her weight so all these are actually prescribed by dieticians so there are a lot many other areas that dietitians may work in they will work in eating disorders unique they are a very crucial member of the multi-disciplinary team they also want people in the cancer world they want people with dementia as well in terms of the dietary requirements people with osteoporosis cystic fibrosis people have undergone the transplantation etc so there are a lot of areas for specialization for somebody who is equipped with a dietitian degree and this is a snapshot of a recent research study that has been conducted by the chief technician from nuh so aj suling came up with an app a tool to help people with diabetes to monitor their their dietary intake so this is something that they've launched and it's published in a scientific journal so dietitians are also equipped with clinical and research knowledge to be able to continue to be innovative in their treatment okay so if you do take out the dietetics program you will be working in a variety of settings you will be in the kitchen you will be in the food services you will also be in the acute walks okay so i'm moving on now to diagnostic radiography hey diagnostic radiographers they are really investigators they use technology to to actually investigate the the anatomical region to provide the medical team with proper diagnosis so if you are really into the use of technology you you love physics so this is the right program for you hey diagnostic radiographers they work in hospitals especially centers poly clinics as well as private clinics there is a huge demand for diagnostic radiographers particularly i think last year when kovite 19 first hit radiographers are really in huge demand and we did actually graduate our students early so that they can contribute to the health care sectors in the early phase of cope with 19. the diagnostic radiography program is a very hands-on program we conduct our classes both on campus as well as in the healthcare institutions so that students have hands-on experience working with the machines with x-rays ct scans mri ultrasound etc and that is why students who wish to become videographers will come into our program because we are very closely linked to the healthcare institutions and therefore we actually ensure that our program equips students with the right skills and the knowledge to practice in the healthcare setting okay so at this structure i would like to play a video on how applied learning at sit health and social sciences are carried out because like i say the health sciences program are hands-on program so y'all if you if you do come into this program your learning will not just be within the classroom but through a variety of different [Music] methods [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay i hope it gives you an idea about the different types of learning that you will be exposed to when you join the program you will have seen from the video that there's a clinical practice education component so these are compulsory clinical placements in a variety of settings in hospitals in the community that every student of the allied health programs have to undergo okay so as you could see from the video students from the different allied health programs they do a lot of hands-on plus also academic work there are a few modules that are called common modules that people from different allied health programs will actually come together to learn together and therefore this fosters inter-professional understanding so right from year one modules such as health systems anatomy and physiology which will have a taste later on psychology and sociology as well as research these are all conducted cross-disciplinary therefore students from physiotherapy will work with students from diagnostic radiography and students from the dietetics program work with students from the occupational therapy program okay so likewise in year 2 as well as year 4 the students will also do so in year 3 students will embark on the honors thesis module which is a research project and some of these projects may also be interdisciplinary in nature okay so therefore when you join one particular ali health program you are also expected to work with students from the other programs okay direct is going to talk more about anatomy and physiology later so this is one of the foundation sciences in year one and students not only learn about anatomy and physiology on our campus they also use anatomy hall which is based at nus to understand this subject in more detail because that's where you work with asylum mentors okay who are actually people who have graciously really donated their bodies upon passing on so we do to enable us to learn about the anatomical features so this will be elaborated later on right now there's a kobe 19 and therefore we have actually haunted our overseas exposure program so pre-convict students get to be exposed to the overseas health care practices through field trips so we have brought students to hong kong japan thailand china island before right now with the kovit situation virtual exchanges are in place and hopefully when the commit situation goes away next time we are able to resume this again but we still have connections with various universities as well as healthcare institutions in the region so just now i mentioned about the honors thesis all students not only need to be equipped with the basic foundational modules knowledge plus their clinical knowledge they also have to learn about research in order to be equipped with the skills and the ability to to find out what are the latest updates in their own respective profession so we are not only teaching our students to be great in being an entry-level healthcare professionals we are equipping students with the right attitude to know that healthcare knowledge is evolving there is a need to be critical to what's out there to really learn about what is evolving to be updated to current practices so as to be able to benefit our patients better so in in our program all students have to go through an honest thesis they have to learn about basic research and be equipped the skills to do so so upon graduation allied health professionals healthcare professionals have gone into different fields so besides clinical services a small number of them also go into administration a lot of healthcare administrative leaders come from the allied health background there are of course also healthcare professionals have gone into education not only in universities but also in education offices within the hospitals but of course as well as research offices within the hospitals besides the university and i help professions can also continue to upgrade themselves through continuing education and additional qualifications so we have healthcare professionals who have gone on to do their masters their phds as well as post-doctorate so when a healthcare professional or rather an allied health professional first start work they will start as a conditional registered allied health professionals and they'll slowly move up the seniority level at a very senior level that there is a career path awaiting either in terms of clinicals but being a clinical specialist to specialize in one area or to go into management or to go into education or research okay all right so in terms of admissions to our health sciences programs for those with a levels you will need a good path in two of the h2 subjects so these are the science subjects and for dietetics you will need to have a good pass in chemistry okay for occupational therapies you need a good path in two h2 subjects but one of which can be size and the other one can be non-size for those with a diploma there is actually a website for you to go into to find out what are the relevant diplomas for the respective allied health sciences programs and you also get some information about the indicative cgpa on our website all students also need to undergo a medical examination because we are going into the healthcare sector so there is mandatory medical clearance and there are also specific things that you need to know with regards to special medical conditions and students who are shortlisted will then be invited to go for multiple mini interview so these are the different stations to assess to assess you on whether or not you have the right attribute to be a healthcare student and the assessors are both from sit as well as from the healthcare sector so in other words we are looking for students and graduates who are caring compassionate people focused and empathetic okay at the same time we also need our students to be to have the right ethics to be resilient and also to be inquiring okay with that i end my presentation let me stop share thank you very much thank you proft for giving us a breakdown of the programs uh he also makes me want to go back to school again for our next segment we'll be having our own healthcare scholars from sit share with us a day sit my experience as a student celine lee is from the physiotherapy program where eliza way is from the occupational therapy program saline and suffer you may proceed to do your introduction okay just let me just scream okay so good morning everyone so i'm sydney and today i'll be sharing about physiotherapy so um i'm year 2 studying at the singapore institute of technology so uh what is physiotherapy so this is a definition that i got from the allied health professions council and says physiotherapy involves the assessment treatment rehabilitation and prevention of pain and injury and other physical dysfunctions okay so what are the main three main areas of physiotherapy so the first one is musculoskeletal which i think uh many people are more familiar with what physiotherapists do is we treat issues relating to the bones joints and muscles so you can see here there's exercises being done and um we we can treat patients such as those who have uh osteoarthritis as well as those who may require rehab for surgery such as acrv head yeah and the next um area of physiotherapy is cardiopulmonary which is relating to the heart and lungs so we treat patients who have um issues relating to their um heart heart disease as well as lungs so you can as you can see on the bottom right there's a physiotherapist using an instrument to administer uh breathing exercises for the patient so um [Music] some of you may be quite short to hear this but because uh it's as physiotherapists that anything that involves a muscle we are involved in it so um the heart is also a muscle and the diaphragm is also a muscle so which is why uh we are we also train this part of aspect of our patients and um now see we have neurological physical therapy and oh yeah okay so um we this is where we treat patients will have uh stroke as well as a cerebral palsy or those even those who have parkinson's disease yeah okay sorry okay so uh so why choose physiotherapy so i'd like to share you my videos of why i chose physiotherapy so first is um because i actually like the exercise so uh because of that um i had this i found this passion in myself and i was thinking uh if i like to exercise and um i'd like to encourage others to put effort into maintaining their physical body as well so i think this was fair i found that if i had a personal exercise i could and uh maintain my health i would like to pass it on to my patients as well so um i also wanted a more upbeat and fast-paced job which was uh i think what healthcare could provide me because i didn't want a desk on job as well yeah i like to like on the spot and be um on the get-go that kind of situation yeah and i think that no days it's the same for the phys for physiotherapists as every patient is different and there's a lot of learning opportunities in physiotherapy as you can see just how i introduced the three main areas of physiotherapy so there's many disciplines and um a lot of things to learn as well so i actually came into physiotherapy wanting to pursue a newer rehab and help my patients with neurological conditions so um let me share with you about student life at sit so um so this is a picture of uh the concordia camp which is a health sciences camp because uh in sit we have a few have health science callers so we have our own camp where we um get to um interact with each other and get to know more for each other yeah and it's quite fun and then i also joined the srt economy team and science you can go for site visits as well to other care homes during our modules yeah okay so now to share your book with you about lessons so so we have our lectures so uh certainly you may not see the theater right now because of colby but um yeah so this was picturesque and the and to me that anyway so we actually go over to nus for our um lessons to learn about anatomy so um i'll say i'll show you that um actually this uh physiotherapy cost is quite uh content heavy and you have to be ready to put in the effort and time to study for the course as well yeah okay so now i'll show you my about my favorite part about school which is practicals because i i i do enjoy the hands-on learning so uh this uh picture of my knee being cup it looks like a chinese cupping therapy thing but it's actually um what it does is actually sends a carbon through the the knee so that it helps to relieve pain by providing a sensation okay then this is a biotech machine which can help to check the strength of your muscles by doing various tests on your on your knees i mean on your yeah based on the joint okay so we have uh we do learn how to use walking aids so you can teach our patients how to use it and we also have a lot of fun doing exercise creation as well so we have to think about what kind of equipment that we want to use to help our patients depending on their needs and yeah i'll show you about um yeah so we're doing this what happened during our muscular skeletal practicals so i can show you this video and you can see my my arm right when when you use the bend to pull it right it can actually go up higher so i didn't actually put in more effort to raise my arm but somehow it managed to reach higher so it's like it's how we can give therapy to our treatments as well to our patients as well yeah yeah so it's quite interesting to explore that okay so now let's share about university culture so this is my personal opinion and yeah okay so i think there's quite a lot of diversity in srt because uh we are more of a hands-on university and with uh aptitude-based admission so in a way that um the students are accepted are not just based on academic grades and there are many people like who comes from like different walks of life and like uh the site and that it's um it's more uh i find a more diverse kind of culture yeah um it's also uh i find quite homely because uh the school is quite uh small but there's also uh quite a few amenities to like uh just for students to really stress that you can see on the right we're playing like the machine yeah okay and i feel it's quite a good student support um yeah because uh whenever i need um somehow or anything you can just uh easily email the srt office and they will always willing to help now yeah okay thank you okay okay now pass my time on to uh shoot yes hello everyone my name is shuhui and i'm a year 2 occupational therapy student at the singapore institute of technology so i think this quote very nicely sums up some of the reasons why i chose occupational therapy and the quote is from virginia stoffel who is the ex-president of the american occupational therapy association so the quote says occupational therapy practitioners ask what matters to you and not what is the matter with you so the meaning of the quote is that ots help people to go back to their occupations which is anything that a person finds to be meaningful and important to them and not just the literal definition of occupation as in your job occupational therapists can work with people with mental and or physical disabilities but no matter what we always make sure to focus on the person's ability and not just their disability because we believe in seeing the person as a whole in terms of the university culture srt prides itself of being a university of applied learning and what that means is that it is very practical happy so if you want to come to if you want to apply for any of the healthcare classes you should expect a lot of practical sessions as well as practical exams and clinical placements but personally um practicals are my favorite part of school so i think if you are coming in don't be afraid just learn to love them and taking in your stride i think another part of university culture that i would like to highlight is that you are expected to be adult learners and what that means is that you need to take responsibility for your own learning by asking for help if you need it it also means that you should organize your own time and also be punctual respectful and considerate towards your fellow colleagues and your professors as well so now these are just some pictures to highlight some of my favorite parts of school which as i mentioned earlier are practical sessions so the first part the first picture that you can see on the left is a splinting practical because ots makes plans to support the hand so that you can still use your hand while it's in a safe position the second picture is actually from an anatomy practical where we had to mark up the muscles of the forearm that help you to move and enable you to do things like dress yourself and feed yourself the picture on the right is actually from a gardening practical because occupational therapies can help people to go back to their leisure activities that they do in their free time and gardening is one of those activities so these two pictures are from a module that from an assignment that we submitted recently for module group interventions so basically um we are supposed to form a group and each person in the group needs to teach the other members a new skill so for our group two of the skills that we chose for dumpling making and sewing so we actually got to participate in the activity so the purpose of this assignment was to allow us to put the theory that we had learned about group dynamics and group facilitation into practice by carrying it out together with our classmates so that's the end of my presentation thank you thank you suhuy and celine for sharing we have now come to a q a segment where you can ask the sit faculty and the students questions a basic housekeeping mind remember to upvote your questions and also do ask questions that are more applicable towards them we will be able to take scholarship questions at our other channels so the first question and can sit faculty answer this one so the question is could you share more on the differences between pt ot and sg and overseas other than the local ones being recognized by our hospital hello uh hi everyone and good morning i'm tim from health and social science clusters and teaching the occupational therapeutic group program so i'd like to answer the first question uh being a local university i think the advantage of uh offering the local degree programs is that we co-develop the curriculums with the industry partners and the degree programs are tailored to our local contacts so it's very relevant in terms of practicals in terms of the needs in it from the local industries unlike overseas programs i mean those uh recognized university programs are still being recognized by our ministry of health but however the locally contextualized components is missing so that's the main differences yeah i hope i answered the question you prof team okay a second question uh the differences between rt radiation therapy and dr in terms of career prospects oh well uh although i'm not a diagnostic radiographer or radiation therapist uh in definition these two professions are quite different uh i think uh prof thumping they already mentioned about what di is about the radiographers that you know looking to imagine look into helping the medical team to make a better diagnosis uh however for radiation therapists i think they are very uniquely looking into cancer treatments for patients with cancers yeah and the type of treatments for can in cancer area yeah so it is quite a different um career path i would say thank you prof team for answering the question ok shall we go on to a question for the scholars perhaps this question is more applicable to the students why do you choose to study in sit compared to other local unis oh uh okay go first okay so um [Music] oh i think um actually because i mean the the cost that i want to pursue is uh is the site so um i guess um [Music] there was in a way like i i didn't really think much about the the uni like in terms of like you know it's more of like the course so but um but i mean i had some some people i know that they didn't come to sit percy like they didn't feel that it was like recognize the kind of school then they decided to like just go nus up like you know yeah but um yeah but i think srt is offer the like this course in a very like um more of a hands-on way which i'm not sure if that if uh nu is able to uh yeah i feel like it's because we are considered applied university so i think it's um it's good that that our course is in sit yeah um for me quite similar to celine i knew very clearly that i wanted occupational therapy so it wasn't really a question of which university i think i'm going to the i remember there was an open house held by sit and i went there i talked to the professors and the students and i got to know more about what they actually do in the course and they did highlight that there's a lot of practical sessions as well as clinical placement so i think those aspects that they highlighted um made me feel that i would be prepared for my future career if i joined sit so that's why i picked this university thank you sergey and sukhoi so another question for prof team when being an ot can we choose to specialize in an area can we can we choose which area we want to specialize in for example choosing to work in children setting only okay as a degree programs we hope to prepare our students to be ready clinicians as a novice practitioners i think they need to be a journalist rather than being a specialist so in four years programs we teach all students the various aspects of clinical domains in in terms of like clinical areas such as mental health physical rehab children's pediatrics or generating older adult populations so they need to know all these different aspects in order to graduate but however when they join the workforce they may take several years to develop their special interests then perhaps go into postgrad studies and masters and even phds to further enhance their knowledge and specialize in certain areas this is the general trends currently in so-called occupational therapy field yeah i guess this is the same thing applied to all other degree programs as well thank you bro okay a question for the scholars and maybe prof team also what is the gender ratio for your classes is it true that healthcare is a female-dominated industry oh well maybe you want to share how many uh male 1 classmates in your class in your cohort okay um so for occupational therapy generally is female dominated i have 105 classmates and i think only like 12 or 13 males so for ot generally is that's the trend is female dominated yeah it's always around ten percent okay what about visual oh i think for physio there are more um guys yeah i would say it's um i don't really know the exact ratio but um i would say at least i think it's maybe it's just maybe slightly less than half um i would think so but i think it's actually more more more females or so but it's not a tone of that kind of ratio i guess yeah i think so far visual has the highest uh males in terms of percentage across all different programs yeah thank you all for sharing so to our students i think we live in the 21st century it's not about male or female i think males can equally join the pt ot class and females can do the same so go ahead and join i don't think that should stop you another question it's a pt related question so sit sit's pt course used to be jointly offered with trinity college dublin this collaboration has ceased starting this year how will this affect curriculum and overseas opportunities okay uh yeah this is already a decision made by sit and we are now launching our srt owned degree program for physiotherapy so in terms of the changes in clinicians there's no changes in curriculums but however for overseas opportunities we actually have a special component called obviously exposure programs uh it is paused for the moment because of kobe 19 pandemic but we are actually looking into virtual oep at the moment and also we will definitely launch back the physical oep once the you know the kobe 19 situation is getting better yeah so don't worry about that and we are also working with various university partners overseas to look into the exchange programs as a new university we need time time to establish this relationship with overseas counterparts yeah thank you prof another question is the demand for dietitians high in singapore uh in terms of the demand for dietitians i think the they might maybe not as high as the physical or occupational therapies at the moment because the intake is smaller yeah i would say there's a demand because i think we are looking to uh community focused uh aged cares and and not just about asian populations but also in various areas looking to both uh dietetic nutrition so that's why we always look into you know expanding the healthcare professional teams that will include dietitians yeah so in terms of the intake i think later on we can always uh um revisit uh if if this is your concern okay but definitely uh there are that's why we are still taking students thank you okay since we are on the dietitians another question is what are the differences between dietitians and nutritionists well i may not be the best person to answer this but my understanding about dietitians colleagues that i've been working with is really about you know the looking into the nutritional values and also how the dietetic and nutrition input can help people to rebuild their muscle strength rebuild their general health in order to be rehabilitated you know in a more efficient way so that's my experience but unfortunately i won't be able to to explain to you uh the other professions because i've never worked with the other profession before yeah sorry about that no problem thank you very much okay let's go to the students so there's a question for celine uh where are you going to be serving your bond and what will you specialize in the pt role oh um where where oh okay uh i'm actually going to uh anti-inflammatory hospital and um in terms of specialization i think um it's not really confirmed yet so uh like i said i wanted to pursue a neurological rehab so um hopefully i'll get that option at the hospital as well yeah but um [Music] yeah it may also depend on the hospital availability and what the hospital needs as well yeah thank you celine okay okay another question so this one is coming up quite a bit and i just want to summarize the question so if i'm from a non-health science diploma can i still be accepted into the course like the physiotherapy or occupational therapy course non-singapore diploma non-health science phenomena meaning maybe a diploma in engineering deployment oh okay okay uh definitely definitely yes they can apply and then we do have a list of recognized diploma programs from all the polytechnics in singapore and do look out for the information from our main sit website it's all listed there thank you prof okay maybe a question for the scholars uh now maybe so where you can answer this one so uh you guys are mohh scholar so i think the answer will be quite biased but the question is why an mohh scholarship instead of an sit scholarship um i think for me because the mlh scholarship is very targeted towards the health sciences disciplines and it also provides further development opportunities for you as a healthcare professional after you graduate which is something that the school-based scholarships may not necessarily offer you and because for me i i see myself being an ot for a very long time so i hope to have that career development opportunity which is offered by the mlh scholarship thank you suhei i think to add on to that uh for the students do file do go and do research on the various scholarships sponsorship schemes available i do think that there are differences between uh things like the bond period things like the the tuition fees covered so i don't think that's a one size fit or answer it depends on what really you you would like so another question for prof team how is the accelerated ot course like is it for entry level graduates um yeah we are actually launching this accelerated ot degree programs this year and we already had official accelerated degree program launched i think uh two years ago so this is the third year intake in terms of the differences uh because i need to let you know that the differences is that we are actually consolidating everything the four year degree programs into two and a half years yeah so it is a very very uh intense programs yeah in terms of uh students that who might be suitable for this we are definitely looking into entry-level and students with essential science uh in science i think particularly and we want students to really have a very good grade in order to cope with this accelerated degree programs within a very short period of time yeah thank you prof another question is uh so by having a nursing diploma will it be an advantage to be shortlisted in applying for the pt and ot courses uh well we of course hopefully you know um people from the healthcare field with diplomas will continue with their profession because they actually spend several years at least three years actually study the particular professions to support the industry and of course if they do decided to switch korea to other healthcare professionals we do consider but in terms of advantage there's a bit of advantage because they know the healthcare um system much better yeah but we actually as a prof dumpingly mentioned uh we take the um the equal measure systems yeah by looking into both the academic as well as the performance during the multi-minute interviews yeah thank you prof uh one question for the scholars how can i better prepare for my interview um i think if you are talking in terms of the school sits multiple mini interview i think the multiple mini interview assesses more of your communication skills with others rather than your academic skills so i think what you can do to prepare for that is to try and seize opportunities that you have now for example if you have projects or if you have leadership opportunities in school those are opportunities for you to learn how to work with other people and um for the multiple mini interviews for my i remember there was a group section where you have to communicate with other people and there's also an acting station where you'll be given a simulated patient and they will assess how you respond to the person's concerns there was also a written test and finally there was an interview about why you want to join whichever course that you applied for so i think um soft skills is definitely something that's emphasized on in the interview in addition to your academic skills i think um if you're talking about the interview as to why you won the interview asking you why you wanted to join whichever course that you applied for i think it'll be very helpful for you to highlight if you have relevant attachment of volunteering opportunities that enable you to gain exposure in the field and i think it will be also helpful for you to highlight some of your personal qualities that make you suitable to be a healthcare professional thank you suey okay we have one question maybe i can direct it to the three of you so in making a decision between choosing ot and pt are there any general qualities and character traits that i can look out for myself to help me with my decision student you want to share why you choose ot i'll add on later okay okay so for me uh i did actually did consider um ot as well because the um the way it's still a patient care and the type of patient of care they give is like similar but just like it's different but it's um instead of like um direct therapy can't care so um but what what i felt that i wanted to work on for like patients is more of like the technical aspects like um and being able to um to help them with the like the those kind of like physical functions i felt that that was where i want to be i want to help at that point patience journey right now i felt like that being there um that part being part of that but it felt more like um more of like a pt's role and um i felt that that suited me better in terms of like um like helping them with um um their physical function rather than their adl activities of daily living i wanted to be part of helping them first with their physical functions yeah and yeah and generally what pt learn um may be different from what ot learns so um pg we may learn more about the in depth about the physical body that kind of thing and i thought that yeah that was like of my interest yeah for me similar to celine i did consider pt as another option when i was applying but for me the reason why i chose ot is because i think it it adopts a very holistic view of the person so ots can work with people who have mental and also physical conditions as well as developmental conditions whereas pts would usually work with people who have more physical base problems and i think ot i i believe that sometimes the person's problem is bigger than just the person itself so like proft mentioned earlier as otis you always consider the person the environment and the occupation itself so there are several areas in which you can make a change to help the person so i really like that ot adopts a very holistic view of the person and the problems that a person is facing so that's why i chose ot yeah thanks students i think as a faculty definitely um we recognize both professions are important because we do work hand in hand that's why in society we actually have a lot of inter-professional education opportunities for all students to come together to learn from each other to understand each other's role better so that they can work as a team but as an occupational therapist myself the reason why you know i stayed in this line for so long is because i think so his code is very good you know what matters uh what matters to you actually is very very important we are very interested about people's doing we want to help people in day-to-day life activities and sometimes i call myself that i actually can be your life coach because in regards to your health conditions and if you used to do certain things in the past are you you know going back to that particular life pattern again and we actually can help you achieve that whether by helping you to repeat your uh your physical functions together with physiotherapy colleagues or whether we want to help you to regain your cognitive functions back in order to manage your own daily activities but ultimately it's about what they do what they are interested about doing in a daily activity yeah thank you students and prof for sharing i think as a healthcare officer myself i would like to share also so no matter the career that you choose in healthcare no matter the discipline you choose i think the most important thing that you need to have empathy you need to have care for the patient because these are all caring professions so that's the very first thing that should be at the center of your decision when you want to choose otmpt then i think you have the passion you have you know you want to make a difference in others go and do research in the various ot and pt schemes when do research in the universities the teaching curriculum i think you can go to care beyond there's a lot of examples there so yeah so we have about maybe five to ten minutes left we'll take a few more questions uh questions for prof so the resource for our own clinical attachments or will it be assigned by the school uh if is the letter will we have a choice uh all students have to go through their clinical placement education uh as part of the requirement of a lighthouse professional council and also the world professional accreditation body and you as a student you may not have a choice of like where you want to go because our cpe coordinators actually work very hard with different industrial partners to create the slots for various settings and the students must fulfill all the different components within the the program itself so unfortunately we may not uh you know be able to please all students in terms of location in terms of the field that they like to to go for tpe yeah so it is really about um equalism everybody will have a chance to go to somewhere that may be nearer to their home some places that they may like more than other settings yeah prof another question to be working in a specific department for ot does one need to further their studies upon graduation so i think the question is asking about the postgraduate route is you know what is it like and what can they expect well i think at the degree graduation level that that means you graduate from sit with honors degree i think this certificate will definitely allows you to practice as a new practitioner but in terms of further upgrading yourself to masters and phds usually we recommend students to have some years of a clinical experience because when you are doing your master for example sit we offer clinical uh master's clinical rehab masters in the area of like going maybe to a student-specific fields by doing module-based research module-based education and also research component yeah so it is about revisiting the theories and then also looking into some latest evidence and how we can enhance our care quality yeah so definitely it's very rewarding because personally i um also took you know to this route i further enhance myself taking the post-grad and also phd but it's very rewarding when you move to different stage when you realize actually you're already somewhere up there in terms of clinical skills but you want a little bit more so that you can actually do better or you want a little bit more so that you can actually coach your juniors better yeah so learning is never ending so definitely um yeah the option is available locally yeah and we also have a doctorate in uh we have a clinical doctorate in sit as well so just a bit of a publication yeah thank you prof i think to add on right personally for me i'm in my 30s and i think in the past when i was in my 20s or maybe i was 18 or 19 the careers in healthcare and the education options the career paths they were not exactly that fleshed out in the past so for example in nursing right uh when i saw i was a polygraph when i was uh going to choose my my course when you look at nursing i think there were no such thing or rather it might not have been publicized already inaccessible no such thing such as nurse educators no cycling like apns i think same goes for the healthcare disciplines at that point of time i think the the strategy and the moh strategy at that point of time was to quickly build up a healthcare force and i think it's very different now because now you have the different specialties you have the different uh you know uh education tracks available in singapore i think srit has been building up the the courses over the years if you realize last year we had the speech and language therapy uh course we also have the dietetics course we have quite a number of local uni courses that you can take now so i think it's a very different uh scene compared to the past and i think when you go to sit when you go to your hospitals or or you know institutions for example your supervisor or your lecturers professors will be more than willing to to share with you what you can do next so don't worry about the career path i think it is very very bright so okay question for the scholars do you get to plan your own timetable in sit or is there a fixed timetable for different students in different courses oh okay oh we don't actually have our we can compare our own timetable and uh our timetable actually changes every week so like um all this is really pre-planned so um i guess you don't have to worry about it about like uh bidding for mods or that kind of thing so it's just you just go for cars according to your timetable yeah thank you uh another one right what's the best part of university life [Music] for me i think uh like i mentioned earlier i really enjoy practical classes because it's a lot of fun to be able to see like what you can actually do and how you learn by putting what you've learned in theory into practice i think another big part of my university life that i really enjoy are my friends because sometimes it's it's very hard to get friends who are outside of healthcare to relate to what you face whereas if you talk to your friends in healthcare all of them go to the same thing as you all of them can understand your problems and they can help you to feel more understood so i really like being with my friends and uh going for classes with them thank you another question for the scholars right are there electives or minors that we can choose to go along with the physiotherapy course i think there isn't a minor in a way yeah i don't think there's a doesn't matter that you can can take to repair your course but i think um in the for what in the clinical practice right uh yes which is your three and year four there'll be you can take one elective yeah if i'm not wrong yeah so you get to like choose which one um perhaps you may want to learn more about pediatrics then you can take the pediatrics elective that kind of things but i still within the scope of physiotherapy practice so i don't think there's a minor that can be paired with it yeah thank you scholars uh i think we have enough questions for now uh we'll be wrapping up this segment and i think next off we will have prof team will be sharing with us so thank you students thank you prof team for answering the questions uh the next segment which is by prof team is a virtual campus and hss labs tour so it's quite cool because it's virtual and i think you can see things like uh there's a i think i saw a human category the other day so do tune in to prof teams sharing and prof team i will leave you to share your screen thank you okay yeah so let me share my screen all right so let's start our virtual campus tour and we actually developed this um just recently for the recent open house so this is actually our headquarter sit at dover at the moment and this is our main gate yeah in fact when you enter the main gate you will see our tower block yeah so this is uh the main entrance so let's take a look ambassador studying in electrical engineering and infocomm technology and i'm angel a year-to-student doing a degree in chemical engineering and together we will be taking you on this virtual sid at dover and right now we are at the main lobby of our campus located in the university tower this is where our reception counter is as well as the architectural model to showcase our future campus you can also click on the button on the right side of your screen to see how future campus in pongo looks like to begin your tour click on the arrows to find out more about the campus see you around okay so uh to zoom into health and the social science labs and uh let's begin with our first lecture to hss right and this is our common hss lab in hss we call it common hedges slab because we don't want like a specific program to own a lab i think that's the culture of inter-professional collaboration starting from university level and you can see we have anatomical models that allow students to you know borrow and study after class time and we also have a posters along the walls and a corridor for students to for staff yeah and we actually have uh let's start from this lab skill clinic six you can see we have a gate analysis equipment there for uh students to learn how to analyze gate patterns yeah and this is mainly used by visual therapy students but we do use this space for other program specific education as well all right and then outside of this next door we actually um have the mock-up hdb flat okay let's enter and have a quick look so in this lab we actually have our wheelchairs we have our dining tables we have our laundry sets we have our mock-up toilet okay which is up here we create simulation environment simulated environment for simulation training no maybe students will be given a case study so they will practice with peers how to get into the toilet with modifications like grab bars and then we also have the ramps that's movable for students to play around and we also have the we also have the living the bedroom here for students to practice transfer from the normal bed to the wheelchair yeah and then we also have the wardrobe so this is a mock-up flat right and let's go to another lab and the lab next to the mock-up flat we have the anatomy lab as well and you can actually can see we have all this analytical models again for students to study their anatomy i think one main challenge for non-science students uh especially from a diploma in other non-science programs they might find it challenging in coping with this anatomy and visual physiology module yeah so um at the moment we conduct these anatomical labs in the nus med uh medical school right because we do not have a wet labs in sid campus so this is another one let me show you another lap here and we actually have the mock-up kitchen for ot students for diabetic students for speech and language students to practice you know their cooking skills their feeding assessments they are swallowing assessments all right so this is a real kitchen that we can actually use microwave you can use the induction cookers to cook real food yeah and let me show you another lab we also have a human performance lab uh where you can see all the um high-end products okay looking into um people's performance capacities yeah we have a treadmill looking into people's heart lung systems okay and we also have the trap bicycles and yeah and uh and then lick you know we also have another equipment there to look into their muscle strength so this is one um technology focused we uh and that this lab is mainly used by physiotherapy students let's move to another lab this is a lab that is mainly used by uh ready uh diagnostic radiography students okay so students will learn how to read images yeah from cd scan from mri yeah and as part of their practical sections yeah and then we also have another [Music] sensory lab is mainly used by dietetic nutrition students yeah so you can see we have a lot of kitchen stuff that students actually learn how to cook and how to analyze nutrition in this century lab we have covered this kitchen living room we have covered this okay let's move to the simulated wall and this is the mini simulated wall that we have in sit down at dovo and you can see we have the many kings we have the hospital baits and we also have a wheelchair stored inside this room for students from all programs to practice their clinical skills yeah including communication and we also conduct assessments in this lab as well how to handle patients in the hospital environment and of course we actually have another recently built mega lab are actually able to host like more than 100 students at the same time for their practical sessions so this is a shared led mainly by visual and occupational therapy students to practice their physical handling skills to practice their physical examination skills these are all the treatment cultures or we call it plins so that they actually work in pairs to do physical examinations functional examinations and we actually have a camera systems and uh tutors and trainers will be able to do demo in front and the camera will be uh taking it in the videos and then project to all different screens around the around we have a lot of lcd screens uh in in the app itself yeah so that's our one of the biggest uh hss lab in our site campus yeah so yeah and of course when we uh come to this uh campus there's another entrance that we have two entrants besides a tower block we have another entrance to academic plaza where all the faculty sitting on top and we actually have the um academic plaza foyer the lobby of this building and now you can also see that we have the um mini hss garden all right that actually uh managed by occupational therapy students and as part of my module we conduct gardening activities um to look into how can we introduce horticulture therapy or therapeutic guiding activities to people with different health conditions yeah and maybe um before we end let's take a quick look at our classrooms yeah so sit as a technological university we invest a lot in terms of technology in teaching so this is our smart classrooms that we have the um uh we have all the mobile we call it cows okay our computer on wheels the student can share their screen to the rest of the class and also the tutor can share that screen to all different accounts for more effective learning okay so i think uh um [Music] that's all for my uh lab tour okay and uh hope we'll see you one um one day in sit campus yeah thank you thank you prof team for sharing the virtual tour with us i think there are some participants asking in the chat where do i download the link and i think the link is at the sit website that's a virtual campus tour as a website so you can go ahead to look at it in your free time yeah next up we have prof tariq who will be conducting a virtual anatomy class for us so prof turret you want to take over please thank you thank you nigel for the introduction uh just a minute to share my screen okay good morning to all of you uh my name is dr tarek i'm part of the health and social science at sit and i'm here to talk to you a little bit about anatomy uh before we begin of course you already heard from prof tem and propping lead that anatomy can be a little bit challenging but we need to understand why do we study anatomy so in order to be able to go into any of the programs at sit the health programs at sit or at any university actually the first initial or basic step is to understand how our body is built and how are the system functioning with each other without this basic understandment you will not be able to comprehend the therapeutic methodologies that are being discussed in different programs in order to treat something you first need to know how it functions and how it looks like in the normal sitting so in anatomy we discuss the normal body parts we teach you how the normal body parts look like how they are functioning together and then the specific function of each system is further discussed in the physiology component of the module although it can be a little bit challenging but it's also a very rewarding module and i believe most of your friends after they have gone through it they really appreciate the course once they start studying the particular parts in their respective modules so uh currently like proft mentioned we usually uh give our practical classes at nus because they have the anatomy hall where we can have direct interaction with silent mentor which is a very important experience for you to learn from at the same time at sit we have our own lab anatomy lab which you have seen part of it other parts consist of for example vhab or virtual human anatomy program which is the one that you can see in the picture right here where your friends are using the vhab system to look at the heart i will try to show you pictures later from this software also we have another machine there that is called anatomage anatomage is a simulation simulation anatomy software that is in the full human size where the students can look at the human body and do a virtual dissection using that machine and go from one layer to the next to explore various muscles and systems okay with that being said perhaps we can start our talk today about the anatomy of the heart so to begin with what is the heart when we say the heart what do we actually refer to so the heart can be defined as part of the cardiovascular system that is responsible for bombing the blood supply to all the organs and all the system in our body we probably all have images in our brain about the heart right so it usually looks something like this oh not this one this is the one that you see in the movies okay this is not how our real heart looks like so moving forward this is an actual diagram of a real heart again this is not a real heart this is a diagram that has been drawn to the heart okay we will now try to know about these different parts in the next slides and identify each of them to be able to grasp the function and how to look for that in the next picture i'm going to show you how a real heart looks like from a silent mentor and of course it does not have this bright color for identification of different parts so here we can see how a real heart looks like as you can see here we cannot see the blue we cannot see the red is just the heart as it is in our body okay so uh moving forward the heart is usually divided into four chambers four chambers or four different compartments these four chambers are two atrium and two ventricles the two on top are the atrium we have right atrium and left atrium the two below the atrium these are the ventricles we have right ventricle and we have left ventricle as well so if you want to describe the heart if you want to go back to the previous slide by looking at this shape we can describe the heart as pyramidal in shape with the apex pointing downwards and anteriorly and the base is on the top okay so the apex is pointing downward which we what we call an anatomy inferiorly and in later lateral direction meaning going towards the border of our body and we said that the base of the triangle is towards the back of the body so we just mentioned that the heart is the organ responsible for bumping all the blood throughout different systems of different systems and organs of our body it's normal to think is this organ protected will protected it's very important to our life right so in the next slide here we are going to discuss about the coverings of the heart the heart is actually covered in place completely from all around with the main vessels as well these are the main vessels which we will discuss in a minute okay so all of this is covered with what we call pericardium pericardium is a sac that is covering the heart so pericardium has different layers the first outer layer which is this one that you can see right here where i'm pointing my cursor this is called fibrous pericardium okay the fibrous pericardium this is a tough layer that is that encapsulation encapsulates the heart and it offers protection as well as attachment of the heart after the fibrous layer we have the serus layer okay which is this two layers so the serus layer have two layers within one is the outer parietal layer and the other is the inner visceral layer or epicardium so one more time pericardium this is the entire covering put together epicardium this is one layer of the serus layer if you look at this diagram here on the right you see a fist being pushed into a balloon this blue here this is a balloon this simulates our heart and its covering so if we can imagine that the fist is the heart then here this is the base of the heart and here would be the apex of the heart right as it is pushed inside the balloon the balloon completely covers the hand or the fist right so these two layers of the balloon are the serus pericardium so the inner wall of the balloon right here this is eb cardium okay so this is the one directly in contact with the heart itself the outer layer which is right here this is the parietal pericardium this one okay you can see that there is space between these two layers and this is called the pericardial cavity and contains pericardial fluid or serous fluids let's look at what we just discussed in wordings to be easier for you to follow up so we said the pericardium is a sac covering the heart it is formed of two layers outer fibrous layer and inner serus layer the fibrous layer protects the heart and provides attachment to stabilize the heart and position the serous layer can be subdivided into parietal and inner visceral the inner visceral we call it epicardium or epicardial layer okay so the space between these two layers is called pericardial cavity and it contains serous fluid the serous fluid functions in this location as uh as to reduce friction we know that the heart is bumping the blood bumping the blood means that the the muscle itself is contracting and relaxing contracting and relaxing this would normally create friction so to reduce this friction and to minimize its effect on the cardiac muscle and surroundings we have the serous fluid in the pericardial cavity that allows for smooth bumping of the heart with reduced friction as much as possible the heart muscle itself is called myocardium okay so now so far we've discussed three different uh anatomical terminology one is pericardium this is the entire covering of the heart the second is epicardium and this is the inner layer of the serus layer okay and the myocardium and this is the actual muscle of the heart itself okay before we go further let me share with you how this looks like in our body so i will share a 3d program to show you that in a minute okay here we have the 3d program we have removed the muscle layer so we only have the bones and some of the internal structures the heart is well protected inside the rib cage all of that we call it the ribcage to be more precise here we have the sternum in the middle and then we have the ribs first second third and so on and this bone here we call it the clavicle okay so let's remove these bones to look underneath okay so this is what the heart looks like this entire structure is the lung which lung is this the right lung or the left lung this is the left lung and as you can see it's covering big part of the heart right here this notch in the lung is called cardiac notch because it gives position to the heart itself now we are looking from an anterior view of the heart so if i move it like this now we are looking from a posterior view of the heart we already discussed that the heart has four chambers right two atrium and two ventricles these structures will differ according to which location i'm looking from so right now i'm looking from anterior view so in the anterior view i can only see two of these chambers this one and this one this one right here this is the right atrium one more time this is the right atrium of the heart below it right here this is the right ventricle of the heart if we move to that side we have the left ventricle of the heart which is this one and on the back we can identify the left atrium so that means that the left left atrium can only be seen from a posterior view while the right atrium can be seen from the anterior view the real heart in the human body is in the size of a clinched fist so if you clinch your fist like this usually this is the size of our heart we see that it is pyramidal in shape it has a base and an apex so this is the apex of the heart this part that i'm pointing to right now sorry this part right here and here is the apex sorry is the base of the heart so the left atrium acts as the base of the heart so the entire heart is resting on the left atrium on its back right here okay let me remove these vessels so we can get a clearer view okay so again this is the posterior view of the heart we have the left atrium and the left ventricle this is part of the right atrium which we can also see from the posterior view so here we see the right atrium and the right ventricle now let's discuss about the main vessels that are arising from the heart or coming into the heart so let me get back to the main uh main vessels right here okay so right now i have just removed the pericardium that is covering our heart all of this is the heart and all of that is the vascular system that is delivering blood supply to all our body parts and organs i put it all together so you can get an overall view but please don't get confused by the uh so many vessels around here in a minute i will just erase those and leave the main ones so if we look at the right atrium this is where all the blood from the body is being collect collected into the right atrium this is done through the superior vena cava right here and the inferior vena cava both of them empty the collected blood from all of the body into the right atrium bear in mind that this is a deoxygenated blood it does not have any oxygen so it's the heart's function to send it to the lung to be oxygenated and then receive it again and send it out to the entire uh body system okay this vessel right here this is the pulmonary trunk okay as you can see the balmonary trunk arises from the right ventricle here we have the right ventricle so the belmonte trunk takes the blood from the right ventricle and distributed to both sides of the pulmonary tree the pulmonary tree as we said as we mentioned before will be covered right here with the lungs okay once the blood reaches the lung it will be oxygenated it will receive its oxygen as it is passing around the alveoli of the lungs okay after that is completed and the blood is oxygenated at these vessels then it is uh collected back from the lung through these vessels right here okay we call these the balmonary veins okay so let's go back now we are looking from a posterior view of the heart again all this part this is the left atrium we have four balmonary veins right here one two on this side and one two on the other side okay four balmonary veins that collects the oxygenated blood and returns it back into the left atrium okay we go back to the frontal view after the oxygenated blood is collected in the left atrium over here the lift atrium empties the blood into the left ventricle and then the left ventricle bumps the blood to the entire body through this vessel and this one this is the aorta so we call this part the ascending aorta and this is the arch of the aorta and after that if you look from the back we have the descending aorta okay so let me remove all of this and we go back to the heart itself to be easier for you to follow okay so here we only have the heart itself we already identified this as the superior vena cava inferior vena cava all of this part of the heart this is the right atrium here we have the right ventricle we identified this as the uh left atrium and this is as the left ventricle these vessels that are coming into the left atrium are the balmonary veins okay and although they are veins these are carrying oxygenated blood okay then the blood will pass into the right ventricle and then the right ventricle will pump it through the aorta right here to be delivered to the entire body okay if we remove this part of the heart then we get a section inside the heart muscle itself or the myocardium we mentioned that these are four different chambers these chambers are connected by gates okay we call these gates valves so this is the valve all of these parts three parts to be more precise that are connecting between the right atrium and the right ventricle all of this space this is the right ventricle so we call this the tricusp valve okay and then here we have another valve that is connecting between the right ventricle and the balmonary trunk okay if we move into the left ventricle which is this one over here all of this this is the left ventricle we can see inside this valve we call this the mitral valve or bicusped we call this tricusp because it has three cusps each one of those is a cusp okay we call this bicusp or mitral because it only has two cusps okay and this is the bicusp or the mitral valve this is connecting between the left atrium and the left ventricle after the blood is collected in the left ventricle then the left ventricle will bump and push the blood into or through this this cusps so these cusps are for the aortic valve all of that all the three of them these are the aortic valve they will open and allow the blood to pass from the left ventricle into the aorta itself to be delivered to all the remaining parts of our body okay now let's go back to our presentation and try to get more details on this okay uh moving forward again these are the parts that we just discussed in the previous slide so here we have the superior vena cava here we have the inferior vena cava both receive the oxygenated blood and empties into this chamber which is the right atrium the right atrium will then pass the deodoranted blood into the right ventricle over here through this valve which is called the tricusped valve then the right ventricle would contract to pump the blood through the balmonary trunk the palmolia trunk would then take this deoxygenated blood into the lungs to be uh to be oxygenated so it can receive oxygen then the blood collected from the lung will come back through these four vessels these are the bowel monarchy uh veins we have two on this side and two on the opposite side over here you cannot see the other two right now okay all of these will empty into the left atrium and again at the moment we're talking about oxygenated blood the left atrium will then empties the oxygenated blood into the left ventricle through the mitral valve the left ventricle will then bump or contract to push all of this blood following this arrow here on the back the red arrow through the aortic valve and inside the aorta ascending averta and aortic arch right here okay so again this is the cut section that we just saw from the uh from the 3d software you can see the tricusped valve the tricusp valve is connected by thin fibers which we call it cordatindini corded hindini is attached to the valves on one side right here okay and then attached to these muscles which are inside the ventricles these muscles are called the pillary muscle so what happens the valve is in this position when the babilia muscle contract it pulls the cord that hindini to open the valve so it's like a rope or a small cord when you open it when you pull it it opens the valve to allow the blood to pass through okay so one more time these small uh tendons these are called corda hindini and they are attached to the babilia muscle inside the ventricles of the heart which when contract they pull the contract in to tindini and accordingly they open the valves the right ventricle and the left ventricle are separated by the interventricular symptom all of this part is called the interventricular symptom and it is separating the right from the left ventricle okay let's move forward so as we discussed these valves we need to know that it is important to recognize the sounds of each valve separately so where would we look to here for these valves in a living patient again this is the sternum bone as we just said right and here we have the clavicle so we'll use those as our reference for the aortic valve right here it is best heard on the right side the second intercostal space this is the second intercostal space right here on the right side so if you put the stereoscope the stereoscope this is what the doctors used to hear the sounds in our body if you put it on the right side of the sternum you'd be able to listen to the aortic valve if you if you put it on the opposite side so the left side again for the second intercostal space you'll be able to listen to the pulmonary valve okay if you move down to the fourth intercostal space right on the left side of the sternum you would be able to listen to the tricusp valve okay while the mitral valve is best heard at the apex of the heart so the apex of the heart can be surface marked by drawing a line from the fifth intercostal space with the mid clavicular line this is the clavicle so if you say emit clavicular line running here then here would be the apex of the heart okay this is an easier picture of what we use in real life to listen to these parts another way to identify the apex of the heart easier is just below the nipple of the patient okay so below and slightly on the right of the nibble of the patient you can listen to the apex of the heart okay moving forward in an x-ray this is what our heart looks like in a normal x-ray this is what our heart looks like again these both are x-ray one is taking from anthroposterodirection the other is taking from postural anterior direction right here of course we can see the bones more clear because the bones are harder structures so they don't allow passage of the x-ray okay here uh just a minute okay here are the blood vessels that supply the heart itself as the heart is a muscle it needs as well oxygenated blood to perform its function so how does the heart receives its blood to perform its function there are two main arteries that supply the heart these are called coronary arteries okay so here we have the right coronary artery and on the opposite side posterior to the balmonary trunk we have the left coronary arteries these two coronary arteries are the one responsible to provide our heart with uh oxygenated blood both of them they arise from the base of the aorta directly okay after the blood supplies the cardiac muscle to perform its function it needs to be drained out drained out means to be taken as de-externated blood and sent again for oxygenation so the main vessel that drains all the blood from the heart this is the coronary sinus and this is the biggest vessel that you can see on the back of the heart here it is on the groove between the left atrium and the left ventricle we have this groove here lying inside the groove is the coronary sinus all the other veins of the heart drain into the coronary sinus then the coronary sinus will open directly into the right atrium okay to deliver the deocenated blood or the non-oxygenated blood into the right atrium so that he can it can get a chance to be exaggerated again so again this is the coronary circulation we said it receives blood supply from the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery both arise from the aorta and the main vein that drains the heart this is the coronary sinus it is it can be seen on the posterior surface and it empties directly into the right atrium so how does the heart actually bump what makes the heart bomb there are there are electrical signals that generated and travels through the heart or cardiac muscle to give it the signal to pump in this rhythmic way so we have two nodes that are responsible for sending these electrical signals one is called a sinoatrial node or sa node the other is called atroventricular node or av node these two nodes are responsible are responsible for sending the electrical signals to to allow our heart to pump in a normal rate without increased pumping rate this is called tachycardia or decreased pumping rates lower i mean which is called bradycardia okay so what are the main clinical conditions that we hear about when we are talking about the heart usually these are conditions that affecting the blood supply to the heart so they are affecting the coronary vessels that is why they are called coronary heart disease or chd okay so what can happen to these coronary vessels uh one of the reasons could be atherosclerosis which means thickening of the blood vessel itself due to presence of a lot of fat deposits okay or fed fat deposition on the walls i mean thrombosis thrombosis is coagulation of a blood inside the vessel this should not happen in normal condition but in certain diseases can promote thrombosis if one of these coagulation get interrupted inside the artery that is supplying the heart then the heart will not receive a sufficient blood supply high blood pressure and diabetes or smoking are all predisposing factor to coronary heart disease so the most common two most common names that we hear about heart conditions are angina victorious and myocardial infarction to explain it simply angina pectoris is a reversible condition so this is a temporary occlusion or a temporary stubborn stubbing of the arterial blood supply to the heart okay temporary means a small period of time after which this occlusion have been resolved during this period the patient will suffer from pain radiating pain on the left side okay and radiating to the left arm if this angina victoris is prolonged so the occlusion was not resolved for a long period of time then we have myocardial infarction the word infarction means death death of the muscle so myocardial infarction means death of the cardiac muscle so depending on which blood vessel that was occluded then the muscle that is supplied by this blood vessel if does not receive blood supply for a long period of time this muscle will die so again angina pectoris this is a reversible condition it can be treated myocardial infarction if the card if the cardiac muscle dies at this location it cannot be treated again this is part of the cardiac muscle because we have several branches supplying different parts of the heart so usually when occlusion happens it's in one of these branches so the muscles that are closer to these branches will be affected with the myocardial infarction while the rest of the heart will still be beating that means that the patient will still be alive but will have either irregular beat or a weak beating of the heart not sufficient to provide blood supply to the entire organs or cause for example low blood pressure okay i don't want to take too much of your time i just want to give you a brief about what we study in the anatomy and usually this lecture will be followed on by a similar lecture in physiology describing the action and the function of the heart to the entire system of the body thank you that's all for me so now uh i don't know do we still have time to share kahoot nigel yes we do have time please uh you can go ahead and share okay so i will share with you a kahoot quickly just to revise the information that we just discussed right now let me go to the page okay i will wait for two minutes for you to join in the kahoot and then i will start [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] again before we start the kahoot i want to express that this is just for revision even if you get the answer wrong that is still fine it's just to stabilize the information that we quickly discussed right now so one more minute before we start [Music] uh just to also mention we will be giving voucher for the highest scoring the highest score in the carehood so just to test whether you were paying [Music] attention okay perhaps we can start now for the sake of time you can join in later again using the pin code if needed so the pin code is 763905 okay i will start the kahoot now you still have about 25 seconds to give your answer to the first question okay six of you got this one right the correct answer is the pericardial layer and the visceral layer again we're talking about the pericardial cavity so this is located between the parietal layer and the visceral layer okay so i will move on to the next question [Music] [Music] so here we want to know where to put the stereoscope to best listen to the pulmonary valve okay very good for this question 15 of you got this question correct the best place to listen for the pulmonary valve is the second left intercostal space excellent okay moving on again this question is where is the best place to listen for the atrial ventricular valve where do we put the stereoscope okay okay apparently this question was a little bit difficult for you but still nine of you got it correct so the right answer is at the second right intercostal space this is the best location to listen to the atrial ventricular valve moving forward where does the pulmonary trunk arise from so so okay 12 of you got this one correct the palmonte trunk arises from the right ventricle to send the deoxygenated blood to the lungs to receive the oxygen supply okay moving forward this is the last question how many blood vessels open into the left atrium okay only eight of you got this one correct four is the correct number remember this is the left atrium so it is receiving two bulmary veins from each side these are carrying the oxygenated blood from the lung back into the left atrium about money veins from each side that makes the total four okay let's see our board for winners the third place goes to t the second place goes to joe and the first place goes to william william thank you for participating also ben was a runner-up as well okay thank you thanks nigel that will be all for me okay so they have any questions regarding this short lecture they can still ask question uh using the chat as well yup so please ask your questions using the chat uh and i think waylon please do uh contact us you can go to the tech support there and drop us a message but we should be able to find you so a prof tariq thank you very much for sharing it has been very interesting brought me back to my school days for the next segment we'll be having min and ashlyn share with us on the application process at sit so min and ashlyn are the admissions officers from sit and do note we'll be having a q a session after this so you will be able to ask them questions as well mina ashley please thank you nigel thanks so much for the introduction uh let me quickly share my screen here okay i hope uh you can see this so um yeah hi my name is min from the admissions division so in this segment i will be covering an overview about admissions related information such as admission requirements our application process as well as some brief information of our scholarships as well as financial assistance schemes that we offer in sit so you may ask what is the admission requirement um uh perhaps uh before i go into the specifics uh let me quickly play a quick video to share what type of students we are looking for so nigel would you help me play the video please [Music] if we were to put universities on this spectrum of theory to practice then sit would fall very much on the practice each side of things i always found it difficult to understand the theory first and then the problem i put a lot of effort into making sure that everyone understands the problem first because i think when you present theory first it becomes like this um mystical phenomenon but it's definitely not the case but when you present the problem first the kids actually go through the pain of i don't know which one is right you know it's so realistic and it really mimics a real engineering career students actually get exposed to relevant activity that's important for them to secure a job in the future so they do more hands-on activity and practical based lessons rather than going through textbook-based courses and thanks very much for that let me just go back to my presentation slide so in general sit practices a holistic and aptitude based approach in assessing applicants for admissions so what that means is that we do not judge and amid students solely based on their academic grades but rather apart from meeting the minimum academic threshold we take into consideration the students passion and interest as well as whether the students may have you know taken up relevant job shadowing opportunities or work experience and also their co-curricular records so we do look into every single student's personal statement which is part of the application when they apply to us and it's shortlisted the interview uh performance hey let me just sorry i think i may have missed my slide previously so yes i would like to also add that in sit we have also published our first indicative grid profile that will help you make informed decisions in terms of your relative standing compared to your peers so the indicative grid profile table shows the academic grades in bending for a specific program in the last admission exercise and it will also give you an indication of the number of places that's available as well as the most recent 2019 employment rate as well as the medium salary so application exercise and intake is once a year and the application typically opens from mid-january to mid-march so application is currently open all the applications are to be submitted online via our sit website which i've given the link over here and you will have up to five choices in your application and if you are required to serve your national service in singapore a place will be reserved for you if you're successful in your application now i'm going to give you some tips uh you know that you may ask you know uh us for advice on what you know uh you may want to take note of to help boost your applications so first and foremost when you are deciding on what course to study it is important to do some research and self-reflection you know how passionate or interested are you towards the course you have chosen why do you think this course or career should uh or would sustain your interest in the long haul and of course there are also practical aspects right such as whether you have met the subject prerequisites and if you have attained a relevant academic background in order to sustain the academic rigor of the university life and since it is an uh application season right now and our application is is currently open do think through the courses you're applying for and the cost uh choice order is um something that you know you should take into consideration so let me just give you example in sit as i've early on mentioned applicants have up to five choices in their application so we will typically review each application application based on the order of the choices to give you example if you have indicated say physiotherapy as your first choice and have been successful in your application you will then be given an admission offer for physiotherapy and we will thus not review you for the subsequent choices in your application however if you have not been successful in your first choice then we will review your second choice and so on and so forth okay um i would also like to stress the importance of the personal statement as i've kind of alluded earlier on in your university application it is a chance for you to articulate why you know you would like to study a particular course and what skills and experience you might possess that shows your passion as well as your interest in your chosen field you could also share information of non-academic participation and achievements which review your soft skills such as leadership qualities collaborative abilities critical thinking reasoning and communication etc so moving on to tips for performing well at the interviews i'm just going to share this quite generically you know across all the the programs that we offer in sit so i think it is very important for you to think about your passion and interest i think we've shared that quite a fair bit i think throughout this this whole morning already and do some research on the programs and the related industry to ascertain if your interests and the courses that you intend to pursue are aligned i think you should also be prepared to explain you know to the interviewer if you're called for an interview why you're interested in your chosen field and also outline your motivations for enrolling in in the course that you've applied for you can also demonstrate your interest by reading up on the latest news research and development in the field or the industry consider practicing some of the commonly asked or university admission questions with your friends or family before your interview and be sure to get used to being able to develop your thoughts and communicate your ideas and arguments under a time constraint okay because sometimes uh you know uh you maybe only give it a given limited time uh to to share uh what you share your answers okay and um although university admission interviews are usually fairly informal i think what is uh best is to still be dressed up rather than that's dressed down even though it may be on a virtual setting as well so you may want to wear clothes you would wear for formal job interview for example you know you want to look smart you want to look comfortable so that you make a good impression last but not least i think it is also very important to be yourself i think what we really really want to know is to know the real you understand your motivations on pursuing the chosen course and whether you have the right attributes in pursuing uh the course that you have applied for as well as the healthcare industry in this setting so i'm going to quickly share a little bit more about our scholarships and financial system schemes now but in general there are three main baskets of expenses when it comes to university education tuition fees living expenses and enrichment programs and over at sit we have more than 300 scholarships and financial assistance schemes for our students and one in two students have either received a scholarship or bursary in fact over 20 of our allied health students are actually on a scholarship scheme so there are um you know as i've shared scholarship opportunities in sit um and the most prestigious scholarship will be through our sit scholarship and then we also have external and donated scholarships for our students to apply to and these scholarships are typically highly competitive and we're just looking out for students who are all around us who have not just achieved academically but they must also exhibit evidence that they have contributed back to their community in sit we are also committed to providing students access to a university education without letting any financial challenges get in the way so students who require financial assistance can apply for these financial assistance schemes so with that i have come to the end of my segment and i'm very happy to open the floor for questions thank you min for your sharing so i'll start the questions rolling uh mostly admissions questions as of now so the first question is will you be bringing the radiation therapy program back will be renewed um i think uh to quickly answer the radiation therapy program um i think tim also you can help uh chip in a little bit here currently we have uh holding this bank uh it's currently in review um not just among within sit by reviewing this with our industry partners as well as moh to ensure that you know we don't want to to start a program uh where there is a shortage of job opportunities so this is currently in review but then i think in the subsequent years uh you know when there's uh a need for um uh or at least there is that that uh demand for for radiation therapists uh within the the local uh region yeah we will we will certainly bring that back uh tim do you want to add on to that or yeah okay yeah i think i have nothing to add thank you do you mean yeah we'll move on okay moving on there's another question is what is the probability of getting into a dietetics course so i guess the question is asking about the competitiveness of the course okay ashley would you like to help with this i think you have been helping out with the dietetics program right okay so uh for the dietetics program it is actually quite competitive because of the lower cohort size so based on the indicative grid profile you'll notice that for previous uh for ay 2020 last year we actually have less than 20 um places available for the program but for this year due to the increased uh demand for dietitians uh so uh we actually have around approximately about 25 places for dietetics this year so in terms of how the probability of getting into the diabetics program uh it is actually also dependent on you know the the core subscription rate uh you know how many you know it's also hard for us to know how many uh candidates will be applying for the dietetics program this year but the number of places will give you some kind of a sensing of the competitiveness of the program but ultimately other than your academic results it's also largely based on how well you perform in the multiple mini interviews as well yeah thank you ashleen since we are on the dietetics topic so you talked about the demand being higher for dietitians in singapore could you maybe elaborate about this so actually we our faculty we has worked closely with the dietitians the local dietitians chief dietitians in the hospitals as well to understand uh and project what's the demand for uh that for dietitians in the workforce in the subsequent years so but uh in terms of how the number of dietitians that is required in each um hospital uh it's not as many as um uh compared to like perhaps physiotherapies or occupational therapies that is required in terms of the manpower so we also often get questions about why the intake size for dietetics is much lower than other allied health programs so this is also based on the manpower demands in the workforce as well because we don't we also don't want to flood the uh to have too many students and then we uh you know then end up uh they end up not having sufficient uh place job place employment placements after they graduate so that's why the dietetics program intake is much smaller comparatively but every year we will actually have close uh discussions with our industry partners so uh that's why then uh the the intake size etc will also be adjusted accordingly as well yeah got it ashlyn uh another question also dietetics so is the dietetics course globally recognized will bi will i be able to further my studies overseas with a masters of dietetics with a foundation of the sit bachelor of dietetics degree i i will do my best to answer but maybe team can also help to add on a bit more with your knowledge as well if you would like to practice as a dietitian overseas you will need to check with um the the accrediting body in that particular country so uh from what i understand currently in singapore um dietitians are not uh included under the ahpc but there is a snda that you can uh kind of register with to get uh is i don't think it's really an accreditation but more of register with snda to let to know so that they have a list of uh dietitians that who are practicing in singapore and if you would like to further your studies then uh you would probably have to check with that particular university whether uh uh it is accepted or our program is accepted by them or not so every pro every master's program i believe you have there are different um entry requirements and it depends on what is the specialization that you would like to pursue for your master's degree thank you ashlyn okay perhaps we go over to some interview questions first then we go back to the slt questions so a question is there's a question here which asks how is the interview process like and how many applications do you receive each year how many are shortlisted okay uh so for uh uh the interview process uh for the allied health programs we adopt a multiple mini interview approach but what would be different uh for applicants this year is compared to perhaps what you have heard from celine and shuhei earlier is that uh salinas from the earlier intake they would have attended the physical uh multiple mini interviews on site but uh this year for uh also due to the current safe distancing measures etc we have adopted a video assessment approach so from the candidate's point of view you will not have that a very uh how to say like similar um experience from your seniors where they had to really go they had really uh they really entered each station one by one but for candidates this year who are taking the interview it will be a video assessment approach where you will attempt all the questions uh in one sitting but it will be assessed separately by the different sit faculty and industry partners yeah so it's really uh to keep to summarize it's a video assessment uh approach this year and then in terms of the number of applications we receive each year and how many are shortlisted it differs from program to program and the number number of students shortlisted aside from the from those who meet the academic requirements we also have uh aptitude based admission so as long so we also take into consideration if you have let's say a relevant work experience perhaps as a therapy assistant etc so those are also taken into consideration as well in our short listing thank you ashlyn uh there's a question of what qualities look for what qualities do interviewers look for when applying to sit do you want to elaborate on that except for other than you have mentioned the working experience as a therapy assistant and that sort of thing so what is the sit student that you're looking at what is the applicant profile well i mean maybe i can answer this from a faculty perspective and also an interviewer in the past few years and also in the selection panel i think we are looking for students who really understand the profession well and as their first choice let's say we are looking at choosing occupational therapies at the first choice we need to uh find out that whether students understand this profession well all right so must do study research a little bit about this profession and before you take the video interview and secondly i think we want students to have a good communication skills and also project themselves as a confident person and around that person it's not just good in academic but someone who actually you know knowing not just a healthcare system but also you know as a layman person as a competent person we want them to you know show their confidence in in all areas yeah i think in general like this is something that we are looking into definitely there are specific questions that we change every year so you may heard about something from other students but we do change questions every year so um yeah sometimes you won't be able to prepare exactly what we are going to ask you but definitely you need to be confident enough to take on the challenge as a healthcare professional i may add as well i think uh you know you're going to be joining healthcare which means you know a lot of time you're dealing with patients you're dealing with people who may not necessarily be in the right frame of mind you know they may be angry because they are not feeling well you may be dealing with family members who may think of alternative remedies for their patients as well so i think it is also very important for you to be compassionate um you you need to be able to stand on your ground you know and also think on your feet as well so sometimes all those questions that we are asking in the multiple mini interviews is really to to put you on a spot so that you can think and then develop them and mental frame of mind you know to to deal with that particular situation or scenario that we've given you as well so i think those are all those kind of qualities as well that apart from you know um you know meeting your having having your grades and whatnot i think most importantly you know for you to join the healthcare sector you you need to understand that you'll be dealing with with people so if you're not people oriented i mean then then this this might not be a suitable profession yeah i hope that kind of adds to the to your answer thank you for sharing uh i like to share as well so uh like the panel mentioned right it's really about being in healthcare being patient-centric so one of the things we look out for in our mohh scholarship interviews so i think they will be the same yes how do you care for the patient how do you make the patient the center of your care and we put you on the spot really for example we have questions that ask you for example if you are a pt or ot and supposedly the doctor's prescription or advice might conflict with your own understanding or might conflict with your your you know your your assessment of your patient what are you going to do then are you going to give in to the doctor are you going to find out more are you going to push for a patient-centric approach so we will i guess we will evaluate all these sort of things and the the sort of qualities that uh the panel rightly pointed out so being able to think on your feet being able to to you know in a hospital in in a hospital setting are you able to react to the hustle and bustle of the setting itself so i think these are qualities which are common across the board so to prepare for interview do i mean these are good tips so i think you can prepare along those lines okay another question for the panel so with an aging population in singapore uh why isn't there more places in the cohort for sit allied health heard that srt's allied health courses are always over subscribed by a lot there's another question which also asks us about the most uh in demand allied health discipline so maybe we can take those two questions together [Music] for the first question is the number of places right i think is the number of places are not like purely decided by sit itself it's really about government's projection in terms of aging population in terms of the community sectors as well it's not just about hospitals but also community care sectors yeah so we take the number and then of course based on our sit capacity yeah and then we evaluate uh that so this is what i actually uh get that mean and actually if you want to add anything i think ashleen actually kind of answered that question earlier on as well like um uh as we already said that you know um this is not not a sole position that's made by the institution but it's it's usually determined by the ministry of health as well as our industry partners uh to to make that projection of how many graduates uh do we need to um you know to pump into into the the the industry right to help meet that demand so it's also a matter of whether um sure enough you know there's a demand for it but we also want to ensure that there's proper infrastructure that's built in place before we bring in the software which is where um you know um sit as well as mohs come in uh to to ensure that that to happen as well so so this is actually a lot of uh calibration on on on the industry as well as the institution to to ensure that another thing that we also take into consideration is the clinical placement uh that we may not have enough clinical placement slots if we take too large quantity of students so this is another major considerations for sit i mean yeah yeah so uh if i can also add on i mean aside from the projections and the close discussions with industry partners so we also fought for candidates who may be unsuccessful in their application we do encourage you to you know if you are really passionate in joining the program uh during uh while we are waiting for the next application period uh do look for relevant work experience we do have a number of students who were successful in their application after uh applying for a few times and in between they actually uh gained the relevant work experience that not only helped uh improve their relative standing in their application but it also helps them in their academics as well because they will actually have a better understanding of the profession and when they enter the program and they they uh take the modules because then it kind of give them a better understanding and they are more prepared and they are more uh certain that this is the profession that they want to join because after all this is a four-year program and uh it's a it's uh quite a large investment of both time and money into the program so we do want we it will also be a good chance for you to uh be certain that this is the profession especially for applicants who may be wondering whether if perhaps physiotherapy or occupational therapy will be more suitable for them so uh you know if you are not sure then you know uh some kind of drop shadowing or work experience will help you to understand better before you commit to the four-year program as well thank you for sharing uh i think from a broad-based level uh we also at mohamed holdings we do expect the demand for certain allied health professions to increase because of our aging population so although we can't say for sure the exact amount but one of the scholarships we have recently came up with was the community care scholarship and i think that one you can study physiotherapy occupational therapy speech therapy and social work so these are some of the disciplines that are actually probably going to be in demand because of aging population you know they need help with physiotherapy occupational therapy if you have a stroke for example you'll need help with swallowing that kind of stuff so do check this out and i think sits speech and language therapy is also new so that tells you a bit about the demand and where where the industry is going towards okay so let me go back to slt so speech and language therapy is it a competitive course i think the answer will be a number of places but okay so i'll without some of the questions that ashleen or maybe mean you can see how you want to answer so the first one is is sit is slt a competitive cost the second one is how does slt cost compare to those of overseas universities uh one more is sit's slt degree is not currently internationally recognized and accredited will i still be able to pursue a master's abroad so these three questions okay maybe i'll just start offers then we can add on so for slt i will say that it is also a rather competitive program because of the lower uh intake size so for ay 2020 we have about 29 speech and language therapy students for our first cohort so that will give you a sensing of the competitiveness in terms of the available places for slt there is also a rather high height is a higher requirement in terms of language so aside from the english language requirement slt program also requires students to have a mandatory second language requirement as well so it will be in a way more competitive in that sense that you have aside from english you still have to fulfill a second language requirement for to be eligible for the program uh regarding whether if slt degree can pursue a master's abroad like i mentioned earlier similar to dietetics it will depends on whether if you would whether the university accepts our degree but to practice as a speech therapist in singapore sits degree graduating from our degree will you will be eligible to register with hpc to be a speech therapist to practice in singapore so we are also the program as it is new so we will be seeking uh accreditation from ahpc as well so this kind of a work in progress because we just started yeah and the other question i think that compares with overseas universities [Music] okay so for how slt course compare uh to their overseas universities uh um i'm not able to speak for the programs from other overseas universities but what i can share is that for our when we were designing the speech and language therapy program we work closely with the speech and language therapies in the hospitals with our industry partners as well uh in terms of the curriculum but we also understand from our industry partners that they because of the aging population uh we will actually need speech therapies who are bilingual uh so that they can communicate better with the people the the local in the patients that that we meet in the local context yeah so if you were to pursue a speech therapy course overseas what you might be missing from in the overseas program would be that our programs are really more catered towards the singapore uh aging population which you know this will be something that you you may not uh encounter like if you are pursuing an overseas speech therapy program team do you have anything there let me add on i think i shared this just now during the q a for the other programs it's the two key com components that make our sit degree programs stand strong is that we have the localized con elements that you know the industry partners actually came in to teach our students and also we have the see clinical placements that is in their local hospitals and healthcare settings that actually make our students understand the um health care systems community care systems much better upon graduation because we are actually producing students for our local healthcare and community care sectors and that's our primary objective that is why sid degree programs is for local students and then you will notice that we hardly have oversea applicants because sit hss clusters at this stage we are still primarily focusing on local graduates yeah thank you prof and min and ashlyn for sharing yeah i think it those explanations are really really good uh so some background the moh team i think we met with the speech therapist professor somewhere last year to film a video so we met uh desiree i think valerie so the key thing about the speech therapy program in singapore is that it's designed for local context so i guess when you put the culture into perspective when you put the languages the slangs the connotations if you're going to study at sit i think you would be ready almost ready uh after you graduate to go into the workforce but i guess if you're overseas is going to be very different because of the way they speak the way they communicate for example right i think the way my my my daughter calls me is going to be very different from from overseas so overseas i think they will call it and maybe if you're in australia a very more slang sort of way but for here you know it's very simple it's like papa mama so it's those are the sort of difference i think you can expect and i think why uh sit is positioned very strongly to conduct the allied health programs for the singaporean cohort okay moving on so some questions on interviews so will interviewers touch on content-based questions like science questions for health science courses or the questions usually generate and tell me about yourself type of stuff um well i think here we're trying not like to reveal too much like details about the multi-million interviews as i mentioned we want students to get yourself prepared and to be confident and also knowing the profession these are the two key components that we are looking at and also i think as various speakers shared we want students to be caring uh with the caring hearts and when you apply it for the specific programs and also be resilient okay and uh and in order to handle all kind of challenges in terms of what exactly going to be asked it really depends what kind of questions that actually came up by the admission committee because we do have our admission committee from our cluster to look into specific questions each year so um yeah so um don't be too uh stressed about what be prepared i think as i said understanding the program that you are going to apply for it's more important than or do i have to know specific um content related questions in science or anatomy all that okay so i already give you some hints yeah so maybe just to give a bit of um assurance uh uh uh some kind of questions that uh unlikely to come out from in the mmi will be maybe we will show you a diagram of the heart and ask you to identify um certain parts you know what uh that that professor turret had mentioned earlier so we also uh understand that our applicants uh some because we have applicants from diverse backgrounds some could be polytechnic graduates who are from a science related program or maybe non-science related programs and also a level students who even though they have taken subjects such as biology etc but they are not in a way trained in terms of the health sciences side of things so this kind of questions the kind of questions that will come out is really for the interviewers to assess your uh your suitability and the other traits that we have mentioned earlier yeah thank you panel for sharing uh to add on i think a lot of primary and secondary information available online and everywhere i think the healthcare sector is now currently in the spotlight so you can go to sit website you can go to care to go beyond website i think you can find lots of info there for your prepping okay another question so there are a lot of questions on grades and ranking so maybe actually not mean can you elaborate like on you know for jc and paulie's uh what is like the cut-off grade sort of thing that you're looking at i think uh it might be good to uh as i've earlier shared in my presentation that we have actually uh published our indicative grid profile um to to just give you a gauge on you know what sort of um academic standing uh our students have gotten uh in terms of percentage-wise in last year so that gives you a cage but that's it i i don't want to just kind of stress to say that oh as long as you are straight a student it means that you get a higher chance of getting into the course that you want to um so we have kind of maybe shared many times that um that's just really to ensure that you come in you know you can you can cope uh with with the academia uh of your studies right um but there are also many many aspects that we are looking for and particularly when you are joining a healthcare sector it's it's really the other attributes that will come into play um so if you're looking at you know what's the minimum cutoff and whatnot refer to the indicative grid profile as i've shared previously alternatively i think you can go on to our website and and the information is there just to really have a sense check of you know what sort of ratings they have um and you will i also like like i've mentioned just just to reiterate that it's it's not just that yeah we really look into other aspects and in fact uh when our students uh are shortlisted and they all come for the multiple mini interviews actually everyone is just going to be reviewed on that same slate yeah it's no no no longer a matter of okay if you know my a levels is all straight a's you know my your chances is higher than someone who uh has gotten uh abc for example everyone is going to go through the same interview and everyone is just going to be treated equally and then we are all going to assess you based on that new uh standing i hope that that answers uh that question actually you want to add on to my answer yeah so maybe just to add on to mean uh what me said earlier like after you have been shortlisted and entered the multiple mini interview stage uh i think some common questions that we get is also do we give likes let's say poorly or a level students a higher priority etc uh these uh once you have entered the interview stage uh it's all everyone is on a fair level playing field so there's no uh the interviewers will not know whether if you are from a poly background or you are from a level background uh et cetera so it's really just to the grades wise is really just to make sure that uh you are able to cope with the academic rigor so uh yeah like me mentioned uh you may use the integrative grid profile as a reference but uh really uh focus more on i think at this application stage uh for most of the applicants uh the grades is is something that you know it's kind of like fixed more or less fixed already uh we i think it's more important for you to focus on preparing uh for the multiple mini interview and do more research in terms of the profession uh that you wish to join uh i i will feel that that personally i don't feel that that is more important thank you ashleen uh so another question and i've posted the integra integrative grid profile in the chat so you guys can have a look so i think before i go to the question uh same thing for ammo h holding scholarships as well i think it really depends on the applications for that cohort as well so from then on from there we can shortlist and that sort of thing so if you are going to have all the straight a students applying to a certain program or scholarship then it will definitely be more competitive so i think the indicative grade profile should give you a sense of that also uh so question by a full-time professional in the hr industry would like to do a career switch pursuing a part-time therapy services course and rare kin on ot how will i be able to enter as compared to those with prior science uh background have a lot of uh similar applicants like that from a non-sign stream uh my recommendation is if you have to do have a similar relevant background in healthcare industry like in in that case uh just apply okay just apply yeah then leave it to the the panel to decide uh whether you are suitable right if your child listed and come for mmi yeah thank you prof i think side note right i think that also uh the fact that they have such programs going on is also a testament to the demand of the healthcare costs in singapore i think we're really ramping up quite a lot due to the pandemic and the aging population so okay let me take another question maybe quick question so will mmi be conducted online due to covid yes it's a online video uh assessment so uh applicants will not need to uh uh come down on site for uh the multiple mini interview another one are the interviews conducted in group or individually [Music] so for the video assessments uh uh really what i capture is that you will if you are shortlisted uh the video assessments is uh something that you don't have to uh it's not it's different from like the physical interviews where you are given a specific time slot let's say for example from 9 am to 10 10 a.m and then you have to you know you have to come down and attend an interview during that particular specific time period so it's a bit more flexible especially for let's say uh applicants who might be currently pursuing a full-time job or applicants who are currently serving their national service so you do have a bit of flexibility in that sense where uh you know you don't have to you are not given a specific date and time to complete the interview yeah so so it's all you can do it you know perhaps for some applicants uh who will find it a bit more conducive to do it uh perhaps in the middle of the night where it's quieter or perhaps in in the morning etc so it's a a bit more flexible and convenient for applicants to complete the video assessments in that sense yeah thank you ashlyn so i will answer a few more last questions so will i be fascinated i think that's uh yes i think if you read the news yesterday or the day before i think everyone in singapore be fascinated over the the next few months so and i think healthcare students do get vaccinated so that's no issue okay maybe one last question for the folks at sit so there are some questions regarding the 3d model being online are there any more such lessons going to be played maybe you want to share if we have any uh sessions coming up in the next few days or weeks if you want to share the moh i'm sorry i'm with the here sciences discovery day we are going to be running a hss discovery uh virtual discovery day next saturday uh this coming saturday on the 27th of february um i'm so sorry i don't have the information i think we have already closed registration okay yeah yeah i think we need to uh yeah prepare ourselves so sorry about you have not registered um [Music] i don't know whether we can still oh we can yeah i can just write into us actually um all right let me let me refresh the slides where let me yeah yeah and and write in i think uh i i think probably the link is no longer active so sorry yeah no no but but just uh just the the the email that they can write in to see whether they can still slop down in i think that would be good that'd be great let me let me check yeah okay yeah let me share let me share my screen okay yeah so you don't need to share the screen we will put it in the chat so [Music] so i think nigel has has helped to share the email address do write into us and and and go try as best as we can um you know to to slaughter you into um our event that's happening this coming saturday morning from 9 30 to 11 a.m okay got it we have posted it in the chat so that's it we have come to the end of our session so thank you professors and admission officers for taking the time to answer the questions uh to the participants if you enjoyed this session please take a few seconds to rate this program at the bottom left of the screen our next session is walking in the healthcare professional shoes which is conducted by our very own scholars coming out at 2 30 so it's a session which puts you in the shoes of a healthcare professional professional to join us later and have a great lunch see you at 2 30 p.m all the best for your application thank you broth bye-bye thank you

But months have passed since migrant workers have ...",it's very squeezy and uncomfortable to having dinner inside the room it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail these aren't videos from a year ago they were given to us just a few weeks back it's been 11 months since the kovic 19 virus exploded in foreign worker dormitories and a total lockdown was declared since then dormitories have been cleared of the virus and migrant workers have gone back to work the pandemic put a spotlight on the 300 000 or so foreign workers who are housed in mass dormitories [Music] their living conditions provided the perfect storm for a pandemic to spread one year on i find out what's being done to control the infection in dorms and its impact on our foreign workers hi over the course of three months we contacted migrant workers for their stories in this episode of talking point i'm going to show you their lives through their eyes unfiltered later on this is my dormitory here is a playground before we played here but now it's totally restricted my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook so we have to choose cattle our dining area still empty we are not allowed to come here and eat we have to take our meal inside the room one room got 12 people if we want to go supermarket to buy something groceries we have to change our pass while some of our migrant workers live in accommodations such as rented and private housing about half of them live in mass dormitories all located in obscure parts of singapore it was in these dorms where coven-19 cases exploded leading to over 150 000 workers infected the government moved in to seal off the dorms began a regime of mass testing disinfecting the premises and instituting safe distancing measures by august infection rates dropped and the lockdown was lifted most workers could go back to work i asked those who live in dormitories to tell me what life is like for them now staircase also medicated we are not allowed to take staircase while we are collecting our food from the catering we have to take a long queue to collect foods or buy foods so all the migraine workers are depressed right now following all rules and regulation restriction video stood out to me the most so i'm giving him a call to find out more sakib works as a safety coordinator and has been living in singapore for 11 years it's been about five months since his dormitory was released from lockdown [Music] we are not really allowed to go out on the field or any playground we are not even allowed to gathering on corridor yeah we are only allowed to go to toilet use toilet and come back to our room we are not really able to go all those facilities system like cooking and sports zone or physical exercise because the restriction is still in there before covet 19 struck workers could access these facilities and congregate in open spaces freely so do you feel like you are still in lockdown yeah i do feel because i'm not really able to go out in community and i'm not really able to take any public transport and i'm not really able to cook yet and i'm not able to go to playground there is so many restrictions still in my room so i feel actually i mean [Music] i can totally understand why there are restrictions i mean even for you and i we've got all these new social distancing rules because of this pandemic but i can't help but wonder if the rules imposed on our migrant workers are a bit too much [Music] i want to experience for myself what life in a dorm under these restrictions is like i was denied access into sakif's dorm but i was allowed to visit another dormitory ten months ago this place was declared an isolation area it was one of the first few dormitories in singapore to be identified as a covet-19 cluster at that time about 7 000 migrant workers here were under lockdown one of them is surge good morning good morning prepare myself fast food packing so can you leave the room for work anytime you no no no like i only transport timing only i go back outside to minimize congestion workers can only leave their room for work at designated times so just now behind there is the last scan yeah this one last scan can go out for work hd wordpress this one permit green means can go out for work i am a healthy uh red means not allowed to work oh and how do they find out you know if you're green red yeah this one tasting surface blood test workers and dormitories are tested for covet 19 every two weeks all right thank you i'll see you at night while suresh is at work i noticed the barricades outside and inside the dormitory i've asked to speak to the man in charge of this dormitory i want to know if all of this is necessary jimmy why are there all these restrictions in dormitories these restrictive measures are very very important in order to indicate the infection weights therefore it's really really necessary to reduce the crowding and also our co-mingling of the workers within the dormitory so as you can see this is the segregation measures or even the new entry points basically ensure that we have multiple releasing points in this dormitory so as to ensure that the residuals go in and out of the dormitory swiftly and also go through the necessary checks so definitely the intention is to try to keep them safe and well socially distanced right that's right there's a definite lack of social interaction now have the workers gotten used to that well they have no choice practically we realize that they do need to have some social life they do need to entertain [Music] it's 8 pm and suresh has just returned from work as the residents here aren't allowed to eat in the canteen for now they can take away food from there or cook their own dinner something that this dormitory unlike at suckabs has provided for [Music] [Music] suresh after work what do you do in your free time after work for coming room after dress up cooking then makan go bed now see movies play games phone home calling just things so before covet what did you used to do when you were free before covet i sometimes free time i go out just i sometime only i meet my friends do you miss doing those things that you used to do yeah miss but no choice from what i see suresh is allowed to cook and it's not very cramped where he eats since my visit to his dorm the gym has opened up and communal sports have resumed but i'm discovering that restrictions differ across dormitories with some being more stringent than others and as i'm about to find out strict rules don't just apply within the dorms but even on the one day these workers are supposed to get their rest and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes [Music] i'm in little india typically on a sunday you'd see many foreign workers gather in open spaces like these to socialize or to play games but today it's noticeably quiet as evening falls i try to speak to some of the migrant workers but finding ones who stay in dormitories is proving to be challenging oh do you stay in a dormitory no damage no no i use the house no dormitory company house and i soon find out why your friends were in the dormitory what are they allowed to do they're allowed to two hour or one hour later three hour the government give the permission the dormitory people they give permission only they go out forever and so you don't need them a long time never sit there last time have contact but now they cannot come out you ever know what they do on the resident of they also they stay in the house or dormitory inside these workers i'm meeting don't stay in dormitories so they're not subjected to the same kind of restrictions since the pandemic migrant workers living in dormitories can only go to purpose-built recreation centers on their rest days these centers have amenities like fnb outlets a barber remington service and a supermarket i'm waiting for kavikuma he typically comes to this recreation center in sambawang once a week i want to know if that's enough for him hi hey kavi did you come for the dormitory yes how do you normally come here i just  only take the bubbly kavi is allowed to go to a recreation center only because he comes from a dorm clear of covet 19. still he needs to produce a negative swap test and apply for an exit pass he is only allowed to go to a recreation center assigned to him to apply for an exit permit like how long does it normally yeah so at least two days or one days before we have to apply and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes that's it yeah but no enough but no choice we are only allowed three hours are you shopping today [Music] so you mentioned that you are here for three hours yeah is that enough for you of course no enough because normally we are only a load work and come back to dom yeah uh only one day alone exit was to come here so also i only allowed rc i'm not going to other place so what do you think you missed the most mostly is that i cannot see my relative here because only i can see that uh my dormitory my co-workers this other thing i really miss thank you okay thanks so much man for bringing me okay thank you bye bye after seeing what a recreation center is like and talking to kavi i can see why he wants to come here more often just so he can maximize his time outside the dormitory but even then he only has three hours a week outside and that includes travel time [Music] go liberation center then come back send money only because so boring our company lori bring and bring back to home it takes one and a half hour left one and a half hour i really couldn't make my time to meet friends and have fun for me it's not enough because it's very small small small place it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail just go go eating only eating watching movie like that and then go on bed lying in bed resting that's why it's very hard from us hi i'm good thanks for having me these strict rules imposed on our migrant workers have been going on months after lockdown it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people and i'm about to find out the dire effects i've been tracking migrant workers to hear their stories about what life has been like since covet 19 exploded in their dormitories this is the picture i'm getting the dorms me no longer being locked down but some of these workers still aren't able to do the things that they used to like gather with their friends for a meal and this is not just within the dormitories but even outside on their day off but just being able to spend their rest day outside is so troublesome that many choose to stay in i'm meeting rashid early this year his company moved him to a private accommodation as his dormitory was too far from his current work site yeah hi how are you i'm good thanks for having me over yeah thank you also this is where you stay now uh yes it's my accommodation nice russia tells me life is better living outside of dormitory but i'm surprised to learn he is still facing restrictions if i extend dormitory they have all the rules given by the dormitory and mom and government also need to follow here also i need to follow but still i don't uh go around like shopping mall or anything i just go out for my essential to buy food only so even though you don't stay in a dormitory yes you still have restrictions yes why is that restriction is uh from government uh mom bca as i am a safety personnel in my job site so i need to follow the bca requirements all those requirements they have still now we don't have any approval to go outside like as before so how do you feel now that you can't really do those things it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people we also need refresh my our mind how do you cope with that kind of feeling like how do you make yourself feel better i doing a lot of voluntary job as i am mentally depressed last time so i trying to teach other person who also mentally depressed i'm a safety coordinator for jobsite in my company and my job to take care all my company people whoever working in my side or outside so i have to take care of their health how are they feeling every single person have different feeling so in this case few of them they say they are very bored because during kobe they cannot go home leave so they miss their family few of them they say they are mentally not so good advocacy groups have pointed to prolonged confinement and job uncertainties affecting the mental state of many migrant workers in singapore so much so that a government task force was set up in november to enhance mental care support among the initiatives deploying public officers to dormitories so they can look out for workers who may be showing signs of anxiety or stress [Music] after months talking to our migrant workers i'm taking what i've learned to the manpower ministry martin cole oversees all the plans rolled out by the ministry's new division ace set up to take the lead in the fight against covet 19 in foreign worker dormitories [Music] martin i've been speaking to some migrant workers after lockdown and they brought up some issues which i was hoping that you could answer so firstly within the dorms they're going back to work but they still have some restrictions my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook what's your response to that there are dorms that have on sweet cooking facilities now those that have communal cooking facilities that was where we had the restriction we were trying to control the the infection the transmission but we have already lifted it and we have invited dorm operators to apply to mom so that we are satisfied that the safe management measures are all in place currently we are staying at 10 this room is still 16 bed inside in terms of sleeping arrangements some of them have mentioned that yes there are fewer people but there's still the same number of bids in the room which means they don't have the kind of space that they need give us some time for the dom operators to do something about it we are working very closely with the dome operators to make sure that we continue with this de-densification effort i cannot go follow bus cannot go mrt is it true that dormitory workers are not allowed to take public transport at all for work activities we require employers to provide transport to and from work because when it comes to peak hour traffic the risk of transmission is the highest and when we have large groups of workers going out to work using public transport that's where we introduce this transmission risk in both directions between the dorm workers as well as the community but when it comes to other activities other than work while we strongly encourage employers to arrange transport we allow public transport because the transmission risk is a lot lower so migrant workers are allowed to take public transport as long as it is not during peak periods do you see the restriction on public transport changing anytime soon unfortunately for as long as kovit is with us i would say that i don't see it changing three hours you can go out and then come back that's it they're only allowed to go to the recreation centers and back for three hours when will this change we have already have plans to increase the frequency of visits to the recreation center and for longer and you can expect positive changes this quarter wow okay that's great news for them then given that we don't really see an end to this pandemic at this moment how would we go about improving the lives of the workers who stay in dormitories so we have already have seven quick build dorms that have been launched they have improved the specifications to improve the living environment for the workers as well as to make them more resilient to infection over the next the course of the year we will be launching more quick build dorms and to increase the number of paid spaces to about 25 000 quick built dorms are a temporary measure and will serve as a guide for more permanent solutions to our migrant worker housing so one year on because of all the robust measures in place covert 19 infection rates among our migrant workers have drastically gone down yes some are still struggling to adapt to the new normal but things are looking up this could be the future of migrant worker dorms in singapore more spacious rooms each with five single beds spaced at least one meter apart compared to a typical dormitory where up to 16 workers can share a room the room also comes with an ensuite toilet shower and sink outside there are also larger communal spaces like dedicated kitchens and shared amenities like a minimal thanks so a silver lining to this pandemic is that it has accelerated plans to improve the living conditions of our migrant workers but what they really hope for is to be able to rejoin the community i hope our restrictions have to pull out and giving us space to have release our stress i hope we can go around singapore and eat at the hawker center let us to go outside even once a month like that because we need to relax also our mind

On the Red Dot meets five Singaporeans who ...",everything changed when kovit happened i was on my way to work and i received an email from my boss i've been revenge that's it wouldn't use the word burden but i just didn't want to get my parents worried [Music] because i've covert when i'm about to pass away what do i want to look back on most of the teams are all family breadwinners so it's important that they keep the job we did talk around with the idea that it's totally different from what we have been doing [Music] so much effort and then we are not earning much of profiting out of it how do we move things forward from this and become better my name is [Music] i hate going to the market i'll try to avoid it since young i don't really like the smell the hustle the slippery floors of the market [Music] but things have changed now i probably visited the market more than i ever visited in the past 30 plus years [Applause] freelancers here are feeling the heat as the covet 19 situation works before the pandemic mom conduct a lot of cooking classes students will come to our house and learn dishes and they will pay a fee for it that is a property agent my wife xiaomi and i shoot wedding videos and corporate videos for our clients [Music] the freelancers live isn't easy for two years we kind of have sufficient jobs coming in month to month but this time during the circuit breaker mom can't host her regular classes that she have been doing for years when government announced a circuit breaker only essential worker can go out to work we have to stay home it's bad for everybody when we didn't have any income coming in we started to worry about how how long can our savings last us that is really stressful actually course there's the utility bills and stuff we have to service our mortgage for this house so our cpf got wiped out now [Music] layoffs in the second quarter of this year more than doubled from pre-covert 19 levels to over 8 000 even as total employment continued to fall by around 104 000 in the same period we first heard about the news of the plan shutting down and letting go of staff around april i was not that overly worried because i was in that company for seven and a half years but of course reality comes and hits me my name is muhammad nasir jafar i'm 47 years old i was a city quality engineer from an oil and gas mnc i still can remember very vividly when my managers say that jay i'm sorry we have to let you go [Music] i was lost for that 5-10 minutes when you hear it itself from your boss right yeah that is when it hits you really hard for four months i submitted more than 60 applications i tried semiconductor pharmaceutical electronics industry as well chemicals but still nothing never in my life that i feel unwanted why is it happening why is it me [Laughter] i'm doing the easiest part like cutting potatoes my mom is in charge of the curry chicken portion and charmaine is doing the bread portion growing up every friends gathering birthdays family gathering my mom will always prepare a pot of delicious curry for everyone to share it's everyone's favorite during the circuit breakers a lot of our peers do facebook live cooking shows and mom kind of felt pressurized to step up to to do it online as well we wonder what could interest singaporeans her customer base she thought of curry bands [Music] it was purely just to demonstrate how to cook it but by chance we gave some of the buns too to our neighbors and friends and sales started coming in [Music] it started out with just two of us mom and i running all over looking for ingredients making the bands delivering the vans ourselves [Music] and then as more orders came in we couldn't handle it alone so lester and dad stepped in to help [Music] at that point of time we didn't think of it as a business we were just happy that someone wants to buy yeah [Music] in the beginning of the year kovit happened and everything changed [Music] there was this fear like oh okay i'm unable to find a job wouldn't use the word burden but i just didn't want to get my parents worried my name is chiven i'm a third year student in smu 23rd april was when my exam ended i thought my whole summer is ahead of me what am i going to do i wanted to get internship in a company in singapore unfortunately when kovit happened i couldn't get an internship yeah so that's when i started to look for other things to spend my time so today i'm actually going to be filming a tip talk it's something that i've started doing circuit breaker so i usually connect it to my laptop over here and then this other setup was where i'll put my phone and that's where the whole creation begins many like me were feeling bored they wanted an outlet to just laugh a bit when i seen so many singaporean families dancing together with their kid i think it's really cute that's when i learned a dance a very famous tik tok dance when i posted it there was barely even one or two likes i knew it wouldn't get viral because a lot of people do that [Music] i started to experiment with new ideas and that's when i found that video that worked you again people like relatable content people like funny content so when i started to do more so of that that's when i think people had positive response the video got viral and i think it's garnered about 200 000 views in one night i was quite shocked at that i think a lot of girls found it funny and relatable because they too had unshaped eyebrows because of circuit breaker your first time do facial is it okay yeah i see you got a bit of black hair right here so this one also kind of was went viral in the temple community because it's true right how many people liked it about like four thousand like four thousand from india not from india local singaporeans because i was making people laugh i was making people smile made me want to create more to date i have about 58 000 followers really never expected any of this mischa can i get back my phone don't ever let me catch you using the phone again is that clear it was well received especially my school content because people can relate to it like oh my god yeah i remember that don't ever let me catch you using your phone in the class again is that clear yes i promise i won't use it again and that's a wrap so now comes the editing and all that so this is this takes a bit of time social media can be toxic at times and i think i've experienced a fair share of that as well [Music] i told him right from the start there are definitely be haters because he's seeing it on the lighter side maybe some may not you must be strong to accept it some of the mean or nasty comments that i've received is like you know he's not funny he can't sting a little bit you know took the smiles off people's face like literally i just wanted to make people smile i just want to make people happy [Music] my name is kelvin i'm the general manager here since 2002 it's already close to 18 years that i've been working here we are right now in the printing room where we have our large format printers uh here we were making mainly large springs for clients [Music] 2019 has been a very very good year uh actually we expected 2020 to be even better but things take a sudden change when circuit breaker was announced the closure of workplaces will take effect from next tuesday we had to shut down the whole operation for the next two three months and we totally had zero revenue from that point onwards in business theory with that kind of results we should be cutting off manpower it's difficult for us to actually say hey you know the business is no good and we want to lay you off the team has good for me for some of them even before i joined the company some of them joined us for 10 years five years and so on most of them are all family breadwinners so it's important that they keep the job while preparing for the shutdown we also had difficulty to purchase masks and we did toy around with the idea that we may be bringing in the mass production capability into our place to support singapore's needs for mass it's totally different from what we have been doing [Music] this is our first machine that we imported in we actually went to china to procure the machines and all the supplies we did all the installation and training through video conferencing and messaging we could do about 100 000 masks a day if we run 24 hours this will become a challenge because our team actually needs a different set of skills [Music] previously my role was a fine art print maker it switched overnight and now i'm doing face masks doing the quality control and also to check packing so totally no experience brand new uncharted waters [Music] hi chung how is the adjustment to the machine after we decided that the earlobes and all the things are not attached properly are you looking into it when we brought in these machines they cost us a couple hundred thousand dollars we throw in almost uh close to one million dollars of cash along the way we failed at a certain part the year loop attachment the distance between the tick and the joint uh when we actually browse them together is quite challenging because just a little difference after movement will actually affect the whole attachment we need to resolve this since of urgency those who place the pre-orders are all calling ourselves to make sure that they get their deliveries done everyone knows that they have to deliver it's just like a war time where everybody puts themselves into the front line to help fight the war [Music] during kobe i had the time to like slow down and think about the end of the road when i'm about to pass away what do i want to look back on i think what's meaningful in life is being able to give back to the society that has given you a lot of course like you know i'm just one person i cannot do it alone [Music] before covet i was living and working in new york around march the cases suddenly exposed to the thousands the city went into lockdown my parents were very anxious and very worried and that's when i decided to return to singapore i actually got quite a bad sore throat but i didn't have any fever so i still took the flight home because i was doing my parents i'm very worried that i'll pass it to them then i actually took myself to the gp clinic to get a referral to go to a e for the covet test and it was positive [Music] she told me about how the other elderlies that were in other words were suffering and she was really worried for them yeah singapore is an aging population we see more elderly who are living alone who are isolated within the community they could be astray from their children their spouses has passed on as well or their siblings are also generally very elderly as well i think as humans we crave for social support and a sense of belonging [Music] [Music] which i recently started after recovering from kobe 19 with two other friends the idea of kapong takis and getting more volunteers in the community to help their own neighbours that's what keeps me going i'm trying to reach more and more people kampunkakis is a platform that matches volunteers to a neighboring need [Music] today we try to match kakis within a 20 minutes walking distance we want to make sure that they are neighbors who can check in on each other regularly [Music] we are a non-profit organization we recruit our volunteers through social media giving out flyers in the neighborhood right now we have close to about a thousand volunteers of course it hasn't been growing as quickly as when we first started anymore since you know most people are starting to go back to work some of our neighbor khakis they have to support more than one neighbor and certain areas we don't really have enough neighbor volunteers as well if this initiative is stopped four elderlies will really fall through the gaps [Music] because of the pandemic for the very first time i'm jobless you were looking for a job via online job portals right no response from the applications that i submitted it was really zero i was more than eager to actually start work because it was already about four months that i've been staying at home right my original resume was about six pages long yes yes i remember it was quite a long resume the first thing is to work on improving his resume to better highlight his technical skills and knowledge so after jay has worked on his resume my colleague actually shared his profile with 3d metal forge and he was invited for interview and within three days right yeah he received a job offer [Music] 3d printing is exactly the opposite of what i did previously which is a conventional machining process so it's more to my own personal worry on whether i will be able to keep up with the expectations from my colleagues and also from the company i am in charge of the inspection of the products to ensure that it complies to the engineering drawing which specifies all the requirements of the products this tolerance is basically referring to a surface finish tolerance yes there is a surface phase yeah i think that was the mistake that i did which resulted in some delay in the world engineering drawings can be very complicated so jay might not have seen or exposed to all these new symbols if let's say we ship this out to the customer eventually they might not be able to use these parts because it might not fit into whatever they need to actually assemble this component to i do feel very bad actually because it is an unacceptable mistake for a quality engineer to do to commit i'm still under probation for treatment of forge i do not know whether i have done enough up to the expectations of the company for me to be confirmed [Applause] this is this is concerns we are smu students i actually wanted to get an internship in a company related to marketing unfortunately when kovit happened i couldn't get an internship that's when i stumbled on tick-tock types of students in morning assembly son four years in school helped me time my time actually i've seen some people posting his stories on their story and those are people that don't know him and that's how i knew how big given switch has become [Music] mechanical pencil you every time kid asks me it's just that the week maybe surprised me because i didn't expect him to have that a week ever since i started tiptoe and gaining more traction it's when like brands will reach out to me i still am using social media for the purpose of connecting talking to my friends seeing what's happening in their life the small change would be that now i'm using social media and this influence to share about a brand to my friends could it be maybe that i have a sizeable following then they see that maybe i cater a bit more to the younger demographic so they reached out the clients are okay with the setting of the scene but they want me to drop the female corrector because they don't encourage cross-dressing yeah your first time do facial is that i do tend to take on the persona of a girl and i'll wear a wig you gotta take it now working your brains has been bittersweet can be challenging sometimes when a brain tells you okay do this and then you're like oh how can i make it funny you know how can i make it funny it's definitely not easy tik tok life is a new feature it was launched in the singapore market two months ago okay i think it's good i actually can be quite nervous before i go live so people who are currently on the app scrolling on tiktok they can actually watch your live broadcast so there are 13 13 000 people active right now so i'm gonna go live let's do it in three in two and one yay hi guys hello hello hi everyone watching uh steven tiktok live helps me to interact those people who follow my content now more people are more than ever looking at their phones so i think that's where you capture their attention so someone sent one diamond so these can be translated into cash there's also this cool feature where people who have actually been following you for some time right they can actually reward you with certain coins i would say one coin maybe is two cents sometimes they may give you five coins so that is uh that's like 10 cents [Music] i was glad that there was still job opportunities in the midst of kovit i've been receiving some offers from brands to collab and to promote their merchandise or their brand so most of them would really be less than 500 so i would say on average i do like four for a month i still have two more years before i graduate that money will go into helping me pay off my school fees [Applause] so it's hard to motivate yourself to wake up early in the morning when the sky is still dark but to deliver the orders we have to wake up like at 5 00 am 4 30 am sometimes our brand name is in my curry bun in short it's it my cb which is a reference to circuit breaker there's of course people who really dislike the name but as a home-based business starting in circuit breaker we have to take certain creative risks we sell our curry runs on instagram our customers direct message us and we'll follow up with their orders through there we started this business with no business plan we're just selling one kariban at a time to survive this pandemic none of us studied business none of us studied culinary customers all around singapore wanted to try our curry bun so we deliver island white with zero delivery costs [Music] and then the end of the day we realized that we are making such a loss i remember feeling very disappointed after all this hustle all these efforts ultimately could not support us so i thought how do we move things forward from this and become better saturday yeah the delivery route so my dad will just follow accordingly to the house number one number two number three etc i am designing the packaging i put on a little doodle something personalized for our customers [Music] mom did a lot of groundwork for refining the recipes my brother is very good with numbers and help us to calculate all the ingredients cost packaging cost that helps us with all the delivery [Music] we have to also pick up some side hustles so i'm editing a wedding video right now we had to juggle between both the caribou business and the video business which is a challenge because xiamen is very much involved in the kitchen process if we stop doing the curry buns then what will happen to our parents mom and dad have been freelancers all their lives and they are not of age to redraw from their cpf anyway so they really needed to rely on their job to provide for themselves so with the khariban business they are able to get an income at least [Music] this is your cat i'll rescue them so you feed them every day [Music] i was actually inspired by my own parents my parents would prepare food to help my stay alone senior neighbour so that kind of you know sharing and giving spirit is something that really inspired me to start kampung kakis [Music] so this is the map of all our gucky volunteers as well as aoka keys in meat the purple and the blue are volunteers and the brown is our beneficiary salkakis in need one of the things we realized is that actually a lot of the elderly were not very tech savvy and therefore they felt more isolated so my team decided to start a new initiative called digital car keys where we use our network of kaki volunteers to become sort of the tech support xinten a woman chessy zoom [Music] bye if kobe didn't happen i probably would still be quite busy with my daily life and work and maybe didn't put so much thought into how we can do more to help the community i had the chance to really slow down and reflect upon my life and how i was leaving it if i was to continue in new york i wouldn't be able to do all that after i came back to singapore i still had my job in the u.s so i would work late hours from eight pm to about seven am the next day it was quite difficult because i would start working on khakis in the afternoon before i you know commenced my work in the evening i actually did go back to the us from july it was very hard trying to manage kaponkakis from the u.s because of time zone differences i wanted to come back and see it you know continue to grow [Music] [Applause] [Music] we have 25 to 30 employees most of them are all family breadwinners during the pandemic our printing pieces were all shut we should be cutting off manpower but we chose the face mask manufacturing to actually help to save the jobs even up to today we still have a full team with us [Music] okay we had some issues on the yellow customers are complaining so we took the feedbacks we put in more stringent checks it took us some time before we will come and get a better product out there to the market the pandemic actually forces us to think out of the box to really move ourselves from our comfort zone to actually protect everyone's likelihood to evolve the business to change it to bring ourselves online and to expand to different portfolios to make sure that we are still relevant during the difficult times we thought that it was a good mix to actually expand the whole product line with hand sanitizer [Music] june is where we started back our printing production after the three months stopped right now i'm back to doing my previous role as a fine art print maker i oversee the printing from the color editing to the quality control so back to normal i would say happy to be doing something that i'm familiar with okay so this is safe [Music] now everybody is trying to do promotions so the activities are rolling back in quickly but the production of the face mask still continues [Music] we believe that holding this capability for future safety net is actually important so we decided to keep the the mass manufacturing business uh alive um as long as we can [Music] machine level pandemic has actually brought us stronger together we have learned to think in all the different perspectives don't just keep looking at what they are doing right now and you should be able to find the other part of goal what else you have to do preparation for tomorrow okay we tried juggling our videography business and the caribon business but that also means that we don't have any rest day at all it's difficult and it's really draining sometimes but i think it's worth it [Music] honestly if we were to stop this curry bun tomorrow we would just go out and work harder in our respective jobs but what's keeping us together now it's the chance to work together as a family and to earn together as a family sometimes we also wonder whether the very generous support we get from our customers and friends is this one is this thing gonna last and is there future in the caribbean business we don't really know as well do you want to continue doing it if we can if people still want to eat our curry buns we'll make them we will make it hey jay hi matt are you doing i'm doing good thank you have a seat my appropriation period is three months if they think that

U7F4pkhUJ1Q,COVID-19 Effects on Mental Health of Healthcare Workers – Stanford DOM Grand Rounds – 22 July 2020,UCXb0w5GOQy0rLW1w8qGh_NQ,Stanford Department of Medicine,2020-07-23T15:13:16Z,"In this Stanford Department of Medicine Grand Rounds presentation, expert Debra Kaysen discusses the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare ...",okay uh good morning everybody uh today we have a really uh exciting uh presentation uh as usual before we get started with the presentation we have a couple brief updates and also as usual we will be offering the cme that link will be coming out to you very soon i also wanted to bring your attention to one new website that was created uh with help from uh michael hollis in the school of medicine uh with our own jack zhang together with dr harrington dr singh uh kathy um garzio and a number of other people they created a website called race for the cure it could be found uh jack wilson.link that really summarizes amazing uh all the different uh therapeutics that are in process being studied right now from different therapeutics to vaccines so we'll send that out later as well today but wanted to share that with you and so we'll start with our updates now so dr huja i'll turn it over to you great thank you good morning everyone uh today we have a 35 coveted patients in the hospital at this time focusing on the shc numbers of 224 42 patients have reached our icu and that percentile has stayed stable there have now been 10 deaths at stanford and again that percentage has stayed stable under 5 looking at the age breakdown and i showed you this last week as well um it's really you know been the same there was a small shift towards the younger population as we've seen and looking at our gender breakdown there is a slight predominance of females in our covid population just over 50 percent which is has been consistent at our institution and you can see here of the female population 26 of them have been pregnant giving us you know a significant number of uh pregnant women that we're taking care of in collaboration with our ob colleagues i wanted to show you some um information about the surge planning that we have and so there are actually quite a few meetings that occur either every day or you know every week at certain times in collaboration with shc and school of medicine faculty looking at certain triggers so looking at the awards and capacity for staffing there under the auspices of the icu leadership with the help of angela rogers arthur sung and weiniker norm risk and steve ruas looking at capacity with regards to our events and md staffing and then you know the support of our local community both in the bay area and patients coming from southern california with steve ruas and rudy arthofer helping be the gatekeeper of the transfer center and helping these patients who might need higher levels of care or potentially therapeutics and looking into therapeutics you know id with the help of shanti kappa goda has been really helpful in developing both uh some treatment indications as well as a lottery system should we ever get there if patients exceed the supply of rem death severe for example and then making sure that the clinical trials that have remdessed severe are available for patients who are eligible and interested i wanted to show some length of stay data the average length of stay of a patient on the general medicine awards is usually four days and you can see now with our covet patients for those who do not go to the icu it's about the same length of stay so i think the teams have you know really done a good job of streamlining their care they know how to manage these patients in fact the radiology reports now read uh for patients that have pulmonary findings that uh you know consistent with covet infection so i think there's definitely some patterns of familiarity in the care of these patients now however if a patient were to go to the icu the average length of stay is about 17 days and when these patients do go to the icu the majority of them occur within the first 48 hours so it's relatively early in their care and then here you can see in the green lines the number of discharges of covid patients per day and then the black line uh reflects the number of deaths and then down below you can see the i icu transfers to the aau so that's downgrades that occur day by day and then again the orange line is the total number of patients in the wards and the icu with the icu broken down in red and that dramatic uptick uh from late june to current day looking at our seven bay area counties and again noticing last weekend this week the lower proportion of icu patients as we see the uptick of patients in the hospital in part that being from the younger demographic that's being admitted and then finally for the last slide just looking at the seven bay area counties and the trends there with santa clara county being here in purple so thank you to my data team and errol i'll turn it back over to you thank you thanks so much dr hooja dr chang also has some updates he wanted to share with you regarding occupational health hi good morning uh so trends and occupational health are paralleling what we're seeing on the inpatient side as well as uh in the community you can see in this uh graph looking back over the last eight weeks that positive employees unfortunately have continued to rise steadily mercifully in the last week it has plateaued again hopefully reflecting what's going on in the community overall uh the positivity rate uh in relation to those tested remains relatively low at three percent overall and five percent for people who are symptomatic uh and and that's significant 95 of people with symptoms turn out to have something other than covet but this is uh this is the volume trend i thought i'd also share with you um the distribution where people are getting their infections from sources of infection so i apologize the visibility isn't great i just did this this morning as i was collecting our experience over the past couple weeks in july the 58 new positive health care workers broke down as follows the single largest source not surprisingly was household transmission 20 that's in the blue 20 out of 58 people had a known household positive member the next largest was 16 out of 58 in orange had no known exposure and and that also is consistent with uh general community prevalence uh an important point is that uh the gray uh wedge is uh travel mostly domestic travel and that has been emerging as a significant source of uh infection either the the mass transit aspect of the travel itself or more likely the prevalence of the place they traveled to or even more likely what they were doing when they went there because you don't go and stay in a room you go and do something and so family gatherings are a common source of infection out of state and then other sources of notes were mass transit going to the gym or going to mass outing was a source of infection and then also a new source is patient exposures so what are we doing in response to this in occupational health while the majority of this is really outside of our control in terms of household and unknown community exposures uh there are several things that we are doing as an organization to try to increase uh the protection of our workforce uh one is uh the oversight body court has approved the addition of the use of face shields or goggles eye protection for all health care workers in who are patient or patient visitor facing we are still working out exactly how to implement that and what it means but that's a direction that we are going in everyone now with a household known positive member are is being asked to quarantine for 14 days uh all symptomatic persons even though the majority turn out not to have covert anyone with symptoms we are now asking to stay home until their test result comes back the good news is that 95 are negative and can come back to work uh the lab turnaround uh has been uh excellent this week uh thanks for our lab colleagues work on this and now it's a one day uh and then finally we're looking at travel domestic travel as i said it's an emerging source of infection in our healthcare workers new york new jersey connecticut has already mandated a 14-day quarantine this morning stanford university for their own uh campus uh employees have mandated a 14-day a quarantine for travel outside of northern california and so we are looking at our data and we'll be trying to reconcile our policy with the university's policy uh and factoring in uh cdc recommendations and and local recommendations that's the update on ikea for this morning dr chang thank you for everything you're doing and thank you for those updates um so we'll move on now so um i before i talk about our presenter today i just wanted to briefly update you on upcoming ground rounds in the next few weeks next week we have dr sarah rudman she's the assistant public health officer for the santa clara county uh public health department assistant with working with dr sarah cody and she's going to present i kind of left it open to her she's going to kind of present about the various different things talking about contact tracing and really trying to provide some color into the um kind of the insights of what's been going on behind the scenes in the department and really wants to provide an opportunity for you to ask any questions as well to that end you'll see a survey helena is going to send out in the chat here and feel free to answer it's a one question optional survey where you can ask any questions in advance or dr revlon can plan in advance and try to address some of those questions but we'll make sure we have lots of time for you to ask questions for her next week so we're really really looking forward to that the week after that we have covert 19 the effect on homeless population with dr ho and bomb burger burger and then the week after that we have uh dr martin landry as you may know he was the principal investigator for the recovery trial that of course has affected care for covetations worldwide so we're really looking forward to having him join us so some great sessions in the coming weeks um moving on for today though we have a really exciting uh presentation uh dr deborah kasich and she's going to be talking about kevin 19 and mental health care impact on many of our us health care workers dr cason i got her phd in the university of missouri in 2003 she did her internship and fellowship in the university of washington in 2006 and stayed on this faculty there during her time at the university of washington she founded many programs including one that worked to develop and test more accessible interventions for people suffering from mental health health impacts of traumatic events she joined the stanford faculty in 2019 and she has been a very active person both in clinical and research in the focus of post-traumatic stress disorder and related disorders as you might have guessed she's had she's been busy throughout her career but particularly this year and we're really lucky to have her with us today it's a talk that many people have been asking for so again thank you for joining us thank you to dr sheila lahjani for recommending connecting me with that dr cason as well so dr kasich i'm going to stop sharing my slides and let you share yours and uh and while i'm doing that okay i'll go ahead and let you share your slides thank you for being with us i also want to point out one thing i learned about uh dr cason uh she's an expert in another form of that i wasn't aware of cognitive processing therapy and but i understand it's an opportunity to provide treatment in a shorter time period her work was actually highlighted on the radio show this american life where um someone who suffered from uh proportionate stresses or abuse from 30 years ago filmed i recorded all 10 sessions and put them online as part of this radio show so i really encourage you to check that out i'll send the link to this if any of you would like to watch it but it really allows the opportunity to see dr cason in action it's really really powerful dr case and i'll turn it over to you thank you so much for being with us today beautiful thank you so much and thank you for letting me borrow your time i know everyone here is extremely busy i'm going to dive right in and talk about you know covet 19 is a novel type of traumatic stressor and because of that we're learning together about what's likely to work in this context and we're refining what we recommend in terms of mental health protections based on what we learn that being said we're not flying blind there's actually quite a bit that we know from prior epidemics on their effect on health care workers and what can be helpful in buffering them and that's where we're really going to start so you know my the prior speakers i think did a nice job of setting the context the scope of this pandemic is unprecedented both in terms of its global impact and its duration as we know the u.s is one of the hot spots and cases are rising currently in california health care workers pretty consistently in the literature on the mental health effects of epidemics are one of the groups that are most at risk for experiencing mental health impacts from responding to epidemics now i do want to clarify in part because this is coming up quite a bit in popular media the difference between stress and traumatic stress and kovac 19 actually fits into both categories so stress is any kind of uncomfortable emotional experience with physiological and behavioral changes and not all stress is bad stress so for example starting a new job moving having a baby getting married those are all stressors but in most cases those are positive events chronic and persistent stress can have psychological and physical effects though now traumatic stress is more specific it involves exposure to actual or threatened death serious injury sexual violence or repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of traumatic events usually in the course of your job so first responders medics health care workers would fit into the that category and you can think that cloven 19 has certain experiences that fit into that category but it also has more general stressors things like having too much work being isolated boredom being quarantined following the news you know with the doom scrolling and and just seeing all the terrible things happening those would be stressors and and the way we intervene is a little different if something is a traumatic event versus a chronic stressor so when we look a little bit more closely at what we're seeing with healthcare workers with covid19 the mental health impact is is quite evident your prior research on the sars mers and ebola outbreaks found that healthcare workers and recovered patients were particularly high risk for depression anxiety and ptsd both during and after the outbreaks among healthcare workers the individuals who worked more closely with patients who were sars positive mers positive or who had ebola were more likely to experience mental health symptoms especially in the months and years that followed now when we look at some of the data that's coming out globally on the experiences of health care workers this is from a study that was done within the first few months of the outbreak in china among their health care workers when we look at just reporting symptoms most of the healthcare workers were reporting some symptoms consistent with traumatic stress so it's about 74 about half were reporting symptoms of depression a little less than half were reporting symptoms of anxiety and about a third of them were reporting some type of impact on their sleep and sleep disturbance and these rates were the highest among the health care workers who are working most directly with cova positive patients if we drill down into that data though a little bit more closely and look at folks who are at clinical levels of symptoms the rates are much lower um but about a third of the health care workers were reporting symptoms of traumatic stress that were at a clinical level 15 were reporting that in depression about twelve percent with anxiety and about eight percent were reporting clinical levels of insomnia this is actually quite consistent with a survey that was done of healthcare providers in singapore and india with about 30 physician enrollment anxiety was found in about 15 percent of those physicians depression in 10 and traumatic stress in about 5 so fairly consistent although there are some differences we don't have data yet really uh coming from the u.s healthcare workforce so we're still waiting to know how this is impacting our health care workers now there are several risk factors for distress are things that we found that contribute to this so long work hours constantly changing protocols there was a recent paper that came out looking at nurses responding in new york and one of the things that they reported is that the inconsistencies and constant changing and protocols was an additional source of stress um experiences of stigma from others increases risk role conflicts you know there are still folks who are struggling with how do i take care of other people in my family and do my job when both are very high demand media coverage uh one thing i will say is that you if you can limit the amount of consumption that you have of media and social media that actually will be quite good for your mental health the lack of specific treatments is a stressor and then limited supply of ppe so we can think about the stressors as coming in different discernible waves or periods of time so during the pre-trauma period and i'm thinking about the time that we in april and march when we were preparing there's an increased workload there's uncertainty about what kind of equipment is going to be available and there are worries about whether one might get sick or one might infect one's family members as one moves into the surge in the peak trauma period increased workload and staffing issues becomes more of a stressor shortages of ppe and other equipment has come up quite consistently globally as a stressor and as a risk factor for mental health concerns there is increased risk of contracting the infection and of infecting family members and worrying about those and then quarantine has its own mental health risk factors associated with it when we get into the post-trauma phase then factors such as a shortage of health care providers and the economic impact on both the institution itself and on the larger community become stressors or risk factors now i think one of the challenges with covet 19 is that as we are seeing it's not a linear progression from pre to post trauma we're going in and out of phases depending on what case rates are like in our area in a recent survey of emergency room physicians i just want to highlight this point because i think it's essential assurances about safety and security was one of the things that the physicians indicated would most alleviate anxiety for them and that was specifically around adequate ppe knowing that their families would be safe was one of the factors that the physicians reported would be most beneficial in addition we don't come into this situation all in the same place so for folks who are already having a hard time with stress or burnout we're already having some challenges with coping they will be slightly more at risk in part because the gas tank is doesn't have as much fuel in it in looking at stanford's own well md program and the model for how do we take care of our healthcare workforce this is quite consistent with some of the strategies and skills that i'm going to be talking about with all of you today so there's this concept of a culture of wellness of having shared values and behaviors in leadership having compassion for self and others the concept of efficiency of practice of having systems that help people work effectively and having positive patient and colleague interactions and work-life balance and the concept of personal resilience although i'm going to be emphasizing ways to build personal resilience you'll also notice as we're talking together that i'm also going to be talking about things about work-life balance and positive team interactions as well as having compassion for oneself as ways to be more resilient in the face of covet 19. so one of the first things to recognize is that when we're faced with stressors like this there are quite common normal reactions to these sorts of events so the first set of reactions are what are called intrusions or intrusive reactions and these are ways that the event comes back to mind this can be things like thoughts images dreams or emotional or physical reactions to reminders there are also avoidance cues so what happens when we are exposed to something that is a stressor especially a traumatic stressor is we may try to remove ourselves from it or protect ourselves from distress that can be things like avoiding talking about the event thinking about it having feelings about it or avoiding reminders of it many of us as health care providers also will try to push through and that can serve as avoidance as well right because we're compartmentalizing our own emotions or our own feeling thinking about the event but if we keep doing that over time it's avoidance there's also physical arousal so the body reacts as if danger is still present that can be things like being hyper vigilant so looking for danger being easily startled or jumpy being irritable having outbursts of anger or fear or tears trouble sleeping trouble concentrating it also can include monitoring yourself for physical signs of infection or monitoring others with events like this there also can be grief it's in response to the death of loved ones or colleagues this is sadness anger guilt regret missing or longing for the person or having dreams of seeing them and traumatic grief that can focus on how the death could have been prevented who was at fault or to blame and that could make it difficult to adjust to the death and we can have physical reactions these can be things like headaches dizziness muscle aches hyperventilating having a rapid heartbeat and one of the challenges is that some of these acute physical reactions also can look like symptoms of coved 19 and so this can lead to panic attacks or excessive self-monitoring now with regards to guilt what we're seeing among health care workers is that there are multiple potential sources of guilt in the acute phase of the pandemic so this can be guilt about potential transmission of the virus to family members it can be moral distress where we feel like we're being asked to do things that go against our own moral code or professional code can be guilt about lower work efficiency can also be guilt about feeling like you can't be at work carrying out your regular duties if you are sick or quarantined um it can be about not being able to work after you've tested negative but you're still feeling sick and aren't able to perform your normal work and you feel like you're letting your team down and it can also be guilt over mistakes now one thing to stress is that these reactions are not psychopathology these reactions are common they're normal they're expected and they're understandable in the face of stressors the place where you may want to pay more attention is and to actually reach out for help is if these symptoms or reactions are going on for more than two months and if they worsen or if they're impairing or functioning either at home or at work now even though these reactions are common for many people they will improve over time as the stress comes down one thing to remember and i um i'm concerned by the media reports that keep talking about a mental health tsunami that is going to face that is going to face all of us globally because the reality is that humans are resilient resilience means that we adapt well in the face of stress and most of us actually are able to recover naturally from these types of stressors this is common it's not extraordinary that doesn't mean that you're not having a hard time or that you're not distressed and it's not a trait so we can learn to be resilient and actually most of what i'm going to talk about is how can we build resilience it's also important to remember that resilience isn't one size fits all we follow different pathways and trajectories and we rely on different coping strategies to get there and because we may be experiencing different stressors at a given time we're going to have ups and downs in our symptoms and our functioning and in our resilience in the moment so in terms of ways to promote resilience during the peak trauma phase and even in the post-trauma phase um there are things that we can do so promoting safety and restoring calmness normalizing acute reactions that's what i was just doing as we were talking about what are common responses building a sense of self-efficacy i'm going to talk about some strategies about that in just a sec feeling connected and belonging and having mental openness about what's happening all can help build resilience i would also add that clear messaging and communication from leadership is essential feeling part of a cohesive team and giving and receiving support as part of that team is helpful as is feeling listened to and having a space for decompression so i'm going to briefly talk about what can you do in the field right so some of the strategies are things you can do while you're at work while you're in the midst of things other strategies are more things that you can do when you have a break when you're at home or between chefs so in the fielded stuff a lot of people are working at very high rates right now but some things that you can do that can help you cope in the field so taking breaks taking more frequent breaks than usual if you can i'm remembering to breathe and that sounds uh simple but it actually will help bring down your heart rate it'll bring down anxiety so doing three minute breathing breaks can be extremely helpful uh using support resources so one thing that multiple groups have talked about as a helpful strategy is to start shifts with a group coping strategy and to end a shift with group words of support or with a group debriefing about how things went reflecting at the end of the shift about what went well what didn't again offering support and taking rest so using the restroom when you need to taking breaks again as needed some other strategies in the field that groups from new york were reporting were helpful were things like during a shift having a respite area where employees can rest shower get some emotional support grab a snack if they need having soothing music or tv or other de-stressing activities in that space they report it as being extremely helpful the other piece is to remember during your shift that the stress is understandable to have a partner to buddy up with and check in with and staying in contact with people that you care about after your shift and to give yourself permission to pause and recharge and we're going to talk a little bit more about that now so the other thing to build resilience is to lean on coping strategies and to build new ones so when one is stressed often it is easiest to start with strategies that are already familiar to us what's worked well for you in the past during stressful times are there things that you've used in the past that you've stopped using now start those up again by starting with what you already know first of all you're not having to master a new skill or a new habit and it also enhances your sense of self-advocacy okay now it may be that there are skills that you used to use that aren't as effective now and some might not be as effective but they are still working that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you or wrong with the skill it just means that the stressor might need you to shift the strategies a little bit so you might need to add some new adaptive coping actions and you want to be open to troubleshooting either new ways to implement coping strategies or some ones that you might want to try that you haven't used before so in terms of adaptive coping activities these are some ideas this is not an exhaustive list this is intended to be some things to think about and some of them are going to be better for different people or better in different contexts i would emphasize exercise is a wonderful intervention it works for depression and anxiety it works for stress so building in an exercise routine that you can keep up with is great journaling can be very helpful for dealing with some of the hard stuff sometimes it's just focusing in the moment on something practical that you can do right now relaxation methods i'm going to actually show you guys a tool that's available for playing with different relaxation methods whether it's progressive muscle relaxation or meditation or using the breathing strategies but there are multiple different ones to try the other thing i would add around coping before i move into social support is it is important to set up a regular practice schedule around coping sometimes we forget to use our coping strategies until we're in crisis and then we wonder why they don't work it's like trying to learn to use a stick shift you really want to practice it a lot not try it on the hills in san francisco for your first shot do the same thing with the coping strategies so social connections and support are actually one of the most effective agents in preventing traumatic stress responses for helping promote recovery and i know with this event with quarantine social distancing um and high workloads it's very easy to become socially isolated or withdrawn but we know that social connections are one of the most helpful things for humans in being well um and in recovering so there are different kinds of social social support that someone may want or need and it can be helpful to think about these different kinds of connections so it may be material assistance or physical assistance i need someone to help me with something it may be advice it may be someone that you can lean on for emotional support and for those of us who are not so good at asking for social support you can think about which ones might be easier for me to ask for first and start with that so the other thing to think about is that giving social support is also helpful for our emotional well-being so there's the concept of tend and befriend which is taking care of others is often a way of actually reassuring our own sense of self-worth and feeling cared for and valued i would say for health care workers just watch the balance of that many of us are very good at taking care of others not so good at taking care of ourselves and so making sure that there's a good healthy balance in there i think with covet 19 sometimes we have to be more mindful or thoughtful about building this in we have to do a little bit more reaching out because some of these social connections aren't happening in naturalistic ways as they might in other contexts so another thing to think about is how to manage reminders and to just be prepared for these so there may be trauma reminders so if you've gone through something especially distressing either in the workplace or in your own life these are events that evoke the thoughts or feelings related to that event and it can bring up those thoughts and feelings long after the event has ended as well as right in the immediate aftermath there can be loss reminders so for those of us who are grieving these are things that bring to mind the absence of the person that has died and there are change reminders our lives look very different than they did a year ago and so there may be these reminders that hit you about how life has changed and a feeling of grief and loss about that so knowing what might be a reminder for you and having some coping strategies in mind about how to address that or how to be prepared for that can be extremely helpful so it doesn't catch you off guard these can be things like the south sight sounds places smells um the time of day the situation the room it can be physiological reactions you feel your heart start beating faster and that brings up the reminder so planning around these responses can actually help reduce their duration and their intensity okay just a word about sleep health and i know there was a really lovely webinar specifically on sleep so i would encourage those of you who are having sleep problems to listen to that but some brief tips around managing sleep to the extent that you can with your work schedule establishing a regular sleep schedule and limiting daytime naps to no more than 15 minutes and no napping after four reducing your use of alcohol a lot of folks i know go to alcohol as a way to try to manage sleep but it's a terrible medication for sleep structure architecture also eliminating your afternoon or evening caffeine increasing exercise and working on cultivating some relaxation before bedtime or doing something calming if you're finding that worrying is keeping you up you're lying in bed and worrying quite a bit you can use a worry diary um so jotting the thoughts down and then dealing with them in the morning so i want to talk about my favorite group of the strategies which is around how do we talk to ourselves and how can we use that in a different way to manage stress so especially around strong negative emotions like guilt shame or blame using some gentle curious questions can help address the beliefs that feed those emotions and we know that stress changes the way we talk to ourselves so just like when we're stressed we can feel our muscles tighten up in some ways stress can make our thinking overly rigid and unyielding so it may be things like you know this is a terrible time i can't keep myself or my family safe it may be doubts about our own judgment i'm feeling overwhelmed i can't manage this workload self-blame something bad habit it was my fault or esteem the world is unfair other people don't care enough about us those thoughts are probably not accurate so what we do when working on self-talk is first identify what the thought is then ask some questions to test the thought and then work on changing the thought to be more yielding more balanced you can almost think about it as mental yoga you're going for increased flexibility and range of motion so some questions you can ask yourself if you're noticing you're having those kinds of rigid thoughts you can ask some questions to gain perspective what's the evidence that this thought is true is there any evidence it isn't completely true is there another way to look at the situation that might be less distressing or more helpful you know our thoughts influence our feelings so if you're having angry thoughts you're gonna have angry feelings anxious thoughts have anxious feelings and you can think about these as mental pictures that run through your mind so asking these questions helps you really test whether that is completely true another one is to use a compassionate lens to ask yourself is this the thought that i would say to a good friend who's saying this or if i'm in my kindest space what might i say to myself instead often we're better to other people than we are to ourselves and so this is turning that lens on ourselves now for those blame thoughts looking at hindsight bias is quite helpful often we're judging a decision or what we did based on the knowledge we have now so asking yourself questions like did you know this would be the outcome realistically what options did you realistically have at the time and what was your intent that can help for the what-ifs or the kurdish to help bring those down so just briefly running through a couple of examples for someone who's saying i can't manage this work a more flexible thought might be i'm coping the best i can in a really difficult situation that thought is probably more accurate okay and less distressing and so when you find a thought like this that's a bit more balanced you then want to practice saying this to yourself so for safety i can't keep myself safe is that completely true what are the things you're doing what would you say to a good friend i have some specific things that i can do that will be more likely to keep myself and my family safe an example of blame i should have done something differently right some questions did you know this would be the outcome realistically what options did you have at the time and what was your intent more flexible thought might be i did the best i could in a really difficult situation so i wanted to give you guys some resources to think about the covet coach is a free app that was developed by the national centers for ptsd and it has tools around self-care around relaxation and coping it has some light touch self-talk kinds of skills as well it's got meditation and breathing it does not share your data with anyone or do anything with your data so it's a quite safe app and it was pulled together uh from multiple mental health experts um so i strongly recommend that if you're having specific problems with sleep you might want to look at the cbti app it actually has some very nice tools for addressing sleep problems and if you're feeling really overwhelmed with stress and with how do i break down all the stuff that i'm balancing the move forward app is a nice one for teaching problem solving skills for those of you who want some resources these are some references at the ebola psychological first aid manual i think is an especially nice resource for folks and then if you're needing a little bit more support there are actually quite a number of local resources that i've pulled together for all of you um that includes uh that there are trained physician peers that you can speak with the well connect program for trainees and there are some wonderful resources actually at the faculty staff help center space around different types of stressors and the well md program so i wanted to save time for us to be able to talk through this and to do some q a okay so thank you so much for all that information for those links um we will send a follow-up email with that slider or the direct links to those websites for you as well um perfect there's a few questions coming in right now first one dr hopkins asks uh he asked this one a little earlier what is different about the fifty percent of health care providers who are not depressed maybe the characteristic is just of them or what's what's unique about them it's a wonderful question how do we understand who's gonna wind up in that risk group and who's not um so from a data standpoint what we're seeing is that nurses are more at risk for whatever reason women are more at risk potentially because women are also often taking on the lion's share of family responsibilities and stressors as well folks who are already experiencing mental health concerns before this hit also are more likely to wind up in that depressed or anxious group so those are some of the consistent risk factors that we're seeing across samples okay great thank you um dr casey next question here uh how can teams better address psychological safety to those experiencing the pandemic differently and make sure they also have a voice so some groups may be focusing on the loss of social interactions like going to wedding but other groups are focusing on things like family members and friends being infected with kovitz struggling with loss of job or food insecurity yeah no that's a great question and you know i think you also highlight that this event is hitting different people and different groups of people in different ways i think one thing that you can do is actually building in a place that for people to check in right how is everyone doing i've been doing that with my own teams and with my own students for example is making sure that i'm actually rather than just diving into business and we're all so busy it's easy to do that of actually how are you and asking it as a general question and making sure that people don't experience consequences for being upfront about genuinely answering that question i think for folks who are struggling with issues um that are stressors outside of work trying to tap them into the resources that do exist at stanford that we can i know within the psychiatry department we were doing the listening forums which were extremely helpful for a place for people to talk about what was going on for them um and to get some additional resources and support when they needed it so those would be some suggestions i would have okay great thank you um another question here what about if your spouse is more stressed than you are is there help for spouses of employees uh well i can't answer the specifics about what what resources are available but my memory in going through that list of links is i think on the support during difficult times link and i know that in the faculty and staff help center there were actually some specific resources listed for spouses as well okay great thank you can you please comment on the impact of mental health professionals and their workloads the effect of workload you touched on this a little bit earlier maybe elaborate more on how their workload affects the mental well-being yeah um and i think you're i'm assuming that the question is about healthcare workers and workload not the mental health workforce and our workload related but not exactly the same um so in terms of the healthcare workforce you know i think the analogy around fuel in the fuel tank is not a bad one which is that we all need time to recharge as workloads go up it becomes harder to use those coping strategies there's on only so many hours in the day i do think it's a place where carving out that time is important to be able to rest to be able to recharge i think that giving yourself permission to fall apart at times is actually quite helpful um but that is part of the recovery process and the resilience process when we're exhausted um you know we need to be a little more patient with ourselves and others so that's a place where that self compassion and compassion towards others is quite helpful um and i think carving out the break times that you can again is going to make you more resilient great um a quick question here from um how do you ask that the apps reference for healthcare workers uh are they work healthcare workers specific or good for patients too that the websites you share shared with us so this page of resources is more oriented towards us these resources the covet coach the cbti app the move forward place and there's actually a bunch of other resources on that page it's like a cornucopia of good coping strategies those are useful for patients and i didn't focus this talk on the impact on patients but we are finding that specific groups of patients are at high risk for long-term mental health problems related to covet as well specifically icu stays are associated with risks of ptsd and depression patients who may be quarantined can be at risk and individuals who have more severe cases of covid may be more at risk that certainly was true with the ebola outbreak so yes please share these resources with your patients excellent uh dr ewan kim asks for those of us who are working from home or waiting for deployment can we volunteer or get trained to be peer support listeners are there enough of those do you need more can you connect can we get trained and she also says thanks for the excellent talk oh awesome um i love that question so i am uh i am not uh part of the well md program but what i would do is i would actually reach out to them and find out how you can get trained i am sure they would love love to have your help we also created a reserve core basically of mental health providers for doing the the connect and recharge groups right now we're on hold waiting for you guys but if people are also struggling we can set up a one-to-one call with any of the connect and recharge providers so we also have those resources for you all as well great thank you um next question here what if you feel your colleague is not doing well and they absolutely are in denial should it be reported to someone oh that is really hard um that is really hard you know i think the best step and it sounds like you may have already tried that is to talk to them in a caring way about the concerns that you have you know it seems like you're suffering and i'm worried about you and i know you're trying to push through and so trying to do that as a first step i think is useful if that's not working um you know i think talking to somebody's uh supervisor especially if you can do it in a compassionate way about how do we help get this person some support is a good next step whether you should report someone i think you know if somebody's getting to a place where it's impairing patient care then that may be an issue that it has to be escalated dr cason uh has there been and i imagine there's been uh at different levels this type of discussion with leadership so that can be educated and uh i guess the the people who are being led want to know that this all the things you're talking about self-care there are leaders i know our leader for example in department medicine we have many of them that promote this stuff making sure we're taking care of ourselves but this time doing systematically or organizationally this training oh well that is probably above my pay grade my experience in working with the well md group is that this is actually something that has been embraced by stanford leadership and the this is part of an organized program um i do think that there are some groups that are embracing some of these principles and there are are different groups implementing it in different ways um there are probably some better ways to integrate all of what we're doing so we don't uh unnecessarily replicate efforts across teams great um and dr case and i had a question that came in quite earlier through the chat function here anonymous question and it has to do with staff as well so any advice for the hundreds of staff who have had um pivot to remote work even uh even though they're not patient facing they worry about our doctors they worry about their own families and many of them family members who are first responders anything the managers of these staff can do specifically yeah that's a great question you know i think some of the same strategies that we talked about would work with those staff as well so doing check-ins building team meetings where people can connect you can think about those first of all rituals are helpful for people having predictability that's part of what's driving us all nuts with this is there's so much uncertainty so i think as a manager what i might do is seeing if there are ways to build in huddles or those social supports and connections both with staff pre shift and post if that works with people's workflow and checking in with people about whether that is helpful or not i would also say i didn't talk about this so much in the skills part but if you have people who are worrying a lot my favorite strategy for that is to schedule it and i know it sounds really silly but using setting aside 20 minutes a day is scheduled worry time that's the time you get to worry about the doctors the patients whatever it is right when the worry thoughts come up at other times write it down on a list and then put it on the back burner until you get to that worry time so i think there's both there's some individual level strategies about worrying and then there's some manager level strategies about worrying gotcha um yeah next question up uh lala our colleague in the emergency department happy to have colleagues from throughout the school of medicine with us she asked a good question here and she says this is a marathon uh we have many more months of this ahead of us and we must be kind and collegial to each other knowing we are all under some degree of stress to prevent us from adding to each other's stress many of us are filled with pride and purpose some are of our jobs prevent us from email but do optimally perform with coping strategies right now is the institution thinking of a post-trauma plan for the healthcare workers after we are out of this i can't speak to what the institution is doing um but i will say to you i agree with everything that you just said and if the institution wants to put together a post-trauma plan hey i think it's needed and b i would be delighted to be a part of that thinking process great we'll try to get through these last one or two more here as time runs out can you please clarify how to implement not doing quote quote-unquote doom-scrolling in a mindful way is there any important information in the news that many of us do not privilege do not have the privilege to ignore i hear ya um and and i will say that this is one of those physician um what i say versus what i do just listen to what i'm saying not necessarily what i'm always doing um so i think with news what you can do is actually set a time limit on it and there is some data that sort of about 30 minutes of news consumption a day is sufficient and is not associated with mental health impacts and to be honest um there's not that much value added after that right there's not that much new information so set a timer um there are actually productivity tools that you can use or the adult controls to turn it off and then be choosy about what media you're consuming to have it be high quality right um so and and that's consistent with some of the data coming out of 9 11 the news consumption was actually associated with higher risk of traumatic stress symptoms for folks okay great and perhaps there's just one question left at this one and conclude here but any uh comments that you can have any reports on increased harassment of healthcare workers especially women um this uh healthcare worker was saying she's experienced more particularly over televising the last few weeks and obviously there's a role in stress absolutely absolutely and i'm very sorry to hear about that i mean i know in terms of the international media there have been physical attacks on health care workers in some places um in terms of telemedicine attacks that i have not heard of as much but i am sorry that you're experiencing that you know again i think where you can set limits or if there are places where you can get buffers from that that would certainly be better and then having places that you can check in and debrief about that um i think is essential because that is a more extreme stressor got it that's perfect yeah and we'll end on this last uh comment here watch a movie rather than the news yes i agree with that uh dr cason thank you so much for letting your expertise and your time look to us and we really appreciate it i learned a lot thank you again uh thank you to our panelists and to everybody for sticking with us and we'll see you next week ,True,False,True,False

Bob acaba Chavez and it is my pleasure to facilitate this webinar we have with us today our esteemed Secretary Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India miss Preeti Sutton who has been the key strategist in times of the covert pandemic we are also honored to have with us the stalwarts and icons of psychiatry and delegates both nationally and internationally who have graciously ugly to participate in this webinar and we are all eagerly waiting to interact with them so without further ado I had a quest our head of the department professor Fatima muti to welcome this virtual gathering and good evening to most people I think many people have joined around the world or either in the afternoon or early evening and so good evening to all of you I think it would be very appropriate to say that you know we've never imagined in our lifetime that we'd be going through moments like this just a decade ago we were rejoicing in the fact that the world was flat and we were rejoicing globalisation and now we're at a moment where we're wondering whether we the world is going to get flattened and how are we going to manage the times ahead there's been a lot of you know emphasis on physical distancing we realized like never before the importance despite physical a distancing we've realized for the first time in our lives Eve it's the greatest importance of staying connected of learning from each other of networking of learning both what we should be doing and what we should not be doing in terms of addressing the pandemic the Kobuk pandemic hasn't been just a physical pandemic in terms of affecting our physical states it's really unleashed a whole lot of mental distress we've known about the worried well people with depression anxiety various kinds of psychological distress uncertainty and anxiety and particularly in marginalized communities the effects of these can be extremely devastating we also know about the economic kind of challenges that in turn can you know aggravate the mental health problems at the same time I think we understand the importance of resilience more than ever and in times of these uncertainties how is it that we can learn how to cope how can we be less vulnerable and come out of this stronger that's why we need people to come together and try and see how we can find solutions so we yeah so this is truly a webinar with the difference we've had we have a set of global stalwarts from Australia professor Mohan Isaac from the United States professor Micelli Kevin from Canada professor Lakshmi Arthur from the UK professor Benesch Mogra and closer home our beloved director professor bien Ganga other who are really going to talk about the impact of the the COBIT pandemic not only in the countries that they're located in but what lessons it has for the world how do we address the public in terms of mental health how do we look at underprivileged to societies what might happen after the pandemic ah the common thread that connects you know all the speakers is that the four of them are visiting professors in the Department of Psychiatry we've never had an opportunity before to actually bring them together on a common platform and this is the red banner that offers us this particular opportunity and we're very very glad to have them not only do they bring in the expertise of the countries they work in they have mentored several young psychiatrists from India and I'm sure the wisdom that they bring will help us to find not not only to understand the challenges but to find solutions to this huge crisis ahead of us the icing on the cake is of course that you know as dr. Gangadhar mentioned we have a amidst missus pretty Sudan the secretary a Health and Family Welfare Government of India and we couldn't have hoped for a better person to actually inaugurate this program after releasing the newsletter Samet worm which was brought out by our Center for integrated medicine at NIMH hands under the leadership of Professor Ganga and professor Scheele Rama so she's going to do that and inaugurate this webinar as all of you know babaca described as her as a strategist and i think particularly she's always been one and particularly in the Corbett crisis her leadership has been exemplary she has a particular interest in mental health is actually written about the crisis of mental health and what might be the factors contributing to it she has brought about several people together to bring about material awareness material start a helpline strengthen the state government responses to the mental health crisis increase prevention of mental health problems improve awareness and importantly reducing the stigma and the fear around Corbett so madam we're very very grateful for your taking time off to be with us this evening and we really look forward to your inaugural address we also have in amongst us mr. Neil ambush Sharon economic adviser to the Government of India as well as a joint secretary responsible for NIMH hands and he's been extremely supportive to us in honor activities and I'm sure has Health Institute grow from strength to strength so we'd like to welcome you sir and I will not stand between you and the speakers but before I conclude I'd like to welcome our large audience you know we've had about 300 registered participants with many of them have logged in now we're hoping that more of you will log in and I'm sure this is going to be an intellectual as well as an emotional treat for all of you and I hope you enjoy the two hours ahead I'd like to kind in a welcome speech you don't normally thank people but I'd like to thank professor Naveen and the team for actually bringing this all together and bringing us all together on this flat welcome once again and thank you all very much Thank You Man we now move forward to the release of a quarterly newsletter so much more from the department of integrated medicine of NIMH hands I hereby request mrs. Patil then to release I thank you man I request our esteemed health secretary ma'am to deliver the inaugural address very much professor eminent national and international experts my colleague in ambush participants ladies and gentlemen I think professor Abbott Emma materially said very well humanity has actually rarely expressed and experienced such a collective sense of vulnerability in fact I would like to say that if we could express our experience of a relative or maybe that that will help us to overcome the stress and anxiety that all of us are feeling at this point of time I begin with expressing my gratitude to demands our premier Institute dealing with mental health and also all our national and international Institute's that are dealing with very sensitive subject of mental health and showing us the way ahead thank you very much actually the present pandemic has posed a dual challenge for the body and the mind so sure psychosocial if health effects of over 19 remain unseen and I'm sure are going to last longer than the physical trends in India our challenge has been huge you see this is also due to our social settings our then sleeping settings and the cordial and social gatherings that we are used to the physical meetings that weekend the celebrations India is a actually nation of festivals we are unable to celebrate we are unable to actually get together because we do have to observe physical and social distancing not only for ourselves but also to keep our loved one safe and this all has led to stress and anxiety stigma and fake news also has actually contributed to people feeling very anxious and also very stressful there have been in the recent past suicides I think out of bewilderment and also out of not realizing and not being able to reach out physically to their loved ones so this webinar is very timely I would like to also say that we have in the ministry recognized the need to set up special resources for addressing issues of stress anxiety and mental health it's a fact that our own mental health survey of 15 and 16 2015 16 showed that there is prevalence of mental health issues of varying degree I mean it's it's not not all are very severe and 150 million Indians need active mental health intervention but very few fewer than 13 million seeking it we are actually quite you know hesitant to talk about these issues I wish we could discuss our stress our anxiety our depression with our loved ones just as we discussed our diabetes or hypertension or our other diseases so I think I must come for India also true of knowledge and talk about mental health and I think I must thank demands under the leadership of dr. van Garderen that we have actually put in a lot of effort but there is a national mental health mental health helpline run by newman's which is then on-boarded by various states in their vernacular languages there this helpline has been widely publicized we have a separate section on behavioral health and social or psychosocial resources on our website our website has you board ship running into millions so that is also very helpful we have videos and small clips helping people to to cope and go and to see those even if they are in isolation so that it can help them cope with stress we have actually there is a dedicated site called copied warrior . as a nicely dot in which actually has about one hundred and sixteen thousand psychology and social welfare professionals which are line listed as four districts and this has been done this this aggregation of human resource has been done so that at the disaggregated level the concerned administrators the concerned doctors the concerned institutions can avail of the services of these very efficient and I would say a precious resource to deploy them in settings which will they will be useful and they will be helpful and we've had nearly 2.5 million viewers on webinar and courses related to bubut and mental health together but I am saying well this is just tell the participants and our experts that what we are doing is only a drop in the ocean we need further guidance on how we could take further and help and reach out to people and we are especially we want to start a communication theory is engaging specialists experts and achievers from various walks of life to give educational and motivational talks so that people can be reached far and wide and you would like to translate this into or netilat languages because India is so diverse so I would request this Wagner to also address how you could help us how we could reach out to people and I close with thanking our experts for participating and also thanking in enhance for taking this initiative this very very important initiative and we must have many such webinars in the future also thank you thank you mom for your enlightening words before we start off with the sessions we have a few housekeeping announcements we want this webinar to be as interactive as possible so please feel free to type your questions on the chat box which has been made available to you on the webinar platform and through the YouTube live streaming the link of which has been already circulated since we have several speakers so please type in name of the speaker you want the question to be dressed to kindly keep your microphones muted during the speeches and all the questions will be taken up at the end of the final presentations so with this I now request dr. Neha Kulkarni to introduce us to our first speaker good evening a first speaker of the day being dr. Lakshmi Adam who's the professor and head Department of Psychiatry and director at Institute of Mental Health University of British Columbia Canada he is the president of world federation of societies for Biological Psychiatry editor-in-chief of Canada and Journal of Psychiatry his areas of interest being bipolar disorder with more than 330 publications in the field he is been his accolades include Mogens Co award general Thurman award and Calvin price for bipolar mood disorder research is one of the top 1% of highly cited researchers I now invite professor Lakshmi Adam to deliver his talk on addressing mental health needs of the public the platform is your circle maybe click the presentation mode yeah okay perfect thanks very much first of all let me say it is such a delight to see so many colleagues and I want to thank for the opportunity to share what we who learned about the mental health impact of Kobe 19 with with all of you so I think this slide is has been circulating around for quite some time and I'm fairly sure that many of you will have seen this and you'll see this in patients presentation as well so what this shows is what typically happens during a pandemic and that is in the set of four earlier stages the acute care beds are overstretched and then around that time are slightly after mental health problems are so begin to emerge and then steadily increase with time now of course with co19 this pandemic is probably something that's not none of us have ever seen meaning that there's probably nothing like this that we witnessed in our lifetime so far and so as we look to the future I think there are a lot of uncertainties in terms of how this is going to evolve in looking at them some of the numbers this morning I think so far something like thirteen and a half million people have been affected and close to 600,000 people have died so far so I think one thing that is probably very clear is that there is going to be a significant mental health impact or aftermath and some might even call it a mental health endemic so to speak how bad that's going to be is anyone's guess at this point in time let's go to the next slide please so there are many factors that likely will contribute to the mental health impact of this pandemic and I just think about five of those the first one being and probably one of the most important ones is fear of contracting the disease and also passing the disease on to some of the loud ones and this is a obviously a major source of stress and I think to mitigate the risk of spread as we all know many countries around the world had implemented lockdown some of those have been lifted and some of the countries have begun to re-implement these lock downs again and I think one of the consequences of these lock downs is that they tend to disrupt our social rhythms our daily routines and we know that our biological clocks are entrained by these social rhythms and when those biological clocks are disturbed they tend to lead to depressive symptoms can we go to the next slide please so this is a study we did very recently just trying to understand that relationship between social rhythm irregularities and stress and depressive symptoms and what we found was that there is a significant negative correlation between stress and social rhythm irregularity and equally importantly we found in our recent study that there is a clear relationship between development of depressive symptoms and social rhythm irregularity so clearly disturbance in these social routines seem to have a significant negative impact on mental health let's go to the next slide please and there are obviously other consequences of this pandemic economic impact is another massive one with job losses and businesses being shut down with service industry self affected most gently go back go back to the previous line so that's another significant risk factor traumatic experiences of witnessing relatives being admitted of hospitals being on ventilators relatives friends acquaintances dying obviously or major stressful factors and lastly we also know the Y was itself seems to affect the body in many different ways particularly its impact on the immune system and also we know that it enters the body through the ACE 2 receptors and these these are all expressed in some of the areas of the brain that are intimately involved in emergence of the mental health symptoms so areas such as hippocampus amygdala and some of the Mona in the music nucleate regions as well so there are many reasons as to why this pandemic might have a significant impact of mental health next let's for the next slide please so I think how these factors impact that really depends on which group one might belong to so for example for someone that's in the front line as a healthcare worker fear of contracting the disease and spreading that to two loud ones is a massive risk risk factor and of course those with the pre-existing mental health conditions many of these tend to operate and there are many others as well well let's go to the next slide please now the challenge though is that you know we all do believe for the reasons that that I have outlined that this pandemic is going to have a significant impact on mental health but unfortunately the data so far it comes regressing what the impact is is of very poor quality so if one looks at what's been published in various journals many of them are opinion pieces with not much data and most of the data that's been collected still go back please bring us like most of the data that's been collected instead of based on surveys and many of these surveys have not used these sort of a best methodological strategies to to estimate the impact so there are numerous methodological problems with these studies let's go to the next slide so this is a survey that was done in Canada and again these surveys are done on a weekly basis and depending upon when the results come out the sort of percentages tend to vary but I think most of these surveys tend to look at some of the common problems such as anxiety depression substance use and as you can see approximately a quarter of the population seem to endorse each of those things let's go to the next slide please so what about the studies that are being done and I think most of the data that has been published comes from some of the studies that have been done in China and this is a systematic review which included about 12 said 'yes with about 27,000 people and this systematic review suggests that about a quarter of population are endorsing anxiety symptoms and approximately similar number endorsing depressive symptoms and also substance use as well now don't forget that these results are based on in very sort of blunt instruments such as PhD nine or gat seven or Gattu you know things like that let's do the next slide so this is another more systematic review with more patient's are more respondents included in these studies and again the numbers seem to be fairly similar ranging from a quarter to a third of population endorsing stress or anxiety and depression so I think it's fairly clear about a third or a quarter of the population have these symptoms the what's unclear is how many of these people actually meet the criteria for some of the dsm-5 or ICD disorders and that research is is still not there or not out there is yet let's go to the next slide please so this was a study that was done a key BC again looking at about 3,000 people and these people have been asked to complete questionnaires on a weekly basis and this is sort of methodology everybody seems to be using these days and as with the other surveys and studies the UBC study also found fairly high incidence of depression and anxiety and in this particular study our colleagues looked at what are some of the predictors of increase in depressive symptoms in the in respondents and they found again not surprisingly low income difficulties with school and work social isolation concerns about getting basic necessities so some of the risk factors that we talked about seem to be the ones that seem to predict some of these mental health symptoms let's go to the next slide please so if a quarter 2/3 of population are being are likely to be affected by this pandemic and comes to the mental health concerns the question is you know how do we how do we address the needs of these populations so this is an editorial that we published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry where we address in detail what are some of the strategies that one might use to address the needs of those four groups that that I've talked about earlier on and that is you know if you have someone in the general population that has mental health issues sweaters on the main strategies one might imply versus someone with a pre-existing mental health conditions or frontline health workers are those that had coded 19 now we'll talk about some of these in terms of what we've done how in managing this issue within BC so let's go to the next slide please so what we saw with this pandemic I think like everyone else we were fundamental health perspective anyway we were expecting the worst but - but luckily enough in BC our chief medical officer has managed the pandemic quite well in collaboration with our health authorities so we all work together so during the acute phase at least within BC although we were expecting the worst even from the medical perspective our system was not stretched at all and in total we only had about 3,000 cases of code 19 within within the province of British Columbia but from the mental health perspective we were also expecting significant surge in demand and so we had pre-planned by preparing for the worst case scenario in terms of creating koete cohort units and redesigning our mental health services but to our surprise what we actually found in the initial days at least was that there was a 40 percent reduction in bed occupancy so number of our mental health beds were empty and as we as the pandemic a world what we found was that many patients were afraid to come into the hospital because they were concerned about getting contracted with the the Coheed 19 so that was that was one of the reasons for people sort of shying away from the hospital in the initial days although that has changed since then now we're back to 105 percent in occupancy which sort of goes with the the expected increase in mental health problems that that most people have predicted again in the initial days of pandemic our outpatient activity reduced by 50% and we swiftly switch to a transition to what to a care with 95% of our outpatient activity was done through the virtual strategies using zoom and many of the other strategies the carico head unit that we had created most of them were empty so we finally end up switching to one unit where most of our patients were admitted so we've been incredibly lucky in BC in managing this exceptionally well let's go to the next slide please so what we've done apart from just addressing the hospital situation as I mentioned earlier one of the major reasons as to why you know we've been so successful in BC I think had to do with the consistent messaging from our chief medical officer and also chief medical officer working with health authorities what one doesn't want to see is what Trump is doing minimizing the problem and giving messages that are inconsistent and and clearly erroneous so so that's obviously what's causing huge challenges in the US we create a crisis line the volumes for crisis line went up by something like 400 percent and those continue to be high but also our we our government you have about five million dollars to beef up our virtual mental health system capacity in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association so that anyone with you know depression anxiety symptoms can access online CBT with coaching support and that has had a huge impact we are working on redesigning the social rhythm therapy based on some of the research that we've conducted and the way hoping that we'll be ready for deployment in the in the near future we also made sure that some of the frontline healthcare workers needs were addressed so within each of our health authorities we established teams that were available to provide psychological debriefing for our friend line health care workers and for our physicians we worked with the doctors of BC to set up a virtual mental health care system so that any physician that has had any mental health issues can can access these services quite rapidly so by providing access to a number of these psychological supports we were able to address the mental health needs of the frontline health care workers and also our general public quite rapidly and all of these have had significant impact and finally I think some of you may have heard about what the government's in each of the power provinces and the Canadian government has done in supporting the financial impact of this Kovach 19 by providing wage subsidies to people and also providing business loans to to businesses to support their their activities so I think we've used sort of a multi-pronged strategy strategies to to some extent I would say to mute the mental health impact after co19 so far but just looking at what's happening in the rest of the world we're not done with it and worst is yet to come we are preparing for the second and the subsequent subsequent ways just go to the next slide please and that's going to be my last leg so as he heard I think one of the major strategies that's been incredibly helpful is the is the transition to that which will care strategy and our government has recognized that and our Prime Minister has announced 250 million dollars to further refine our virtual care strategy so this is an editorial that we published basically pleading to our prime minister that this is great that you're investing this much money but let's just make sure that it is invested in right areas although transition to virtual care has been incredibly Swift there are a number of issues with the virtual care strategists including things like privacy so all of those issues are addressed and this in this editorial so I'm going to stop there and thank you very much for your attention thank you selflessly ting the importance of mental health needs of the public I now first doctor pratik Varshney to introduce us to our second speaker thank you dr. Veronica it is an honor for me to be introducing the next speaker professor Denis bubela to his various credentials there is being the former president of the world Psychiatric Association the Royal

cultural and social aspects of mental health including Social Anthropology and community psychiatry and history of medicine and policymaking his interest has led to research and publication of more than 450 articles in national and international journals of repute he has authored more than 40 books which have been translated into various languages including Japanese and Chinese in 2019 he was awarded the book of the year for his textbook of public mental health for his research and work he has been the recipient of many honorable which include the coveted commander of British Empire in 2012 the Lifetime Achievement Award from the AFP a the honoris causa from National University of Paraguay and the prestigious presidential medal from the president of Indian psychiatric society I would now like to invite dr. professor Dogra to deliver his speech on mental health of the underprivileged during over 90 you right while their slides are loading [Music] okay can everybody see that yes sir okay and right it's a great privilege to be sharing the platform with stalwarts of Psychiatry particularly need sort of global pandemic and I think it is absolutely critical that we learn from each other and we have a global response rather than each country are thinking as if the virus knows our walls and nose needs visas across countries I am what I'm going to do is right bear with me I'm gonna sort of present some findings from a major report at a public health England had done on underprivileged populations in the UK and you may have seen the headlines that South Asians are much more likely to have died from kovat are both as members of the National Health Service and the frontline staff but also I in the general population and just to remind us that underprivileged populations generally mean women children elderly minority racial groups I think minorities LGBT populations people those who are poor unemployed living in overcrowded conditions and I think the challenge does remain about definitions and heterogeneity of groups I'm going to focus on race gender and poverty I haven't got data on LGBT populations I'm not going to be covering that but again I'm not going to define race and ethnicity I think people are aware of that and I am so it's basically the things that we need to be bearing in mind that racial groups are not genetically discrete often they're not reliably measured and certainly they are not scientifically very meaningful but these and feed into racism and particularly in you would have been aware of the tragic murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and subsequent campaign around the globe on black lives matter and it is also worth bearing in mind that there is a difference between race and culture and they carry different meanings and we have known for a very long time certainly since the 1960s that the rates of various aquatic disorders are higher in some black Asian minority ethnic groups we know that schizophrenia is much higher in African Caribbeans depression is much higher in South Asian as a deliberate self-harm and particularly Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations in the UK have shown much higher rates of depression and in the minority ethnic groups there is also a challenge that we do not know enough about East European groups and these variations have been attributed to a number of factors such as genetic and dabney in it I'm but 30 years ago there was a theory that it is all about winter birds then it was about frederik complications are particularly among african Caribbeans and there have been studies which have argued that there are social and psychological factors whether these are related to structural racism or not but what that has meant is that quite often this leads to misdiagnosis over diagnosis culture conflict etc and we know that the help-seeking is delayed in many ethnic groups because they they are not aware of what where to go what to do they may have very different models of explanation of their distress so they may seek help elsewhere in in the UK certainly till a few years ago every summer there would be Hakeem's and words coming from India to our places where there are large South Asian populations I had say it's a very different issue related to help seeking and we know that South Asian populations particularly have much higher rates of diabetes mellitus of hypertension high levels of obesity and other chronic physical illnesses such as osteoarthritis arthritis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mean I know it you know black lives matters campaign has shown that there is a challenge in terms of structural racism in the society and it is quite evident that even when within the lockdown quite often black drivers or people of color who were out were much more likely to have been stopped by the police and we know that from the National Health Service that they're less likely to be listened to for whistleblowing and they're more likely to be low paid out frontline and care home staff particularly from the Philippines and East European and they have had more problems in accessing personal products equipment just to illustrate that the deaths rates due to co-ed among Asian the nation British have been 1.5 times those of white population I'm among blacks they've been 1.7 a mixed ethnicity in 1.6 and others non-white is 1.3 and risk of dying following a positive test is two times higher for the Bangladeshi group one point four times for the Pakistani group and one point three times higher for the Chinese group and these findings are from the public health England report and as I said that they've been consistently higher rates for other ethnic groups sometimes almost equal as in other Asian or in odd Black Caribbean particularly risk of dying well which is higher for the Indian group but if you have diabetes type one and your hba1c is equal to or less than 58 millimoles in the previous year your risk of dying is twice I but if it is more than 58 then it goes up to our nearly three times and similar differences in diabetes type two and interestingly there's been a scale where they have looked at the what they describe as Cove adage which summarizes vulnerability for combination of risk factors and they may each risk factor and because women are generally said to be more protected by their Cove adage is lower I for example healthy white women aged 40 will have a ecovillage of 32 I whereas white man aged 45 with BMI of 36 and severe asthma will have a cove at age of 45 five years for BMI 36 and four years for severe asthma therefore giving an overall age of 54 and in Asian women age 50 with diabetes type 2 to H be aired a1c over 58 has covered age of 50 minus 8 because she's a woman plus 5 plus 10 so her kovat ages 57 so added years of age for Asians or Asian British are four years for blacks is six I for mixed ethnicity is five and four others non-white is three so you can see the moderately there's a moderately robust or provisional evidence for that so similarly due to BMI if your BMI is between thirty to thirty four point nine it adds four years to your life are between thirty five and thirty nine point nine it adds five years and if it's over forty it adds ten years and similarly the moderately robust data and diabetes type one adds years to your covert life similarly with other chronic conditions heart failure add its chances of dying of cobra two point three times are years added nine similarly in cerebral vascular disease and the evidence for these is moderately robust and it is again I mean if you look at organ transplant if you had an organ transplant then your chances of dying from kovat is four point three times higher and it adds sixteen years to your covert life so again I'm not going to go through that but it's consistent the findings released by public health England about two weeks ago suggest that risk of dying following testing positive I seventy times higher in people eighty years or older than those under forty higher in males higher in those living in more deprived areas and in a black Asian and minority ethnic groups even when it's just adjusted for age sex deprivation etc say ethnicity and income inequality are independently associated with covert 19 mortality and as Lakshmi's already mentioned I'm not gonna go through that but it's also worth bearing in mind that BMI populations in the UK I work in occupations which place them at increased exposure as I said the got a lot of them had been working in social care homes a lot of them had been at front-line NHS staff but also driving buses there was a rather tragic incidence of a bus driver who had been spat on by somebody who had co-ed dying off a covert subsequently and BMA individuals use public transport to travel to work and there are I mean obviously long-standing inequalities at public health England did a survey qualitative survey with about 4,000 are qualitative interviews looking at the risk to exposure and risk of complications they are dying from Ovid 19 and it is important sort of recognize that minority populations and underprivileged groups also have much more eye issues related to diet for that smoking infectious diseases at etcetera although women are less likely be infected or develop co-head i but there's clear evidence that violence against women and girls has increased exponentially and over two hundred forty three million women and girls have been subjected to sexual and physical violence in the previous 12 months this is general intimate partner violence and there's been increase in france for example by 30 percent since the lockdown in argentina by 25 percent similar figures in Cyprus Singapore Canada Germany I'm and UK there's been a rise of domestic violence with increased demands for emergency shelters and it is also that women quite often are in insecure jobs so they're losing their jobs and economic pressures create additional problems and we know from previous outbreaks that Wilde's once the epidemic pandemic is over men's economic activity may return to pre-crisis levels but impact on women's economic security tends to last much longer so the global recession that will occur is likely to contribute to a dip in women's income and unpaid care work and pushing more women into poverty so the key messages are that we need to be aware of a long-standing impact of social and economic inequalities and pandemic has just brought this to the forefront underprivileged groups are more likely to be as exposed to risk I have higher risk of complications and this may be related to issues to stigma discrimination or racism lack of trust etc so just to conclude that in underprivileged groups are suffered more disproportionately they also have higher levels of comorbidities and what we need to be looking at is both sort of structural changes this is not a band amic which is affecting countries in isolation this is a global issue which needs global solutions and global work to get to the next stage I had once again thank you very much for inviting me and thanks very much for listening happy to take questions thank you sir for highlighting the mental health concerns of the vulnerable sections of our society I request dr. in a very pursuit there to introduce us to our third speaker Thank You Monica it is my privilege to introduce to you our next speaker professor bien Ganga who is the senior professor of psychiatry and the current director of Nam hands he

yeah I miss ladies visible yes sir yeah oh thanks redeemer for making a wonderful team to share our observations on concerns rate mental health during Kovach what I will share in the coming may be introduced so would be work related to how we face the challenges of managing mental health in enhance and also in the country at large what are the contributions that we made and how it has shown results essentially we see this challenges from the kovat scenario and we had the opportunities we had we converted them into opportunities and this is precisely what I am going to share this is something that I'll be presenting as a representative from the entire mental health division of NIMH hands there are several people who contributed to this starting from the psychiatry is ecology is social work in the health education and nursing so many people contributed to this this is what I am going to be presenting as a summary of what we did in clinical services what we contributed from the community mental health services dr. Moniz acts has been the person who laid the foundation community mental health services way back almost three decades ago sorry you're going to witness all the developments that we're going to be seeing here before I continue with my talk I got a message from secretary she may probably be leaving at any time commitments both the secretary and Schmidty pitty Susan and our Omega do I sell any llamas Sharon you believing any moment halfway through they said they have another appointment to meet given the cold places all over the country it's well expected thank you madam thank you near emoji for being there thank both of you for giving an inspiring introduction and raising of us madam exit I'll continue it may talk later of course miss you the later part of personal answers though so then coming back to my talk legal services ready Midland services we did several training and capacity building throughout the country and we produced many information education communication brochures flights etcetera I'll come to the tip later coming to clinical services what we did there are the areas where we contributed one of them was which is the brainchild of Fatima a continuum of care we closed down the outpatient services once the lockdown was announced in March in the patch we knew that people wouldn't have facilities to travel and also OPD crowds used to be very huge and social distance would be a myth and put together we thought it's a good idea to approach the outpatient services government also gave an advisory that people should utilize hospitals largely for emergency services so we closed the outpatient but have a concern for our patients in scattery made us go back to their case files in all places where the cell phone number was registered we made them call them updated them getting a consultation and where possible we also listened with the district mental health program in Attica and also the Bangalore Metropolitan hospitals where these people can be sent to receive their medicines we're required or consultations near their house through these services apart from this the telemedicine services I must say regarding telemedicine the very timely intervention by the Medical Council of India who gave the telemedicine guidelines a-a-a Dennis was made and order was made in so telemedicine became a very legitimate business in our clinical practice so following that demands also produced the telemedicine guidelines for mental health therapists in particular and thanks to the telemedicine group enhance and also the Indian saccadic Society the National body together this thing was released and so far mental healthcare telemedicine is now a legitimate activity so we allowed face-to-face interviews in this telemedicine services also generated electronic prescription we had some challenges here again thanks to Kovac we could push this issue of letting them prescribed benzodiazepines we allowed one been the recipient will prescribe to the telemedicine services another pump a lot of people during before with anxiety disorder fluids if I'm also helped many second urologist they were using this for describing to patients with epilepsy and we also were able to introduce methylphenidate which was again a useful medicine in patients with resort we had this opportunity to introduce the interactive voice response system for people to telephone take an appointment and then come something that we would never have imagined before this Cove it started this was a challenge that people will come directly and wait in the queues crowding to overcome this we introduced this it was an opportunity to convert outpatient services to an extent possible using a VRS although we still have to saturate this process and so make everybody use this service there these changes led to closer to about 20,000 of those 15,000 phone calls was a few a week backs a number they have made almost 20,000 phone calls a pitch close to a word thousand eight hundred people benefited from critics as you know that a lot of people would get follow-up prescriptions as free dispensation at the demands counters the opening was closed and thanks to the dmhp and the bangalore metropolitan hospitals we were able to deliver his medicines to the bangalore centers level centers cooperated with us and close to about 30 districts all the states helped us guess we asked them to go to their nearest center the district gave us the medicines from the district mental health program stocks we were able to give a telemedicine services to 150 consultations the interactive voice response system although we had some hiccups in to start with but stoon he picked up and close to about 1800 people called up and obtained appointments these changes in addition to that openiy was transformed we in the period of kovat we knew that the lockdown would be lifted and we would get back our crowd thanks to the hospital administration which made larger waiting halls outside the building of the outpatient and also decluttered the outpatients waiting halls to be able to make people sit in a more distant way to give a lot of space between them together the work efficiency and the comfort levels in the outpatient largely increased and we had done it during the period of lockdown and thanks to all this preparation following the lockdown when we lifted the outpatient closure we also have got the outpatient activity back the functioning was lost muda the community mental health team did the wonderful job in this period one of the activities was looking at the concerns of travelers who were quarantine but clearly those who are air travelers who are wanting that one Isaac was mentioned for two weeks I don't know whether he was going to accept what observations that I have had here from our colleagues quarantine people so the quarantine people were spoken to and Zaman services were offered for counseling thanks to the cannot occur health department's mental health team which actually worked with us so what we had we had sources of distress boredom social isolation concerns about their job they're getting salaries fear of infection what if the test results would be positive concerns of spreading infection to the family members largely of course stigma so these are the symptoms which let me also mention close to about twenty percent of them have anxiety depression symptoms sleep symptoms and even suicidal ideations were in this population 1,600 phone calls were made to these people number quarantine these questions we had this data analyzed as you might have read in the newspapers and other media concerns about migrant workers doing the lockdown period was enormous thanks to several health departments or state and central administrative bodies the handled immigrant workers concerns quite well nonetheless places where migrant workers were camp we had an opportunity to meet them educate them present some posters explain to them about the illness not to have concern but to be careful and these things led us to develop a small video clipping and also a advisory as to how we need to work with this mental health services we had help from the vendor metropolitan group who had their Health Survey health workers come along with us in the part of Education and facilitating these things we had about 5,000 odd migrants assists and we visited as many as about hundred and forty sites where migrants were located some even in demands campus migrant workers were doing a huge construction construction had starved the conductor had to hold all activities and their concerns also examine they the team people had pre-existing mental illness severe nature new onset mental illness in about five people we referred about fifteen of them to different hospitals our management they had to flag the several concerns uncertainty about how long would this lockdown gone wanted to go back to their families fear of being abandoned by their employers and if needed some of them were carrying the many some of the human who were pregnant and they were concerned what would happen substance uses related desire issues also of concerned what if I am NOT going to get alcohol in the next today's travel I've had this fire problem so these are the concern that they express and thanks to the community mental health team and also the Connecticut state government helped the department which made this highlighted and all other workers who went on to now work with the migrant workers that took this survey shion's and health subjects by appropriate counseling we also launched a helpline the moment the lockdown started we anticipated a disaster like situation and people would be very concerned public both those who are infected and those who are not infected would have lot of concerns so we set up a helpline a toll-free helpline for people to see my counseling thanks to the Ministry of Health they said this should be a and national activity so they requested us to engage as many mental health professionals as possible all over the country and this was possible thanks to the dental instead of psychiatry and also the pageboy Institute of Psychiatry they participated and also in many states people came forward as many as 14 natural languages from 16 different states but 250 plus mental health professionals were able to give a helping hand we were available the lines could go to them three lakh calls came and close to over 50,000 calls were related to mental health services again thanks to the secretary health we were asked to also dedicate a separate line for helping the health care workers and their mental health concerns and to these people hire highly trained professionals from mental health from the Department of Social Work ecology as Kadri from NIMH hands were available to help them I do not have the exact number of people who sought help for mental health conditions from the group of the healthcare providers not just the co-ed warriors but many other groups of people we did several their stress related concerns clinical psychology is a cat of social work so we had close to 30,000 people benefiting from this I am just making a list of activities that the dependents a character has then the sites will be available I'm not going to details of these things we trained psychiatrists in many states we also try and lay counselors we find obstetricians for concerns related to postpartum or newly prenatally area period and the mothers had questions like and I feed my child if I develop COBIT consider that so we're also trying to allay their concern just a little practitioners address we also trained psychiatrists using a CME program on how to use telemedicine in psychiatry this is a list that we did through this telemedicine services and we also have a very very vibrant demands digital Academy which also jumped into the fray making this training to several groups of people on just mental health substance abuse disorders and the Health University of cannot occur rather than the health University actually participated with us in feigning many people on issues related to mental health and other directly Public Health importance in Fouad they used our platform of images like Adam II to Train physicians nurses health workers all over the state the general since Academy also has blend into this the National Commission for protection of child rights realized that child abuse was a concern and a large project has been given to the shaker she surely is reading this project and this is now going to address these concerns of children whether co-ed are no covet I'm sure this cuz this program will be very helpful the Department of Clinical Psychology needs some unique activities how to train psychologists very efficient in terms of telephone counseling so they did a training program for people psychologists to avoid a 10-15 number they also set up a portal on which people can discuss mental health concerns share questions get some answers answers are usually written by a clinical psychologist a psychiatrist who would put the appropriate answer many questions were common and close to a 150 questions for which answers have been generated as many as about 35 answers which are common to these questions have been generated on this portal the depowered a psychotic social work which also hits the Center for disaster management and psychosocial support again did the several programs of our law police officers and many college teachers and school teachers and these were very well received and many teachers participated in many felicitous program and in fact the canonical government for the bangalore city police have asked us to conduct some programs how to manage stress during the covetous situation and this again has received lot of interest lastly before I conclude we produced four stuff information education communication materials pamphlets videos posters newspaper articles as many as about hundred you stupid articles came from the group of behavioral sciences scatter psychology social active on me leave topics available to Covidien Minton online blocks the publication send you publications also came to publications have committed period summers later some as opinion papers and summer data papers we also produce some short messaging services small statements or advisories which will boy SMS as part of general public awareness thanks to the health department many of these they also reviewed did some baking and a host of them are already on the Government of India health department's we have said this is something that we will all post or having contributed to the national activity in mitigating mental health fair stress mental health complications are comorbidity in Kovac firstly while we were doing many of these activities we thought from week to week we made compile all activities and published 12 issues have come the last issue was released a month later now the frequency of releasing these bulletins is once in four weeks and this has attracted a lot of people as many as 12 pages of this and 12 issues having come compels all the work that we have done of course month to month we are going to be updating this work as well so I think I will stop here I must thank not just one department but all the departments there are many groups which are working particularly the medical super ends present and the past medical super end who contributed enormously in developing these activities the Health Education Department which made all the education material and other academic departments which participated in many of these training programs I must thank all of them and of course thanks also to the mystery which was continuously motivating us demands which made us produce all these activities we recently completed a manual of how to address mental health concerns in mental hospitals other establishments and psychiatric patients in general during the whole period when they're infected and they're not infected other challenges like hospitals being closed off it is being closed in some places and people who are homeless mentally ill who are entering in all these situations how kovat concerns can also be at risk and curve in individuals mental health concerns can be addressed a manual has been released a few weeks earlier we also released a manual on mental health concerns in those or healthcare workers how do we address them how to manual eyes the whole services for them these are the activities that we have done I thank again the man team for letting me over here I as the director of demands I also thank all the esteemed speakers for coming I may

how many actually viewed the live YouTube thanks once again I lived with the organizers to take the makeup thank you sir for this engaging talk on how technology is assisted in continuity of care for our patients in psychiatry and measures taken to manage the new onset symptoms I now request dr. Pavitra to introduce us to our fourth speaker it's my privilege and pleasure to introduce the future moving key attack he is a former professor and head of department of psychiatry at newman's he is a past president of the Maricopa stroll Association in Bangalore and the Society for community health awareness research in action India is currently working as professor in school of psychiatry and clinical neurosciences University of Western Australia his areas of interest include community mental health public health 25 the Nordic population epidemiology suicide psychopathology and summit reform disorders he has served as consultant and advisor with World Health Organization in numerous occasions he has got more than 175 publications in both national and international journals he has been awarded deal in Moorthy long duration award of the Indian society Society now I invite ruff is a moment Eliza to deliver his talk on practicing psychiatry post pandemic for that very kind introduction it was delighted I was really delighted to hear certain presentation about the contributions of Newman's earlier of course I listen to hell secondly saying that the anyone demands for the major you know contributions in the field of mental health even not only now but in the months and years to come Oh in a short period I think you have given tremendous leadership to a lot of activities by various people in different departments and as an old student I'm the old Faculty of the man's I'm indeed proud to hear all these contributions now let me begin my presentation okay so I want to express my gratitude to the men's organizers for organizing this kind of a faculty for the first time more importantly I want to thank them because now begin the key organizer asked me to talk about what happens after things like that the enemy this gives gave me an opportunity for some future gazing and that is what I hope to do with all the participants who are now logged in here are your men you may expect relations you could be right you can of course based on a lot of information that you can you have already you can mix regulations you've already heard from secretary during her inaugural speech she said that these psychosocial problems are invisible they are already there but she already made a prediction they are going to stay with us for a very very long time now lunch mean his presentation said that you know we don't know yet how the end week is worldly still in the midst of it it mentioned think of it for example today in India we covered a major milestone we covered 1 million cases first it was a gradual increase in the past few days it has been in the United States which is you know one of the richest country which pens for healthcare in terms of proportion of GDP one of the highest in the world about 16 17 percent of the GDP and also created a record today for the total number of infections per day it crossed 77204 are still in the midst of the economy and you talk about post handily you can only future case and make speculations and that is what I am going to do but I do this raised numerous questions I'm trying to answer them as I go along I promise you I will not take it's because it should be some time for discussion and of course we are who are waiting to listen to dr. casement who is already written out to research and he has excellent ideas about what side so I would I am stopped in about 10 to 12 minutes so psychiatry has withered lot of upheavals even if you look at the last one century you had major problems you know he's this pandemic the most disruptive I think there is a very wide belief that this has been the most expected in fact Henry nusrah is written that this is the cataclysmic event which has changed in the world so I would think that it is a pandemic that has become in the most destructive and probably it is going to change society forever in fact they let me it he said house Italy in Canada how it is a pandemic a much needed a call for psychiatry the optimist in me made me think that ok you know this is a very good bed because fault lines which have been there not postman to make but pre-pandemic and make period and portability various fault lines so I could think that we all of us or organizations or mental health proteins should consider this as a way to fight for psychiatric in these lessons from the past what does post pandemic mean I've already mentioned that we still don't know but they came from past I'll give you some indications about and we can refer to a post pandemic period how do we know about the pandemic or do we know that the enemy is is over I think we are far away from that point so we don't have to breathe for claims in practice of psychiatry I'll tell you that okay any lessons from the past what has been widely talked about is a Spanish flu more than 500 million infections five million deaths but what is important is so we are still in the although it that this is likely in the beginning of psychiatry and how psychiatry has phased all these deceptions we'll know very much world was but of course the deinstitutionalization woman we saw tens and thousands of people be charged from mental hospitals in the United States in UK etc and the problems which that cause which we are even now facing after 30 40 years people are talking about even now end up on that old war laugh of the Soviet Army so he doing bellezza Paul ISM suicide rates when top physical has deteriorated so we know that these kinds of nature of people can have disastrous consequences not only on health let me move on to the next one what are the fault lines at Table four I don't have to highlight since I talked about psychiatry post handling I think we should look into the major fault lines that we have still not been able to deal with effectively all over the world a huge pigment gap across the world I would say across the world you can please if you look at research data you find that it is only a difference in the degree of the hugeness or the whiteness of the treatment comes in countries of Asia such as India other places it is huge but even in countries such as the United States I mean of course Canada and Australia may be partially exception to this huge statement yeah grossly inadequate resources not only financial but also human resources the continuing universes if you want the health secretary referred to in Earth's speech these are all fault lines that we need to be aware of as we playing for the post pandemic area shamefulness even in the rich countries sources this has been a big problem why because recently I read Alan France is saying that tens of thousands of people with severe mental illnesses are dying in the United States because of the cooperate if you listen to DNA is talking about ethnicity they you know long-standing economic situation which have all been you know population as well as people who suffer from the neglect of disadvantaged populations the rural populations are vulnerable the economic and social policies which are promoted in equally an innovative policy I would I'm very confident to say that all over the world is in the last 20 years or so the economic and social policies have only contributed to increasing iniquities and inequalities tribulus energy of the number of psychiatric beds where people with mental disorders have been you know in the next slide I show you that Mentalist homeless mentally ill large number of people in jails in United States and many other places with the diagnosis of mental illness brains trans institutionalization all these have to be kept in mind as we the point I am making is that LT talk about psychotic practice post endemic we should be aware of the large fault lines which we are not being able to effectively deal with this is a full tutorial famous book about psychosis he recently less than six months ago in October the keynote address at the American Psychiatric Association of Institute of psychiatric services conference he said rarely have so many real meaning people in so wronged my generation made major mistakes in emptying the state hospitals without thinking about how to treat the seriously mentally ill in the community is up to the next generation to solve this problem only highlighting these so that we are aware of these issues as we plan for psychiatry and mental health care post pandemic this I am you know the problem of long-standing inequality iniquities socially economically and the consequences on mental health has been highlighted by English in many of his slides but I would both of you who want to know more about it it's not as like a disease and economist Joseph Stiglitz who is a Nobel Prize winning economist who wrote several months several years ago race of inequality and there are sections in this book or to mental health consequences or social problems and I think the Kovach pandemic has only exposed these problems because in all countries including in India today there is a CNN report every since you report but out the poor but the 60% of poor people in India of the worst weeks in Saudi and we can be closed down etc people middle class upper middle class of course they have their homes they can sanitize they have so price of inequality people who want to know more about it the Oxford you know they have to tolerate it already but people who are interested in knowing how inequality how wide it is even in very advanced countries in building perhaps not instead you the initiated PA lancets I country talking about the futile psychiatry and I'm highlighting the Pauline that psychiatry is not all very good you need to be aware of all these fault lines before we move into the future of the things that mean you have to be concerned about I have already made this point that the pandemic is not perfectly we are already harnessing the potential of technology to provide more rescission in the digital mental health mental health care and how swiftly we have both virtual care I'm not really mentioned about that is something which we have to focus much more on while we consider this VD also acknowledge the fact that anthem which will be a part of sauce future people have already talked about how are we going to deal with future pandemics okay what are the major things that we need to deal with don't even refer to my previous speakers already they will actually talked about current rates of anxiety depression substance use it there is a huge increase in mental health problems there are already indications I mean the last three four weeks I mean in India of watching the news every day all of the country and also era which has been highly they are having a search and every day the number of suicides which are reported is an indication about the things to come a huge increase in mental as well as a metal has consequences of the economic downtown in fact a few days ago that the years after 2021 in be similar to the years after 1945 I think this was Bill Gates talking about future pandemics to send bodies so the enormous economic consequences we have a little taste of it about the prices in peace and Lee in Spain the suicide rates went up etcetera that would be something that we need to deal with on a positive side I think wider and increase she was the SAG that similar of late evening he's seen operated by the Union secretary in sings of the Ministry of has been family well said he's an important indication that the government of England is is also a mini retirement I know I was in Australia to see weeks ago in fact one of the few things there's two parties the two poles keep fighting all the time but one of the things on which was very unique agreement was funding for mental health almost a billion all over release for you know the telemedicine and things like that so will this be an example will increase funding in countries and a big I put three question marks because I don't know because please going a huge economic downturn funding for mental health to improve services probably is also positive now the the rapid that doing those delivered is because I'll raise some questions will become the form of a of you know connecting with the doctor you don't have travel you don't have to paid in the practice the outpatient room etcetera so maybe this will become a crucified mortal what you know for millennia the laning laying hands represented the essence of the doctor-patient relationship the human touch of the carer and coating was artificial intelligent much before they could it started in 2009 I'll show you so he talked about that so decent being physically apart a sense of menace and also psychics can remote care facilitate transfer of trust empathy and compassion I'm sure we will have many many more points for his research agenda and I will now it's a very interesting book it's called deep medicine how artificial intelligence and make you mean again of course this is mm thank you very much once again for officials back to Naveen thank you sir for highlighting the lessons to be learned from the past pandemics flagging the fault lines and challenges lying ahead of us I now request dr. Neha Kulkarni to introduce us to a final speaker dr. Mallika a last Speaker of the day professor Micelli case she won the Stanley Cup professor and head Department of Psychiatry Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Howard Medical School is the editor of schizophrenia research journal with his areas of interest including psychopathology Biological Psychiatry including anatomical and functional neuroimaging new recognition and neuro development genetics in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and many more who is one of the principal investigators of business project with more than eleven hundred and seventy publications in both national and international he's been the recipient of many honorable awards I invite professor my dedication to throw us a light on research in public psychiatry during pandemics I welcome you sir sorry I can buted myself do people hear me yourself first of all Thank You mayor for that introduction and also thank you for the organizers Naveen pratima and Gangadhar and others for making this wonderful event very timely event possible I know that we are running late into the event and I'll try to be brief and my job has been made easier by all my illustrious predecessors in this event and what I'm going to do is to point out the research directions that we should be as a global mental health community be pursuing in the years to come and the fact that the the Kovach pandemic has given us an unprecedented opportunity trying to move my slides here and this is not exactly moving okay yeah and so as I said Kovac 19 is a global stressor that has you know come upon mankind and we can be viewed as a natural experiment upon this world and during such a pandemic while we have several disastrous consequences that we are dealing with this may also be an opportunity for us to reflect upon the nature of this pandemic and what it might reveal to us about the mind and the brain and about the future practice of psychiatry altogether as bajas Oxford interestingly as this cartoon points out it was during a pandemic the Great Plague of London in the 17th century when there was a quarantine and Isaac Newton Sir Isaac Newton was essentially isolated that was the period during which he discovered the groundwork for his theories of calculus and the theories of gravity and motion so this may be the time when we are sitting at home but we have our minds and our data to look at and actually think about potential new solutions that we hadn't thought of before now Mohan also pointed about the importance of learning from our past it has been said wisely that those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat the consequences of the past repeat the mistakes of the past so we have to look at what has happened in previous pandemics and they one pandemic that is well known to everybody is the Spanish flu of 22,000 18 or 19 as well as many as 500 million were affected and about 50 million people died and the number of new hospitalizations for mental disorders increased by 7 fold over the 6 years after the pandemic which included depression anxiety in your senior neuropsychiatric complications including what became known as encephalitis lethargica the parkinsonian features they all emerged only years later so the what the main lesson for that is this is the time time to begin research and understand the nature of postcode neuropsychiatric disorders is now and it has to be started proactively and this is a slide actually short earlier on is a very insightful slide points out the fact that what we are still in the middle of is this first wave of the immediate mobility and mortality of covered 19 what we are beginning to see and what will become more problematic are the subsequent consequences of the resource restriction the economic declines the are the non Kovach conditions which were kind of not receiving treatment re-emerging back into the hospitals and the post ICU complications and so forth and also the trauma and the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic leading to psychiatric disorders it is these disorders that we have to anticipate and take proactive ways to understand and intervene I recently wrote a paper which in which I outlined a research agenda for a coed pandemic and the kinds of questions that can be framed as priorities so if you think of this as a major group of disorders we have to understand what are the risk factors as well as what are the resilience factors and the previous speakers have outlined the important factors such as medical comorbidity personality factors environmental factors such as smoking social distancing loneliness unemployment economic decline race underprivileged communities urban a city and air pollution we have to study these multifactorial origins of psychopathology and negative consequences of Corbett and also understand the presentations of these various psychosocial consequences that you will see or we are beginning to see either new onset horrid exacerbation of pre-existing anxiety depression psychosis obsessive-compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder Dinesh pointed out the importance of looking at intimate partner violence which we are already beginning to see a pattern of cognitive decline and dementia lakshmi pointed out social rhythms disturbance which may have an impact on mood disorders and so forth we are also beginning to see the world is changing around and developing quick solutions to healthcare resources delivery and approaches to care and we have to see how they are working are there alternative ways I should healthcare policies change and and Delly Stelly psychiatry and digital psychiatry which many of the previous papers have commented on is almost coming to the center stage at this point now in this slide I wanted to put together the the model of how we understand Cobie related neuropsychiatric complications one has to think of these as an epidemiological triangle with the host that is our own body and our own immune response the agent which is the virus of the left side and the environment all of these factors interact to produce the consequences that we are beginning to see and are those include all of those that I mentioned before social economic demographic and pre-existing illness related factors as well as access to care medication and heterogenic effects medical comorbidity and even genetic risk all of these will have to be considered in our understanding of the nature and evolution of psychopathology and we know that the these illnesses have a time course there is an acute infection many people thankfully recover without symptoms and some who have symptoms may have mild symptoms and thankfully a small proportion which varies from country to country maybe around 5% and global average develop an acute severe inflammatory response due to what is called a site of and storm and that may lead to its own delayed neuropsychiatric consequences like delirium and cognitive declines and may be followed by several downstream psychosocial consequences an important question that has to be understood prospectively is whether conditions that cause an ongoing chronic inflammation due to pre-existing medical illnesses like obesity autoimmune disease or pritus diabetes hypertension depression do they all predispose to a higher chance of developing cytokine storms and do they also predispose to higher chance of subsequent neuropsychiatric sequere now this is a cartoon which is also circulating around which is very insightful if you carefully look at this there is the now acute wave and which tend to flattened by a strong collective response which is the best case scenario but if this strong collective response by the community and the public health care systems are inadequate and are short-lived that would lead to a subsequent search again of both of the Cova Dwyers as well as of the mental health consequences so one has to have develop a response both at a community level and at a healthcare system level a you know adequate and consistent collective response which is not only comprehensive to begin with but also sustained in the longer run so that is the key point that requires national and local level leadership and it was very I was proud to hear the others presentation of how Anna mance is taking a lead for the country and perhaps for the world on developing a collective response in that way there are many things that are beginning to change it has been commented by previous speakers about the rapid shift that is happening to telehealth you know in my own system in Boston we have seen that almost 90% by now of outpatient care has been switched to telehealth and even inpatient settings we are walking around with iPads and I'm sitting in the central room and having tele consultation with the patient sitting in their wardrobes and so forth and simply the same thing is happening with consultation liaison settings as well so what are the strategies for developing a research plan and a research agenda there are many ways in which data can be harnessed for benefit in understanding Cobie related mental health consequences one could use existing health records like electronic health records are available which can allow linking between mental health medical and community health services to identify patterns and trends both in clinical populations as well as in individuals with suspected or existing coverage 19 it's also useful to capitalise on existing cohorts of already well characterized populations like the UK biobank is one good example large numbers thousands of people whose clinical characteristics as well as biological specimens have been characterized the same thing with many large studies like we snip and in a mass like a DBS and so forth and such platforms might allow might also have recruitment platforms which will allow these individuals to be brought back and if they have been exposed to Cove it how do they respond and can we learn anything about their baseline characteristics about who does or does not have negative consequences also it's important to initiate population studies in vulnerable populations like children frontline health care staff people who have survived severe cough in nineteen and so forth for example we are in in my own Hospital in Boston we are beginning to start a co-ed clinic for people who have been discharged from intense intensive care units and we will be prospectively following them up to understand what what's going to happen over the next few months or years what are the principles of good research practice first of all one needs to conduct both hypothesis-driven as well as hypothesis-generating research the hypothesis-generating research will involve selection of large scale agnostic data that uh that are obtained in a you know in a way that could be that could lend itself to measurement based care study designs need to be rigorous ethical and would need to consider general population as well as vulnerable populations when we say measurement based care we not only provide care for patients but also we measure what we are providing the care we are providing and also the responses and there the psychological and physiological changes over the course of time using biomarkers and so forth we also need to involve multiple stakeholders patients those with lived experience the public the policymakers and so forth the research has to be interdisciplinary and what can God there outlined was a great example of collaborations between disciplines such as psychology psychiatry epidemiology neurology neuroscience and so forth data need to be harmonized and methods need to be harmonized across multiple settings and also international collaborations the more the data the better the answers will be and so collaborations are already emerging internationally of consortium that are beginning to collect data in a uniform kind of way now one idea that I want to throw out here I'm sure somebody is already doing it but I think the mass could take a lead on something like this and the one testable hypothesis is if you look at all the medical conditions and the demographic conditions that are associated with the higher risk for post coverage consequences as well as the co-ed infections themselves these are things like obesity metabolic syndrome chronic medical disease diseases like arthritis sedentariness what is common among all of those one thing that is common among all of those is the is what is often termed the concept of hello static load Dinesh pointed out one other concept of kovat age and I would argue that kovat age may be related to the degree of accumulated stress in the body that you know that throws individuals homeostasis away in other words the body is thrown out of balance and what is it that can reverse this kind of imbalance it may be that exercise healthy diet good sleep yoga and meditation may move individuals towards the mode of the homeostatic balance institutions like them hands which have a world repute on an empirical study of lifestyle interventions like yoga too could take this as an opportunity and collect data on outcomes of people who are exposed to kovat as well as those who are not exposed to ghovat as well as those who have explained exposed and have had infections and other consequences to see whether pre-existing parameters of lifestyle can predict resilience towards negative consequences and also whether introductions of healthy lifestyle interventions could make a difference and of course for such research one needs a comprehensive systematic prospective a study that involves both psychosocial and biomarker based assessments of data that's that's a large-scale effort and you know it's very important that national organizations and international collaborative opportunities should be looked into for these kind of questions I think that's so biomarkers might include simple measures like c-reactive protein cortisol heart rate variability sleep quality and so forth so it take home points our Kovach 19 is a huge challenge to health and mental health everywhere kovat 19 is a natural experiment that offers an unprecedented opportunity for mental health research several important questions pertaining to causes presentations trajectories and treatments of mental illness can be addressed in the context of pandemic I would stop here to say when Mohan asked the question whether what's in future for us this may be an opportunity for psychiatry to bring the body and the mind together and also also to bring large-scale resources to address the mental health issues the the challenges that that he the fourth lines that Mohan pointed out a lot can be gained by embedding COBE related questions in the context of ongoing studies as well as new studies of vulnerable populations and as many of the previous speakers have also said he helped and digital health a rapidly assuming center stage and prospective proactive research is needed now so gathering actionable evidence while we continue to do what we can do to mitigate mitigate mental health consequences of covered nineteen leadership is critically needed more than ever and it is amazing to see how Lim hands is taking taking the lead here thank you thank you sir for enlightening us on the strategies that you could use to relate it to the mental health research I now request professor Matthew Vargas to moderate the question and answer session so thank you very much to all the five speakers who did an excellent job I think this webinar something that will be watched many times over in the next few years let me start by asking question to Kevin who just finished so Kevin in terms of research are you suggesting something like the worldwide solid I had to eat trial similar study for mental health and maybe it's something that since you already have some thoughts on it and maybe you and Lakshmi and the range from the Institute and maybe Mohan from Western Australia and enhance could think of a large very large sort of international study looking at this you know some nice research do you think that's a thought this one I think you read my mind Matthew absolutely I mean I don't know much about the Solidarity trial even though I have heard about it and you know if there is any way in which we can bring all the first who are interested in this important problem together it will be fantastic great I think it's something for both you and the other to think of Matthew can I just jump in an adequate point just mostly from the logistical perspective right I think I read a great idea but I guess one also needs to think about logistical challenges and the time it might take to cause something like that and and I think one of the things with the pandemic is it's unclear how this is going to a wall on how long it's going to last and and I think in BC we try to harmonize the harmonize the data so that we have a common database for all patients that have been affected with co19 and we spent really last two-and-a-half months trying to figure out all the processes and and during that period I would we've lost a lot of valuable time because most of the patients now have recovered at least from the acute phase so I think while the idea that patient meant mentioned is is a really good one and I think as we try it as we wait to implement that I think it shouldn't stop new Mahan's from taking the leadership and implementing that in India right away because I don't think you should be waiting for this to become a global effort because that might take quite a bit of time during which you know one might lose valuable amount of time so my suggestion is it's a great idea but let's start with NIMH hands because Newman's has shown an incredible amount of leadership in addressing this covert challenge Thank You Lakshmi for those comments and also suggestions and I think that's something that we need to really look at Mohan questions you you say learning from the past is important and learning from the Spanish flu and other disasters that we have had in the past do you think you you were positive in sense of saying that this might actually push us to us doing a lot of tele consultations and telehealth do you think telehealth will change will be the game changer in terms of reducing the treatment gap and do you think that in a in a world that was so far very unconnected do you think that this will actually improve social connections between people not just families and those but also our patients in ourselves okay let me just respond let me make first firstly two points telemedicine is not anything new 15 years but it was only for remotely located rural populations in Tina's population in fact I have myself done a review of the scarf telemedicine project into the port district which was funded by the trust him blah era under the sitting in scarf would review patients in Buda Co tape of the Kota is the least developed in so any medicine as being there but what is important to notice that from the time of it and any started how swiftly we have more to it not only in the advanced countries can gather told us about how that is being applied even in India so now the question is I mean that was some of the questions that I raised once the coffee settles on we don't know when you heard from Lakshmi also maybe two years later I think this too shall pass and they would be something for the normal game many people say that it will not be the normal that we have some here will be a new moment but what time will telemedicine be the preferred mode of consolidation my guess is that it will be no issue in has no set at ninety percent of all the consultations in most I also had misgivings concerns can you transmit the empathy concern to us as doctors we have always seen patients face to face etc so I think this will be the game changer this will be the main mode and there would be a lot of people not for essential services not for serious problems but for mild to moderate problems the anxiety is the patient it is other problems I think the digital actually method would be the mainstay and to give you an example social media and even in the number of people who are linked to social media whatsapp and all kinds of things you know it's numbers are rapidly increasing and success of all those providers service providers who provide social media is an indication that telemedicine would be an ideal it would be also processing thank you one another the this global pandemic which has come to India has actually pushed up the issue of health care in our country and I think all Healthcare is really being ramped up and also mental healthcare so the district mental health programs and and other people on the ground especially mental health professionals are really being pushed into the field do you think that this will actually push the district program and the health program of the country in a big way because we are talking about MBBS courses MD courses we are talking about fast-tracking things do you think this will be a game-changer as far as healthcare in India is concerned now but one it has alerted us about the importance of Public Health whether for the physical health our mental health i as a scat rest believe that public health should come in the 4th and we should move out of hospitals as much as possible and resources spent on the hospitals if a part of it is spent on the public health agenda we would probably be giving a better care to the population this is number one the other issue which I think I should give with Kevin this is a tremendous opportunity for research we should consider maybe initiating a large in the center collaborative study following a big cohort of population who has gotten infected and not that mean Oh a couple of years maybe more numbers of years be able to see what are the outcomes of these krama infection in terms of psychiatric morbidity mortality or any other developmental progressive phenomenon that we may see this is a very good opportunity risings we have now visiting professors from four different countries I think this is the right time to start a mighty central follow up quad to be able to unravel this question sure the in the people in the on these in this we will take up a big proposal on examining discussion and something that can I think get funded at this critical moment lineage there was a question for you thanks Denise for bringing this double or even triple whammy that the underprivileged are facing in terms of having more physical commodity not being able to afford health care and increase violence now there's a question somebody's asked it says how do institutions and hospitals look after the mental health care of the healthcare workers and also of the underprivileged what what strategies can we adopt I thanks very much Matthew I think before I answer the question can I just go back to the sort of elemental health question I think it's incredibly important that we don't jump on the bandwagon in that yesterday mental health changes the concept of care I spend some of my time with the Tavistock which is as you most people would know as history of psychoanalysis and certainly the older psychotherapists are complaining that they can't share showed display empathy whereas younger generation does not see that as a problem so I think we need to be looking at what do we mean by empathy and that in context of privacy and confidentiality is going to be the key whether tele mental health takes off or not the question about what we should be doing I think it's absolutely vital that the institutions look after their mental health and well-being of their staff and again in a series of surveys have shown that the rates of burnout among doctors and medical students freak Ovid I was something between 30 and 40 percent in some medical schools and 95 percent in some medical schools in Hong Kong for example so there are Chen's about what we need to do I think there are four levels of interventions each of us has to be responsible for looking after ourselves and looking after those around us whether it's at home or at work our teams team members institutions have a moral responsibility to look after its staff by making sure that access to occupational medicine occupational health is available readily easily and is well supported then there are but then a third level is more at a sort of regional or state level as to what organizations need to support each other because there are questions about confidentiality for example lemon in Bangalore if NIM hands staff are feeling under stressed how free are they in accessing services within them hands so should they be have some kind of mutual agreement with st. John's so they can go to st. John's and be from st. John's can come to them hands in a similar way and fourthly at the sort of national level Medical Council's have and nursing councils and you know equivalent bodies and other healthcare professionals have an ethical and moral duty to make sure that services are available and accessible I mean we found in a server in the UK that medical students generally do much better in seeking and getting help whereas junior doctors do very badly and we know that junior doctors and those who graduated our medical students within the first year of graduation are really stressed out and they find it very difficult to seek help so we need to be investing as a profession to make sure that services are accessible and readily available without stigma and if we cannot provide those services without stigma then we can't go around criticizing other people that they have stigma about mental illness I finish and I think that systemic perspective in terms of primary secondary and tertiary prevention is very important I think the search shows that it's really the system with large systemic interventions that are really useful if somebody has depression and anxiety the intervention interventions are less likely to help as opposed to actually preventing it from a very systems is to make larger institutional and national perspective one of the key things is that in a lot of surveys in couvade are showing anxiety and depression the question is are these kind of genuine appropriate responses or are these illnesses because if we create more demand for our services and we time delivered that that is gonna be a traditional right yeah so Lakshmi there's two three questions for you thank you very much for all that research that Canada has done on the covert situation especially the systemic responses from your British Columbia there are three questions one is how do we prevent suicide what a strategies to prevent suicide among the health care workers let's first question and the second one is on the effect of code on sexual health okay well let me start with the first question on that is I think the early identification of the mental health impact is the key I think because you know things don't change overnight with different line health care workers they're obviously constantly exposed to number of stressful factors related to providing care for people with with co19 and so what we had done within our system was to organize the the psychological first first aid so we assembled a group of experts within within our system and the team was readily available to provide help for anyone that needed help the access was the keys in other words you know didn't have to wait for several days before they could see someone so the help was available quite rapidly so that I think that was one of the things that was very helpful and the end the second thing I think is also access to the crisis lines that we had implemented in our system so they are again if someone a healthcare worker is concerned about seeing a team within the healthcare setting and there are concerns about privacy perhaps then they can call the crisis line and get get that support and then the third thing that we'd organised is working with the with the physicians organization within our our healthcare system we we set up a virtual mental health clinic so people that that have accessed the psychological debriefing or psychological supports if they didn't feel that their needs have been met with that kind of strategy and if the concerns are you know a bit more serious meaning that they've sort of moved on to having a a major depression or an anxiety disorder or psychosis or bipolar then there would be a rapid access to more formal psychiatric assessment and appropriate treatment interventions so I think the key is offering easy access or rapid access to to frontline health care workers and providing help earlier on I think is probably the best way to to address those suicidal thoughts and that leading into actual suicidal attempts and the second one was about the sexual health Matthew was there that's right yeah so so I think we so we have a member in our department whose expertise is in fact sexual health and she's actually been doing in number surveys to to understand the impact of endemic on sexual health and of course when the pandemic began the general impression is that you know people are spending a lot of time at home there are lots of time on their hands so you know there's going to be a significant increase in sexual activity there's a baby boom you know those kinds of things but what the preliminary data are suggests suggesting she hasn't analyzed the data in detail is yet but from what they've looked at in toss the preliminary analysis it's it's actually indicating that the sexual activity the pandemic for vast majority of people not for arm for master majority has actually gone down mainly because of stress and anxiety and those kinds of things but it's interestingly for a small proportion of people it has gone up and I think her hypothesis is that it's perhaps for this small group of people it's it's a way of coping so far as majority it leads to decrease in sexual desire the activity goes down but for small proportional people it's difficult and so it does go up thank his fees as you mentioned trauma in passing how would you conceptualize covert related trauma as being unique and what are the kinds of research questions we can explore in that area yeah so again you can look at the trauma from the individual that has been admitted to hospital with co19 you can also look at a trauma from the family members perspective or even from the frontline healthcare workers perspective so with the individual that has contracted Co it and has been in the hospital of course there's the issue of watching other people on the unit's going on ventilators going into coma you know on all the activity that goes with it and also the patient himself or herself going on the ventilator and the trauma on the fear associated with that and for healthcare workers you know I think if one watch to what's happened in in China particularly in the earlier days of this anti might come in you know one has heard a lot of horror stories and you can also imagine the trauma from from the religious perspective where they know that their loved ones are in the hospital but they can I even visit you know they have to see them through a glass window or things like that in terms of you know what are some of the research questions that can be addressed I think I self alluded to in my presentation you know a lot of the data that's come out so far is based on very poor methodological II based kinds of studies so we have some ideas but we don't really understand how this is going to be impacting I mean donación brought up the point about a lot of people endorsing anxiety and depression but is this sort of a normal response one might expect given the pandemic are you know are some of these people actually transitioning into the DSM and ICD disorder so we don't have firm answers Kazak and cage talked about this offering a natural experiment to study and I think well we know with this with this co19 virus is that it does have a significant impact on the immune system and we know that the main system alterations have been implicated in the needle biology of many of our psychiatric disorders so in a way this might present an opportunity to study how stress impacts you know glucocorticoid system the immune system at energix system and how those changes in those things interact with some of the predisposing factors and the resilience factors that might eventually determine who and developing for example whether it's PTSD our other type of anxiety disorder are our depressive disorder so in other words looking at those different types of cohorts and propensity matching looking at the exposure to some of these events and then perhaps collecting blood samples for some of those measures and doing a comprehensive clinical assessment to collect some of those data or later risk factors so that one can then begin to model how these factors interact that ultimately determines who ends up developing these these disorders so and I think given the number of cases that you're seeing in India I think you know and I agree with the case that this presents an amazing opportunity to answer many of the questions that we have we want to answer by about 25 minutes but I just couldn't let me because go without some discussion so I think I'll cover all the questions I don't know if there's anything from the Facebook shares the I wish made a comment about what we are doing for media people how we can use the media to come up with primary prevention in yeah it's a good question I just want to bring you to there's the audience that the mental health education department is holding a webinar tomorrow for media persons as to how their presentations on covertly could make a different impact more positive impact in individuals to be able to help them out of this crisis of mental health yeah I think there's one more question from Morley I'm not I think I've covered all of them about early interventions going out the window but I think that's morally can sort of probably talk to Lakshmi about that early intervention system I think I can go I'm gonna hand this over back to the organizers now in EMCO thanks a lot for letting me moderate this session thanks thanks very much and I think we should take some of these ideas forward thank you thank you all I request professor Naveen Kumar C to deliver the concluding remarks thank so Haruka and I I must say I think it's been a wonderful experience having all our senior professors you know coming in and connecting virtually for this excellent program we had had a feast academically touching upon various issues of kovaydin mental health actually I mean starting from the health secretary madam herself she talked about the importance of mental health and kovat and professor Adam go the the work that has gone on in Canada and of course dr parra speaking about the underprivileged population and professor ing talking about the initiatives that has been taken in diem hands and professor MK talking about practicing psychiatry post pandemic and of course the icing on the cake was the talk on research ideas can come up and how to take this forward and of course lot of ideas have come in and as proximity work is rightly put it some of these things need to be taken forward so I thank you very much one and all for having spared your precious time and spending time with us we are indeed privileged and hope to see you all thank you thanks

Ellen Welch a medical doctor who says we should be thinking about our health much more broadly dr. what kinds of things besides our physical health are important thank you for having me on today and yes that's correct when we talk about someone who is healthy we are talking about physical health but also mental health social well-being and other resources a person needs to live a full life that sounds like a lot more than just caring someone when they have a fever you're right health isn't just the absence of disease it also refers to a person's ability to bounce back from an illness or other challenges in life there are many factors that contribute to our mental and physical health some factors include a person's genetics their environment their relationships their education and their employment these all impact a person's ability to lead a healthy life so what can our viewers do to improve the kind of health you're talking about certainly eating a healthy diet and giving regular exercise is directed by a physician or keys to good health it is also important to have healthy coping skills when challenges come up in a job or a relationship having healthy social relationships can also contribute to a person's overall well-being including their mental health doctor help me understand that my stress was doing more than just impacting my physical health it was also starting to hurt my relationships affecting how I spent my free time and seemed to make me feel overwhelmed in fact learning that mental health is the way our thoughts feelings and behaviors affect our lives helped me realize I needed to address my ongoing stress as a health issue both physical and mental I talked about this with my doctor and he connected me with a therapist I still meet with my therapist from time to time in addition to the diet exercise and physical checkups for my doctor my therapist has helped me learn to manage my stress develop healthy relationships and a more positive attitude each and every day is filled with unique ups and downs but understanding the link between my physical and mental health has made a big difference in my ongoing recovery journey [Music] ,False,False,True,False

discussion today here at the hr leaders summit i am grateful for the opportunity to host this panel uh being a people leader myself my team's mental well-being is the top priority for me and so like many of you joining us uh having a chance to learn actionable tools to empower us to lead by example and promote mental uh well-being in the workplace from leaders in this field is definitely appreciated so let's start with the introductions now and maximise the time we have on this important topic firstly joining us today dr zoe fortune zoe is ceo of the city mental health alliance in hong kong which she helped establish in 2017 a researcher by background zoe has over 15 years experience in academic commercial and not-for-profit sectors with a focus on evaluation of mental health

good to see you and our final panelist is tsuki tawana as head of college and labor relations so he's has responsibility for the strategy and delivery of employee and labor relations relations initiatives across asia pacific she's based in hong kong and is passionate about creating an organizational culture and environment in which employees can excel welcome to the stage suki hi good afternoon everybody happy to be here great thank you all for taking the time to spend with us today uh for those of you in the audience who attended the earlier panel session about surviving and thriving how to lead your workplace through recovery mental well-being was actually a consistent consideration throughout the conversation and often they're considered contribution to the recommendations made by the panelists so with the greater understanding that mental wellbeing is at the center of our call being let's take the opportunity now to focus on this topic and how we can promote mental health and well-being in the workplace zoe my my first question is actually for you so research suggests loss of control and uncertainty negatively impacts employee mental health the actions companies have had to take to protect their employees through covert 19 including extended work from home requirements without foreseeable any dates have contributed to these feelings what recommendations can you share with leaders to combat this impact on their employees empowering them with confidence thank you um and it's really great to hear that the topic of mental health and well-being has actually really come to the fore and we know that for example the world health organization says that there is no health without mental health it is integral to everything that we do so it's really it's really great to hear that everyone's focusing on this so much and i think that you know there there has been so much um times of change it's been unsettling for many it's been very different experience throughout this whole covered process and many people have experienced it differently some people have had challenges in different ways and i think it's really important to understand that actually everyone's experience is a little bit different first of all and that could be you know some people have been isolated some people have been at home with five children trying to homeschool and work at the same time so we need to take those things into account and i think also earlier on today we're hearing a lot about leaders so let's just start with the leaders and it is about the leaders but i think it's also about important to recognize that there are roles and responsibilities at every level of an organization so we need to truly embed change um so that could be leaders it could be hr it could be junior staff and i think there are roles and responsibilities if we're going to create change across every organization then we need to empower people at every level of an organization to do that and it's about giving them the confidence and ability to do that so i think you know leading from the chop um senior leaders being conscious of those challenges being aware of the needs of staff you know it is about what we've heard about in terms of vulnerability being open being open to questions being able to communicate externally about what's going on but i think it's also about you know the way that we provide confidence and empower staff is to trust stuff you know if anything this experiment that the world's been in has shown that working from home can work for a lot of people some people it doesn't work but that we can trust stuff and we can empower staff and it is possible to allow people to have that flexibility where it allows so it's about giving people that confidence and that autonomy to work in the way that that's best for them within the realms of what's possible within a workplace but you know could there be policies that we can put in place to support different um groups of staff i think it's about communication so communication we've had a lot of perhaps but there's a you know there's a plethora of information out there right now but what we need to hear is a clear consistent message from senior management providing that reassurance as well we are as an organization um getting a lot of responses and an increase in requests requests for things like general mental health awareness but also i think requests for training like resilience and recognizing that actually this is about supporting staff to be a little bit more resilient providing that confidence what skills do people need to re-enter the workforce as well so it's about communication as well checking in with others um and that's not just you know regular meetings we've all been zoomed out during this time but i think it's also about those kind of water cooler moments those little interpersonal interactions and we know that we've got to know people on a different level we've seen inside of living rooms and kitchens and and met pets and children and all the rest of it but it's about using that as a mechanism to get to know our teams better get to know those around us better so we know what keeps them well in a mental health perspective and we know where their struggles are so that we can help support them through that as well and then i think the other things are ensuring that we put in place strategies to support good mental health you know and we know that there are things that call good mental health like exercise routine keeping in touch with others and so it's about ensuring that how do we create that healthy working environment that's how we create confidence in our staff as well things like identification of stress points how do we work together at every level of an organization to destigmatize mental health and ensure resources are made available and that people feel okay to reach out and use those resources whether that's training or whether that's other forms of communication and ensuring that we can support staff with good mental health and what they can do at the level of prevention to look after themselves as well these are the kind of things that are going to make people feel confident as they return to the workplace or as we enter a new normal or whatever a new normal looks like and recognizing that we need to provide that flexibility that autonomy and empower staff to be able to do that going forward yeah brilliant thank you zoe i think i i actually really appreciate your description of this experiment and uh and it's always interesting uh when we're talking about the new normal or the next normal because it seems like everyone has to be really flexible at this point in time especially to just take the next step or or find the next way that's going to work for them and obviously having that that understanding and and awareness of your own limitations or your own opportunity um is really important to consider at the same time fantastic um so rushing my next questions uh for you actually and and it ties back in nicely with a couple of the points that zoe was making so there there are many online resources available for leaders uh to learn more about strategies and tools they can use to drive employee well-being led decision-making in the workplace have you experienced an uplift in interest in these resources in recent months or weeks and what's your recommendation for leaders who are looking to take the first step in their own education oh yeah definitely katie i think govic crisis has also led to this urgency around this and leaders are seeing now firsthand how they need to be aware about well-being and how that impacts performance so we've seen a much more heightened activity across employees on our resources of well-being so in the top three resources which saw the biggest i also lead digital learning for unilever asia and and you know the biggest spike we saw was um you know well-being was one of the top three pathways where we tell people about you know things about how do you take care of your emotional health how do you take off care of others you know in your team or in your family so i would definitely say this has come of age and you know just yesterday i got off got off these series of calls where we're doing um just leadership sessions on wellbeing uh so i couldn't have imagined maybe a year back saying in 90 minutes dedicated for top 100 leaders of the country talking about well-being understanding how do you show yourself understanding how do you sort of um take care of your um you know focus and stress so this is definitely come of age and i think what has also helped is the overwhelming data uh around uh well-being and employees feeling not optimistic and that has made that leadership shift um i think to your second question i feel like in terms of what so see there are tons of resources online on resilience mindfulness which are all great places to start so uh how do you take your physical well-being mental well-being um uh you know as as zoe mentioned resilience so these are all great starting points and leaders can look through this material uh just a tip we have we have a clear resilience challenge going on which is a 14 day resilience challenge which is super simple it takes you 5 or 10 minutes to do each activity and do it over 14 days so you can go to instagram facebook anywhere on clear site do it at any point of time so that could be a good starting point just on the theory or a concept or you know experiencing that whole thing uh but at the end of it i do feel well being is very personal so i get energized by dancing and yoga and books somebody else might get energized by pottery and music so i think the number one thing i think i would say to leaders is if you want to educate yourself about well-being educate yourself about your own self and your own well-being right so what energizes you identify that and share that and when you share that and as we mentioned you don't have those check-ins well-being check-ins and as you share that and you listen from your team that'll give you a far better education about your own well-being and your team's well-being which is much more relevant to them um and of course the theories and the concepts help but i think that would be more critical as per my experience yeah you make a good point and and actually it's it's one of my favorite uh considerations i think although none of us have been able to travel for quite some time i think we all remember being on a plane and the attendance reminding us in case of emergency put your own mask on first before helping others because if you don't help yourself you won't be able to help others and you know and and this is actually a case of emergency you know that the situation we found ourselves in was a case of emergency so it's really important that everyone remembers to put their masks on first uh as as leaders in their in their companies and their businesses and so that they can help others thanks so much rashmi and actually i just noticed that uh there is a comment uh in the event chat uh from from nikki at glint who is saying that they have some survey results showing that managers are experiencing uh it burn out at a much higher rate than some of the individual contributors and zoe and and rashmi even suki from from your experience or the all the data you have available to you are you seeing that as well sorry can you go i was going to say actually it's interesting there's a high expectation of leaders in the current environment but i guess you also remember they they also need to take care of themselves so i definitely think just my anecdotal kind of information from across our organization across the region leaders are feeling that additional sense of responsibility and i'm really conscious that when i speak to them myself it's always reminding them to to russians point about looking after themselves because they're not going to be very um impactful for their team if they're also not in a good state themselves so yes without actual data anecdotally i would echo that um katie i'd like to just build on that see you we have to understand that because of kobe the relationship between manager employees is changing relationship between a manager and employee was earlier predicated on the fact that you come to work i see you i sort of supervise you and i in a sense there was a lot of control as a part of this relationship and now that relationship has pivoted to being not based on control but based on deliverables which is a good thing you know overall right because now the managers it's all dependent on deliverable and and that creates a certain uncertainty for the managers which which is much more than what it creates for the employee right um so the managers now have to be you know they're not sure how to deal with that change of relationships that does you know increase the issue with them and the other reason for this is that because everything which a manager does get amplified more so uh so for their every action it gets magnified so they also have to be more careful about how they come across how they do things so there's definitely more complexity in that sense so i would recommend that statement yeah great and zoe did you have some some data to support that as well yeah i was just going to say so i think we also need to remember that this is unprecedented right no one was prepared for this and so we are placing a lot of responsibility on our senior leaders on our staff on our managers on everyone and so i think it speaks to both of those points that actually we've got changed work patterns across the board and we are still expecting people to perform at a certain level we're expecting managers to manage that process at a certain level so actually you know uncertainty anxiety all of those emotions they are somewhat inevitable to a certain extent so i think we need to allow ourselves to to recognize that but also if we look at data so we did a survey and that was published last year and amongst employees in hong kong we found that some of the employees who are experiencing most levels of stress or showing symptoms that are related to stress and poor mental health were that middle management level so they weren't the most senior people in the organization and they weren't the most junior people in the organization and it was felt that some of the reasons for that were because they have a lot of pressures particularly at that age you might have family pressures you might have young children you might have healthy parents you might have financial concerns you might be managing up you might be managing down and so there's a lot of pressure it depends on life stages and things like that as well but i think it does speak to the fact that actually there is a um a lot of stress on a certain level and i think we also need to understand that this is an unprecedented time and we also need to get better at supporting our staff at every level and being able to reflect and understand that everyone needs support because i think people are putting in place resources for mental health as well our managers are checking in and saying and how are you doing but we also need to ensure that we look after them because if you are looking after other people you need to it can be hard on yourself as well so we need to ensure that we are supporting those people yeah definitely and and empowering them with the tools that they need to be able to answer you know the the requests for assistance from the teams that are approaching them absolutely for sure and so striking my my next question for you um a powerful concept for consideration is that culture is caught not taught i actually have that written up on on the wall in our office and unfortunately no one's there to see it right now but we're still living and breathing it as much as we can um how do you think organizations can create a culture with mental well-being at the core to empower all employees to excel yeah so i actually it's just kind of building on some of what we heard now is well just listening to to zoe and rakshmi i'm thinking um this whole environment has accelerated it's accelerated a lot of things including the relationships that leaders have with their team members what's going back to the expectations once you come to work you deliver um i show everybody's different but i show a level of engagement and interest with you but it need it can stop um and i think now people are probably the the highest the investment skill that we've been developing is the eq aspect really um so one of the things i think if to create that mental culture you actually need to mental wellness culture you need to take a step back and just look at your culture per se um so at american express for example we're very passionate about having a strong leadership culture where leaders are not just delivering results it's not just the what but the how as well and i think actually we talked earlier on about sort of looking at wellness in totality but the concept of diversity and inclusion and actually going from just diverse inclusion to actually psychological well-being um so i i'm as a colleague or as a team member i'm not going to speak up or feel safe if my previous relationship with the organization or my leader was different so i think those are some of the things that we now need to start thinking about because it goes down to trust basically so building that culture takes time um but i think one of the key tools that without any investment as such is really having the conversation and encouraging leaders to be transparent about their own emotions to ask the question i was chatting to elite the other day and was worried about her the team member and there's that sense of but i don't think i can intrude i don't think i can ask that question i was well actually at a time like this if the person is coming to you saying i need help that's permission to say can we have the conversation so if there ever was a time that you need to lean in now is that time so i think just simple things like um having a conversation being transparent showing your own vulnerability um are really critical and those small things build up to that sense of psychological well-being which then build to a different kind of culture and i think that's really critical as well as all the levers that we have basically having the tools and resources available the employee assistance program having medical support you know having a gym encouraging diet exercise but actually there's something more fundamental that you need to tackle as well as a tactical stuff as you do this yeah absolutely and i think one of the the things that uh our current circumstances have given us is actually a level playing field you know so so everyone is actually in the same situation um as one another so so the accessibility to to speak to each other human to human yeah you know uh is far greater than it has been in the past um and that actually leads back to what you know rashmi was saying before about those those tools and resources available because we are all going to have to be open-minded to saying okay i want to be able to help someone when they do come to me with that information or with with that um you know situation that they feel comfortable sharing um i've got to be able to be prepared to answer right yeah i also think it's really important to recognize our own limitations and so there is um and i've again and my role is across the region so as i talk to different countries it can be a tendency to try and fix things depending on the culture but actually sometimes with mental wellness you also need to bring the professionals in and recognize actually that as a leader you should be the first point of um identifying that there's an issue but you can't always solve it yourself and actually it's dangerous as well to become an expert but really bring in the experts that can really help because this is a long-term sustainability thing as well yeah we could see some new hr roles specifically in mental health coming into businesses yeah in the very near future uh which will be a great opportunity for everybody and look i i sorry go on so we're we're looking at something like that you know we're looking at something like a mass trainer like a first aid mental health first aider concept and uh it's it's amazing for companies to really welcome something like this uh because it is so important is so needed uh and you know i think it's it's good that people are now waking up we actually did that in our australian market as a pilot um when we got all of our leaders on a voluntary basis to do mental and wellness kind of triage so to speak and it was really really well received and i think it was a lot of it was around just giving people the confidence to start the conversation but also giving them the permission to not to solve it but to direct get the right support so i would definitely advocate and i think it's something i want to do across the other markets in asia as well i mean in our market in japan we and traditionally maybe a culture of people are a little bit more um introverted yeah not you know comfortable speaking up but the demands from our teams now and the realization that actually this is important it's really positive yeah it's so good just one comment on the philippines actually particularly because it's a culture where social support networks are really strong yes i would also advocate what i'm seeing is that because of that people don't feel as comfortable talking to their normal um their normal resources because they don't want to create more anxiety amongst family or amongst friends so i think again things like the employee assistance program it's just been mindful and not assumed that because culturally and other times people are very um they are resourceful this is again a time where people will need different things want um absolutely that so you're you're nodding as well did you want to contribute i i completely agree with with all of those points so for example i'm an instructor in mental health first aid as well and i think one thing and it is becoming increasingly common but i think one thing about it doesn't have to be that training program but something similar to that is it's about normalizing the conversation right it's about destigmatizing it's about normalizing it's about recognizing that one in four people experience mental ill health and you know if you're stressed then perhaps these are factors that might be related to some of those things but it's also about taking away the fear of that conversation so those kind of trainings give people that a little bit of skills and confidence to be able to speak to someone and know that actually they don't have to be a counselor but it's about being able to open that door open up the conversation and then be able to redirect to those other sources so that we can better use things like eap which is typically underused so that we can get better use of those resources by creating a culture where we feel open and able to talk about it and then we can best utilize all of these services across the organization because the other thing i think is about you know change takes time within culture of an organization but for example if you look at data from the uk we know that graduates are looking at employee well-being um within their recruitment and when they're choosing a company and selecting companies to work so you know it's it is about the human case but um and it's about the business case but maybe it's about making well-being and a good place to work the capital of how we want to recruit people and support those young people coming into the workplace so that they are not entering a workplace a fear but they you know this conversation is open and that's how we start to change culture and we start to create these environments where people feel safe and able to talk about this yeah fantastic and i'm conscious that we do only have a couple of minutes left but there's a question from esther in our chat um so i might just direct this one to to rush me and for your thoughts and before we have to wrap up um but esther's question is uh do you have any tips and or advice about taking care and promoting mental well-being in the hr team so the hr folks are also a significant subgroup that require attention while they're fired fighting in this new environment that speaks um of high level of onset uncertainty um great question thanks katie so i think hr has emerged as a frontline hero in the corporate setup because um i know i mean we don't compare to the real frontline heroes that are medical professionals but you know in the whole corporate setup so uh so they have been more uh hard uh hardly impacted in terms of you know the whole well-being bit and what we've seen work is you know uh one is the whole purpose so unilever is a very purpose-driven company and a lot of hr professionals we have like 50 000 people who discover their own purpose and how it connects to their work so i think reminding professionals in hr about their purpose and how this connects with their overall purpose you know most of them do believe in unlocking human potential taking care of people so reminding them how these hardships are actually connecting them to their purpose in the organization and their individual purpose and then inspiring them with stories you know on how their work is impacting people stories about how people are being able to continue how they how their efforts are helping business continuity and making sure we pull out those stories making sure we inspire them with that that has something which which has seen a positive uh you know impact and the other thing is like any other employee we need to take care of our hr folks as well so you know any anything that you do for the rest of the employee make sure you do it specifically well for hr because they are the people who are going to take care of those employees but i think it just boils down to energizing them about inspiring them the which bigger picture around this yeah that's that is a great tip thank you and so we actually have unfortunately come to the end of our time thank you very much again zoe rashford and suki uh i'm confident the insights and thoughts you've shared with us uh will support all of our leaders today with an opportunity to improve employee well-being in their workplaces um so thank you all and thank you everyone again for joining us and i hope you enjoy the rest of your day thank you thank you katie and panel right the last break of the day now if you're thinking about running off and not coming back then you are going to miss a fantastic session because at 3 30 we will be hearing from stephen

russelling for your kind uh introduction uh i i'm very much pleasured that you know i was given this opportunity to share with you about this topic and i'm sure many of you come from different background and when i reach see through the participants i notice quite a number of local people that perhaps no i'm not very familiar with bahasa sarawak too bad so it's so bad with me if i can present my things in english but i will try my best to to speak a little bit bahasa in between right after all i'm a sarah kian's uh i i should learn also and you know when i was working hospital cebu last time as a houseman i also learned a little bit of bahasa iban those very technical terms like you know [Music] all this thing right so uh really happy to share with you about this topic um and i see a very very good response from all of you because i i believe most of you understand mental health is getting more and more important in this era and is something that we have been neglecting for the past decades but now people are looking into it and that is actually a very very welcoming and very good rest uh very uh how to say to me is something very encouraging because uh you know in the past we think this is something like taboo we don't want to talk about it but now everyone is okay with it and then i see many of you are from machis babandaran that means our policymakers also look into it very seriously and that is actually a good sign at least for sarawak i think it's a good sign right so uh many of you already know that you know copyrighting this panda may actually affect us very badly i will talk about this later and then but i also want to focus on also the growth that we actually managed to have over these past almost one year right okay and if you have any questions at the end of the sessions we can share about uh i mean i will try to present this as soon as possible so that we can more times to interact with you and of course maybe we cannot address all the questions in at the end of sessions so uh if you have more questions you can you are welcome to email me uh later but we hope you can also share your your opinions your struggles here as well with other people and see how you actually cope throughout this session right and here i already thank sarawak development institute because you know uh conversations itself actually can change a life in the past we don't talk about it so when without talking about it we don't know how to address the problems now when we talk more about it we know what other problems is all around and then we can share our experience and we can share our struggles and when you have more people come together then you will have more solutions right so you are not alone definitely we are all survivor of this panda media and now let me bring you through the history of pandemic is something not so new but it sounds like very new to us right because what for the past one year we have been like on and off locking lockdown and then we have to lock ourselves in the at home also we can't go to shopping malls we can't go anyway and if you can see here since 17th century until now there are so many viruses ongoing over the globe so it's not something very new but it seems like we had not really well prepared for uh this pandemic yet so people need to learn from experience so looking back the history it actually helps us to learn how we can cope with it better so a big background of this pandemic it started in jupe province china in last december and when the ws are confirmed there is a noble corona virus uh causing these raspy tree illness because of the stigma people actually called uh is called it as a wuhan's pneumonia which is not so nice so in the end they suggested to use it uh to name it as a kovic 19 and now we are familiar with kobe 19 right and officially who declared it as a pandemic on the 11th march and not long after that we actually announced our lockdown as well so what about in malaysia it reached malaysia in late late january 2020 when uh china china tourists actually came in through johor singapore link at the time it still report the reporter case still remain low and mostly imported cases until localized clusters like the cluster in kuching very near to our home uh the the church cluster and then we also know that the public cluster that emerged in march and then it started to have the first wave of our uh localized clusters then on 18 march to 3rd of may a nationwide movement control order was uh was initiated by our government to mitigate the outbreak and very very fast after about six seven weeks then we managed to go into conditional mco line now and then uh then later proceed to recovery mco along this course we know uh it's a very it's actually a natural cause for a pandemic to come back in second and third wealth if you study the epidemiology right so uh but now the third wave actually hits us very badly right and i'm happy today will be the last day of our cmco in sarawak hopefully tomorrow everyone can still remain calm and don't go out and share share the unhealthy air around you can still continue to keep the hygiene and keep all the good habits that you have learned throughout this cmco yeah right uh i will share a little bit about the statistics because i understand there are medias here also there are state governments or any people from the government sector always asking for statistics right uh and you have seen a lot of infographics uh perhaps along the on your apps or your uh or your mobile phones or more facebook social medias right so this is on 25th because the 26th one is not yet out and i'm happy to see kuching now is orange zone but you can see there are many red zones and this illustration is very very easy for us to actually see where are the places which is still not so safe to travel and i'm not sure any one of you have noticed it or is just become a very new norm to you that you don't recognize it yeah you can see here at the bottom right bottom there are actually some advice from our kkm cprc to to share with you uh how you can actually practice the good habits like tutorials [Music] so online shopping actually become more famous nowadays right and this is another infographic that shared by uh ministry of health and you can see uh the third wave here actually he kisses uh the back uh very badly uh during this uh third wave we actually have about 50 000 cases right and this is the latest from yesterday this information is very important and you can see let me share with you right so a total number of 60 000 people have been detected positive so far and you can see here uh on the right upper corner the fatality rate is actually not as high as compared to other places 0.57 percent although we don't we don't wish anyone uh suffer from this but uh the fatality rate is actually not that high and somewhat ranked number eight of all the states so far yeah okay and this this piece of information is very important you will know uh how many cases are still in icu uh how many of them incubated how many active case one and this is another very interesting infographics okay and i'm not sure any of you uh is aware uh that our ministry of health malaysia is also updating these uh informations and they also share a lot of things like karis panduwan and infographics and even hotlines is here and sop so uh if you you are not aware of all these maybe you can have some time to check this out because uh a lot of useful information will be available here rather than you uh praying and checking uh information from people and sometimes people may may just share a fake news that is not really true and then making make you more anxious okay now um who also did a survey recently from august to october where coffee 19 then they found that kobe 19 actually disrupted mental health service in most country right in uh among the 130 countries that actually surveyed actually 93 percent of them had problems with access to mental health service and also because of this survey they noticed that the almost all country spend less than two percent of their national health budget on mental health it means that the policy maker doesn't always focus on mental health when it comes to the planning that they're more focused on the physical health and that because and that they met uh our our mental health is not so well worth uh among or all the people of also be coded because they are not very familiar with mental health service and after this covey 19 i believe many country has started to pay attention to mental health right and further information from this survey actually there are about 60 percent disruption to the mental health service to the vulnerable group like child and adolescents the older peoples and the women who just got pregnant or they just delivered their babies so these are the foundable groups that have problems uh having to access to mental health service and about two-thirds of the people have difficulty to uh to go to the usually counseling and also uh psychotherapy and one third of the people have difficulty to get their medicines and three quarters reported have disruptions at least partial disruptions to school or even workplace mental health services so what are the changes of the healthcare service also because we practice social distancing so we advise uh tele medicines and tally therapy and you can see not every country is able to do that only 80 percent of the high income countries start to practice telemedicine and less than 50 percent indeed in the low income countries and one very sad thing is about this uh actually 989 reported mental health and psychosocial services available and is as is a part of the national coffee nighting response plan but only 17 have at full additional funding for covering these activities so who are the people actually got affected uh from this phantomy you know we have as young as six months old baby right and then our school green children they have problems uh going to school i still know that you know my my niece barely go to school throughout these years on probably only like two months of 2020 and even my university students they have difficulty to go through their final year professional exam and this actually caused a lot of anxiety and a lot of uncertainty certainties that brought them a lot of fears and also anxieties and not to forget about the working adults you also have problems at work because you have to work at home i share with my friends who work in singapore they were expected to work at from home so in the past they only do as expected to work from uh office eight to five perhaps but now because you can work at from home so people can actually call you even like midnight or later in late evening so this actually disrupts the quality of life's lifestyle as well and elderly elderly is the group that that then are no no good with ict so a lot of times they know there is some big things is happening but nobody is actually helping them because we are very busy with our own uh difficulties right so a lot of times at the list are the people that we actually tend to neglect and recently also i had done uh some research with my students that you know is sarah what a lot of self-employed people encounter a lot of anxiety and depressions because of because of this pandemic the financial difficulties the crisis that they encounter and this also affect them a lot and not to forget the front liner as well the healthcare workers right and not only healthcare workers also the police then in the past we don't see that much of police roaming around but now they have to go to different places to uh to just check if anyone is breaking the rules and all that and also airline staff they get affected a lot throughout this pandemic and what kind of mental health changes throughout this uh kind of make so it includes biological emotional cognition and behavior so let's let me share with you one by one from biological uh a lot of times when people get anxious they tend to have these following symptoms there will a few muscle tense sometimes when they feel anxious they get shakiness uh or some people feel depressed so that the cat is sympathetic um and when people are not able to tell others the psychological symptoms a lot of time will manifest as physical symptoms like headache chest tightness and very prominently especially in adults they may actually show sleep disturbance and also apathy disturbance emotionally wise uh people start uh feel panicking uh i still remember uh the first the first one we actually the the nations or the government announced mco so everyone start panicking because they have to buy a lot of things so that they can keep the keep the stock at home right so when you feel panic everyone rush out also that that may be very dangerous dangerous right um so we start to worry about our future we start to worry about our kids uh the schoolings our work and all and there are also people get angry they get angry with how why our government not not uh taking attention uh taking actions probably they are still learning we all still learning because it's not something that we always face right uh along the course there are people also feel guilty because they did not really spend time enough with our family uh even like when actually uh i'm sure many of you from kuching still remember uh in santosa hospital was a cluster and i also feel guilty because i might actually accidentally spread the disease to to my family and luckily uh you know after i was currently for about three weeks uh nothing happened i got stopped three times it's definitely not something very pleasure right and we get helpless because we don't know how to how to cope with these situations and some people may also feel hopeless because of these situations and not to forget those who actually lost their family in this battle that do experience grief they probably have difficulty to accept things right and condition wise when people get anxious they have difficulty to pay attention and when you come pay attention you have difficulties with memories and people may be in denial and thinking that you know this thing is not going to affect me and so all also because of the social distance things may show that uh you know we feel so disconnected with other people from all around us right uh even the pariah ang harikawai deepavali uh hari raya are not all not able to do to celebrate in the big crowd so it it just be it's just like a very uh it is nothing special for their celebration anymore right and behavior wise sometimes when when we get affected with emotionally we tend to cope with different ways and like young children they may they don't have to go to school they may spend a lot more time on screen they play games and adults we like to check check out the social medias and see what is the latest news what is the number of the people tested positive uh for myself i like eating so uh sometimes you know i got very bored i do like do like to eat a lot a lot more compared to usual and there are other people they may use alcohol to actually cope with the negative emotion and we become more aware of the hygiene so actually the sun patients of mine actually came to me because of these ocd like symptoms not obsessive compulsive because they need to keep washing hands until that that there is an abrasion on the wood on and so on right and we also notice that there is an increased prevalence of domestic violence because when people get affected uh emotionally they may they may actually tend to displace their anger to those who whom they think that they can displace too so uh a lot of domestic violence happens uh throughout this period as well and does there's also another there's also another populations when people get affected when they have uh they have negative emotions that may actually go on with uh self-harm so yeah so these are the effect from this pandemic yeah so why actually mental status will change we we do notice in there a lot of people to have intrapersonal struggles so in ourselves we have a lot of struggles perhaps with the finance with the thoughts with the worries with the work and so on and sometimes it can be biological not when you don't sleep well you don't eat well our brain chemicals tend to be disrupted and when the brain chemicals disrupted then the brain chemicals that are responsible for your emotion will also be disrupted and that also will cause you to have depressions or anxiety and so on so apart from that you know a lot of times mental health problems it doesn't come from one cause it can be due to your uh personality some people they tend to be more negative some people they can withstand the adversities in their life because they tend to be more strong and also uh you know childhood development some people that tend to have more trauma throughout their uh upbringings and these many factors actually can affect one person or how they actually cope with adversities right and interpersonal struggles also happens during this period we we do not only deal the intro our personal conflicts we also have to deal with the conflicts with others so we have problems with relationships with our colleagues with our friends with our family with our spouse partners and so on right and by and large uh the very big factor that caused us to have trouble here is the environment right especially those who stay near hospital right if you hear the siren right it may be very panicking because we know that you know people are not allowed to go to hospital by themselves when they get tested positive so the hospital will actually send ambulance out so when you when you hear the alarm ambulance alarm come nearby your neighborhood you start to feel panic because you know that you know there's someone in your neighborhood is actually tested positive or maybe more than just one right also other people panic on buying mass right initially so the must become very very expensive so panic biking buying also become an issue another thing is social distances um no main is an island we like to social uh with other people we can't stay on ourselves alone so when there is a social distancing we cannot meet our people we can cannot meet our friends cannot meet our other relatives or our family members that frequently and that also contribute to the changes of mental status and one one thing i like to highlight here is also stigma because uh moshe anyone of you know why stigma is a strong lack of respect for the people or a group of people that temporary they have something like for example in covet 19 when someone who got affect got tested positive and the society doesn't really approve of so this group of people they they are being disapproved uh they're already very traumatized being tested positive but they're also being disapproved by their community and the friends and even the worker the colleagues may also reject them at workplace so this can contribute a big trauma to them so now let us take a break i have been talking quite a lot let us take a break for a while you just come down and relax all right for you for all of you that you don't know right i have done this for 40 seconds just now in that do you know it's estimated that one suicide case happened in the global in every 40 seconds so in the past 40 seconds probably somewhere around the world there's one person actually had committed suicide it's a very sad case right and recent uh news also mentioned about the 266 that they had tried to actually uh commit suicide during this mco time right uh um among them about uh 78 percent of mails so if you notice you know the man at home or know anyone you have an email please next to you just talk to them and ask them are you okay are you okay or not you want to talk to me right share your concerns okay and surprisingly and very sadly also the news mentioned about 20 23 of them actually from the age group of 15 to 18. so it's a very sad case but but not to forget they are also a vulnerable group right suicide is a real thing and it actually happens uh about 800 000 cases every year and you know when every suicide case happens it doesn't affect the person alone it also affect at least 25 percent who are close to them so now how do you actually recognize the signs of suicide what are the reason when you you know that people may be going through a very difficult period they do not uh most of the time there are signs that you can actually pick up and then you can do something about it so i hope everyone can share they can learn also and try to notice anyone next to you uh around you they have this kind of signs and symptoms and help them promptly right so this they may start to have problems with eating and sleeping they may say that they tend to eat a lot or eat lesser than usual they may have a significant weight loss they also have problems with sleep insomnia cannot sleep or they tend to sleep a lot they lost interest in their hobbies and a workplace or even going to school they lost interest to taking out the self-image they don't they don't share they don't uh they don't don't claim themselves right and they also try to get rid of a big crowd they want to stay alone they want to isolate themselves or sometimes people may cope with these negative emotions by using substance drugs or alcohol or maybe smoking a little bit more than usual and you may notice some drastic behavior change like uh persistent low mood they start to give away the belongings they say the s word s means suicide right or they may leave some notes on the instructions or social media and so on so these are the signs that you want to recognize when some somebody is actually giving you the signs that you know they are impending risks that they may actually go to this stage to to take their life so having having said all these negative uh emotions that we had mentioned earlier we also learned something from this pandemic right i'm sure many of you have learned something i i learned something as well so one thing that i noticed is the resilience because many people respond to this phenomena this crisis differently and some people somehow rather they are better coping than the other people so what is the determinant i think resilience is a main point here when these people they have this capacity to actually maintain competent functioning in facing all these major major life stressors and resilience doesn't come in one day rome is not built within one day right it's just like muscle if you flex it enough you have been exercising you will take less and less effort for you to get over all these emotional uh punctures uh punches each time so i also hope uh those participants today you can learn to to you know trend this muscle the resilient muscle and this is something very interesting that i learned recently when i give another talk somebody have shared this right right you look through things uh using your rose tinted glasses now someone look at the situation in the positive light or with a great optimism by this i'm i don't mean that you don't see the buildings uh we we don't see this crisis is true and we try to avoid that you know we deny this but we choose to use a more of this optimistic view looking at this and that's why i talk about growth today like what are the some growth that we have over this pandemic you know lifestyles have been changing right being hygienic is no longer just a good habit but it becomes a very good very important skill that you need to have for survival so time has changed now uh everyone will be more cautious they will they want to wellness they'll use uh alcohol swap they will use a hand sanitizer whenever they go and then notice this is really important even when there is no crisis upanimate like these right so now we learn to have to to be more hygienic also throughout these periods you know over the past one year i i also learned uh to to give talk uh through this online platform uh from a class that i can see a lot of students to a class that i don't see anybody only the laptop and the webcam right so i also try to attend myself along the way and we will notice these innovations is not something very bad it actually helps us to get connected indeed over this past about six months i attended at least three or four online courses and also international conference where i don't have to fly all the way to other places to china to taiwan to other places in order to attend all these international courses internet national conference so you get to meet around people around the world with just and apps right and not only that our government sarah government are always very uh very happy with digitalizations right so all these apps have been developed throughout this pandemic is something that i will see is as a growth and i also want to share with you several mental health professionals actually among all the psychiatrists we have developed this group in telegram called sarwar mental health information you can go through these this this link and then you can you can look through this and you actually can get a lot of useful information on how to cope with stress how to cope with difficult uh difficult emotions inside this uh platform and you can see here right tips can gandali stress the technique abc so it may be difficult for you to find these videos all around the place but if you could you just have a apps like this you can access to all the resources that you need in just one platform right also working from home is no longer a dreams i used to think you know if when especially when i'm jammed in the traffic uh i got trapped in the traffic jam i was thinking like uh how am i going to to get rid of these right i have to try like 30 40 minutes to go to a workplace but now i can work from home i can share with my students on what they need online as well and it's safe time for traveling so working from home is no longer a dream and education wise i have told you that you know i attended uh many online course uh online and it become more available because they think that you you they don't have to rent a place for you to come together so people can learn online and then the the fee for the learning also become cheaper and cheaper and you don't have to fly all over to other place to learn something new and at this same times when you have uh so these lockdown measures people to start to actually build more genuine relationship they spend time together they come together as one family and spend time with each other and which usually everyone is busy on their own they have no time to spend the time with others so perhaps it's also something that is good for building a family relationship right and i also want to highlight this that cprc had mentioned about this our ministry of health have been looking into the availability of facing states all around the world there's about 10 veterans that is on the face phase 3 clinical trial right so what i would like to bring out this because i want to share with you there is hope only hope and deals right so when we lost hope we we tend to see a lot of negative things when we remain helpful then we know that some someday that this thing is going to get over because of the whole so today i want to pose a challenge to all of you not to keep things to yourself but share with others but also if you cannot teach anyone around you that they have any negative emotions try to leave others with the words by just saying are you okay i noticed that um you you had not been yourself lately so you like to have a talk with me right you spend some time with them uh you just need to listen to them and and spend time with them that will be very helpful so what are the tips that you can do to help others you can try to show concerns right if you notice something you know try try to believe your gut feeling if you notice something is not right that is probably something is not right so try to show your concerns and just ask simple questions may actually make a very big difference and you also allow them to have a room for emotional expressions so when you actually ask them are you okay don't talk too much allow them to express their feelings allow them to share their problems even if you have your own problems maybe you want to allow them to share their problem first then only you can share your problems so that would that means that you actually support each other and many a time uh you know people try to listen but they become very judgmental along the way so we try not to be judgmental but just listen and try to understand uh to try to put ourselves in their shoes and understand how difficult emotion it can be when people have diffic have gone through a lot of difficult periods right and you may even want to offer that you want to accompany them and help them to receive treatments from health professionals if it's indicated is needed this is something that i will encourage you to do but what are the things that i would not encourage you to do don't say i know because nobody is the same so we will never know how other people feel uh from our perspective so uh try to avoid using this i know how you feel and all this because you will never know i would never know how my patients feel when they need to get ingestion they need to take medications every day they need to suffer through all these side effects i only know that from textbook so i can't i can't tell them you know i know how it is difficult for you but i can say you know i can see this really difficult for you right and do not keep empty promise if someone telling you that that uh you know they're intended to that they feel very empty in themselves that they want to end their life don't say that no i will keep this promise i won't tell anyone but also don't be secretive about the suicide intentions help them afford them where to get help now i will share with you what are the mental health service that is available over this era so this is an initiative by the ngos i'm in the health association sarawak they have developed this their own website and they also offer a online counseling online support group they also have this website for information especially for party for coffee nighting and you can see when you want to get help you there is a urgent github you can have one-to-one support uh you can also have other defender service and support group so that offer quite a number of uh resource here by befrienders also there are there are a number of things that we have done right the informations about the government and you actually can get quite a number of mental health service directory all over malaysia in this website and there are some results as well and also offers some activity corners especially you know those who are currently at home or granting at the hospital they may be very bold they may be thinking a lot right so they need some activity to help them go through that period so offering this help will be helpful and because i'm representing the preventers today i would like to also share with you there are a number of uh defenders centers thanks to technology you don't have to only call uh preventer kuching you can call all other centers that is available uh all over the malaysia there are nine centers over malaysia's uk uh some some centers offer calling some center offer email uh service some center actually offer was whatsapp service at different operational hours okay um there are also other uh associations or other ngos available in sarawak like sarah women for women's society here there if you notice that anyone who has domestic violence affected by domestic violence right you can also give them a call that they provide some service counseling and also a temporary shelter home so other religious group like grace center body uh counseling also provides service and if ready ready you don't want to call anyone in in sarawak right you you don't have to worry about that because now most of the calling is quite it is free it as you call preferences actually free so there is if you can notice here on the ministry of health website there is this hotline hotline right and there are a number of other ngos that is providing online counseling so you can call them to express your negative feelings or you can even share with your friends that who actually need that right it's here okay so um many a times we don't know how to get professional helps and that's why many people don't step up to to get help very promptly in time so now i share with you a very simple steps for you to actually get help right so step one you just need to go to any nearest clinic or it can be polly cleaning it can be your private cleaning okay and get assessed by the doctor and then they will they will write you a referral letter and they will even help you to get appointment from the general hospital who have psychiatry service or even go to hospitals in dosa in kuching right and then you can see the mental health professionals and get treatment there and these are all these number available and actually in most of the districts in sarawak we do have a psychiatric service nowadays even like in sri lanka syria and sergey we all have psychiatry service as well in general hospital and even in lingbang right so the hub is out there and not to forget uh those in kuching uh maybe sometimes you know when i when i was waiting for uh the results of the subtest i also get very panic so that these are the numbers that you can call for the gurakan the operation room right you can record them during the operation time and also if you want to get started you need to get some information actually can also come up with a lot of notice about where you actually can get the test done but make appointment before you actually go and see how from this uh clean the major poly cleaning coaching area last but not least i like to actually encourage you again you don't have to be an aspect you just have to care share your carings when okay when you share your carings uh they will help a lot of people who really in need right and also i like also to promote for befrienders coaching because you know the whole day we are the whole year we are not able to do our road shows if you can support us you can call us if you if you need any emotional support you can email us also if you can help us with our finance because we still need fun to to go through our operations with that i thank you thank you very much dr bernard for the talk thank you very much for the sharings so now we will open the sessions for q a so those who would like to make a comment or ask questions you can either use the chat functions you can post your questions there and those who would like to ask or make comment or to speak so you can either use the raise hand functions next to your name or you can unmute yourself and let me know that you would like to make a comment so any takers [Music] perhaps i can just start uh just now that the net you talk about the resilient muscles so maybe can you give us some basic or simple tips on how do we train these resilient masters yeah okay yeah a lot of times you know our how how we get that is because our thoughts can affect our our feelings our emotions and our actions so the thought itself is very important that's why i say look through the rose tinted glasses try to see different perspectives you perhaps you can you can't stop yourself from looking from the negative perspective but also try to be optimistic so we try to look on the bright side that is what we always do right so when you always try to look from the bright side then you will train your resilient muscle uh even better than others right so if you you don't try to train your muscles then you will be very flat yeah so i hope that uh no it's not easy it will take time it will take many many days or many many weeks or many many years for us to be like one not even as a psychiatrist i do have uh moments that i am under the weather so when we are able to actually look through this roasting the glasses so you'll be able to be more optimistic yeah in fact i'd be very busy with giving talk these past few weeks so i feel like uh quite overwhelmed very very very pronounced but i i'm looking through this is my last thought for the for this month and no i say i say to myself now tomorrow i can have a very good or tonight i can have a very good rest all right thank you dr vernet okay we do have questions from uh alicia alicia would like to know the cause uh to seek professional help from the clinics is that what are the costs involved involved oh okay it depends on where you want to get help from a from private clinic i'm not quite sure because i don't do any private practice it depends on the medical centers how they charge it but in the general hospital it's very easy as if you are government servant actually the cost is almost none right right but if you go to the specialist service you only have to pay a five ringgit to get the service including the medications and if you go to polyclinic they usually asks you to pay a current gate number second one or two ringgit so it's very very minimal because this is something that i must press uh malaysia government because that have met our our healthcare service is very affordable yeah all right now actually actually you don't get to wait for too long to to get to see uh professionals so don't worry about you know i i need to go through government service and then i had to wait for long actually it's not really true nowadays all right thank you dr bernard we do have a few more questions so uh okay from amanina how to convert someone who doesn't want to help themself okay this is very common question and very practical questions right if someone don't want to help themselves we want to recognize what actually caused them to feel difficult to seek help so again the active listening is very important when you listen you you know sometimes people that have struggles to get help because they don't want to see psychiatrists because it's a stigma so they feel like if i go to see psychiatrists it's like i'm seeing a doctor right so i would not address myself as dr killah but they may actually see me as a dr killah so this may be one of the barriers that they need to to have to go through before they consume professional help also because they don't know where to get help so now you now at least hear about 200 people that you know where to get help already so i believe when you know where to get help it becomes very easy for them to actually sit help right so if you even if you don't know where to set up at least you know where to actually get help first then then we can recommend you how you can get through uh get the treatment proper treatment and proper follow-up here yeah so the first thing is to listen to understand what is the struggles all right thank you so now uh the next question is something that is very common to all the workers this how to overcome stress in the workplace due to the overlord work of a lot this one i really have difficulty to answer you in just one few minutes many another workshop after this right but maybe a simple things some simple tips simple tips in our in our culture we try not to uh how to say we try not to confront our boss most of the time but i'm not asking you to try confront with the boss but you can actually talk to them you know i have this difficulty to finish all my work because of this and i i would like to have a lot more time right know if you don't discuss with them they assume that you are able to copy that so if you don't talk you don't express your needs people assume you can do that so if you have that need you you should talk to them all right there you go all right next a few one uh next question is that uh which is better when someone needs help or need advice or psychiatric help befriender or tell them to go to the psychiatric clinic to get help so which one come first or which one is uh to the first step actually i would say you you are the one who will be the most important person when people actually talk to you that they need help right you should actually provide the help first so you are the most important person that is the reason that i want to share with you today because when you actually can be a befriender to them all these other external services may not be necessary right um most of the time people they don't go to suicide uh extend immediately they just need someone to listen to them someone that can share their burdens so if you can do that then our load will be much reduced i must thank you for that all right but if let's say you already noticed that uh something had been very alarming like what i have mentioned risk of suicide or these signs that you recognize that of course you want to ask them what is your preference do you want to call befrienders you can give them as many results as they they feel comfortable with um and you can even help them to go through to get appointment you bring them to clingy you know asking me to asking my patient patients who go to psychiatric clinic is difficult but if someone actually accompany you to go to their clinic it actually is the burden all right thank you okay next one is uh what is the first thing you should say or to do when someone call you and say i'm going to end my life oh this is like a same question yeah okay um what do you think there is no there is no first no no model answer i will i will give you i would say i mean if my personally i would actually say i hear that you so i will reflect i hear that you feel very distressed now and then you try to call me because you are distract you are in distress would you like to talk more about it can you share with me what actually bothering you now so again you just need to spend time for them you allow them to have room for expression know why why we have preventer service when prevented service comes from other countries apparently it started in uk they noticed that when people are able to express their struggles actually after they managed to express the struggles the suicidality intentions suicide intentions would be lesser so they find the support there so when they call you that means they really really trust you so you must be the very good befrienders of course you'll be overwhelmed with that that's why listening to this talk also trying to equip you with that knowledge and help yourself and help others all right next is uh there's a sharing from lenny that someone jumped from at uh sabakas recently and a lot of them uh mostly government servant witnessed the occasion the incident so they are emotionally affected so how to get rid of this feelings funny feelings well um i think you try to make it uh less intense but i can really sense the intense emotions you know when you see someone you witness someone jump off from the high buildings it's not something very very light it can be very traumatic for those who actually witness that as well [Music] it's very difficult to say but i would say if let's say you have these these difficulties and you notice a few people in your group actually have these problems it helps you want to come together and share among yourself how is your feelings maybe you have to process through these feelings and in let's say at the end of the sessions everyone can support each other that you really don't need a professional help in the end of the day if you think that after sharing in the group and many people still get affected that they still need some professional help i i think you can actually get uh get help from the psychiatric service at least uh talk to uh japan kasata negari uh to to allow them to send any psychiatrist or any psychologist or even counselor to come to your group and process that trauma traumatic experience and we always think that you know trauma is something that can get true over time but it actually doesn't get true if you don't present it it will just change the manifestations maybe initially you feel very intense you feel your penis you feel uh chest tightness but along the way you may project this difficulty in yourself become a body sensation you feel or depends you feel very easily affected you don't feel like working at all so again because you don't process that trauma enough so i would encourage you to talk about your growth first and if they can share their feelings and you feel better after that then perhaps you don't need further professional support but you do need one like i said always ask for one all right thank you uh from alicia again i think it's a follow-up question how many sessions does one need once they seek professional helps again this is not a exam question yeah i can tell you until the person is good enough and resilient able to practice the resilient muscles we will not give out the person we will continue to follow other person all right yeah okay next one is how do i say a stay positive when covet 19 is still in our society and our safety is not assured so i think this is a very common uh issue faced by everyone in the society now so how do they how do we stay positive this probably needs another one for workshop to talk about how you can stay positive and because the issue is real not only you even me we are all survivors from this pandemic we are all the teams from this and me as well we are still worried about we are still worrying about this pandemic as well so as soon as we actually practicing the meshes that uh have been uh mentioned by our ministry of health many of many a time you are quite safe unless you don't want to practice and you want to keep yourself safe that is quite impossible right so we have to practice the safety measures like you know wearing a mask when you go out or try not to go out as many as possible as much as possible and try to not eat out also in a very crowded place right always maintain one metal uh distance from others okay and then use a sanitizer or at least you wash your hands with uh with uh soap and also water not only water soap with water and all this so if you practice all this if you still get it i really i really think that you know it's really very melania it's very unfortunate but in our actually in our statuses most people who actually practice that uh they don't really get it so you know that if you practice safety measures usually you are quite safe all right thank you okay next one is from mr eddie uh good morning dr barnett during this pandemic period what is your advice on keeping up with the hospital appointment this is for people who have appointments at the hospital do they keep it do what is your advice on that um i i'm not sure where which hospital you are from uh and as far as i know most hospitals come out with their uh uh crisis measures like dosa they actually allow people to uh to contact them earlier and then get their pack medications early so if you have any doubts you should call the relative hospitals and ask them if if they actually come up with any measures for you to get medications right and that they do actually have measures like tele consultations so some of our patients we we think that them probably looking through the notes they are quite stable in the past maybe one or two years so we will just call them and ask how are they coping so far and then if there is no alarming issues we will issue the medications prescriptions we will prepare the prescription so they just need to dry through so it will actually reduce the contact and also reduce the risk to get infected that's for stuff at least but i believe all other hospitals have their majors as well so if you have dogs just call them and clarify on that all right thank you on that okay next one is that a society what should we add to help those who feel stressed during this pandemic because prior to the pandemic we usually can get events like marathon jokaton etc but during this pandemic what events or activity can we organize to help those people you can organize talk like this yeah you can have a lot of support group you know as i said when people are able to express their difficulties a lot of times the negative feelings will be much reduced and we usually keep to ourselves things keep things to ourselves and then thinking that we are all alone in this world right but actually you are not alone and many people actually suffer suffer from the same feelings like you so when they come to to the same group they can share with each other right that is actually very helpful uh you don't have to wait for a mental health professional to to to have this support group among yourself you can also organize one and help your friends uh you just get the three or four of them and come together using zoom also maybe 40 minutes because it's free for 40 minutes right yeah at least if they can share about it they will be very it will be very helpful so i i will also challenge you to start this and then you will actually reduce a lot of my burdens as well at hospital all right thank you now the next one is how to overcome the feeling of helplessness and fear of uncertainty over the situations which we cannot control during the pandemic feeling helpless and fear fear of uncertainty again another very big topic to talk about wrestling i guess y'all still can do more about this matter yeah so again uh i would say uh training your resilient muscles really takes time it doesn't come within one day but you know this error actually causes a risk because we want thing almost instantly instant noodles fast food everything comes very fast so we have lost our patience to wait for the best to come right so i would advise you to at least to keep you know if you you can't train yourself to be more resilient enough then at least you talk to someone that you trust uh let other people help you so don't get don't don't do it yourself when we are trying to train this muscle right so at least you get someone to help you first so i'm not sure if this question actually pose any uh any elements of depression or anxiety but if you do to get professional help all right that's what that's the questions that we have in the chat so is there anyone who would like to personally share or make comments or ask any questions they can let me know and then we can give the opportunity for them to do their sharings anyone from the majest maybe even those who are working in the front liners maybe you can share your experience working during this pandemic of course we have people from areas that have not been affected at all by kobe 19th because some area in sarawak they have been uh green throughout you know so i think that connection is good i think only the remote area anyone i don't see a raised hand with this oh i would like to speak okay yes all right yeah maybe you can turn on your video all right but is the sound system good all right yes yes it's good we can hear you clearly are you driving no no no no no no okay yes um first of all thank you dr bernard for the very informative um wonderful talk you know as a lecturer and as a part-time lecturer teaching my students you know who are doing their master's degree from unimas and they used to come to me for help i would teach them but now we have to do it through zum from cebu from muka and even uh from you know saba they ask questions about shrugs so i mentioned certain things first of all in this pandemic lockdown i did a lot of gardening i had so many herbs especially i planted thirty types of herbs now there are seven types of herbs lay cha tangerine peachy pothole collecting kimko fan you know it was plentiful of harvest yes it's locked down i have good contacts with the hawkers i would collect you imagine early in the morning after coming back from auntie dory's house i would do gardening because there's no job i have to do a lot of things in the house which is good i keep myself busy i keep myself happy i keep helping people i did uh work like sewing from the house you know i helped my friends and then those masks it's not very good at first i'm not good at it but eventually as time passes by it's really good i did zoom in and help out and encourage the students from the girls brigade section then in the gardening you know i know there are elderly ladies 18 70 i know them i would phone them up today until then you no need to cook i'm cooking luicha you wait for me by one o'clock i deliver food to you free of charge so the day before you know cooking luicha is very very tough you have to fry the peanuts you have to fry the economy you have to fry the dry prawns you have to get ready all the you know pickles that is the type of so you do everything ready then you gather the leaves so i will prepare everything ready and i must get back from auntie dori's house by seven so i start preparing garlic you know all these things prepared cut the long beans whatsoever i buy things ready you see i have students asking me sing say what can you help me to sell guava i said huh at this time to sell guava how how much is a kilo okay one kilo is nine ringgit oh that's too expensive you know why don't i help to sell like 20 kilos you know in about this three months i can sell 300 kilos of guava just to help my student and at the end of the station my ex-tourism student would say um i said no net don't worry i buy from you because i have some pocket money uh yes we do our part like dr bernard said there's no time for self-pity you really work hard and actually when i deleted the food auntie would phone back this one and they would say your luigi is very nice it tastes so good you know we cannot go out to eat now we have really nice lucha lunch pack get hot warm and the soup is so delicious next time could you give me more soup you know things like that it makes me glad and i'm ready and energized to do the next round i did four rounds you know each time it's not easy i would put the name put it in a nice plastic bag put into a box put into my car house to house delivery then of course in addition i have to sell my students cooper so in this manner we passed time and then at the same time i helped those in the nursing home and then for three months or so off and on i was extra general hospital the seventh floor the eighth floor and then kota samarahan now i have experienced when the coffee patient comes up i must say thank you and i say that the struck government of shroud has done its very best the medication the medicare all these are doctors you know in their costume which looks like astronaut so the security guard would say convict patients downstairs and all these are like um some of them have commented how do patients you know need to get medication when they're sick they need to go hospital they would just run you know from all these uh covet patients that is covered by the plastic and they would say all the coffee you know um then i realized oh my goodness the the crowd is so frightened of this patient you know and the doctors everybody is running health scatter but i would just look and i said thank you for our doctors in the general hospital even at emergency to receive patients from strut general hospital emergency section to cottus-raha specialist they are doing such a great job the medication the care the nurses all the front-liners i want to say thank you it was such an experience this time the lockdown has taught me so much lessons not only to be resilient like dr burnett has mentioned to be hygienic to be caring to really comfort people and i comfort so many people even you know they are christians they have not gone to church and i pray for the patients and they say could you come and pray for my mom she's so sick things like that little things that we do it makes one's life so much better to all out in gucci and elsewhere i say stay safe stay healthy stay positive do whatever you can the little you give especially in kind words a touch a smile a love it makes a difference thank you thank you thank you dr dorothy for the sharing so very insightful and very courageous so very very happy to hear that you are doing well as well so we do have another questions uh from anita that how much helps can we extend to someone who need helps when that someone has no family support right okay before i respond to this question i would like to really press uh this notion for his her very admiring support to the community no because of your your persistence in your kindness in helping those who are vulnerable in this society actually it is a lot of our burdens as well i'm i'm sure that they contribute quite a number to our uh to to help our healthcare service uh at least the the healthcare workers right so what i would actually uh summarize what she actually had done is that when you have a life goal in in yourself that you go for the life goals then when you go towards that it's also a ways of practicing your resilience muscle and another thing is uh when we talk about uh covet 19 it doesn't only affect our ourselves mentally but also physically so do you know anyone when they get affected they need to be quarantined at home and they don't they don't get food and all that so we always try to address the basic need first the shelter the food you know and so before we come to talk about the mental mental uh our emotions and all that i still remember when i was uh i was currently at home and i was trying to call the staff from the hospital because uh you know other people calling them they may not feel the same so but i'm currently i'm calling them they feel very much supported and one of the things that i will try to identify is that what is your best in need is your best in need is already being covered so uh there also i found out that i can link to this question right i found out that our jkm also provides a lot of support in giving food and giving services not only the food but also the they can come to your house they send some necessities to the people who have poor support at home but of course we can't do everything yeah we try our best to do as much as we could but we also be need to be aware of what are the the social service and all the resources that is available in this society so if you have doubts always try to get get support from welfare department because i i can assure you i would i was welfare department had done a very good job and you know by the day when i called these staff who actually uh work here from um who has actually worked in kuching for like few few years and all his friends are all get quarantined in different place so he has no way to get his food so we just asked our social worker to get help from the welfare department and the same food to him is so much needed for him that he can go through that 14 days without a worry about whether he needs to be in hungary for that 14 days when he is in quarantine so when we want to help other people we really want to see what is the urgent need that we need to sector right so really uh you can help as much as you could but of course you can you still have difficulty to address all the needs in the society so always share the results and the the even like if you post on facebook right many people will respond to you if you know what are the services in this society just share with them now i know that people who don't have food you also can call hope place they also share they're also thankful to those people in need all right thank you dr vernet for that so perhaps we can go to the next question is it on the how much help we can extend to someone who needs help when someone has no family support so is you want to add on to that do you want to check with any welfare officer right because i'm not sure i'm not sure how much this family support means by no family supplements not at all or there is family but they don't support at all so it's usually under welfare department all right so i think the next question is more on that on family member being very negative and how do we deal with family members who have been very negative but doesn't want to seek help again listening is very important i have mentioned this and emphasize this throughout my presentations when you try to listen to them you you will be able to identify why are they so negative it can be because of the past experience it can be because of the personality can be because of the developmental history that they have a lot of trauma in themselves you know uh hospitals and dosa had reached out to many people throughout this period we have online uh housing um as a way on if you are in distress or you are in stress and many people actually feel on the phone and we notice that not many people actually not really get affected only by coffee 19 there is long-standing problems in themselves that they had not been addressing but they are busy with life said that they never addressed that but because of this covenant i think they start to sit down and reflect about the life reflect about everything because they have more time now so they start to feel that you know i really have depressed for so long i never get help so now they come to us as a platform they manage to get help from us so we actually we get how we actually refer them to the nearest clinic or nearest psychiatric kidney as well so again the first thing you must listen and listen what is the need why are they so negative then you you understand why they don't want to get help a lot of time there are a lot of barriers like i said it could be because they have worries that you know seeing a psychiatrist may be very cinematized they might want to consider uh a private practice psychiatrist or counselors or ngos that i mentioned earlier um if if they think that you know i don't know where to get help then now you know where to get help so you can help them to get the help promptly all right thank you any more questions or anybody who want to do sharing as well take a 40 second dragon maybe i can ask another question uh dr bernard sure based on your experience working with the coveted 19 patients [Music] what is the scenario like in terms of their mental health for sarawak like the severity uh the range of an issue faced by them perhaps you can share with us a bit on that i mean i did not actually deal with patients with covenanting directly uh there are a few patients came to us after they tested positive and then they uh they are out of current in their were tested they are certified as safe patient to call for to seek help to see mental health from central side when i am working there right but perhaps not many people know that our state government have been trying to gather mental health professional support to support all these people who are tested positive like for hgh they actually call all these people who test the positive and those pui actually in different centers actually caught by a stat counselor and also by hospitals and dosa mental health professionals right so when these people actually come to us a lot of time they have a lot of struggling of stigma you know because it's very obvious that when you don't go back to work or you don't go back to the place that you should be or in when you go back to your neighborhood people will try to actually reject you because they're worried that they may get affected although we have been educating everyone that know they are safe already after 13 days yeah so a stigma is a very big issue i hope also through this talk i can also strongly advise everyone that no to not to reject those people around around you because they already certified as positive and then you reject them again this is like double blow to them yeah but of course we already know once they are able to be discharged from hospital that means they are safe to be in the community so all we can do is to accept them thank you thank you for that is there any more questions from the participants all right [Music] all right i'll ask the last questions okay okay yeah this is on uh on suicide you highlight on the the symptoms just now but i think many times uh often we see a lot of suicide that happens among uh i mean celebrities or well-known people it's usually very like you think it's a non-visible symptoms see i think people who have this known visible symptom is i the most uh dangerous because they seem us to be all uh very happy they are very happy with their life they are like so outgoing you know like they are they're really uh hide their issues very well you know they presented a totally different uh personality uh image to the people around us i think these are the people that is very hard for us like we are often taken very surprised not like a shock by when this kind of people suddenly committed suicides you know so what would be is there any how do we try to look for this kind of uh cracks you know like symptoms you know especially among this kind of people who doesn't display very visible symptoms okay so i think i need to address this also uh very you know very heavily a lot of time we are misleaded by the informations given by the social media and there's no one single cause for a person to take their own life usually that is due to multiple factors but one very prominent trigger triggering factors they will highlight on when they report in the social media so definitely uh it's not difficult for you to identify someone who already have the signs that they're having uh depressions they probably have a low mood for a long time right so all these celebrities right i believe the friends and the family will also notice that they already have some symptoms or signs that along the way that if you look at if you look at them if they do a postmortem uh for like for past few months right many people say oh i already noticed that uh he start to say something negative or something like that but it's not projected in social media a lot of times like i said it doesn't come immediately unless the person is very impulsive but usually it doesn't count immediately so you will be able to identify find uh some signs or symptoms along the way when a person not getting is not on a good mood so uh what we always do is we tend to neglect that because we don't know how to address that so we we try not to ask how are you i are you okay we feel very fearful to actually address that but i can tell you you don't have to do anything you just provide any you just provide a room for them to express their difficulties so when they feel safe with you they will tell you everything they have so from there you can and identify what are the needs that they have and you can actually encourage them to sit help early as well all right don't be leave by the by social media all right all right right now not taken all right okay maybe we can do another around uh one uh last check is there anybody who wants to say uh or any more comments if there's no more comments in it then please uh join me to thank dr bernard thank you very much for the informative sharing and the insight to what we can do so i hope that all the sessions have been very useful for all of us in how to uh in to manage and how to cope uh with our mentor to stay positive to cope with our negative feelings during this pandemic so once again i would like to thank a few people like dr burnett for example and then also to new dimensions for providing the technical support last but not least i would like to invite now everyone to turn on their camera so that we can take a group photos so everybody may i invite you to turn on your camera and be in the in front of the camera so that we can take a good photo if are you ready we will wait for a few more people to turn on first all right then i will i will make the announcement for those who doesn't have a camera it's fine thank you yeah okay keep on smiling i'm starting to take the snapshots now keep on smiling yeah hold on one more hold on and done all right with that we conclude our talking this morning thank you once again to everyone for joining us so we wish you a pleasant day ahead and uh stay safe say stay healthy looking forward to your participations in our future talk so thank you goodbye take care bye bye thank you
