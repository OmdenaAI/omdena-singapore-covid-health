h2JWw3I8XTs,Students Answer Tough Questions About Mental Health,UCKfxN9DXLUDvGnAt59RF9rQ,Tropic Monsters TV,2021-05-12T10:00:32Z,"The best way to remove the Stigma of Mental Health is to talk more about it! These students say it best! ☺️ You are not alone, if you want to speak more about ...",hello everybody so today we are here at republic poly where we are going to ask students some questions regarding a very serious topic mental health so mental health is a topic that people often shun away from as it is look to being a very touchy and sensitive topic however today we are here to show people that hey it is okay to talk about mental health and in fact we should talk more about it so this video is in collaboration with imah republic poly and is supported by ncss under the beyond the label project all right let's get on with this interview let's go what is probably very big i don't know where to start so actually today i'll be asking you guys some questions regarding mental health in singapore just answer them in the best of your ability like there's no right or wrong answers first off what course are you doing at rpe currently we are in the diploma of health management and promotion all right we are in diploma in business it's about science yes for science all of us i'm from dhmp i'm also from dhmp i'm also from dhmp right so the first question i want to ask is what is mental health to you guys and what are some of your thoughts about it for me mental health i think it's an umbrella term so it can stretch out to emotional psychological and my thoughts about it is just a simple phrase is very very underappreciated what many people don't know is that everything around them the environment physical and all that work school family it actually affects your mental health the question of mental health is a very broad topic you know health we often think about physical health and we throw aside mental health think mental health is about your well-being also at the same time it might be from since you were born or developed i think it's just like our brain's response to whatever happens around us maybe share with us how keeping up with your health and fitness relate to mental health that's like a scientific standpoint when you exercise you'll feel like endorphins and happy hormones will all go up and then at the same time your cortisol level will go down which is your stress from a more social standpoint you get to work off your friends or you get to work out alone with like music that you like you know it makes you feel bumbler have you or would you talk to someone regarding your mental health needs do you feel that it is a topic difficult to bring up probably won't speak to anyone about my own mental health because i feel like they won't be able to empathize and understand from where i'm coming from there's definitely a stigma against mental health sort of like oh if you have depression or something similar to that extent not as many people are as kind of caring as if like if you broke a leg i think mental health should be discussed with your friends your close friends and of course you should know who you're talking to because some people might just laugh at you but some people might be the best help you can get in your life it's a very intimate subject i would only bring out something about mental health to like my close friends or like my partner it's hard to share about my dark thoughts and all that you should really seek help if let's say you can't afford to see a counselor or you don't trust counsellors right you can just go to your closest friends or if you're close with your family that's even better some people would rather keep things to themselves because they are afraid of being judged or being made fun of i should rather not close my information with you if you're not comfortable because it will affect both our relationships so next question i'd like to ask is would you be a friend or remain as a friend or even date somebody who has a mental health concern or condition i don't mind actually i'm looking for one oh okay i will go to the extent of being a friend first understanding his or her feelings and their mental state before proceeding to dating them i will be your friend i'll remain as a friend i'll even date someone who's diagnosed with mental health issues they're still humans after all and i believe they're capable of getting better i think this question is also in line to whether i would be friends with someone who is like physically disabled i feel like it's the same thing just that one we can see one we cannot see her it's really a test for your relationship if you can really like handle someone else's feelings and communicate with them i think for me i don't really care much because i mean you don't pick to have mental health as long as i'm okay with my partner and my partners okay with me then i believe that kind of abuse our relationship everyone is flawed in their own way you know mental health should be more receiving to them in fact so next one i would like to ask is what do you think are some signs that may prompt you to pay more attention to a friend like perhaps some signs that may indicate they need some help regarding their mental health attitude towards you or maybe they can be a little bit more aggressive hostile or sometimes they'll just shut themselves up when people get surprisingly a bit too happy every day so like i think this has been brought up by the death of robin williams and all that some people may be suffering from manic depression they might feel extremely happy and high today so that's actually something to look out like people use jokes as a coping mechanism so you should really pay attention in small details frequent mood swings as well as the fact that i guess if something tragic happened to them a lot of family member someone they know well i think it's definitely good to check up with them someone changes their lifestyle or their personalities maybe when they have like a loss of appetite when like my friends actually start to like self-harm or like they talk about very negative stuff like constantly or have like suicidal thoughts then i'll know that they are in distress those friends that i hang out with and one day they like then they don't wish to come out that shows me a sign of them social isolating themselves when i see my friends doing activities that they usually don't do and they do it like very frequently over that period of time adding on to that how would you react if let's say a friend comes up to you guys and reached out to you guys let's say i'm your friend and one day i came to you and i say like hey i think you know recently i've been having some mental health conditions i can't take it anymore and i think my whole world is falling apart so maybe share with us how would you react to that i'll just say i'm so sorry you've been feeling like that i'm always here for you regardless of the time just give me a call i'll always pick up and listen to you don't ever think that you're a burden to me because i don't want you to suffer in silence because i know as well if the roles are reversed he'll do the same so i'm always here for you as a friend i won't like disturb you or i won't criticize your thinking because i know that this thing is a real thing i will personally go with you to the specialist and be there for you if you need me they may not open to whoever they want to so maybe they trust you that much to actually share their things with you maybe referring them to a therapist and i try to guide them along in this tough period of their life i'll ask if they are comfortable enough to share their own issues with me and i also promise that i'll keep this private if they wish to and i'll respect whatever they have to see so you shouldn't say that you understand how they are feeling we mostly don't i think it's best to just be a listening ear to them i think it's best to be there for your friend and listen to his troubles for me as a friend i provide them with the support when they need i was asked them like would they rather have me to help them solve the issue or would they let me be there listening here because i'd rather see how they want me to approach it rather than i assume what's the correct way to them that i'm interested in listening to them and also try to understand their situation just be there for them like be their listening ear instead of like throwing their one side on the other hand do you know what are some of the things that you should not say to someone who reached out to you with their mental health condition and one thing that you should not see is like oh just get over yourself or like not that bad because you really don't understand what they're truly going through oh don't think that way you don't have to think so much you'll be okay you should avoid saying like be independent or why are you so weak yeah same life being true that we fall uh stop playing around and this thing doesn't exist like you it's just inside your mind i think we should avoid uh words such as like sensitive someone out there has it way worse than you because like you're just invalidating their feelings everybody's feelings is valid no matter how petty is no matter how small or big it is don't say suck it up this is life telling them you are fine and everything will be okay you're able to handle it it's nothing not not a big deal you shouldn't tell them that they need time to relax let them have their own time but more instead to ask them out and join time with you if they reaching out to you that means that they're becoming very vulnerable and and saying that it's nothing would maybe affect their mental health even more it's just a face that they are going through it is normal it's cause it's not like do you know any places where people can reach out to when they need help regarding their mental health conditions the only place that i know as of now is imh yeah also apply for like a rp counselor can book a session for them yeah or you can ask your mentor for help then they will go through the steps behind that or you can go through your poly clinic local quality and ask for psychiatrists not really sure but you think there's like a helpline i'm not sure what's the number but then i think they offer some help we have a chatbot that also helps with counseling so if you're not very comfortable with meeting counselors face to face you can text them yeah and it's not a bot like it's an actual person or like if they are not really open there's actually an email or a chat where you can talk to an online mistake i'm vaguely aware that this uh there's a hotline the suicide hotline in singapore i don't know the number of the top my head but i know if you google it you'll show up for sure or they can call the image hotline or something like that in conclusion how do you think we can lift the stigma of mental health in singapore do you think more people should talk about it yeah definitely because the more you talk about it it's the more normal it is i think the key thing is to make exposure for you because when we talk about other health issues everybody knows how to tag and all that but maybe the society is not so exposed to things that we don't see that people are suffering with always listen with an open heart open mind and never judge i think people need to know more about mental health and what it really concerns they need to find within themselves you know the acceptance to be able to accept people for whatever issues that they might have to fellow singaporeans because now currently in our studies mental health is actually not something to be judged of just because you have mental health gives the person some time and maybe if it is really severe they can actually go and seek a professional help but take it step by step and not rush them we should normalize mental health because like everyone is going through rough times so the least we can do is be there for them and like understand the situation even though we can't give them advice we should open up so that we can share with each other advice and give each other some motivations yeah okay thank you guys for your responses they are really very good i'm sure a lot of people are listening to your advice it will benefit them a lot okay yeah thank you all right that's it we are done with the interviews hey i just want to say if you think you have mental health needs or know someone who does please reach out to somebody about it i just want to let you know that you are not alone we have included several links as well as help lines in the description where you can reach out to for assistance don't be afraid to all right there is help available i want to do a big special thanks to imh republic poly sos ncss for this collaboration also if you want to know more information about mental health more links are provided in the description alright that's it for us ciao first pmtv out boom [Music] okay [Applause] [Music] you ,False,False,True,False

But months have passed since migrant workers have ...",it's very squeezy and uncomfortable to having dinner inside the room it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail these aren't videos from a year ago they were given to us just a few weeks back it's been 11 months since the kovic 19 virus exploded in foreign worker dormitories and a total lockdown was declared since then dormitories have been cleared of the virus and migrant workers have gone back to work the pandemic put a spotlight on the 300 000 or so foreign workers who are housed in mass dormitories [Music] their living conditions provided the perfect storm for a pandemic to spread one year on i find out what's being done to control the infection in dorms and its impact on our foreign workers hi over the course of three months we contacted migrant workers for their stories in this episode of talking point i'm going to show you their lives through their eyes unfiltered later on this is my dormitory here is a playground before we played here but now it's totally restricted my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook so we have to choose cattle our dining area still empty we are not allowed to come here and eat we have to take our meal inside the room one room got 12 people if we want to go supermarket to buy something groceries we have to change our pass while some of our migrant workers live in accommodations such as rented and private housing about half of them live in mass dormitories all located in obscure parts of singapore it was in these dorms where coven-19 cases exploded leading to over 150 000 workers infected the government moved in to seal off the dorms began a regime of mass testing disinfecting the premises and instituting safe distancing measures by august infection rates dropped and the lockdown was lifted most workers could go back to work i asked those who live in dormitories to tell me what life is like for them now staircase also medicated we are not allowed to take staircase while we are collecting our food from the catering we have to take a long queue to collect foods or buy foods so all the migraine workers are depressed right now following all rules and regulation restriction video stood out to me the most so i'm giving him a call to find out more sakib works as a safety coordinator and has been living in singapore for 11 years it's been about five months since his dormitory was released from lockdown [Music] we are not really allowed to go out on the field or any playground we are not even allowed to gathering on corridor yeah we are only allowed to go to toilet use toilet and come back to our room we are not really able to go all those facilities system like cooking and sports zone or physical exercise because the restriction is still in there before covet 19 struck workers could access these facilities and congregate in open spaces freely so do you feel like you are still in lockdown yeah i do feel because i'm not really able to go out in community and i'm not really able to take any public transport and i'm not really able to cook yet and i'm not able to go to playground there is so many restrictions still in my room so i feel actually i mean [Music] i can totally understand why there are restrictions i mean even for you and i we've got all these new social distancing rules because of this pandemic but i can't help but wonder if the rules imposed on our migrant workers are a bit too much [Music] i want to experience for myself what life in a dorm under these restrictions is like i was denied access into sakif's dorm but i was allowed to visit another dormitory ten months ago this place was declared an isolation area it was one of the first few dormitories in singapore to be identified as a covet-19 cluster at that time about 7 000 migrant workers here were under lockdown one of them is surge good morning good morning prepare myself fast food packing so can you leave the room for work anytime you no no no like i only transport timing only i go back outside to minimize congestion workers can only leave their room for work at designated times so just now behind there is the last scan yeah this one last scan can go out for work hd wordpress this one permit green means can go out for work i am a healthy uh red means not allowed to work oh and how do they find out you know if you're green red yeah this one tasting surface blood test workers and dormitories are tested for covet 19 every two weeks all right thank you i'll see you at night while suresh is at work i noticed the barricades outside and inside the dormitory i've asked to speak to the man in charge of this dormitory i want to know if all of this is necessary jimmy why are there all these restrictions in dormitories these restrictive measures are very very important in order to indicate the infection weights therefore it's really really necessary to reduce the crowding and also our co-mingling of the workers within the dormitory so as you can see this is the segregation measures or even the new entry points basically ensure that we have multiple releasing points in this dormitory so as to ensure that the residuals go in and out of the dormitory swiftly and also go through the necessary checks so definitely the intention is to try to keep them safe and well socially distanced right that's right there's a definite lack of social interaction now have the workers gotten used to that well they have no choice practically we realize that they do need to have some social life they do need to entertain [Music] it's 8 pm and suresh has just returned from work as the residents here aren't allowed to eat in the canteen for now they can take away food from there or cook their own dinner something that this dormitory unlike at suckabs has provided for [Music] [Music] suresh after work what do you do in your free time after work for coming room after dress up cooking then makan go bed now see movies play games phone home calling just things so before covet what did you used to do when you were free before covet i sometimes free time i go out just i sometime only i meet my friends do you miss doing those things that you used to do yeah miss but no choice from what i see suresh is allowed to cook and it's not very cramped where he eats since my visit to his dorm the gym has opened up and communal sports have resumed but i'm discovering that restrictions differ across dormitories with some being more stringent than others and as i'm about to find out strict rules don't just apply within the dorms but even on the one day these workers are supposed to get their rest and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes [Music] i'm in little india typically on a sunday you'd see many foreign workers gather in open spaces like these to socialize or to play games but today it's noticeably quiet as evening falls i try to speak to some of the migrant workers but finding ones who stay in dormitories is proving to be challenging oh do you stay in a dormitory no damage no no i use the house no dormitory company house and i soon find out why your friends were in the dormitory what are they allowed to do they're allowed to two hour or one hour later three hour the government give the permission the dormitory people they give permission only they go out forever and so you don't need them a long time never sit there last time have contact but now they cannot come out you ever know what they do on the resident of they also they stay in the house or dormitory inside these workers i'm meeting don't stay in dormitories so they're not subjected to the same kind of restrictions since the pandemic migrant workers living in dormitories can only go to purpose-built recreation centers on their rest days these centers have amenities like fnb outlets a barber remington service and a supermarket i'm waiting for kavikuma he typically comes to this recreation center in sambawang once a week i want to know if that's enough for him hi hey kavi did you come for the dormitory yes how do you normally come here i just  only take the bubbly kavi is allowed to go to a recreation center only because he comes from a dorm clear of covet 19. still he needs to produce a negative swap test and apply for an exit pass he is only allowed to go to a recreation center assigned to him to apply for an exit permit like how long does it normally yeah so at least two days or one days before we have to apply and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes that's it yeah but no enough but no choice we are only allowed three hours are you shopping today [Music] so you mentioned that you are here for three hours yeah is that enough for you of course no enough because normally we are only a load work and come back to dom yeah uh only one day alone exit was to come here so also i only allowed rc i'm not going to other place so what do you think you missed the most mostly is that i cannot see my relative here because only i can see that uh my dormitory my co-workers this other thing i really miss thank you okay thanks so much man for bringing me okay thank you bye bye after seeing what a recreation center is like and talking to kavi i can see why he wants to come here more often just so he can maximize his time outside the dormitory but even then he only has three hours a week outside and that includes travel time [Music] go liberation center then come back send money only because so boring our company lori bring and bring back to home it takes one and a half hour left one and a half hour i really couldn't make my time to meet friends and have fun for me it's not enough because it's very small small small place it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail just go go eating only eating watching movie like that and then go on bed lying in bed resting that's why it's very hard from us hi i'm good thanks for having me these strict rules imposed on our migrant workers have been going on months after lockdown it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people and i'm about to find out the dire effects i've been tracking migrant workers to hear their stories about what life has been like since covet 19 exploded in their dormitories this is the picture i'm getting the dorms me no longer being locked down but some of these workers still aren't able to do the things that they used to like gather with their friends for a meal and this is not just within the dormitories but even outside on their day off but just being able to spend their rest day outside is so troublesome that many choose to stay in i'm meeting rashid early this year his company moved him to a private accommodation as his dormitory was too far from his current work site yeah hi how are you i'm good thanks for having me over yeah thank you also this is where you stay now uh yes it's my accommodation nice russia tells me life is better living outside of dormitory but i'm surprised to learn he is still facing restrictions if i extend dormitory they have all the rules given by the dormitory and mom and government also need to follow here also i need to follow but still i don't uh go around like shopping mall or anything i just go out for my essential to buy food only so even though you don't stay in a dormitory yes you still have restrictions yes why is that restriction is uh from government uh mom bca as i am a safety personnel in my job site so i need to follow the bca requirements all those requirements they have still now we don't have any approval to go outside like as before so how do you feel now that you can't really do those things it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people we also need refresh my our mind how do you cope with that kind of feeling like how do you make yourself feel better i doing a lot of voluntary job as i am mentally depressed last time so i trying to teach other person who also mentally depressed i'm a safety coordinator for jobsite in my company and my job to take care all my company people whoever working in my side or outside so i have to take care of their health how are they feeling every single person have different feeling so in this case few of them they say they are very bored because during kobe they cannot go home leave so they miss their family few of them they say they are mentally not so good advocacy groups have pointed to prolonged confinement and job uncertainties affecting the mental state of many migrant workers in singapore so much so that a government task force was set up in november to enhance mental care support among the initiatives deploying public officers to dormitories so they can look out for workers who may be showing signs of anxiety or stress [Music] after months talking to our migrant workers i'm taking what i've learned to the manpower ministry martin cole oversees all the plans rolled out by the ministry's new division ace set up to take the lead in the fight against covet 19 in foreign worker dormitories [Music] martin i've been speaking to some migrant workers after lockdown and they brought up some issues which i was hoping that you could answer so firstly within the dorms they're going back to work but they still have some restrictions my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook what's your response to that there are dorms that have on sweet cooking facilities now those that have communal cooking facilities that was where we had the restriction we were trying to control the the infection the transmission but we have already lifted it and we have invited dorm operators to apply to mom so that we are satisfied that the safe management measures are all in place currently we are staying at 10 this room is still 16 bed inside in terms of sleeping arrangements some of them have mentioned that yes there are fewer people but there's still the same number of bids in the room which means they don't have the kind of space that they need give us some time for the dom operators to do something about it we are working very closely with the dome operators to make sure that we continue with this de-densification effort i cannot go follow bus cannot go mrt is it true that dormitory workers are not allowed to take public transport at all for work activities we require employers to provide transport to and from work because when it comes to peak hour traffic the risk of transmission is the highest and when we have large groups of workers going out to work using public transport that's where we introduce this transmission risk in both directions between the dorm workers as well as the community but when it comes to other activities other than work while we strongly encourage employers to arrange transport we allow public transport because the transmission risk is a lot lower so migrant workers are allowed to take public transport as long as it is not during peak periods do you see the restriction on public transport changing anytime soon unfortunately for as long as kovit is with us i would say that i don't see it changing three hours you can go out and then come back that's it they're only allowed to go to the recreation centers and back for three hours when will this change we have already have plans to increase the frequency of visits to the recreation center and for longer and you can expect positive changes this quarter wow okay that's great news for them then given that we don't really see an end to this pandemic at this moment how would we go about improving the lives of the workers who stay in dormitories so we have already have seven quick build dorms that have been launched they have improved the specifications to improve the living environment for the workers as well as to make them more resilient to infection over the next the course of the year we will be launching more quick build dorms and to increase the number of paid spaces to about 25 000 quick built dorms are a temporary measure and will serve as a guide for more permanent solutions to our migrant worker housing so one year on because of all the robust measures in place covert 19 infection rates among our migrant workers have drastically gone down yes some are still struggling to adapt to the new normal but things are looking up this could be the future of migrant worker dorms in singapore more spacious rooms each with five single beds spaced at least one meter apart compared to a typical dormitory where up to 16 workers can share a room the room also comes with an ensuite toilet shower and sink outside there are also larger communal spaces like dedicated kitchens and shared amenities like a minimal thanks so a silver lining to this pandemic is that it has accelerated plans to improve the living conditions of our migrant workers but what they really hope for is to be able to rejoin the community i hope our restrictions have to pull out and giving us space to have release our stress i hope we can go around singapore and eat at the hawker center let us to go outside even once a month like that because we need to relax also our mind

EoS42rwhORg,Mental health Awareness &amp; well-Being Festival 2021 migrant Writer of Singapore,UCGVC76Y1gJvcj86iHcALeUw,ameera Joti,2021-04-27T23:43:22Z,mental health Awareness & well-Being Festival Building Back : mental health Beyond Covid - 19 supported by:Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth centre 30A Yisun ...,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i had in singapore and yeah so all those things i really really heard a lot of stories a lot of different sharings about their about their mental health issues and so um uh uplifters and these migrant writers of singapore also became a became a way for me to to be connected to to be a friend to be a sister to those who are having so much difficulties during a really really challenging time last year so until now and i found myself doing good doing some good things about educating them helping them out and it really helps a lot also that my employers the psychologists and so sometimes when i have uh when there are things that uh are really really very difficult for me to explain or to understand and i'm going to i always ask for her advice on how how should i how should i advise them how should i tell this to them that they can uh yeah how can i help them release in this matter in this in this thing that they are suffering so that's that's really uh that's really an um analytical guilt way for me to connect more to connect with the people when i want to the community work i feel myself that i am needed i am needed and i can do something for them thanks thank you your story is very inspirational um from all the initiatives that you're part of so adding to that i would like to understand and learn from this so um how how you've been a part of my focus in singapore so in terms of your experiences would you like to highlight how um during the week and before the battery how would you have helped the community here before the penthouse [Music] you know we just offered the time to focus on health issues to focus on issues but at the same time also there were workers that were old salary and i remember when the company closed down who stole 60 workers involved you know that the salary distribute mechanisms are problematic and uh and that uh yes this system that prevents people who are low age uh from uh seeking adequate costs yeah so i mean that certainly on the whole journey to find out a bit more to go deeper and i think people treat each other just loving and being inclusive that translates to very tangible things like like paid surgeries like being able to access basic healthcare um you know being able to transport a decent people right given the recent history of excellence uh even the freedom to transfer trump to employers and i realized that these issues came up as i go in people so i was i've been seen about five to six years right now and um and so during this time uh i have come to workers who haven't you know had problems sitting because in terms of salaries had problems seeking assistance making into health care or taking adequate health care and so i mean i was basically a caseworker at home so i fought to make sure that they've received these basic services and also we're able to negotiate that quality with our employers to reach as good as outcomes as possible so you need to move it because [Music] and we knew that that this restriction also would adversely affect their mental health we didn't know how bad it would be and how much stress this would be our population but we felt that a bunch of social workers myself that we should come together and offer so we provided that with helpline and we had you know workers that were calling in asking for support so we were setting things up but also challenging the psychological risk and um also educating them um is extremely important you can hear it is a form of support [Music] you [Music] ,True,True,True,True
1qAPUD6rE-0,What are domestic helpers really doing on their phones? | Talking Point | Episode 36,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2020-02-04T07:01:40Z,"According to the International Labour Organization, 53% of maids in Singapore do not enjoy mobile phone entitlements. Are mobile phones increasingly driving ...",[Music] Stevi videos like these on your social media field these are all foreign domestic workers these videos taken with their smartphones they may seem harmless but are they really latest statistics from the International Labour Organization show that less than half of foreign domestic workers here are allowed free access to their mobile phone so in this episode I'm deep diving to find out how some of our domestic workers are using their smartphones and if restrictions on their mobile phone usage are justified I am starting with tick-tock one of the hottest video sharing social network service amongst domestic workers right now in just five minutes I came across 50 accounts made by domestic helpers follow just one of these accounts and more made videos appear on my field she's quite talented you know yeah I wonder don't they think the employers going tick-tock - or that the employers are never at first just seems like harmless fun but what I soon saw troubled me mm she counting cash I can see a shadow I can see a shadow over of someone at the back just watch for this spot there's a shadow of the videographer I don't look there you can see looks like a man in a t-shirt now this little one looks like the child of her employer and I'm just wondering if permission was given by the parents for this video to be taken and uploaded of notice also that quite a few videos which he can within the premises of the employers again I wonder if that's with the employers permission as well ouch I wonder if this is where she lives now you might say these pictures don't reveal exactly where the helper stays so what's the big deal well Palma a tech writer who has been covering cybersecurity trends things that the amount of information being exposed is a cause for concern here we have some videos which are downloaded from one of the social media platforms so if you look at this particular video you'll notice that the background images clearly shows the block number one zero two now if you would take this block number and you go to Google Maps and you type in block 1 0 2 you will actually show a list of the locations and sing above your block 1 0 2 so beyond that you can actually use Google Street View to pace to narrow down further from the comfort of your armchair I think the greatest danger here is even when they have a move on to annex how so these videos images presumably will continue to stay on social media and if it's on a platform and tick tock is there forever and anybody is able to how concerned should employers be this images and videos are probably uploaded without permission all knowledge you know and taken over a period of time it reviews a lot of information about the householder there helping out in and who is in the house who stays inside a house in this day and age there's always cameras who could potentially find out more information about household before trying to call into the vulnerable and out journey for example well that sounds scary but is Paul overstating the case I'm quite a tank newb but I'm going to put his theory to the test I saw a few videos from an account belonging to a domestic worker I'm going to see if I can track down where she lives using just a google street match search from the videos I know this helper lives near block three one six somewhere if Tampines [Music] I've set the Google map to block three one six and it has led me to this location let's see whether it matches the block in the tip top video okay I am at block three one six according to Google Maps and it really does look like the picture from the tic-tock video which means that the video was probably filmed from across the street in that direction I soon find four-block I'm looking for okay this looks like the right lid we go I think I found the unit it actually does look like the screen grab that I printed out from the pic top video so as you can see the windows look shattered and the door is closed I'm not sure if anybody's home but I'm gonna try and find her seems like no one is home but from what I can see from the screen bread from the video it really does look exactly like this household turns out she wasn't there because her employer was at the hospital how do I know well her latest tick tock post which was uploaded six hours after I found the unit which also revealed who she was caring for with just six tick tock videos I was able to track down the location of this helper within an hour shouldn't there be rules on managing mobile phones to prevent these kinds of situations but the manpower ministry does not have explicit rules on how employers should manage their helpers smartphones instead they have left it to employers to lay down house rules such as when she can use her phone so these videos that our helpers post innocently online can have huge repercussions so what are employers resorting to when it comes to managing the helpers usage they are not allowed to use on weekdays pcs I found that severe data breaches are possible when our helpers use their smartphones but is that the only problem that employers have with domestic workers they will not be working on their normal chores or their duties are they tend to solve like quickly do the housework or not this thing and then have a lot of time to spend on the pony cutting come now every day I hide in the room see I don't know what what you do every day no that can under heaven had not been free until 2:00 3:00 p.m. you know yes right so the next day morning when they wake up they can't concentrate the work because they're not enough sleep especially those have small kids it's not fair for the employees I have a helper and her being distracted was my biggest cause of concern when it came to mobile phone usage but I found out earlier that the over sharing of information by helpers is a bigger cause for worry it's no wonder that employment agencies like the one operated by no Lena muhammad saw insist only on bringing in domestic helpers who agreed a very restricted phone usage what do you tell the maids about handfull news they're not allowed to use on the weekdays pcs it will be kept by the employers but they can use it during the weekends why did you do that employers may not want them the mates to be taking pictures to be communicating with the families because the the mates may have a lot of distraction and not focus with their work but of course on a daily basis the employees will provide them a normal chip 3G phones for the employers to reach out to the mates this seems like a rather harsh policy I think I agree with you but I think it's also protect the employer as well as the me I think if the mid agrees to accept that and the employer is happy with that I don't see there will be any problem in the long run when you say agree is that agreement in black and white is it in the contract yes I make a contract for the meet to surrender the phone to the employer you know I never thought the restriction on hand phone usage would come from the agencies but what happens if the employers insist on such restrictions no Rhynie abdul wahid found out the hard way the mother of three was at the brink of renewing her helpers contract until she discovered that her helper had obtained a phone secretly I'll show you the room what she's supposed to be anyway when I found her using the phone the kids room kids are sleeping and she was actually seated here we have you know holy water food throw from outside I can see the light from the screen so I came here and I saw what you're doing and she was like holding onto Street and say no nothing so I took it from my special and I figured out what did you find inside and there was a lot of photography for thoughts and photography yes one of the best photos and videos we have a spare room and I also found pictures of her taking selfies sexy on the beach so I shows rubies this is the room where she took a photos in the photos I saw that she's on the beach wearing just bras so the kiss her face and she actually shared that photos with her boyfriend after that what did you do we had a kind of transition so I was like asking her with you you know get the phone she bought a second from from a friends in the C building after what happened what is your stand on help us and the hand phones I think handful is really the root of all evil yeah I believe so so I understand they're away from home they miss their families my kids but you know you need to show me something before I can trust you often for many of us our mobile phones are our lifelines I for one cannot imagine being separated from it because it keeps me connected to my work and personal life which is why when Robina Novato was only allowed by her previous employer to use her phone after 11:00 p.m. at night she called it quits after two months was this rule communicated to you at the beginning of the contract no not at all so I never asked and we never talked about it I thought I will try it first I mean I just started and I don't want to bring up like a negative thing with her already did that work for you at first I thought it will it is fine but then you know as when I started calling my family especially my mom she said she's already I'm already sleeping how did you feel like that I'm I'm really sad I'm really disappointed and then you know that it was a result of feeling homesick because you know when when you just want to say something to someone especially my family or my closest friends I can add to it your attitude at that time was to fit into what your employer wanted yes so you didn't try to talk to her employer no I did not do you think that most domestic workers would react the same way in your situation I think so why yeah because you know first thing we came here to work so most of us will do you know like yeah it's okay at first you know I've known Willa knowing a lot of domestic workers who were the phone their phones were confiscated before they started their job but then they will come up with a second you know they have a hidden phone you know secret phone so for me I didn't do that because I thought I can adjust into it why did you decide to share your story with us because it is very important for the employers to know that we temesta crackers are human being too and I think sometimes they forgot that we are away from our families especially for the new ones it is very important for us to communicate to our families back home or to our friends at least they will know our situation here so perhaps the way forward is to stop restricting mobile phone use but instead a way to manage this beyond restrictions how our helpers use their mobile phones especially on social media can have dire consequences and some agencies and employers are opting for complete restriction because of these remember the domestic helper whom I managed to track down just by going through her tic TOCs videos well I've got some screen grabs here and a popular hangout for domestic helpers I want to find out if they are aware of the implications of posting such videos do you use social media like tic toc Facebook and Instagram what do you use I have picked up this book thanks Thomas what do you post on tick tock tick tock - happy happy videos where do you take these videos in the room in your house yeah okay can I just show you this one is tick-tock video bye auntie also working in Singapore I look at her tick-tock video I find where she live I also can find a unit number from the tick-tock videos I cannot remember you never sure but but do you think your your friends know that from doing this maybe they can show where they live I don't do you think it's dangerous yeah I think so for whom dangerous for her we were here right i I don't I don't do this because of the privacy settings on your phone all the mystic workers who come into Singapore will have to attend a mandatory one date settling in program or s IP the aim is to familiarize helpers with Singapore laws and equip them with on-the-job safety training there is nothing in the module to suggest it also covers the do's and don'ts of using mobile phones edge work so it's up to employers and I want to know how some are managing their helpers smartphone usage I've gathered a group of employers to find out how do you manage your handphone policy I allow her to use a handphone okay provided she finished her duties but on the other hand to control or to restrict her from abuse from overuse I do not provide Wi-Fi so she will be using her own data plan so the more she used the most pain so that in that sense she will know how to control and she'll know how to restrict and self-discipline when I say contrary to employment agency the employment rate was actually two years or no in frequency I know it's not sure you don't have a policy until I assess of performance but we go back every month yeah to my start no restriction on the court the a length of course but after that she's ready got a home phone without having us so you must see where the context from she's a free so I gave her a chance I said okay now you can use the pink for it's clear that there needs to be a lot more education about hand phone usage both for employers and employees so who should take the lead anyway I see um the agency and a government because the domestic helper when it came to Singapore they go for their settling in program but the settling program is only about safety of like windows wiping and all those this Saturday a program should actually involve the tools and don'ts in Singapore for their answer yes have fun music not only about safety but also about privacy and on it I feel that the agency at this moment are not doing enough they can do more because baby see we are the first bridge with the helpless instead of us so they should tell them ok in Singapore this is that room guidelines is of the requirement the other thing you have to expect before you come over your before we bring you over here it's clear that these employers want more to be done both by agencies and the government but before that happens what can we do to teach our domestic workers responsible phone usage for some answers I'm meeting John Gill a migrant worker rights activist and his wife Cecilia over the past 20 years they've employed six helpers to work in their household and they've never had to place any restriction on mobile phone use Cissy what do you say to your help of a handful usage I've never had my my boss talk to me about hen phone usage I'll be a pause I have to do that balloon she's not a child actually using my phone here flight he sample is nobody's outside right then I cleaning and I put his phone then if I'm ironing but if I'm around with Papa right then I taking care of them even useful previously I taking care of a newborn right and the seven years old then I do news well what about privacy concerns in an age of social media job it's okay if the domestic worker shows herself dancing around the kitchen having fun why would we bother so what but we have private areas like bedrooms for example we wouldn't bring strangers into the bedroom why would you want your bedroom to be shown online on social media and shared so we don't want that so that's something that you should definitely be very clear shouldn't happen you might go into details when you're looking after my children I don't want you to take pictures and share them for example oh you know when you take them out on the street you know I really don't want you to use the phone so those are the kind of things that I think it's quite legitimate to raise lien what about yourself what with social media how should help us and employers what around the social media thus I think the employer and the help must talk about it right what the employer wants that then she'd want to do the thick top or around her house or what then the helper also must follow these rules right what happens if they are domestic helpers who despite having some guidelines or talk with their employers they continue to use the phone when they are not supposed to what should the employer do you can't make one general rule for everybody but if we have a concerns then we should share them we talk about it and we come to an understanding so should we allow our helpers to use their smartphones the answer without a doubt is yes but as long as there are no clear rules about how they can use their smartphones this will continue to drive a wedge between helpers and employee [Music] ,False,True,True,False

university in asia elena a very warm welcome to you without further ado let me hand over to elena today elena over to you thank you very much christina really nice of you to kick start this important event and i'll welcome everyone disability is high on the diversity agenda and um it's for many companies health is one of the highest causes of disability in the world today and it causes companies billions of losses each year due to employee absenteeism lack of productivity and innovation the world health organization estimates that 10 of the global population suffers from some form of mental illness which means it's one of four of us is affected unfortunately stigma and taboo surrounds in mental health making it a poorly understood topic across the world and asia is not an exception fear and traditional beliefs prevail preventing many that are impacted by mental health issues from reaching out and receiving help that they need not seeing the apparent demand and not knowing how best to approach the sensitive subject unfortunately few companies today are addressing this critical aspect of employee well-being in their organization so to get us started and to set up the scene i would like to ask professor funk to share with us the landscape of the mental uh health sector in singapore and some of the common mental health conditions but particularly those that are increased over the recent years thank you elena i hope everyone can hear me um and i my slides are up okay i'm just gonna start off give us some background to what's happening and perhaps uh then we could leverage uh and speak on mental health and mental illness now the impact of this pandemic on mental health firstly has caused a lot of concerns because there's ex expression of the increased prevalence of illnesses and problems associated with economic recession job loss even family violence and abusive behaviors in lockdowns where people are kept at home at the same time there's concern that people because of that isolation may uh if they were emotionally unstable resorts to three sides this actually is data that uh we have in our institute looking at patients that we take care for at this point i don't think suicides are on the rise but suddenly we are monitoring the numbers and that's of concern at the same time uh the very providers of healthcare that are looking after our population are under tremendous amount of stress because this is a new virus we do not know how it works and what are the implications on life in general and there are risks and fears that people have so in fact in the study between singapore and india we compared the groups interestingly in india um you know depression and anxiety is slightly higher than uh in singapore where post-traumatic stress disorder was significant and i know it's a busy slide just just take my word for it it's quite significant and it's it's of concern uh certainly for us because workers if they are not able to manage themselves and uh suffering from some degree of stress would not be able to function and and truly in this study they actually showed that there's a higher um complaints of things like headaches throat pain apart from the the usual emotional aspects of insomnia tightness and lethargy and even anxiety alongside this process is what's happening in the world uh i had a quick scan of the literature this is a couple of studies one is in china where it looked at people returning to work well 10.8 percent of respondents suffered from ptsd or post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to work but returning to work did not actually cause an increase in psychiatric symptoms that means illness itself or mental illness didn't arise i'll talk to this a little bit later more executives are practicing hand hygiene and more workers avoided sharing utensils which is a good thing infection control measures were in place in fact another study this one looked at what's the real stress behind all of this it's actually financial stress this is the primary mediator for emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes so these are important points so what has happened since the pandemic the old normal this is what's happening in our hospitals number of admissions the hospital has been moderated the outpatient clinics the specialist uh outpatient clinics people were not coming forward as much emergencies were coming down because there was fear in the air this was in healthcare outside of healthcare i mean what our old normal was really meeting up and and um getting together in meetings and having collaborative face-to-face meetings had to change in fact digitalization working from home home-based learning for children and telly everything i mean we're having a webinar right which we would have been unheard of but we have a meeting in a room with lots of people it's changed it's changed the way we provided healthcare it's changed the way we've worked in our offices and and zoom is very well known i've used zoom so many times in the last i'm kind of over zoomed actually and it's a it's it's not a good thing so what is the mental health approach we have to take in this context first i want to talk a little bit about mental health because it's an area that is quite important and sometimes poorly understood now in the population and providers like myself as doctors and clinicians we are one end of what i call a pyramid the other are patients people who already have mental illnesses now mental health affects the general population what is mental health mental health is not merely an absence of illness it's actually a very overarching well-being concern now very often we are well we'd like to think that majority of us don't have much stress but some of us do and when stress increases we start to have this stress and we start to have problems these are mental health related issues on the other hand mental illness is slightly different this is a biological problem it's not a reaction to stress this very often have genetic um and and brain related abnormalities and they have to be treated by professionals that is about i think christina said or is it elena who said one and four i think in singapore the data is about less than one in one in five but um but it depends on where you do the prevalence studies and of course in mental illness there's mild illness and moderate illness and severe illness here in the institute of mental health we deal with mostly the moderate to severe illness so the percentage is much lower now what this slide actually shows is that there is you can have mental illness and you can have mental health issues they are not necessarily on the same dimension but they're in the same pyramid and severe mental health problems doesn't necessarily translate into mental illness the other piece of course is you can have a mental illness and be still in good mental health that means you are happy with your life your illness is under control very much like someone with diabetes or hypertension you're on treatment you're fine so it's important to understand the role of stress in this this is just a singapore mental health study looking at figures so one in seven is a lot lower than the one in four but that's our local data in singapore now what can we do what are the kind of services that are needed for our patients people with mental illness i think now because of infection control measures we need technology to enable the management uh and for um in the hospitals i think trying to manage trauma is important because post-traumatic stress disorder is very much associated with what's going on in and everyone's scared and frightened and fearful um and then of course there is the possible mental illnesses that may result from covet what we know of covet 19 is that we think it's a respiratory disorder actually it's an autoimmune it's a immune response disorder that causes an inflammatory process that can occur in the brain as well you're not sure on the mental health side of things there is need to provide firstly some guidance on health and how to seek help i think some of the other speakers on the panel will speak more on this but i just you know broadly say there needs to be both live support which is synchronous and asynchronous information needs to be available for the public so they know where to get help and what to do when they are in distress at the same time in the longer term i think there is importance to first train mental health professionals and even general health professionals to manage mental illnesses in general and reduce the stigma for the population at large psychological first aid and mental health literacy to understand mental health concerns do not necessarily translate the mental illness and what are mental illnesses in the first place to really manage issues like anxiety and depression as a whole in the workplace most of the issues are not around mental illness it is around mental health how do you manage stress because now there's a lot of changes in work processes working from home economic recession job loss social distancing and isolation is not a good thing if you don't meet your co-workers how would you feel as a team so you need to be able to manage emotions have coping strategies social support and social linkages within the workplace that's important how can you do that can you respect the safety dignity and rights of individuals but adapt and consider cultural aspects particularly in this part of the world be aware of infection control how to look after yourself and when to seek help when that is needed i went a little fast because i want to complete within the 10 minutes and i'm kind of done uh as an introduction to how we can support the workforce thank you very much i'm gonna stop the sharing thank you very much professor thank you um so what i'm recollecting is that um public and organizational education um has created an awareness around mental health and uh we can indeed uh go and find lots of information online and that's good because more understanding will facilitate our empathy and open-mindedness furthermore compassionate and compassionate communication could help those affected by mental health and bring them closer to those that can help so with that i'm turning to leanne a question to you are you seeing more people seeking help for mental health conditions and especially during circuit breaker how have the npos and charities been supporting its clients and beneficiaries uh especially during this period over to you hello everybody good afternoon i'm leanne from singapore association for mental health uh i'm happy to be with you here today to share a little bit uh on what we observe on the ground as a social service uh provider uh for mental health services um during this uh whole period of covic and circuit breaker we like many corporates um from the social service side actually do seek a lot of happenings in that sense to people uh and about their everyday uh daily life and their work life uh the experience they go mental health issues that come up as a result um simple association for mental health actually uh we have 10 services we started operation in 1968 and we have always been focusing on promoting mental wellness for all and our services range from community engagement education raising awareness about mental health issues to providing creative services to help people to manage their anxiety promote mental wellness and more importantly we also have rehabilitation services where we support people in recovery of mental illness so uh just uh to contextualize um some of the things that um daniel had shared um we all know that from the last 2016 survey one in seven um singaporean here would actually experience a mental health condition in their lifetime and um from a psychosocial perspective um we look at mental health as a continuum and um daniel has said that um being uh men having a mental illness does not necessarily mean that people have poor mental health and actually uh not having a mental illness does not also mean that we have uh good mental well-being so uh when we look at it uh from uh continuum uh at different point we could be experiencing a different kind of um feelings and emotional well-being on the green side on the healthy side we could be happy uh generally very satisfied with life and um meeting our aspiration and emotionally more balanced but sometimes when trouble takes place or stresses come in we could be in the yellow and the amber zone where we actually um our life can be a bit disturbed and there's more anxiety and we may not sleep well uh i'm sure you you can actually some of you may identify may be able to identify some of the symptoms that come about and uh it really depends on our coping strategies and uh how can we build our own resilience towards uh managing ourselves back to the green state yeah and if if um we move along and we don't take care of ourselves well and um do not know where are the resources to support us uh we can go into the raid state where we actually can become sick physically we can have very destructive lifestyle we cannot be functioning very well in our activity of daily living so that is a time of concern so uh in in this whole continuum um there are scales for us to actually uh look at where we are and often time um from our social service experience um we we we don't have a medical treatment so we we do a lot of psychosocial intervention uh to support people uh so this this are some of the ways we we help people understand um that um we need to take care of our mental well-being right um during this whole period um before we actually went into circuit breaker um we are already in dos corn orange in late february and um all the social service agencies uh in fact uh have to come up with our business continuity plan and uh we were already planning and uh to go into split team uh and in fact for singapore association for mental health we started uh going on trial speed team just before um circuit breaker kicks in on 7th of uh april and what happened was um it although we have plans we have preparation uh we had a lot of meetings discussion and preparation with staff uh actually we were quite affected by this uh circuit breaker the first phase because um the instruction is all services have to close except for um very very frontline services like uh residential homes so out of our tent service we only have one service that can fully remain open 24 7. that is our group home in bukit batu where we run a residential service for people in recovery so all the other nice services we have to immediately plan how to provide continually provide our service to our beneficiaries and community through remote means so it was very challenging for us because um we do not have all the hardware support at those in the initial juncture and uh when we acquire the hardware we may we do not have all the apps and software and it took us a while to get out the subscription of all this zoom and way backs up so and what happened was uh the instruction was very clear that due to the protective measure and uh uh safe distancing measures uh there's no way we could see clients and uh we have to actually uh refer services to uh other frontline that are allowed to or considered um white listed agencies uh that can actually visit cases so it was very tough and um what what happened was uh subsequently there was a reverse i would say not maybe not a reverse decision but uh moh has taken into consideration the feedback and um there was a um a new um advisory that allowed with exemption uh some exemption to some services so we managed to uh get some exemption and some of our services are listed as whitelisted agency and uh we could provide minimum on on-site support to our service recipient so our counseling services we could actually let some of our staff with minimum staffing go back to the center and we are able to see some high risk cases during those period yeah so during clear spirit uh even as we as a service provider try to adapt and change to using virtual means to provide consultations as well as sessions and activities with our service recipients um not all our service user could actually benefit from the remote services mainly we take it for granted that uh while we are ready you know people at the other end should be able to actually um enjoy what they usually enjoy during the on-site support uh but many of our clients actually do not have the hardware and they can't afford to do subscription um so we actually also face that challenge with with our clients who we want to support and also there are clients and beneficiaries who prefer not to do all this virtual um link up with us because their home environment is not suitable they are home condition and home buyer environment is not super and some of them are not used to this kind of arrangements where they felt that their privacy can be compromised especially if they have to do it in their house and there's not enough space and private space for them to do so so um so there is quite a lot of adjustment that we have to do um so we resort a lot to telephonic support and declines right okay just just a bit on what is seen on the ground which actually could be mirrored in in the survey national survey that uh carried out um one of the market survey company actually uh can show their survey results uh and i think it was published in the press and that uh actually a quarter one in four uh respondents actually expressed their that they are their mental health is not so good and uh one of our our partners uh silver ribbon they also carried out a survey of 500 over respondents and anxiety and mood issues also surface as a concern um uh i think everybody is also aware there's this national care hotline that was um launched uh on 10th of um april uh so shortly after the launch uh towards the end of the month uh in early may they have released this report to show that uh actually within a short span of time there is 6600 calls and out of this 6600 calls 40 percent actually uh need more support and uh these calls are diverted to uh social service agencies and other um community support agencies that provide more dedicated support to people with mental health worries and concerns um scss also have a chat board called bell the chat and they also see an increase during this period circuit breaker period of people assessing the web to to actually ask questions and seek help so i think it is also consistent that mutually people raise concern and have said that they are stressed and anxious and they need emotional support just coming back to our own uh singapore association for mental health our own service uh our counseling service has a toll-free helpline where our counselors um pick up calls from anybody in the community during this period between april to june uh compared to the same period in 2019 we have a 50 percent increase in callers and uh among the the callers that uh new callers uh we actually see almost 40 of um callers in the age band of 21 to 40 years old um this is pretty telling about the situation on the ground in that this would be the group of people who possibly are working adults and uh because of having to work from home uh because of the movement restriction um they have actually suffered more mental health concerns and um what surface is also 25 about 25 of them actually express or they are depressed they have an anxiety and mood issues uh very stressed during this period um and also they have also raised issues about relationship for example uh one of the caller actually said that during this period is very stressful and she wants to break up with her boyfriend and also family issues came up we have callers who call that they they um having a lot of conflict because of everybody being at home uh and um they are also those callers who are worried about their family members or friends who are expressing depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation and um the callers who are caregivers caregivers who are during this period is very stressed because um they are unable to send their children to child care nor are they able to send their seniors to day care centers for their rehab so it's elena i need to a little bit cut you um someone asked is there a phone number that you could share where um you know where people can call and probably we need another 20 seconds to close your section sure all right i will uh show some numbers and resources at the last slide okay so so i i think we are all aware that we all play uh wear many hats and now we are at the same time uh stressed with having to adapt to the challenges and move towards a a more um adaptive new normal uh so i'm just sharing i have two more slides just sharing some resources for employees uh and as well as for employers um tafette has some some guidelines on how we can actually uh be more mindful of our mental health concerns and issues and support employees throughout this period and there's also a workplace well-being work group comprising national bodies as well as uh corporates and uh jeffrey myset is also one of the company who is a part of this work group they have come up with an e-guide on managing the organizations and working with employees throughout this period smh has also partnered a corporate chancellor and we come up with a infographic and we have posted in our social media uh to share with people how actually this whole period of stress actually actually is a very good learning experience and we can turn it to very positive development for our own um mental well-being and we can become more resilient over time and um my last like is really to show um this is not exhaustive but these are some of the possible places where you can contact or your employee can contact uh if they need support yeah thank you very much it's really it's really pleasant to hear that many progressive organizations took the chance of corvette which is unfortunate chance yes uh they showed their resilience and uh showed a really good ways to advocate for those uh who need help and dispelling of the of their um issues around the topic and you've mentioned jeffrey which brings me amazingly well to uh to our next speaker jeffrey i know that you devote yourself patiently to supporting this big course and i know that you have a daytime job and uh sort of a another job of working for with the charity mindset that jardine set up please share with us how you've been supporting the mental health community and what what advices can you give to smes great uh can you hear me and hopefully you can be able to see my screen as well okay now not yet not yet i'm not sure why it's not coming through uh but it's okay let me try and see if i can share that once again there you go and is that coming true yes okay great thank you very much for your time and for inviting um mindset and myself to this i think you've heard from uh from daniel and from lian maybe just a little bit of background on mindset before i jump to the last couple of slides so mindset is the charity that the judy madison group has established about nine years ago and you're probably wondering why mental health when we started in 2011 this was a totally un interesting underserved area you would find a lot of charities focus on health on physical health on disabilities on children on education but nobody wanted to talk about mental wellness or mental health because it was a very taboo area to be a part of but not talking about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and so one of the things that group has started out over the last nine ten years is to be able to try and raise awareness about mental health mental wellness and to be able to talk about it for those of you who are not familiar with mindset well these are the constituent businesses of the group in singapore and i'm sure some of them would be quite familiar with you you know from the genki sushis to the starbucks the cold storage hong kong land and mandarin oriental this is all part of the group that is behind mindset in the jardins group itself we've been recognized for our efforts over the years and we've been encouraged by this what's our focus our focus really is trying to do good and to be able to recognize that this is a journey we don't do it alone obviously we do it with our partners and co-collaborators um two of them are with me today dr daniel fong of course and and lee yen from samh and you'll find that there has been a growing awareness and a environment where more people are aware of this and are willing to come alongside and be a part of it so we don't do this alone we do this with all our social service agency partners and if you think about mindset as an organization it's actually only made up of two full-time employees everyone else who is involved in this effort is actually a volunteer or has got a daytime job doing something else like myself um how do we do this we do this by way of what we call jardine ambassadors so every year we've got 40 individuals who come alongside spend two years of their life to be a part of this venture and to be able to walk alongside with the activities that they have what are the activities awareness outreach getting people back into the workforce and this is important because part of this inclusiveness is to be able to get and accept people who may be suffering from mental health issues to be accepted within the workplace and that i think just adds to this whole thing about how do we have an inclusive community as a whole social enterprise and fundraising um again this chart shows apart from the numbers that have been contributed to our effort are the other partners you know from digital mindset to singapore association mental health institute of mental health i just wanted to highlight two particular flagship projects that we have launched in the last nine years the first is with the singapore citizen mental health called mindset learning hub happens about raising the importance of the workplace environment and how if you're a mental health person in recovery how important it is to be in a work environment because that gives you a sense of attachment belonging to be part of a local community and it adds towards your self-worth in terms of building that environment for for persons in recovery the other one which we embarked on last year is kind of interesting uh it's with touch community services and this focus is on pathological gaming but it also talks about addiction to the internet and all things internet and it's kind of interesting because if you think about the last couple of months um i for one have been totally addicted to the internet i i am walking through that addiction right now and participating on a daily basis whether it's a webex or a zoom or some form of video conference that i'm on um and and i think this is going to be in my in our view a growing area that we'll have to address as we go back into that new normal of how to be able to regulate between the internet virtual world and the real physical world itself um i i think it would be an interesting challenge for us as we make that transition this is the one chart that i i think if you forget about all the other charts that i've talked about hopefully it will stay with you and what i would call the four is um as employers i i think it's important for us to be able to set the tone of awareness if you are an employee you would not think twice about saying physical safety in the workplace is important and you need to be able to have a place where your employees come in and will not leave injured because you have got poor processes but i think the fundamental shift needs to be not just a physical safe workplace but also a supportive workplace that accepts and supports good mental health practices and mental wellness and and as lien and says there's a group of employers have come together in the last couple of years called work well uh there is a e-guide that you know helps with steps is how you can be able to do this at the workplace and again one thing that i like to highlight is that it is not as daunting as it looks to be able to take that first step because i i think today we do have that support structure that's out there and and well this is one the second a that i would like to highlight is what i call acceptance because when you talk about mental health issues oftentimes people tend to light up their eyes when you talk to somebody about mental health challenge that you have but it's not lighting up to help it's lighting up to step away because immediately you have got that stigma that comes around and say oh maybe you're not quite that okay and if you're not quite that okay maybe i should not be associating with you or if i leave a label with you then i look at you in a very different perspective altogether and i think in hopefully over the last uh a couple of months of this corporate pandemic you know it's been able to show that none of us are immune from the stresses and none of us are immune from some of this mental health challenges that we may have whether it's stress at work for working from home over the last couple of months on not being able to separate our personal lives from our work lives um activities i think it's important as employers in the employment and environment to be able to talk about this to promote this and to be able to address uh stress management um i like to particularly highlight self-care here and i put down there especially for leaders why do i say that because oftentimes as managers and leaders in the work environment we don't tend to take a like a superhero persona and say of course i can manage this of course i can deal with this but i think it's also important for us as leaders of the groups that we manage in the workplace to recognize that we've had to first take care of ourselves before we can take off somebody else and and it reminds me that you know not that long ago we used to have this activity called flying on an airplane if you recall that before kovit came around and and and one of the things that they'll tell you is that you know if we have a decompression and the air mass were to fall down help yourself first as the adult before you can be able to help your children or somebody else and i think that's a good reminder that we have to take care of our own mental health wealth being as well and and then finally the last a would be assistance i i think that as it's not just the social service agencies have recognized the government has recognized and so there is formal support mechanisms that's out there that we as in the work environment can be able to point out colleagues and team members too lien has shared some of that mind line is one that was just introduced not that long ago by the government and i think they are certainly tools and help that's available so from from that perspective i would just encourage everybody to think about the workplace in in this perspective and with this mindset of the four ways of awareness of acceptance of activities and of assistance uh yeah so those are the points that i i wanted to highlight and uh happy to take any questions thank oh you thank you jeffrey you can mute yourself um really very interesting i didn't realize we have so many things in common like addiction to internet and um so as a small question small follower question for you that came so um for a while we have been imagining what technologies could do for our future and today we are bombarded with information and a new term that we are hearing is digizofrenia and it's said to be linked very heavily with mental health could you comment on uh probably the biggest influencer of the modern day mental health issues i i think it's a it's a question of trying to segregate work life balance and and daniel and bm can be able to talk to that technology is supposed to serve us and to be able to give us a lot more time to serve our own personal needs i think there's been a conflating and the bleeding of our personal lives in our work life and the technology that's supposed to help us i think is also starting if i can use that a strong word starting to hurt us and harm us and i think the only way that we should respond to it is to respond with a a a discipline as it were in terms of trying to define time that we would have for ourselves as opposed to things just circle on i don't have a commute now from the office from the home to the office which used to be about 15 minutes where i could have a down time listen to music and clear my head whether it's going to the office or coming back now my commute is from my bedroom to my study which is less than 30 seconds so how do i replace that to be able to get myself re-centered i i think it's important so those are some of my thoughts lovely thank you and thank you for highlighting the importance of creating environment and organization that promotes awareness of mental health and again that again brings very well to um rebecca and before i ask you a question can i just remind everyone to please uh continue populating q and a's uh we will try to address them as after after rebecca spoke and rebecca turning to you so if you could share how your company pwc has helped employees to navigate through this unprecedented times in fact i think the word unprecedent has been reported by google as the most uh searched word for the last half a year thanks elena um just checking so can you see my can here can see okay perfect i just put it on the screen okay great so um i was given the room of two slides so i've tried to pack it all into two but so forgive me um so i think just to understand how companies in general but pwc specifically have dealt with what's going on in the last six months um it was usual to look at kind of our well-being journey over the last year or so and where we were pre-covered um because that's also when we look at this it's important to look at you know where we're going to be when we emerge out of this as well so um i think for us really first of all looking at you know what is the state of mental health in the workplace in singapore the the business case is very well established for investing in employee mental health um in singapore the ncss study showed 5.6 times return on investment for investing in employment health in the workplace so but i think that's something that's not really been internalized necessarily by the business community here um as much as it could be um the message that it's not just a nice thing to do it actually makes business sense um so when we talk about mental health in the workplace um you know the 2019 study in singapore showed 92 of the workforce in singapore are stressed um but more importantly 12 percent said that they had an unmanageable level of stress so there's about risk of burnout and and this 92 is above the oecd average so in general not so singapore workforce were more stressed before you came in jacob than than the average and so that's kind of the backdrop that you start on but um as we were saying it's not just there's kind of the mental health um whether you have distress or a problem but there's also the clinical side so with one in seven people experiencing a clinical mental health condition uh not just distress during their lifetime and actually most most studies show it's about three quarters um have an onset by your mid-20s so that means that by the time you're in the workforce the likelihood you know that that a significant number of us are living with either mental health distress or actual full-blown mental illness it's actually very commonplace in the workforce and we just don't talk about it so it's not an other people's problem it's actually it's an everybody's problem um so what does that mean for pwc well uh so globally we have what's called be well work well which is kind of our framework for for well-being in the workplace which really focuses on four aspects of personal well-being so your physical health your mental health and then emotional and spiritual aspects but we looked about a year ago and said how do we really uh localize this and make this relevant in terms of the maturity of you know in singapore and we really wanted to acknowledge that workplace mental health is a two-way street so you have your obviously individual mental health affects the business right because um it affects engagement performance absenteeism presenteeism retention you know all of those things um but also work is a huge part of our lives particularly here i mean people work extremely long hours um and there's often a huge link between uh a huge amount of kind of um your identity and sense of purpose and sense of um of yourself that's very linked to to work and so uh what you do at work doesn't stay at work it also affects you at home and so it's a hugely important factor you're kind of what we call professional well-being is a huge factor in your overall mental health and well-being so that's why we have them kind of interplay of the two together so yeah so we look at it as both you're as as a as an organization but also as an individual you're responsible for your professional and your personal well-being and they're intrinsically linked so i think many of you may have heard before the daniel pink framework where he would talk about you know autonomy mastery and purpose well when we talk about professional well-being it's sort of similar we talk about you know your growth journey so for us that's is what you're doing um do you do you feel that what you're doing is is part of a longer career does it fit into your goals and aspirations and that's that kind of sense of purpose in what you're doing and are you getting kind of progression then really um the learning and skills so are you getting skills to get better at what you're doing are you really mastering something and feel that you are you know an expert in a topic and then the the huge part about you know the work culture and environment that has a huge um effect in terms of belonging so do you feel heard and valued but also do you have the tools that sort of enable you to do your work so all of those aspects really um on a pre-code on a normal situation or very uh have a very big link to your your mental health and the the employees responsibility to that so for us well being really um including managing your mental health it's not just a soft skill and a nice to have the the clear message from us is like it's a critical business skill to maintain your performance and engagement so that's also why we're part of that as i mentioned earlier the work world leaders work group and we hosted in last year the first ceo dialogue on mental health to really make sure that um you know this is a strategic priority that's been dealt with at a c-suite level so um you know in terms of the challenges we already touched on them before so stigma is a huge issue so we did the you know the beyond the label campaign internally um and we had an internal campaign last year where we had our leaders uh do a video where they were really saying why mental health is important to them and role modeling and saying and making a pledge and explaining like this is personally what i do to invest in my mental health um which was great but then we sort of realized realized that having asked everyone to pledge to talk about mental health the actual level of mental health literacy was too low to do that people don't have the basic uh understanding and language to be able to talk about mental health or mental illness so since then we really worked on increasing that mental health literacy um through trainings awareness and things like that um including doing a training for all of our uh front sort of front end um hr staff and some of our leadership so it was a full full day training on mental health mental illness and what that means in the workplace so that they're equipped to be able to actually deal with situations when they come up but then the other thing i think is around culture so [Music] the the type of organization we are and i think also in singapore in general there's really a kind of stress as a badge of honor kind of culture that means that um working unsustainably is kind of rewarded um and that's really seen as a you know that's a success that's a a great thing if you're sort of working yourself until you can you can barely function so how do we get around that um that aspect of it so you know places to start as an organization so you know as i said we started with a lot of awareness stuff but then it's really about leadership setting it as a priority so you'll hear a lot i hear a lot you know i don't have time i don't have time to invest in my own mental health and well-being but what that's really saying is i haven't made it a priority because we all have the same amount of time it's just that you're allocating your time based on the priorities and if it's not set as a priority you're not going to give time to it um so that's one thing where leadership's really important to set it as as a as a priority and then role model that so um yeah as i said we also did you know full day training for our leadership in our hr frontline staff um but then really you have to support it with policies so make it official so we've got you know flexible medical leave we've got which you can take a sort of mental health phase we've got insurance coverage that covers mental health and we have our employee assistance program and things like that but also practical tools so i was involved as i said the wellness guide from the work work world that um lee jan mentioned but also we have a mental health manager's tool kit and things like that so but fundamentally if you don't embed it embed mental health and well-being into how you recognize performance it's never going to be a priority so we've now just launched a revised professional development framework which builds um into our whole leadership portion we've really built how you manage your own well-being and how for more senior grades how you manage the well-being of your team um is actually one of the attributes that's measured in terms of your performance um and your yeah and so that's and your progression so that's that's um that was sort of where it was at pre-covered uh and then obviously uh covered 19 happened um and we've already touched you know the others have already touched on how this um affects your affects individuals and the workplace in different ways but i think many of you might have seen that meme that came out which was like what has advanced the digital transformation agenda in your organization more your ceo your chief digital officer or kobit um and the answers obviously covered 19 as we all went digital but i think that that also stands for mental health um because having been um it's really pushing the agenda to talk about mental health in the workplace um it's a for a long time suddenly there is a conversation that's happening um kind of naturally sort of opened up pandora's box really and even small things like on call you know ending calls with people and they'll say you know stay safe stay sane and you know for all that you know it's it's trite but it does mean that people are really acknowledging that there are physical impacts but also mental and emotional impacts of what's going on right now um and that they're that's something that's coming into the into the workplace sorry this alarm going off oh rebecca that fits really well with your timing and i need to kind of we're coming close to kind of an hour so do you want to close in with the next sort of a 20 seconds sort of on the key message and i think you're actually there's a question from cara sort of anything you're answering just nicely and uh if you could help me to round up your your slide sorry what was the question um i will read the question i think you did answer that but um i love the term step in not step away but a lot of managers don't know how to step in and know what to say when an employee opens up do you have any practical tips on how best to respond so actually that's something um that yeah so i was gonna get you so obviously the individual part of this in terms of you know resilience but really the critical part is getting managers and leaders it's that middle part because if you don't bridge what you're doing as an organization to through managers to the actual people it's it's there's a real gap there so that's one thing that we have had a lot of questions on so we're already working on it but essentially now instead of me going to people they come to me to ask so we've had some sessions on how to approach these conversations um where with someone who is showing signs of distress or who's actually come to you to disclose that they're really struggling or have a mental uh or facing mental illness as a coach or a manager so the the key message there is really on listening to understand not listening to reply or to give advice um and that you know and empathy is really key and also acknowledging you know we're equipping managers to have a conversation where they're listening with empathy and then can refer people to the right to the right sources of help you you're not expecting all of don't expect your managers or don't expect an individual to be able to counsel someone you're not you know beware you're not a psychologist you're not a counselor you're not a you're not a trained doctor um but what you can do is make sure that they it's around that psychological safety aspect that they really feel comfortable to voice their concerns and feel that you're listening to them and want to get to a better outcome and then you can on their behalf find find where to go next but really um the key there is really just listening to understand thank you so much rebecca i really appreciate and um um i know we're running out of time i wanted to address one of the questions and uh i know jeffrey you wanted to uh to to answer it we have a question from yvonne that would like to know how one can participate in the mindset jardin ambassador program thank you very much um the program right now is within the group itself and we've been talking amongst the x-com as to how we can be able to extend that outside of the group but i think i've sent a response to whoever was asking that question i think was nora my email please feel free to reach out and i think we can continue that conversation as to how we could get you involved thank you there is one question before i pass to uh to andrew and this question also from ewan and if possible uh dr fung would you like to take this question i'm thankful for the panelists sharing while what is the percentage of the employers in singapore that really care of aware of the importance of the mental health at workplace where most company hr hardly mention about it from my understanding that's a difficult question like i'm not aware of how companies look at this um but my own point is uh i think it's important to have not just engage employees and and workers in the in the companies but um employees uh and uh um workers who feel that um they are being um they are doing something that they enjoy you know it's almost like uh in healthcare we started this movement called joy in work and the reason was that uh in in at least in healthcare organizations there was an over emphasis on getting things done uh and not remembering the people the providers of the service that that needed support for themselves so i think trying to find joy in work is probably quite uh critical for overall well-being and that's that's something that i i hope that every employer would think about you well that concludes our event and i really would like to thank all the presenters and we could hear all the passion uh in the room and before we close off um if i may go to andrew um for to close off the event andrew uh chairs the dni committee of uh british chamber elena thank you and thank you to all the panelists i thought that was a fantastic and really fascinating discussion so thank you to all um for for taking the time to talk to our members about this very important topic um for me some of the takeaways i took from the discussion um i think the difference between mental health mental illness is very interesting and very important for us all to be aware of and i think we've all got a role as as business operators in the singapore community um we all have a role in protecting our employees in in in really looking after employees um but it's also interesting that the healthcare industry is is highly involved and charities are also very involved and there's clearly some some very good resources out there that we can use um to to really support our employees during this period and also i thought it was fascinating to hear some of the best practice initiatives um that the companies operating here in singapore are following and doing to support their employees and mental health was an area that has been highlighted by our members um as an area people would like more help in addressing and raising awareness so i think hearing from from companies on practical tips how to how to support your employees during this time is is really important so thank you both to to draw dean and pwc for for really giving us that overview of what you're doing um this is an area that the the diversity and inclusion committee are very focused on um it is an area that has got a lot of um interest from our members and we feel is important to to carry on this journey really to to improve the um the understanding and the awareness um of this issue uh going forward so you will see more um more initiatives from the dni committee going forward um but on that note i'd like to say a huge thank you

that was the difficult part of me but um talking about uh talking about work related related issues um i'm very thankful that uh my employer helped me to get through that difficult time through giving me those um because i want i want to share with you a story uh about that uh around the april before the imposing of circuit breaker you know what she did is to um bought me some uh those gardening tools and all those seeds because she know she know already that uh we will not be able to take our off days and so she bought all those um those gardening tools that i can use to at least make myself busy and not to think about all those those stressful things stressful matters so um but then at that time also i found myself connecting more with uh with with my fellow domestic helpers specifically because uh being one of uh a volunteer in a nonprofit organization which is the police there's that is conducting an online education for domestic helpers focusing on personal growth and money management and we are catering uh we are focusing on domestic domestic helpers from different parts of the world like we have in hong kong we also have in dubai we have in singapore and yeah so all those things i really really heard a lot of stories a lot of different sharings about their about their mental health issues and so um [Music] uplifters and these uh migrant riders of singapore also became a became a way for me to to be connected to to be a friend to be a sister to those who are having so much difficulties during that really really a challenging time last year so now and i found myself doing good doing some good things about um educating them helping them out and it really helps a lot also my employer is the psychologist and so sometimes when i have uh when there are things that uh are really very very difficult for me to explain or to understand and i'm going to i always ask for her advice on how how should i how should i advise them how should i tell this to them that um they can uh yeah how can i help them in this in this matter in this in this thing that they are suffering so that's that's really uh that's really an um pandemical gateway for me to collect more to connect more people connect more to the community where i feel myself that i am needed i am needed and i can do something for them thanks thanks your story is very inspirational uh and also um you can inspire a lot of migrant workers who are working here as well from all the initiatives that you're a part of so adding to that i would like to understand and learn from jerome so um how how you've been a part of the uh workers in singapore so in terms of um your experiences would you like to highlight um how um during the pandemic and before the pandemic how you have helped the community here yeah before the pandemic and yes i think my journey really started because clearly my journey started when i was in elsa so i was volunteering with a long time ago more than five years and um i think at that time i you know we just also the time focus on health issues is able to focus on the issues but at the same time also there were workers that were old salary and i remember when the company closed down almost 12 to 60 workers blocked it and they were seeking for food assistance and i realized hey salaries are actually a big issue in singapore um because the workers had difficulty reclaiming their salaries when the company was going uh going fast but are you also a raise to me you know that uh the salary reduced mechanisms in singapore are also problematic and uh and that there are gaps in the system that uh prevent uh people who are low age uh from uh seeking adequate costs yeah so i mean that sent me on a whole journey to um find out a bit more to go deeper and to dig with easter uh if you go go with these waves and and i think um anchoring me uh i mean my feet being led by my face to um to you know year for society where we have right relationships and where uh when people treat each other justly and we talk about loving and being inclusive that it translates to very tangible things like like paid salaries like people being able to access basic health care um you know being able to be transported on a decent uh vehicle right given the recently of accidents um uh even the freedom to transfer transfer employers and i realized that these issues came up as i went deeper so um i was i've been this scene about five to six years right now and um and and so during this time i have comfortable workers who haven't you know had problems seeking recourse in terms of salaries had problems seeking assistance making into health care or taking you know adequate health care and so i mean i was previously a case worker at home so i basically fought to make sure that they receive these basic services um and also we were able to negotiate adequately with their employers to reach as good outcomes as possible so we need to cover it with pandemic i mean we knew that especially with certificate we knew that if this was going to be a problem and workers wouldn't be able to come forward to seek for assistance and we knew that that this restriction would also adversely affect the mental health we didn't know how bad it would be and how much stress this would be on the population boom that happened but we felt that a bunch of social workers and myself then we should come together and offer that support so during the pandemic i mean we receive requests from helpline we um quite a number of us social workers are assist trained we call a suicide intervention training so we provided them a helpline and we had you know workers that were calling in and asking for support so we were sending things out but also trying psychological risk and um also educating them psycho educating them on the necessary the avenues of because they needed to uh be thanks um thanks for highlighting your experience um adding to the psychological help that you provided i would like to understand from uh dr carroll on on the importance of the psychosocial uh effort and support that you are a part of i like that as well sure psychosocial support is extremely important you can hear from jane you can hear from siobhan as well that we need it is a form of support that you assist people to make informed decisions and help them to cope better especially during this crisis spell maybe disease as well illness as well so they can cook better to help themselves so you're right about the psycho education and counseling a lot of things that we really need to inform everybody not only us that everybody should know what is mental well-being about and to help themselves which is really important thanks thanks for highlighting that and in terms of highlighting the challenges that we face in mental health and in terms of dealing with it dr chan could you highlight that what are the challenges do we face in resolving mental health issues currently so regarding uh mental health issues in general i think first of all the main gap that i often see in my experience is firstly the personal knowledge and awareness of mental health is lacking so a person could be experiencing a lot of distress that could be manifesting in many different ways it could be manifesting in physical ways in emotional ways in behavioral ways but the person is not aware and is not able to identify that the root cause is actually your mental health issue so that's the first gap the second gap that i commonly see in experience is that other people around also do not know how to identify it so the problem actually goes unnoticed for quite a long time before help is obtained then the third common issue actually is the inability to connect the person to appropriate help yeah and there are many many reasons behind why that cannot happen so firstly there could be gaps in the system you know that makes it difficult for the person to access the help that they need or secondly it could be that the person himself who is affected is not willing to receive the help whether it's because of misconceptions or you know some assumptions or some stigma about mental health that they already have so these are the common challenges that i see thank you thank you for highlighting that and one of the points that you mentioned is is often a stigma associated with mental health so how can we build a literacy around mental health and help people talk about it as openly as we talk about physical health for them thanks for that question and i think it's very important to actually have platforms like these to say it out loud and i think platforms like these actually have a great outreach to the people out there knowing that it is also being streamed online so actually uh the number of people that you can reach is actually unevent is beyond imagination right because after this people can still access the resource and all that and it can be a great educational resource the other thing that i find very very helpful is actually for people who have gone through mental health issues themselves to actually come out and talk about it quite openly to share their own experience of what they found helpful what they did not find helpful and how they actually successfully uh processed that whole experience and those are very helpful in me and actually the other thing that i find very helpful is that i understand that in many institutions of learning right now all the students are actually being made to go through some compulsory core learning about mental health issues so that once they know how to identify within themselves two they know how to identify with their friends and three they know how to provide emergency care to someone else who is in distress or who has a crisis so things like that and efforts like that i believe are very important in tackling stigma towards mental health issues thank you thank you for sharing that um adding to that um with which you highlighted the importance of coming up openly and sharing openly uh gentleman has been very involved in community services and being a part of the community in sharing of all the initiatives in terms of poetry in terms of writing so generally could you share how it has helped you and how a community involving part of the community has helped you in your mental health journey and if you could share examples of such as well that would be good i swear myself uh being very active in this uh community especially my grandfathers of singapore and uh it really helped me a lot to understand to during those times that uh i should be thinking about all those stressful things it has helped me a lot to discover the deeper part of my my own self that um because before i really i really don't think about all this i really don't those these things really doesn't matter to me especially about the mental health issue or yeah mental health related issue and when i get when i get involved in this in this community i came to understand that um we can do something for the people around us and not only for ourselves but um it's like we we don't just live just for our own selves but um we should care also about the people around that um uh especially when we when we are when we have knowledge about all these things um we should uh we should also be observant and we should also be vigilant about the people around us our friends the the person next to us and this community uh has helped a lot of migrants also our causes our our mission in this community especially in um promoting literature among among these migrants and um just simply by be by promoting that um writing can help you to at least if you cannot say or if you cannot uh say the thing that is building up inside you you can try to write it all those things that uh maybe we think it's very very simple but when we advise it or when when when a person does it it's really something that uh i myself has experienced because all those uh all those negativities that i've been suffering i've been i've been um yeah about this pandemic it's all in my poems it's all written in my phone so when you read those poems it's like you are reading you are reading journaling you are getting to know janelyn so this is how how literature how how all these activities is helping us to cope up with uh with mental health issues because um just for example with my friends when when we are talking about all these things um uh i can hear from them also that especially those who are who are really involved in these migrant writers of singapore they are also volunteering because they themselves has has um discovered that um this mental health issue can be resolved or it can be it can be um can find ways to deal with it and um of course we are aware of what what uh what is happening around us that there are some of us who are really get drawn into depression because of this difficult situation and with this small with these small things that migrant writers of singapore is doing all the activities that we want our our fellow migrants to get involved just like carnival of poetry and um we also have this facebook group which is the art daily live info with 19 formerly daily living government 19 which was uh founded last april uh april 10 2020 and now it became an arts in me because uh yeah we uh we we know that um inside of us there is really an art in every people there is an art so that's why we name the group arsini and on that arsenii there is an interaction there is a building up of friendship in between not only migrants but also in the local community and that's really really matters to us as um for uh us migrants feeling the love from the locals feeling the love from the community it means a lot to us thanks thanks for sharing down indeed very inspiring aspect of the expression and dr highlighted this that it's important to talk about it it's important to be open about it but one of another aspect is that we have expression we have the need to talk about but as individuals how do we understand or find out if somebody might be suffering from a mental health condition um if if dr carol can help and understand that how we as individuals or friends and families can identify if somebody is self-requirement of health conditioning okay yeah so thinking that i'm talking about it's really very important but um sharing your concern your concern with people who care about you friends or relatives of family members who really concern for you and most of them who are really willing to listen to you and support you as well which is really important too now i'm just wondering about those people who can't read who can't draw so so i also wanted to support them seriously and how am i going to support them as well where where they can't even draw so everybody has their own ways of helping themselves perhaps drawing perhaps not writing or something else that we can actually work on it too to help the rest of who can do it as well i mean jerome you are nodding your head so i guess you're agreeing to it too so maybe when your your comment on that as well sorry so can i just clarify the question yeah so we've understood that there is a need for an expression and you have previously highlighted that uh it's good to be open but also by writing that people might not be uh very expressive or uh how how can we identify and help such people who would be uh might be suffering from mental health condition and as humans how do we identify and help and support such divisions i think that maybe we can take a slow step back a away from framing this as entirely being a mental health issue and maybe just remember that communication is something that we are all born to have and we need so communication and connection is a need for every one of us yeah so we we shouldn't be reaching out to another person because of the concern that there's another mental health issue going on in young person i think you should remember that this is just about a very sincere human to human communication and connection right so i think during the pandemic we have heard stories through our work with the migrant workers in the dormitory is that that workers can live in the same dorm room for 17 years and not have spoken to a word to each other so they really don't know about the other person who's been living in the same room for the last 17 years right and i think it's it's i mean there might be many reasons for that and it will take another platform to sort of discuss what might mean the reasons for those things but if you think about that situation can you imagine how stressful it is to keep to yourself every day 24 hours without connecting with somebody else right so actually connection and communication is so vital and so important so actually if we haven't heard from somebody that we know for a while what's stopping us from just dropping a text or giving them a call and saying hey how are you i haven't heard from you for a bit what's going on with your life right there's nothing wrong with that it's maintaining a relationship it's maintaining a friendship and we shouldn't be thinking that oh you're calling me do you think that i have a problem you know and and we shouldn't be having thoughts like that because we are really just doing what human beings are made for which is connection and communication yeah yeah thank you thank you for having that um and adding to this connection and communication i mr chivon you have been talking to michael perkers and also taking care of all the understanding and listening to the issues so in terms of understanding and the common themes around what people say what are the things that you want to highlight about the common issues that are being faced currently right now yeah workers want to get out of the dormitories right you know really really um they're really frustrated being uh starting those i think they are very worried about a second knockdown they are very stressed um i just had a phone call with um yesterday and he was like um i mean i want to say he found migrant leaders but he was like when can we go out again yeah so that is the question i've been getting for the last six months um and i mean we all are aware of the pandemic and risks and i mean the state has spent a lot of money to try to you understand that but also [Music] there's only so much time someone can spend either in quarantine or seeing only the same spaces and and endometries are built for i mean the environment also just the physical environment is also not one which helps someone relax yeah so um yeah that just bring that i'm just bringing that up as one of the issues and then another one is i think transform employers uh that's a big issue i mean that that they feel really uh that's difficult i mean there's difficulty coming back into the country right now compared to singapore to work by the same time the policy to allow workers to transfer is becoming uh the steps to make it a bit more restrictive than it was prior right so i think it was first liberalised to allow crop workers to cross sector and then later then tighten again so i think all these things uh so so one more one i really want to point out is that mental health is a type of very tangible issue it's it's anxiety is built because of life circumstances and the environment surrounding the person and so i i'm sorry so i really appreciate uh dr grant about bringing out that you know it's about connecting with people because the connection that they have with their employers or the systems they have must must have been quite difficult for someone to want to leave that arrangement yeah i also um so this is difficult but i think the connection that they have with others also because they're not able to invest in social coping in meeting people from the same village so um if we if you know uh like on sundays in the past workers congregate india right but they meet people from the same area together so there's like a little moonshine right and little partner right and uh and different parts right and so you see people that you're familiar with and they can share all their complaints with uh even if they don't tell anyone else but that social coping is kind of missing right now you mentioned that the aspect of communication connection is very important at the same time coping social coping has an important component but there could be a situation where somebody might be facing a mental health issue and he or she might want to get help early so um just to understand how important it is to get help early if somebody knows that he or she might be facing a mental health issue in spite of the efforts that one might need to put in so how how important it is to get an early understanding of the issue at the same time take help on that doctor okay i think in any situation i think raising it early and being able to understand it early is always helpful uh because at different stages of any kind of problem regardless of whether it's a mental health problem raising it early and understanding it early and talking it through early with somebody else is always helpful because at different stages of the problem there will be different ways of managing the problem right yeah so for example you could have an issue that very early on it could just have been managed with some practical help from external sources so other people could come in and provide practical help and that might have resolved the issue but if you don't resolve the issue at that early stage and then it goes into certain consequences then it might get a little bit more complex where you need more than just practical help you might need a little bit more specialized health for example emotional health and all that and systemic health or even medical help you know so i think addressing it early always has these benefits thank you thank you for sharing that uh in terms of um understanding and um uh addressing this need so in your ex experience dr carroll what have you come across recently that you would like to find out or in general what are the cases that goes through in terms of addressing the mental challenges so i was volunteering at the dawn for a month last may so i realized i realized a lot of things i also with healthserve as well so to add on to what jurong say the migrant workers did have communication problems and a lot of these common misunderstandings between the employer and them that caused the anxiety as well and not only that the employer may not even know how to navigate the healthcare system to add onto the stress where they get very frustrated and i think thanks to health that they really manage it well in a way that trying to help them navigate friends that one of the case that um is very strange and he he seems to have abdominal pain all the time and he went to sgh then a range of columns will be done not done yet appointment is maybe in june but then in the meantime he has anxiety and he started having chest pain and he was emitted from ambulance and go to nuh and any page so because of that he meets the columns of the apartment and he's he's so anxious that i need the corners with the appointment so who's going to help me to do that and he got lost along the way then after that he was sent to chinese for another quarantine 14 days and then the doctor over there saying somewhere else i could remember or saying something that oh you will need to get a reference from the public clinic again to get the colonoscopy appointment so the frustration of going around the whole whole system frustrated him and he he's young and he's not tearing and get anxious about it and he was saying that his employees not helping him at all so this this kind of things like health service really helped me and helped them help him really come straight to arrange the appointment and rather than going around the whole system and kept the um the subsidizer game and he's really confused so this is a communication and connection that we really need to step up to really help them and this is really a big gap that i feel that we can do more to help them when they can't communicate better thanks carol for raising that because during the pandemic what that experience has actually taught us that physical health and infection control had become so important and so vital at that time that a lot of times the mental health needs were actually neglected and overlooked yeah so a lot of people took a very medical approach to people who are presenting with these unexplained physical symptoms and overlooked the fact that it could have been contributed by actually emotional or psychological distress and that kind of took those leads kind of took a back seat for a while so actually this is the hope that you know in coming back better and building better after the pandemic is that the hope is that mental health needs will take the same importance as physical needs as well as infection control needs for highlighting that and one of the things that um i see more and more that mental health is getting more and more important and along all the spheres we have we are discussing about it that is a very important fact but in terms of how the future help or initiatives in terms of how adding to talking about it how what are the different initiatives or directions that we need to take in terms of addressing the mental health challenges in the near future or what what we are going to experience uh from here adding to what we already have how do you think that the gap can be filled by various initiatives and what would that be i think that i'm aware of several initiatives that are underway and they are all important i think so first of all the very uh big gap that needed to be addressed was actually the level of mental health literacy among the migrant worker population so we found that there was a health surface that was a there was a great need for that so currently there are initiatives to actually do outreach education sessions uh to help migrant workers understand what mental health is all about and to have the relevant vocabulary to sort of describe their inner experiences and what they're going through because the the experience that we actually have as practitioners in the hospital is that even with translators even with native language translators we found that very often microworkers in their native language may not have the relevant vocabulary to explain their psychological distress and that was one cultural barrier that we had to overcome so building up mental health literacy in the microworker population is one very big gap and it's a work in progress and number two actually it is to build up a call or rather having micro workers themselves know that they can potentially play a role to be a mental health ambassador themselves so they can be kind of like our colloquially termed indian cheese right the leaders in the pack that can sort of continue to promote mental wellness among their social circles right so they can keep the conversation going they can also help identify they can also help to you know look out or encourage each other to look out for each other right and to make sure that the connection continues right and also to you know bring it up when they suspect that maybe there's a mental health issue going on that's true and i think three there are several systemic challenges that will probably need more time in order for all stakeholders to come together and to agree to work on overcoming those systemic barriers in the healthcare system for example so that's going to be a continued conversation thank you thank you for having that um yeah i also think that we should have psychology because if awareness mental health awareness not only one day but should be also to the community to everybody as well who can really assist everybody not only the migraine with this everybody in the community as well they help each other that's a very important point so um this aspect is not just for migrant workers but every person is has some mental challenges or some mental health issues at some point of their life they experience it um not just uh openly deadly but yeah every person somehow experiences so in terms of um highlighting the um community and cultural um aspect of uh resolving mental health generally do you want to share about how um some of the examples that you have um you are a part of or initiatives that you are a part of in terms of um helping people understand um uh and bonding over um community and connection connecting over um different initiatives so could you highlight your experience then in terms of community participation and not just um migrant workers i see that migrant riders of support have got good support from local residents as well so uh can you touch upon those areas as well like synergy between migrant population and local through art and connections through social initiatives all right so one activity that we are doing in uh in migrant writers of singapore which we which we are inviting also different uh people from different countries is is the carnival of poetry wherein we invite um we invite different poets internationally uh from the migrant trial my local migrant local local poets and then from the migrant community and through this we come to understand the diversity although uh it's like um breaking the border or connecting connecting people through arts through this uh poetry poetry event that we are doing and from that we were we come to understand um may not be perfectly understand how how does how does a person the the background the work where um i mean the country that they came from but at least um uh on that part we we are able to have a sharing and we come to understand about their different cultures and we will have ideas on how to how to how to deal with them how to deal with different peoples and people and uh yeah this carnival of poetry although it's a diverse uh it's it's from different uh different cultures but its aim is to connect people to connect um uh connect uh poets to give inspiration to to the to the viewers to the community and um one more thing is that we have this uh facebook page that uh these are in me and it doesn't just because it's it's all about ours doesn't mean that we are just focusing about our talents and everything but then this uh this um facebook group has become a way for us to connect with each other and from this from this through this facebook group also um i was able to uh find new friends and um i just want to share something about uh i think a month ago when i think almost all of them are going through something and i'm a little bit over overwhelmed because um how can i how can i because all of them come to me and share those all those things and of course i need to strengthen myself i need to make myself i need to normalize myself to at least uh support them give something out to share something with them that can lighten up those those feelings that they are they are feeling that they are dealing with so hearing all those stories and i feel like i also i also joke with them last uh that time that oh my gosh uh how come that it's like almost everyone is is going through something and it's it's not only it's not uh it's not something that is just just uh just something but it's a big thing that really involves their uh mental mental health and from that i also i also very thankful that i came to know my grand writers of singapore and through this i was able to know some uh some just like you psychologists that i can i can refer them to i can i i'm very confident to tell them that um um since i have a limited knowledge about about this thing because of course i might i can be a friend to them but um the knowledge i don't have that much i didn't i didn't study all those kinds of uh those psychological uh yeah and i have a limited knowledge and so um i i always i always tell them that just like this on um it doesn't mean that i am telling you that you have a problem about this thing but um why not we connect with this um we doctor like this and so that you can understand better what is going through what is building up inside you so um my current writers of singapore uh because of the of the supporting people also who are supporting migrant writers of singapore we are more confident to that we have somebody we have someone that who can help us to to at least to to bring these people bring these friends to we can refer these friends to in this uh in this um uh these professionals so i'm very very happy and at that time i one one friend really go through the point of um go through the point of thing being so to the point of uh wanting to to do something bad about herself and it's really like um as for you who is listening to this kind of to this kind of um uh what is that to this kind of uh those emotions it's it's really very hard and um i'm very thankful at that time that i know i know a doctor i know uh through this community i was able to uh i was able to refer her to that uh to that uh to that doctor and yeah they were they were able to she was able to speak with that doctor and i'm really thankful that we have this kind of community that um is giving support to us so through migrant riders of singapore through all the locals our friends who are supporting we are doing so much things about this about about helping out yeah thank you thank you for um sharing that in fact when i when i joined uh migrant directors of singapore i was in the poetry session and i could see the connection the emotion and the the raw emotion that was being shared and it was heartwarming at the same time i could relate to it because those were the expressions and feelings that if the most important part that is there is a support that somebody's listening to you and that's the point that was highlighted that you need to share you need to connect and that's the building block of having a good and a strong mental health ,False,True,True,False
Qo6OTQRis-k,VOS x MSC Navigating the Pandemic Webinar Highlights,UCqWXvKDxbm3JOPZm9ge1Gow,Voices of Singapore,2021-06-30T04:20:07Z,"Jointly organised by Voices of Singapore and Mind Science Centre, the Navigating the Pandemic Webinar aims to enhance your mental resilience and help you ...",[Music] good morning everyone thank you for the introduction and for the opportunity to be here today to talk to you about covet 19 and children i'm very excited to talk about this um because a lot of things have been happening in the last one year and especially the last one month i'm going to talk about the clinical impact of covet 19 on children the collateral damage that the pandemic has brought a little bit about the infodemic and then lastly covet 19 vaccine and just i would touch very lightly on variants as well because i know people are interested to hear about that so misc is something called the multi-inflammatory syndrome in children and in other countries it's called in europe it's called pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome and this is essentially a syndrome that's been reported in the u.s europe india various other countries not so much in southeast asia and this happens in previously healthy children slightly older around the 10 age short of a range and this happens about one month after they've recovered from covert 19 infections so when they have covered 19 infection about one month later all the way up to two three four five months later they can develop the syndrome where they come in very ill with fever very lethargic irritable and primarily tummy problems so they get diarrhea vomiting tummy pain not so much coughing or blocked nose and these children tend to be fairly sick which means that more than half of them end up in intensive care they get multi-organ failure primarily involving the heart and two percent of them will die from misc there was a small cohort at great ormond street hospital in london where they looked at the six months follow-up of these children and actually at six months many of these kids were still not fully recovered so many of them still had fatigue and muscle weakness and still needed ongoing physiotherapy and rehab so this is something that we have not seen in singapore and not in southeast asia but obviously singapore has a very international population and we are on the lookout for this for children who have had coveted infection the shadow pandemic right so the collateral damage that has happened um as a result of covet 19 and one of the large collateral damage areas is mental health i think first of all the diagnosis of having the infection in itself is extremely stressful children will feel shame they feel stigma there's bullying i had one teenager who had eggs thrown at her front door by her neighbors when they found out that she had covert 19 infection her friends in school stopped talking to her um she was bullied and you know people would cross the road when they saw her on one side of the road and these were effects that um happened very early on um in her infection when she was still in hospital she tried to stay off social media during her time in singapore because it's in hospital so that she wouldn't see all these comments that were going on from her friends and it can really affect um their self-esteem uh in their mood when children are diagnosed with covet-19 they are isolated for a long period of time at the beginning of the pandemic some children were isolated for four to six weeks now it's shorter it's probably more around three weeks but it is a very long stressful time for them during which time they have multiple swabs the people that they see are all dressed in full ppe and they don't really get to touch anyone there's very little direct contact and it's very stressful for them in singapore we saw the same thing so in singapore there was a reduction in all the vaccination rates during circuit breaker last year this was more obvious in the private clinics than the poly clinics and then hospital had a least disruption and this was most significant for mmr and mmr and chickenpox vaccines which kind of ranged from sort of 25 to 73 percent um in terms of the vaccine rates and these for unvaccinated children are obviously at risk of infection uh measles is likely to reappear when travel resumes and if these unvaccinated children don't have catch-up vaccines then the potential is that there may be a measles outbreak within singapore and why was vaccination disrupted um so they looked at the reasons uh and actually number one was people were afraid of getting infected so people didn't want to go to clinics they didn't want to go to hospitals they were also restricted because there were travel and movement restrictions they were not able to access healthcare because the hospitals and clinics said well come only if it's absolutely necessary and of course their priority changed right so the priority really was to stay away don't get covered um you know let's not worry about the routine vaccinations yet but to be honest within singapore routine childhood immunization has always been an essential health service even during circuit breaker so i think this is now the time to think of our children we have a lot of adult experience with vaccines from singapore other countries showing worldwide safety there's real world efficacy in israel and qatar for the uk and south african variants we do need more data on that but generally the vaccine for variants may be slightly less effective to prevent infection but will likely still prevent severe illness and death and really the fact that we see more variants just reflects the surge in our community cases and that's something that we would like to avoid all right so i think we're all really hoping that we can move at some point from phase three to phase four and that will require everyone's cooperation and help to comply with all the measures as well as vaccination so i would like to thank everybody for really being very good so far and very compliant in helping to get us there [Music] besides the covet 19 pandemic there is a pandemic of fear and as you heard from dr chan there is also um info pandemic or inferdemic so friend from the world health told me that if there are two pandemics running together the word is actually syndemic s-y-n-d-e-n-i-c a synthetic more than one pandemic and this pandemic of fear today is initially was a pandemic of the virus the fear of the virus but now there's fear as you read through the social media the fear of the vaccines the complications the side effects so all these memories are stored in the partner brain called the hypocampus it's a small part of the brain you put a finger just above your head and starting the top here you'll touch the part of the brain called the hypocampus that stores in all your memory and and this part of the brain is near to a part of the brain called the limbic system that modulates your mood so they feel very very happy the neuroscience of singing you see that uh singing calls a a elation of a mood but also this this kind of music uh a singing itself that stirred up to only memory improves concentration we'll talk about that in our research but there's a search of chemicals in our brain we call dopamine and oxytocin and these chemicals the cell lifts up our mood and gives us a sense of well-being you see in this this uh a brain scan called the pet scan the red area is area where there is increased glucose uptake that means the this part of the brain which is the back of the brain is working uh very hard now so even if you're watching this webinar and you're looking at your laptop your computer and if you do a brain scan now this part of the brain the back of your brain will be lighting up because in fact my image the image of this of the slide or image of the speakers is at the back of your brain and so this part of the brain works very very hard so this brain here is the brain of someone with early dementia so you see although it's dementia not all part of the brain has decayed or declined but certain parts are still functioning quite well so in music reminiscence we often like to stir up the part of the brain to increase the the glucose uptake and also increase the neuroplasticity that stirred up more brain cells around here so this is the the basis of some of the research we're doing there are a few other things that you must must remember i want to run through with you um the thing first thing is the new norm you have heard of from dr chan uh also about the new norm that he must acknowledge there is a there is a change in our lifestyle now and so he got to put on mass uh social distancing vaccination the second point which uh dr chan has emphasized on is the information and we have so much thing but inundated and she and i'm i'm glad it's the new word called info dammit now and there's so much things and sometimes there are wrong news or fake news someone asked me what do you which one do you look to i i still look to the ministry of hell website and that particular person's size and well there may be a few missteps in the ministry of health website but in general there are good people down there giving us information and also important to have exercise regular exercise so you see this group of people they belong to a numbers group they go kind of exercising they wear they put on masks and this this little this space here below here this beautiful uh picture uh someone asked me i gave a talk to some doctors and they asked me have you been to switzerland switzerland recently it's a beautiful picture i said no this is in the botanic gardens i took a picture of the botanic gardens this picture was taken 40 years ago when i first came to work in singapore in 1981 i went to botanic garden and i had a crack of dawn and it was a beautiful scene it's not far from the but from the uh the rainforest and fourthly you must think of your diet so if you have you have anxiety you cannot sleep don't go and drink alcohol and it makes it worse because it it affects your sleep architecture in fact it affects your sleep pattern and in fact last last uh last week i have some students who asked me can i have can i prescribe from sleeping pills for them because they cannot sleep then and ask them why is that how come you're not sleeping well that well we're having an exam and we're going to study and um i've been drinking about four or five cups of coffee at night obviously you cannot sleep so the diet is very very important and then some form of relaxation we call it mindfulness practice you're not too familiar with it you can check the the apps the app called mind5 mind five um it's free you can go into it uh this is the important study because many people told me that well why should i do all this kind of relaxation this mindfulness is what is about mindfulness what is evidence based now the good news is uh we often hear a lot of bad news the last last two years now the good news is the the mind science center has published the first study in the world in which we have brain scan of people doing uh mindfulness the seniors doing mindfulness practice and the person who introduced this is our our late friend mr we sinto now of course number six is recreational activities a singing is something you must do all the time uh gardening is a paper published uh by angela sia from end parts and also art also by professor mahindran from the national mine science center so all these things you you can do we have a friend in australia called mr um boon you uh is his maroon or trap in sydney and cannot come back and every morning you'll take the nice pictures of the sea the seashore the booming of the breakers in the in the city and send it to us so photography is also interesting and finally uh most important i think is the social capital you know social capital of people who can take care of you when you are in in a when you are very isolated so these are the group of the namaste people if they form a group they've been walking now they begin to care for one another in a pandemic some of the people this group are widows and widowers and others would ring them and say can we can we buy the the mask for you or can i take the medicine for you so there's a lot of the community uh social connectedness which i think is very very important for everyone i think so it builds up a sense of compassion and a care for all of you [Music] it's so wonderful to see everyone today and thank you so much for coming i'm very excited to be sharing a little bit about um singing today and you know we just heard wonderful things about uh from dr chan and professor khoa on the technical aspects of the situation right now in in the world and which is has been brought great light to and been so informative to us and so what i'd like to bring and share with you today is actually um the artistic aspect to singing and why singing is so relevant to us and what makes singing so special compared to any other art form so i i i will be doing some uh physical movements as well so just expect some to move a little bit today but we are not going to be i'm going to be um trying my best to finish my slides today okay so before we begin i i'd like to share with you the four things that we'll be talking about why singing what aspects of singing help the most so that you are aware of what to look up for when you are singing and what do i do with my voice if for those who are singing for the first time or who have no idea how to sing or how to start these are some pointers and also some future singing opportunities to explore so writing on uh what professor just said on the seven habits we'll we will also be giving you seven habits of effective singers and i'm going to be breezing through because i'm wary of time so you might want to snap pictures of the slides if you uh if you would like to remember some of the points more so in a nutshell about a bit about what i do for those who have not seen me before i'm a conductor and composer artistic director of voices of singapore and my biggest passion in my life lies in bringing communities together so a lot of the work that i do is centered around voices of singapore we have many many different groups and i do a lot of lecture work around the region as well at voices of singapore we have professional and amateur groups community audition and non-audition groups everyone just comes together to sing because they love it we also work with professor quiet he shared on the dementia prevention and these are some of our participants in red and we have a choir for children with special needs called the starlight music making program so with all these every year we actually have a voices of singapore festival that we bring together 10 000 people from all walks of life at chimes hall in three days and we just sing you know and it's just the most amazing experience when everyone comes together to sing with no agenda no competition and just having fun you might have seen some of our projects home virtual choir that we did last year during the circuit breaker and also our spaces at capital theater where we have most of our rehearsals so i'm going to go mo straight into the first topic or the first question why singing and i like to bring an artistic perspective to this with a quote that means everything to me singing can heal the wounds that medicine cannot touch and this means so much to me because we sing when we are at periods of heightened emotion we sing when we are at our lowest points we sing when we are together with friends we sing and we can feel this extra level of communication that transcends speech because songs are able to capture something that goes beyond what we would normally be able to articulate in our rational logical minds i would tell somebody to say hey don't fret there is hope or i would sing the person a song if i were to say uh sing a song to the lyrics of somewhere over the rainbow way up high there's a land that i heard of once in a lullaby it makes no sense at all without the music but with the sound of my voice i'm able to pull emotions out that naturally create uh physical release of emotion i'm gonna demonstrate to you with this text [Music] [Music] that release of text and emotions really help to bring an extra level of imagination hope and motivation to the listener and that is why singing really makes uh such a different uh messaging to the person who is listening to it and also to the person who is singing it now we go to the next topic which aspects of singing help us the most right which is it the mouth that knows or is it the way i am uh moving or what is like the actual aspect of singing that help us the most and i'm just going to pinpoint this to a very specific two aspects a key skill in singing is learning to focus on controlling your rate of breathing and this activates part of the brain that are linked to emotion so if everybody would join me to do this gesture we're just going to relax with by stretching outwards and then we are going to make a sigh with just this ah in a nice light sound okay so join me now and let's take a deep breath from your mouth and nose breathe in stretch upwards as much as you can inside [Music] very good let's do this one more time and breathe in and side now for those who are singing for the first time this sound that you make might might feel very strange it might feel like there is is nothing to do with your speaking voice but it actually releases a lot within you and you can already feel that emotional release just by making the sound and breathing deeply into your body so the sounds made by our voices actually allow freedom of emotions which words cannot express so i'd like to do another um another example for you where we were always looking to tomorrow for for um for a brighter day for uh to to look towards the period of postcovid so i would say tomorrow tomorrow i love you tomorrow you're only a day away right in the most dramatic sense but when i sing it suddenly something very special appears on my face that is much more accessible and natural and this is the song of the lyrics from the musical annie i'm going to sing that instead of say that to you and i want you to realize what happens on my face tomorrow tomorrow [Music] okay so naturally the expressions and facial emotions the body really feels a lot more connected to the sound and therefore emotions are being able to be released in a much more organic and natural sense which speech and sharing thoughts will never be able to match up to so when your mood is up naturally you strengthen your immune system and you respond to stress factors in a more positive way and you enhance sleep patterns life is a song so let's sing it together as a community from all of us at vos thank you so much for attending our webinar a huge thanks to professor kwa and also dr chan thank you everybody [Music] ,True,True,True,True
u8HHlxdOfz8,Being mentally aware and it&#39;s wellness with Abel Peh (The Melting Pot Podcast),UCoLxdwMMzTzVNgVtRLbUZAQ,The Melting Pot,2021-05-31T10:47:32Z,"In support of the Singapore Mental Health Film Festival, we are happy to release a special episode in conversation with Abel Peh   . . Abel is the Programmes ...",[Music] welcome to another weekly melting pot episode today i'm in conversation with abel bay in singapore abel is the program manager of the singapore mental health film festival and i am in conversation with him of course in singapore but not in person as you can obviously tell thank you so much for joining me today abel thank you pyo for inviting us on yep so i mean it is something that i was really very keen to talk about your film festival because i think it's a very very important conversation today and the fact that you have an entire festival you know which focuses on mental health i thought was absolutely amazing and i which is why i was very keen that we have this conversation so could you tell me my the listeners of melting pot a little bit about the film festival right so yeah this is actually the first mental health you know related film festival in singapore and i think it started its inauguration run was in 2019 preparation work began in 2018 with a group of individuals you know all from very different aspects of life you know contributing their various expertise you know to group whether is it communications marketing whether it's program creation whether it's events management so we got a group of friends to come together and i guess that was also when i got in touch with you know the current executive director at the festival uh she is cheryl and so in 2018 you know i had a conversation with her back then i remembered it was at nus you know i was in my you know second year of undergraduate study and i wanted to launch something at nus relating to mental health because i felt that you know the provisions at nus at least in the university campus were not very robust and i felt that it was not very accessible to students and yet at the same time i felt that many students were experiencing you know mental health distress and not knowing where to seek help and i wanted to do something on campus and i happened to get in touch with cheryl and i had a conversation with her i remember that afternoon at university town just a random bench outside the yoga studio and we had a chat and we realized that you know our visions were pretty much aligned and insane of what we hoped to achieve and she then had already you know launched this idea of a film festival and she invited me to join the team then and you know that's how i got involved and back then you know the the mission i guess is really to challenge the stigma of mental illnesses you know through the use of three mediums i think films very powerful medium evidently from the film festival title every film is always accompanied with a panel discussion this allows you know and it's usually adjacent you know right after the film we have a panel discussion because i think when we watch a film films have this very powerful you know capacity to get in touch with certain emotions and certain feelings which would otherwise not be possible say through you know speech say writing say theater each of them have their own you know ways in in helping to emote certain emotions and films that has its own way as well and so when we create that vulnerability during the film watching process and then we move into a conversation where we take advantage you know off of that state of mind you know and launch a conversation into a topic that audiences will probably be able to empathize with much better i know after watching the film or whether is it from a belief experience or you know just from you know watching you know the the how the director has portrayed the issue he allows for more i guess safe and open spaces and more comfortable people are more are less on the guard and this allows for that conversation to come on and hence that conversation is actually i would say pretty much key to the festival it is where we bring in you know professionals persons with leave experience and also community partners so we provide a more i guess a holistic understanding to the mental health issue from various disciplines as opposed to say you know panel full of just medical experts on panel full of persons recovery we have a combination of different uh profiles and so that could help launch a conversation uh in a more comprehensive manner and we leave it up to the audience to decide you know which you know which perspective they may be more inclined towards or maybe you know uh get an understanding of a perspective that they are not so used to yeah and the last medium we look at workshops so workshops if you could see you know through the festival you know two week festival for instance that we have this year two weekends spending across two weekends we have a total of eight workshops in total and this workshop's aim is to focus on the self so we often talk about caring for other people launching conversations into how we can support persons around us or in the workplace in schools but often we forget about the element of self so the workshop comes in where we take you know different mediums such as you know pottery such as eating such as journaling to allow i guess the patrons to learn certain self-care skills and eventually be able to apply these into their life so these are the three mediums that the festival utilize films panel discussions and workshops and with the main element i guess with films as a catalyst you know to promote and advocate conversation so that's pretty much you know what we hope to achieve you know with the festival and what kind of because you said that the festival was launched in 2019 so last year did you have the festival in 2020 or was it virtual what what exactly because i mean i think 2020 is a year which confuses everyone and it draws a blank in a lot of cases so did you continue to to have the festival or you took a break and you're gonna have it now this year yeah 2020 was a extremely challenging time for a team yeah we had a whole list of lineup of programs ready to be launched because the festival was supposed to take place in february last year 2020 so that was supposed to be the second run you know after 2019 yeah and not in in in late january early february uh things were already implant we had marketing installed we were ready to work with systick our ticketing partner to grow up these films we're already pushing out our marketing creative materials on our social media pages and then come dos corn yellow and then you know with the whole uncertainty surrounding whether events could still go on and so we had i remember cheryl and i uh this afternoon we we were following very closely with the ministry of health's guideline because people were speculating here and there and we actually had an afternoon we sat down at coffee club at you know one of the the malls and then we were discussing you know with all this uncertainty you know and all this cost that you know are at hand you know are we going to continue with the plan or are we going to make a decision right now to say let's halt the the program let's wait for more clarity with regard to the situation before we kind of decide how to proceed and eventually we did make a very tough decision uh despite all the preparations in place to say you know we may have to hold this year's festival we may have to postpone it till later part of the year and so within a night you know we had to call you know our sponsors and partners to check with them because people were pulling out you know we had workshop partners from the mental health agencies who were involved in the program but they came and say because of their guidelines for the organizations they work with they can no longer be part of this program so it was a lot of fire fighting and a lot of brave decisions that you know the team has to make and so we did not the festival did not happen uh we were initially intending to postpone it till october in 2020 but the situation wasn't really i guess showing a lot of improvement then in terms of restrictions to programs and large-scale events so we decided to cancel the 2020 festival and we're happy to be you know presenting at 2021 now in just you know slightly less than slightly more than a month yeah wow congratulations on that so the films that you had lined up for 2020 are you are the same films being rolled over for 2021 or do you have a new lineup lineup of films yeah yep so we had we had majority of the films from 2020 festival kind of brought for not brought forward to the 2021 festival but we have in addition to these films added new film editions specific to the kovit 19 situation so i think you know with regard to film selection i think as part of the festival i think how we actually go about it is that we look at you know what are the mental health issues that are i guess relevant and concerning to i guess the team so we have a discussion amongst team members you know especially you know you know we have people from different age groups from the youths to working adults and i guess through our connections and friends we hear say uh what are the mental health issues that people felt felt like they need to know more about or are concerned about but there isn't that much programs or conversations about it and so we pick up these themes and then we decide as a team you know what which mental health topics we should focus on and then i know we will go online google imdb will speak to our international film festival partners to look at the the varying options that we have and then we will spend hours and hours watching all films and then finally deciding you know whether a film is appropriate in terms of its characterization is there a lot of over dramatization of mental health issues such that it may i guess you know you know him bite back in a wrong way or is it is it appropriate age content appropriate you know yeah so these are the different considerations that we had and based on this 2021 festival we decided to bring i guess for all the films from last year but we have made some tweaks to the panel conversations so for instance like you said uh you need to be more relevant right yeah there would be a lot of different aspects of mental health which will come up because of the pandemic and because we've what the world has gone through in 2020 and continues to be experiencing it so yeah no that makes that makes a lot of sense so do you you'd mention that you know you also have conversations with the international film festival partner so so is the mental health film festival something which is showcased in other parts of the world as well yeah so definitely i think one of the main inspirations that ies cheryl and the team had initially when proposing the singapore mental film festival is inspired also by the mental health film festivals in the western countries so specifically you have the new york city mental health film festival which has been around for very long time you also have the rendezvous with madness film festival which also focuses on toronto and canada okay so yeah these are the main partners that the singapore mental film festival you know we constantly have conversations with we partner up with one another we share films that we thought may be suitable for you know the audiences on both sides of the world and yeah so it's definitely something that where we we got inspired and we decided you know in asia specifically in singapore there is no film fest we have a lot of film festivals specifically to embassies to language to culture but not so much to mental health hence another singapore mental film festival yeah which is uh so are there any other similar film festivals within southeast asia are you aware of any others or is singapore the the only showcase for southeast asia not that i am aware of that could possibly be but not that we you know as as far as team knows we do not really know if there are any other mental health specific film festivals in southeast asia okay these films are feature length or do you also have shorts and documentaries and are they all in english or do you have other languages as well with which are subtitled so that you know it covers a bigger spectrum across the globe how do you work that yeah so we do have feature length films and these can be in terms of drama in terms of you know autobiography documentary so we do have a mix of it in fact we have a mix of this three you know in our current lineup for the 2021 feature film lineup and then we also have a a series of short films so these films that length from 10 minutes to 20 minutes and these films are sourced both locally and overseas also related to the mental health topic that we are hoping to you know venture into yeah so these are conversations that we have with the short film you know distributors if the directors themselves and we you know have discussions on whether we could bring the films in and so the short film is part of the program as well so usually what happens in a seating in a in a program seating is that we will have a little introduction at the front we will have a short film screening uh and then we'll have the feature film screening and then we'll have a panel discussion discussion pretty much that's the format yeah yeah yeah how much of local contribution do you see i mean okay this is only going to be your second edition but say between 2019 and 2021 has there been a larger contribution from local directors and production houses towards whether it's a feature land film or or shorts have you seen more of an engagement with the local film fraternity you're listening to a fusion of stories recounted for the first time ever by some fascinating people from across the globe with me kyle on this very unique and special podcast series melting pot in retrospect i think over the past two years there is a an increase in that kind of connection and engagement with local filmmakers about to a very small extent only because i think a bulk of the future feature length i think in singapore at least i think we do not have that many filmmakers that produce feature length films and specific to mental health is even lesser so we have those that look at comedy for instance you know we have we have jack newmarkly you know they're coming up every chinese new year with with their own film so this will not be so appropriate for the film festival like it's a very niche area and mental health team cannot be a sub section not a small 10 minute scene but it has to be a dominant i guess a theme throughout the entire film so this is something we don't see much in singapore so it's very hard to find a feature length relating to mental health though there are a few in our neighboring countries hong kong especially and and we have a malaysia malaysia as well so we have had films from malaysia and this year we're having a film from hong kong on dementia on caregiving and so that's pretty much for future life films for short films we engaging more local filmmakers and i think as part of the festival we have also started this short film youth competition i was going to ask because you know the film schools in singapore you could get the students to actually start to think about mental health and to st to start to engage with something that is so serious you know and i was gonna actually it's interesting that everything that i had listed out to ask you you've already you've gone like 10 steps ahead of me and no which is amazing that it's almost like you're um yeah you've been able to figure out my thought success so yeah no so i think that engaging the youth uh and you had mentioned also that at your univ at nus there were situations you know there were people who were whether it had been identified that people did have mental health issues whether it's depression or whatever it may be whatever category so i think for you to then look towards the youth is is is a very it is a very positive way forward so have you been able to see shorts coming in from the different you know the different film schools that are in singapore yes huge reception so we launched you know whenever you add the word competition right it automatically i think creates this whole you know it it motivates the young so yeah yeah so yeah so interrupted you yes yeah i think i think people like competition people like to you know you know that adrenaline rush that goes with it especially in singapore right yeah so so the film the short film youth competition you know it started in 2020 you know we later in 2019 we bunched out you know our engagements beyond the film festival to engaging you know the youths because the festival will likely attract you know usually the young adults or the adults you know also because of the the content classification of the films which has to be rated and some can go up to m18 and above and so specifically wanted to engage the youth school going youths and hence we have the shot from youth competition where we you know we launched and then we invite yous you know from 18 to 35 you know to come produce a short film relating to mental health and it is not just a call for application but on a part of the film festival we conduct workshops what is used for free so this mainly in the form of mental health workshops to equip them with you know relevant mental health information so they know how to portray these you know appropriately in their films and also i guess a latent function is really to expose these used to mental health content as much as they were used for films but also for their own knowledge and awareness second we we have production workshops so we help amateur filmmakers in learning and equipping themselves with some skills ranging from script writing to you know film editing you know and post production work so these you know so we provide them with some workshops and then they have you know a period of a month or two you know to produce these films and then they send it in to us and this year we saw some 200 over youths participate and we received over 60 short films mission and we are we we have we are in the midst of judging and now we we will be having a short film premiere on facebook in may where we share these films to the public and before we're going to share all the films so we will only be sharing the top 10 films that have been shown and then these films will also be a part of the festival this films will be a part of festival so we don't usually leave the films as it is after the but we make sure we squeeze every film dry the content so from last year's we had above and beyond the 10 films we have the non-shortlisted films we reviewed them we thought that some of them may have important contents although cinematography may not be that good we take them out we use them for engagements with partners and we invite the filmmakers to share their stories through different engagements with you know production or mental health agencies so this is kind of like a year-long engagement post a competition post festival that we you know hope to extend the film you know further yeah i think it's important because it it shouldn't just be restricted to the festival and then for an entire year there's no conversation around it then i think the impact is also lost and and it's very very i think it's imperative in today's times to have an ongoing discussion and through your platform you are able to continue to create that awareness which i think is is quite commendable and you know it's interesting to see how i mean looking at you you're so young but the passion the enthusiasm the ability to be able to work together as a team and bring it to the forefront i think is commendable so i mean that's that's fantastic and i'm really looking forward to be personally able to because it is in singapore so to be able to actually come and view some of the films yeah so in 2019 out of all the films that you screened which film had in your mind had the the most impact and which is the film that connected with you know the audience and with you and your team members was there any one film that kind of stood out for you let me let me have a let me have a thing it's like two years ago and um the lineup that we had last two years ago i think one of yeah it's been really long i don't exactly remember the specific contents uh only also because i've been watching a lot of other things yeah no okay it's fine it's it's not i mean it's not i was just curious that's all yes it doesn't come to mind it's fine yeah it's not so have your um obviously you've said that the festival is going to be sometime in may what what are the dates for the festival so it's happening from the 22nd to the 30th of may okay two weekends and how many feature length films will you be screening and how many shorts will you be screening we are screening nine feature films okay nine short accompanying these visual films and then we have nine conversations so it's nine nine nine yeah and any particular reason for the 999 well sos maybe yeah gosh oh it's been so nice talking to you abel thank you and you know i think it's very important what you have you and your team has put together and i do believe that it is sustainable and i'm sure that you know year on year it the festival will go from strength to strength so i do wish you and your team all the very best and what kind of marketing is involved will people be able to get you know get tickets through you mention cystic but also is it possible for people from outside of singapore to have you know the opportunity to see some of the films after the festival is is there some kind of a platform that you've created for that right yeah thanks for this you know plug you know yeah no i think tickets could still ticket sales are already out and i think you know audiences in singapore can purchase the in-person theater tickets through cystic so this will happen you know on the 29th and 30th so the 29th and 30th are our in-person screenings so these screenings will happen at the national national gallery singapore but throughout the festival from 22nd to the 30th we are having a hybrid program you know where we on our website at watch.smhff.com we have put up a platform where you know individuals can rent films and then they can watch the live panel conversations at the comforts of their own home but these are only available unfortunately for the singapore audience okay also overseas audience will not be able to join us we would love for this to be extended outside of singapore but a lot of distributors are very concerned about film rights rights yeah i can understand that yeah yeah yeah yeah no but you know i mean the fact that singapore people in singapore will be able to not just in person but with this you know this arrangement be able to get involved and today the virtual world is the way things are so you know the fact that they can just in the comfort of their home be able to see live discussions i think that that's quite amazing so yeah i i hope i'm able to publish your episode or rather this episode before your your your festival um i will try my level best to do that because you know i mean i have like back-to-back stuff and melting pot is like you

553srn65ZG4,[FULL] Only groups of 2 allowed to dine in from June 21 | Task force press conference (June 18),UC4p_I9eiRewn2KoU-nawrDg,The Straits Times,2021-06-18T11:02:23Z,"Watch the full press conference, held by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19. Dining in can resume from next Monday (June 21), but only in groups of up to ...",good afternoon since the last press conference we have seen the emergence of a large and growing cluster at bukimira view market and food center the number of cases in the community has somewhat stabilized but it's not going down significantly and we are seeing several unlinked cases every day therefore we remain concerned especially when we have yet to achieve a high level of vaccination minister ong will give a quick update on the progress of our vaccination program later once again i want to encourage singaporeans to get vaccinated as soon as possible especially those whose jobs require frequent interaction with a large number of people including hawkers and market store owners vaccination not only protects you but also your co-workers your customers as well as your loved ones if you are above 60 years old you do not have to make an appointment just walk into a vaccination center now and you will be able to take your check as we step up our vaccination we have also intensified contact tracing efforts and are testing even more extensively to ensure that we can pick up as many cases as possible and as early as possible if you have been informed to get tested i urge you to do so promptly so that you can help us prevent further spread of infections given the continued transmission that persists within the community and the current level of vaccination the the multi ministerial task force has decided to take a calibrated approach towards further resumption of activities that was due to start from monday dining in will still be allowed to resume from monday but we will start with a smaller group size of two we will also ramp up rapid testing for those working in high risk settings to give us greater assurance to open further borrowing unforeseen circumstances and developments in the pandemic we will increase the group limit for dining in and indoor mass off activities to 5 from mid-july this is a more cautious approach to minimize the risk of spikes in cases and the formation of large clusters but we are mindful that the fmb sector will continue to need help and we will support them as we further roll back some of the safe distancing measures next monday we do expect the number of kovit cases to go up some more in the especially in the weeks that follow this is something we are prepared for but we must continue to stay vigilant and abide by safe management measures this will help us to keep pandemic under control and allow us to continue reopening in a safe and sustainable manner we have kept our borders tight for some time now and this has taken a heavy toll on our families and the economy many families are waiting for their migrant domestic workers to arrive to help care for their elderlies their children and their loved ones many projects have been delayed including our housing projects because of the lack of skilled construction workers singapore's business and travel hub status has created many business and job opportunities for singaporeans over the years many of these businesses also have regional or global operations and they will need to travel in and out of singapore to manage these we have to find ways to progressively open our borders to keep these businesses afloat in addition to the appropriate precautionary measures vaccinating our population is key to allowing us to progressively and safely open our borders to meet the needs of our families and their businesses once we have achieved a high level of vaccination we will be able to further reopen our economy adjust our border measures and allow more community activities to resume let me now say a few words in the mandarin generally that um to give a quick update thank you kim yong hello everybody good afternoon uh let me provide some numbers on infection as well as on vaccination first on the infection over the past seven days there were 94 locally transmitted cases compared to the previous seven days of 41 cases so he has gone up over the last seven days i mentioned earlier there are three kinds of cases those who are linked and already isolated linked but not isolated and unlinked so over the last seven days the split between the three were 53 28 and 19 and as compared to the previous seven days the split was 76 5 and 19 so the percentage of unlinked numbers has actually stayed quite stable at 19 so the so despite the overall number going up percentage of unlinked is actually quite managed quite well managed the 14-day moving average of the time taken to isolate community linked cases from the day of the symptom onset is now 1.2 days and so i thought this is an important piece of information and it has gradually come down over the weeks because it means that when your point of symptoms onset and your point of isolation are very close together only 1.2 days the infected person have much less chance of moving around and transmitting to others and that also indirectly then affect unlinked cases and lower the unlimited cases the cases over the past few days are largely driven by the cluster at bukit merah view market and food center although it is largely an open a open air area there were still fairly widespread transmission so dms professor kenneth mark will later explain what are the likely reason for transmission in such a setting what are the kind of precautions that we can take to prevent such transmission he will also give an update on our testing operations which is essential to reduce the time lapse between infection and isolation now some updates on vaccination as of 15th of june more than 4.7 million doses have been administered with more than 2.7 million people have received at least one dose of the covet 19 vaccine let me give an update for various segments percentage of people that have at least received one dose or booked an appointment for vaccination yeah so seniors above 60 that's 75 percent three in four and today we continue to see about a thousand seniors walking directly into vaccination centers to receive their vaccination and i encourage them to continue to do so 45 to 59 age group 76 40 to 44 age group slightly lower 69 because we started this group only about a month ago and then for the latest group 12 to 39 29 and because we just opened this group last week response of students continue to be very encouraging so far 82 82 of students have either received their first dose or already booked an appointment locally there continues to be evidence to show that vaccination helps to prevent infection as well as to prevent serious diseases so our latest data shows as follows in terms of protection against infection we analyze or more h analyze the data of 29 000 persons on quarantine both vaccinated and unvaccinated and we derive that protection against virus infection or vaccination the protection of vaccination against virus infection is about 79.1 percent the uk did a similar study and came up with a number 88 we are 79 so not very very far off in terms of protection against severe illnesses after 629 local cases reported since 11 april who had not been fully vaccinated about 8.6 or 54 of them uh develop serious illnesses needing oxygen supplement or in icu yeah so that's among the amongst those that are not fully vaccinated as for those fully vaccinated they are all together 158 persons who have been infected two of them require oxygen oxygen supplementation and none of them have ever been in icu both also have pre-existing illnesses one was a patient at ttsh the other a resident at mainz view but if we exclude the patients and residents of tdsh and mines view all together there are 120 fully vaccinated individuals who were infected all of them either had no symptoms or mild symptoms so that's our evidence that we have collected locally there is increasing consensus among experts that covet 19 will likely be endemic what does endemic means it means that it continues to mutate circulate amongst us and we have to live with it and that means we must somehow adapt to this new situation so that even with a virus amongst us we can carry out our daily lives normally having businesses open all the time having able to travel overseas from time to time and do all these things safely without many people falling very sick and we have made progress because we have raised our capabilities for testing for contact tracing for quarantine and we have vaccinated a good part of our population so i believe we are now able to put circuit breaker behind us and keep most businesses open while navigating a wave of transmissions as we have just done over the past few weeks however with the delta variant we still need to be very careful of high risk settings meaning enclosed mask off and lots of interaction namely fmb and gyms so unfortunately we have to close these businesses during the heightened alert posture recently and further our borders continue to be remain largely close and aviation and tourism sectors continue to be very seriously affected so moving forward we also need to ensure that these businesses can stay open too and at some point we must be able to start connecting with the world and traveling and travel again but as a start fmbs and gyms cannot be opening and closing in tendon with infection cases and clusters but for us to adopt that approach our vaccination rates will have to be higher so that all of us are better protected so right now 49 of our population have received the first dose and 35 slightly over 35 percent have received both doses and are fully vaccinated it will go higher in the coming weeks and we are vaccinating as fast as we can but we are only constrained by supply we have the capacity to do a lot more but we are constrained by supplies and how many vaccines arrive in singapore so without higher vaccination rates the infection numbers will still matter because high infections can lead to more severe illnesses especially amongst those who are more vulnerable hence minister lawrence wong will explain how we will have to revise the scope of stage 2 reopening next monday 21st june and by taking a more cautious approach with reopening we buy time to get more people vaccinated so the imperative now is to boost vaccination we have done so compared to last month we have pushed up from administering 40 000 doses a day to 47 000 doses a day in the month of june and over the past two weeks we have the capacity to do more and only constrained by supplies so we are doing our best to confirm the delivery of more vaccines early it is not easy because vaccines is a scarce resource and highly demanded by many countries around the world but if we are successful by july we will be able to go beyond the current rate of 47 000 doses per day and open up many more bookings and we will provide further updates when we have confirmation on the final note i want to encourage employers to facilitate your employees vaccination give them time off to do their vaccination and some time to recover if they have side effects such as fever so after all a workforce with good vaccination is also a stable workforce and that is good for your business i will now pass the time to dms who will take us through how transmission and bookend mirror view has taken place thank you very much mr ong as of the 17th of june which was yesterday a total of 56 cases have been linked to the cluster that has been reported rising at 115 buckingham view this is the market and food center present at that location 21 of the 56 cases are tenants or stall holders or staff that work at either the market or food centre and 13 out of the 56 cases are visitors to both the market or the food centre the remaining cases are what we believe to be next generation of transmission involving other close contacts who did not have visits directly at 115 bucket mirror view but had close contacts with other cases that now have been diagnosed to be coveted infected and have themselves had a history of either working or visiting the market or food centre at this time it's still not possible for us to pin down specific modes of transmission but it's very likely amongst tenants stall holders and staff working at both the market and food center close contact amongst them would have contributed to exposure and spread both in mascon and muskoff settings that could have been also an element of formid transmission through the use of common facilities including the toilets for visitors at the market and food center these could also have been contributed but we know that a number of the stalls at the food center are very popular very popular lunch and dinner destinations and there are many who work in the vicinity who will visit both the market and the food center for their meals and some of the uh cases that we have interviewed have reported queuing up for at least 30 minutes which would ordinarily be considered a significant period of close contact if these visitors were close together and therefore it is uh clear that the circumstances were right in a setting where uh the market and food center had a number of cases for transmission to take place all staff and tenants at both the market and food center have been issued with quarantine orders and this includes also cleaners suppliers delivery drivers that we can identify as well as other regular visitors to the premises there the food center and market have been closed for cleaning and disinfect uh in disinfection from the 13th through to the 26th of june and these cleaning operations are facilitated and supported by nea as well as the town council a geospatial mapping of all cases in the vicinity was done which allowed us to identify both the market and the food center is a likely confluence of activity contributing to both exposure and spread and has triggered the need then for further swap testing operations to assess the degree of spread we have since initiated swap operations at various locations in the bukit mirror and tianbaru area in order to identify staff visitors who are at increased risk of exposure this includes testing mandatory testing for staff and tenants at one one five one one six bucket mirror view we've also done this for an ntuc food price supermarket at lancourt barrow close by we've done this also at the red hill market the red hill food center we continue to be doing the swap testing operations for staff and tenants at the tianbaru plaza retail outlets uh in red hill lane and radio close and other other premises in the vicinity and these are based on where the cases have been detected and the activity mapping there are other clusters that we are watching and this includes the various clusters in the vicinity as in enguard street in other parts of bukit mira view at ing hun street and we remain vigilant to assess whether or not there are any cl linkages that can be established between these other clusters and that at 115 bucket mirror view phylogenetic testing is being conducted for the for all these cases where we can do this this testing but the results of the phylogenetic testing is not out yet and we will use these test results when available to establish further links which would we will then report in due course overall we've performed quite a number of special testing operations in various locations where we picked up clusters of cases and this is part of a new strategy to be aggressive about testing to be aggressive about trying to throw nets out to disrupt chains of transmission so for example we've completed our testing at senkang west avenue at the ankerville coffee shop at gem in westgate and and that has allowed us to test nearly 10 000 people with only 10 positive cases picked up in the gen westgate cluster further opera testing operations still continue at aokang avenue at the iron orchard and of course at the bukit mira village a bukit mirror view we want to thank all the residents for stepping forward to be tested based on these swap testing operations now at booking mirror view and we want to remind all uh to be to continue to be disciplined in wearing your mask and in engaging in safe distancing measures and these continue to be important to disrupt future and present chains of transmission occurring we ask all who have had contact in these areas who visited these areas to monitor their own health and we encourage those who have yet to be vaccinated to make plans to register and to do so because vaccination does protect you and reduce the risk of you getting infected with covet-19 infection for the cases that we had reported so far at bukit mera view market and food center about 32 percent of cases had been vaccinated but 50 percent of unvaccinated people form the the infected pool and this does support the view that vaccination does protect you and reduce the risk of you getting infected as opposed to those who are not vaccinated the rest have only received at most one dose of vaccination or have not derived full protection from from their two doses of vaccination and we ask that all still continue to watch their health monitor it and continue to practice safety measures in this regard we want to thank all for for being patient with us as we launch these testing operations this is disruptive for the business in this area what we believe this is important because by participating in this and helping us to get control of this infection it contributes towards keeping bukit mera the tiangbaru area and the rest of singapore safe for all of us thank you good afternoon regrettably we are unable to proceed with our second stage of reopening in light of the latest outbreaks and the big cluster that we have discovered in bucket mirror and now we have to adjust our plans why are we doing this perhaps i can just give some perspectives we've received a whole range of feedback and views about this matter and generally i would say there are two schools of thought one school of thought is that we should push back the reopening to a much later date until we have cases that are near zero consistently for many days but this is in fact very hard to achieve and may not even be possible to do so given how transmissible the delta variant is and if we were to take this approach it will mean we have restrictive measures in place for many months which will cause many businesses to fold so that's not a very realistic option another school of thought is that well you know you say that this is going to be endemic our infection rates in singapore are very low compared to many other places which have already opened up more aggressively and you know on top of that we already have vaccines in place now so let's just proceed as planned to continue to ease up and relax measures and not overreact to each and every new cluster now i can understand uh the sentiments behind this and indeed we do want to proceed with our reopening more confidently but our vaccination rates currently are still not high enough to provide sufficient protection you have to look when it comes to vaccination you have to look both at the first dose which indicates the coverage of protection as well as the second dose which confers full protection and as you heard from minister aung kang just now our rates are 49 for first doses and 35 for full vaccination and that's not high enough particularly the full vaccination rates our vaccine coverage for the vulnerable groups the elderly it's not bad it's certainly above 60 but still not high enough especially for those who are above 70 years old we would like it to be much higher in order to protect our vulnerable groups so if we were to ease our restrictions too early big clusters can easily break out and overwhelm us and result in higher hospitalization and even mortality for the vulnerable groups that's exactly what we are worried about and you can see this happening in other places too for example in the uk they too have decided to push back their reopening timelines precisely for the same concerns and that's why we are not adopting either approach instead we are treading a very careful path forward based on a rigorous assessment of our current situation and hence we have decided to break up the reopening into two steps and our main objective with this staged reopening is to buy time so that we can continue to speed up our vaccination program what are the two stages of our reopening the first stage will proceed on 21st of june and we will allow all the higher risk activities well that you know have masked off like fmb dining and gyms and fitness centers we will allow all of that to resume but with the additional restriction that group sizes in these settings have to be limited to two persons on top of that we will put in place strict safe management measures across these higher risk settings for example when it comes to fmv establishments no recorded music will be allowed there will be no there will be restrictions on video screening tv screening in and live entertainment in fmb outlets the one meter safe distancing rule has to be strictly complied with so it's not it's not one meter between tables but one meter between groups of diners and that has to be strictly complied with and all patrons must keep their mask on at all times except when eating or drinking we will have enforcement officers going around to check and will take strict enforcement actions against any establishment that breaches these rules because they will really put everyone at risk in addition as we had announced before we will be putting in place a system of regular testing for workers in these higher risk settings using the rapid antigen test kits most of such testing can be done through a system of self swaps by the employees themselves and supervised by their employers so we will be training supervisors to do this we will have programs ready to train supervisors how to go about setting up this system in their respective organizations and the test kits will be made available for this purpose there will be a few small businesses who may not be able to organize these self swaps because they are they do not have the scale or the capabilities to do so so we will set up quick test centers for them all right so that the people can go there and get themselves tested too but for the most part we would envisage that most of the testing will be done through self swaps but supervised by employers and we will get this going from next week onwards and scale up progressively so that's the first step first stage of the reopening the second stage will happen around mid-july by then we expect that the system of regular testing will be in place across these higher risk settings we expect that our vaccination rates will be higher and then we can allow group sizes to increase to five persons with this phased approach we recognize that some businesses will be impacted and therefore the ministry of finance will continue to extend the support measures we will extend the support measures for the job support scheme and for hawkers who are self-employed we will extend the subsidies for fees for table cleaning and centralized dishwashing washing services as well as provide rental waivers and for workers who remain affected by the tightened measures we will also extend the covet 19 recovery temporary grant till 31st of july till the end of july and existing recipients of this grant who continue to require assistance can apply for a second tranche of the crgt support grant in july and the ministry of social and family development will provide more details on how to go about doing this as we resume activities from 21st of june onwards cases are bound to go up we have to expect that and be mentally prepared for this we will do our best to prevent large clusters from arising we've already implemented more extensive quarantine operations but there is a wider ring of people who are not close contacts but may have some possible exposures to the virus for example you are in the restaurant but not seated together perhaps a different table but you are in the restaurant at the same time or perhaps in a shopping mall at the same time when there are infected cases breaking out so we will implement a new testing process for wider ring fencing and to help curb the spread of the virus in particular we will send health alert smss to those individuals who are exposed and they will be required to undergo mandatory testing at designated centers so it's not just up to you if you're worried come forward but we'll send you an alert and it will be required for you to take to undergo a mandatory mandatory test at the testing center at the centers we will give you diy test kits to self-administer at home over subsequent days because we know there's an incubation period so one test is not sufficient so after getting tested at the center you will get diy test kits and you can continue to self-administer the swaps at home for subsequent days to confirm that you are not infected so this will be a new process that we are putting in place to help curb the spread of any new cases that may break out and we call on everyone in singapore to do your part to help us control the infection and prevent large clusters from breaking out finally i want to add to the comments made by my colleagues earlier and reassure everyone that we will continue to synchronize our reopening with our vaccination plans we are doing everything we can to ramp up vaccination as you heard from minister ong just now and we will be able to offer everyone a vaccination slot soon so please when it comes to your turn sign up get yourself jabbed so that we can achieve high vaccine coverage and protection levels then we can all look forward to reopening safely and resuming our normal lives let me just say a few words in mandarin to wrap up recovery grant thank you ministers and dms we have 15 minutes for the question and answer session dear members of the media please be reminded to ask only one question and keep your questions brief could we have the first question from s t timothy please thank you ministers and dms i'd like to clarify paragraph six of the release which says that a group of more than two persons who are not from the same household is not allowed to dine in together at fmb establishments does this mean that a family of five six or seven living in the same household can continue to eat out together and if we're trying to buy time for more people to be vaccinated what specific percentage of the population do we want vaccinated before we can go back to normal thank you we allowed um you know people from the same household to go out have multiple tables but they have to make very clear that they are from the same household that is not new we've allowed that before and we will continue to do so but if you are not from the same household then you cannot go and do multiple bookings of two tape of multiple tables and so the same rules that previously applied will continue to apply as to the vaccine coverage what are we talking about earlier we had provided two milestones we said that we were hoping to get initially at least 50 percent of the population fully vaccinated we thought that might be possible around august and then the second milestone was something like 75 percent of the population fully vaccinated so those are the two milestones that we continue to monitor if our vaccine supplies come in earlier and we hope they will we will do everything we can to do so then we can ramp up and perhaps achieve these milestones earlier and in accordance to the two milestones we will progressively ease the restrictions and measures both within singapore and at our borders thank you minister we will have the next question from taopao you yunto please grafton ministers dms like to find out a bit more about the fast and easy testing for the set establishments because um notice that the interval currently is set at 14 days we just want to find out whether um whether there's a need in time to come to bring it to a shorter interval i say seven days or even shorter because i'm especially given the higher exposure that these establishments have and also because on the cost of these tests are also much lower and also for the kids available to these establishments will will it come at a subsidized rate thank you thank you we won't rule that out as we have said we will make these test kits available for free to the establishment establishments over the next three months the we we want to get them get the process started and that's why we are now and all the agencies will be reaching out to the different establishments in these higher risk settings fmb personalized care the gyms to get them started on this model of an employer supervised self swap system if the need arises we can up the frequency but we want to get the system in place progressively and as we do so like i said we will then when when once that system is in place we will look at potentially raising the number of people to five persons around mid july but we are open to considering higher frequency tests and we will monitor the situation if the if if it warrants such a higher frequency and we will also um be making these test kits available for free during this heightened alert period thank you minister could we have the next question from cna cheryl please good afternoon ministers and dms so i would like to clarify why dining is still allowed at hawker centers at the two-person uh cap given that there is been a spate of cases at such premises and in line with that why is there also no change to the five-person social gathering rule given that that could also potentially be a high-risk setting where people are eating and having their masks off thank you thank you so that question is part of that first school of thought that i described earlier right which is cases have come up let's clamp down now and tighten everything across the board it's not uh i mean i understand the sentiments there but if we were to do that take that kind of an approach we would have to you know move from open close open close constantly um and i don't think that's a sustainable position and there may not be a need for us to do that especially as our vaccination rates continue to go up and provide protection to everyone in singapore and that's why as i said just now we are taking a more calibrated more careful approach not swinging to either extreme of shutting down restricting you know very tightly all the different activities no opening up tool recklessly but taking a more careful approach of allowing some resumption of activities still with appropriate safeguards and precautions in place and buy us time for our vaccination rates to go up i just want to quickly clarify that risk is not specific to a hawker centers is related to the nature of the activity which is masked off while you are eating and therefore it also applies to restaurants and specific more specifically for the particular cluster uh bukit mira view uh them uh a single portion of the cluster actually are not in the food section they are in the uh retail shops selling non-food items so the cluster itself is not specifically related to hawkers so the rules that we have put in place is a more cautious approach a calibrated approach taking into account the higher risk nature of the activity that we see in the eating places because you have to take a mask off while eating and you will be talking to one another and that's why we have calibrated the approach that way thank you ministers could we have the next question from channel 8 polling please hi ministers and dms pulling from chinese musia i want to clarification to make with regard to the dining uh just now earlier uh minister warm actually said that different households can still make multiple programs so am i right to say that if it's for a family of six they have three tables for now are they allowed to sit together then my question is earlier dms said that uh queuing at pocket centers for 30 minutes would be a risk so i'm not sure how can we overcome this moving forward would there be any enhanced measures taken to avoid thank you to clarify on the first point no if you have six people in the household you cannot book a table and have six people seated there it's two persons per table but with this is about multiple table booking generally multiple table bookings are not allowed and fmb establishments will be required to enforce that you cannot have a group of six friends and then you book three tables and then you have two two two and then you try and you know circumvent the restrictions book three tables side by side and you still interact with each other that's not permitted but we had made a concession previously for households people in the same household if you really want to go out three tables or two table but you're all in the same house so you make it very clear to the fnb outlet and we did allow such concessions before and we will continue to allow thank you very much for asking about queuing as well we've always been concerned about situations where people come together in close contact for longer periods of time you know even having people in close contact for 10 minutes five minutes sometimes can already carry a risk of both exposure and transmission in the food center setting it's a very popular stall you've got people lining up for 30 minutes that's already a significant duration of contact coupled with if they were queuing up but not respecting safety existing uh uh and they're quite close together that risk then further multiplies so this is a setting where certainly uh a person will be at higher risk of being exposed and for infection then to spread but this is not specific only to food centers you could have queueing that takes place when uh fast food outlets have special sales and people are starting to queue phone outlets uh have new launches of her phones and everyone starts queuing um gp clinics now offering synovic vaccines and people now and the eagerness wanting to get vaccinated queuing up in clinics it's not the setting per se but the fact that people are coming together for longer durations and where the safe distancing measures cannot be uh respected properly where people are now putting themselves at an increased risk for exposure so it's always better if situations like that are likely to occur consider coming back another day going somewhere else which is less crowded mitigate the risk for yourself to avoid putting yourself in such a situation thank you ministers and dms could we have the next question from yahoo nicholas minister once please earlier that we can uh now put the circuit breaker behind us and keep those businesses open and mr lawrence also said that the government doesn't want to swim to either extreme in the restrictions but i think you'll be aware conditions on the ground such that people are finding there's a really little practical difference between the current restrictions and a full lockdown uh many restaurants for example are voluntarily closing due to a lack of business so there's so many businesses suffering and growing anxiety among many uh my question is snap lockdown sustainable on an economic and social level until we reach the optimal level of assassination i'll take it um nicholas thank you for the question i think from the perspective of an fmb outlet what you say is true it's not very different from a lockdown because they are not allowed to open during this heightened alert posture but there are many other businesses in this during this period they are able to operate all the manufacturing plants the offices construction firms life continues for them and their livelihoods are not that affected so there is a big difference between heightened alert and circuit breaker depending on which sector you are in but as i mentioned earlier the high risk settings fmb gyms fitness centers they continue to feel as if this is a lockdown and how to resolve it as we have mentioned i think the answer lies in partly our testing tracing and isolation capability but very importantly is our ability to raise the vaccination rate and this is our imperative coming going forward i should add that maybe because the circuit breaker has been more than a year ago so many of us have forgotten what it was like in fact it was quite a severe restriction on many activities in the community in the business activities economic activities and of course fmb and today fmb we are hoping that by next week we will gradually open and it all goes well with no major outbreaks on the large clusters forming we probably will be able to proceed with a group of five in by the middle of july but that is what is important is to continue to step up our vaccination program as well as continue to expand our contact tracing and testing program i think we have to look at all the measures taken together that will allow us to restore economic activities as quickly as possible because beyond the fmb there's also international traveling as i mentioned earlier there are many businesses operating out of singapore local businesses as well as foreign investors or foreign businesses operating out of singapore as a headquarter they will need to travel around the region around the world to keep their business going and this has been curtailed for a long time because of the need to keep singapore safe but as we ramp up our vaccination we will have to carefully consider how we can allow this travel to resume because this is very critical to the businesses who are based here in singapore so i forgot nicholas's second half of the question whether this is sustainable and as minister gunn say answer short answer is not it cannot go on forever not just for fmb but our entire economy all our livelihoods and the whole competitiveness and viability of singapore i think depends on us being able to be connected with the world so at some point without higher capabilities high vaccination we must be able to reconnect with the world travel must start again people must be able to invest in singapore and able to watch the investments visit us from time to time businessmen must be able to foster deals meet each other students can exchange and all this that makes singapore thrive and allow us to have a good livelihood at some point and in the very near future we must be able to revive that thank you ministers we will now take the last two questions could we have the next question from nikkei may you quote please yes hi thank you for the opportunity um it seems that the key is a wider vaccination higher rate of vaccination but supply seems to be the problem do you have a plan of um expanding the kind types of the vaccination the vaccination into the national uh program um it seems that the cyanobac vaccine is uh hugely popular among the people uh there there seems to be some um you know men psychological uh mental thing that is working so if there is a reason why sandbag is not allowed now um can you explain and do you have a plan to introduce it soon yeah um actually pfizer biontech and moderner are the two most popular vaccines now in singapore many people waiting to book their appointments but we are releasing the booking slots based on supplies we we mentioned earlier about synovac it will be available through the special assess route that is outside of the national vaccination program as we mentioned there is an outstanding application there are some critical data that we still need from the company were requested from them and and they are still pending um so as of now i think the the queue is long for the two mrna vaccines fortunately our edb and our agencies at the very early stage of the pandemic have secured supplies so we do have to supply enough to offer all the whole of our population full protection and food the both dosages question is really one of timing if you wait to end september and october there is enough for everybody now question is whether we can work with the suppliers to see whether some of those supplies can come earlier and then we are at a better in a better position to be able to open and move on to the next stage of our opening earlier and so some of the businesses that are very badly affected international border our sia our changi air hub we can find ways to help it recover earlier to continue some of the comments that mr ong had made uh the mrna vaccines come in batches into singapore but they are not synchronized one with the other so they come at slightly different paces you may find that at certain times one particular mra vaccine is more available than the other so so sometimes there are people who have a specific preference of one particular vaccine for example the pfizer biotech vaccine but actually at that point in time the modern vaccine may actually be in good supply and we do recommend that if there are already other vacant slots available in any of vaccination centers any of these vaccines are all uh hsa pisa proof they are they're fine for our use and it's okay then to to use uh to register for the modern vaccine for example you don't have to wait for the pfizer biontec vaccine the cyanofact vaccine is one that we have now allowed to be used out of the original stopper we had based on the special excess root uh framework but it still is a vaccine that we were enough unfortunately unable to to approve using hsa's pisa framework simply because there still is some outstanding data that the manufacturer has not provided to hsa that gives us the complete assurance about the quality and and safety profile for the vaccines and and because uh that data is still limited hsa has not been able to make progress in converting uh the sound effect from simply a vaccine made available through the sal road into one that actually has that pisa approval we look forward if data becomes available for us then to complete this process of evaluation but unfortunately we're not able to do so so we've been looking at the real world and evidence looking internationally the experience of other countries which have used these vaccines as well some of these countries are very close to us including our regional neighbors like indonesia and we do know that in these other countries they have managed to vaccinate a larger proportion of their population using the synovic vaccine there is a significant risk of vaccine breakthrough we've seen a more recent report of health care workers in indonesia still being infected so these problems still arise uh it's not a problem associated with pfizer this time this is actually a problem associated with cyanobac vaccine and in other countries they're now starting to think about booster vaccinations even six months out from an original vaccination for some of these vaccines as well so it does give the impression that the efficacy of different vaccines will vary quite significantly we've been very happy that the original choices that we made to procure the pfizer biotech vaccine and the modern vaccine have given us great confidence that these are vaccines associated with one of the highest vaccine efficacies among various vaccines available around the world and we continue to put our trust in providing these vaccines to our population it's just that uh while we have procured enough for the entire population uh it will be a vaccination that has to be paced out and we hope the population will be able to uh to to make these vaccines uh make use of these vaccines when when we once available to them thank you minister and dms could we have the final question from today painting please hi uh ministers and dms um so uh just a quick clarification on the updated approach can indoor gyms and fitness studios reopen from june 21st i also wanted to clarify on the um the stages of reopening so uh you were talking about um vaccination by august and 75 vaccination by october could you give us a picture of how the easing will be done when we reached the milestones in particular in california they have almost almost more than 70 and adults those states had received one dose of the will for us how would it look like thank you didn't quite pick up what your second part of the question was we lost you a little bit but i think i gathered the gist of it so on the first question yes gyms and fitness centers can resume on the 21st of june right so but if they are going to do groups activity then it's limited to a group of two persons and if you have classes then we have a limit of 30 percent so there will be detailed safe management measures specific to the gyms and fitness sector which will be released to the industry just as there are detailed safe management measures specific to the fmb settings but the the the all of these centers can start to resume from the 21st of june onwards on the second question i i take it you are asking beyond our two stage opening which we have mapped out 21st of june and then mid-july are there will there be further easing and how does it tie to the two milestones i talked about 50 vaccination rate and 75 vaccination rate so again it's something that's being worked out we are developing a broader set of easing measures a broader set of reopening plans beyond what we have highlighted here today it will be tied to our vaccination program but the assurance is as we get our vaccination rates higher we will be able to confidently reopen not just within singapore but also at our borders and do so safely so those broader plans will be announced in due course when we are ready let me just add to that i think i heard some mentioning of california many of these countries u.s or in europe beside vaccination rate they also had a big wave of infections so they actually have many people who got the infection and do have antibodies so they are true effective antibody rate i think it's quite unknown but we know that whatever their vaccination rate is there's a big chunk above that they actually have antibodies so exactly i don't think we can exactly pack our road map to this because of this factor but as minister lawrence wong say we have two rough milestones and the milestone is defined around two doses and full protection the reason being we are now prioritizing first dose at some point when first dose is done we'll start with second dose and that's when the milestones start to be reached when 50 are fully vaccinated and then when 70 75 percent are fully vaccinated then we will plan our roadmap around these two milestones while maintaining a close monitor of the cases particularly and i noticed many media papers are now publishing this particularly how many people are falling very sick requiring oxygen supplement or icu or requiring to be admitted to icu and we monitor that day-to-day and in the end those are the clinical outcomes that matter so i think these are this is the important piece of work that's going forward and when we are ready we will announce those plans and those roadmaps ,True,False,False,False

Ann to give some advice on how to cope with the situation dr. Ann please fellow Singaporeans in residence this kovat 19 crisis brings a lot of uncertainty to our lives one main reason is that there are people out there who are carrying the virus but are not showing symptoms we go about in our daily lives filled with fear insecurity and anxiety just a week a to ago we were able to move about quite freely from 7 April many of our activities have been restricted we are encouraged to stay at home and to go out only when absolutely necessary this formal restricted living is good for overall well-being and to prevent the virus from spreading however these may be getting some used to as we may feel that we have lost our way of life together we are experiencing a collective sense of loss during this crisis for instance loss of ability to move about freely loss of unrestricted social interaction and connection with others a loss of safety and a loss of normalcy the word crisis in Chinese is weighty which means within danger Vasia lies an opportunity GRE we are all facing a common enemy a small tiny virus which poses great danger but within a danger also lies opportunity to take stock of our lives to improve our body's immune system and for the scientists to find a vaccine to deal with this fatal enemy how each of us reacts psychologically to the crisis actually depends on our mental resilience our outlook on life and kind of support we get from our friends and family members humans go through various stages in reacting to loss from this belief shock to negative emotions such as anger disappointment guilt anxiety and depression life being messy and chaotic before we finally accept the situation and learn to live with it for some of us we may go on to find meaning in coping with this crisis so how do we cope with such negative emotions one way of handling this crisis is to find meaning in this collective sense of loss how do we find meaning one approach is to practice mindfulness focus on our breathing to remain calm and stable phew great that we are still healthy and alive focus on opening our mind and observe the many ways of viewing the crisis take time to rest time to reflect time to connect time to catch up on things we have delayed in doing focus on the present cherish the here and now not lament about the past or worrying about the future focus on the current activity are doing and enjoy it focus on the surrounding be it flowers food books TV or pets you may end up during this period finding new hobbies focus on connecting with those at home focus on optimal protection such as keeping a distance wearing a mask when you go out and not overreacting such as panic buying a hoarding be my food others need to buy groceries as well and also be my food everything has two sides negative and positive focus on the positive and not the negative it doesn't help focus on support from friends family and remember your faith in religion as well and remember to give support to others who need help and keep finding meaning in this collective loss at the end of this whole journey we may become more enlightened with a new approach to life stay mindful thank you very much thank you dr.

rPKRWPP_l_c,COVID-19: Inside The Mystery Of Singapore&#39;s First Community Cluster | Contact Tracers | Ep 2/3,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2021-02-05T12:00:33Z,"Just when Singapore's contact tracers have tracked down and isolated all visitors from Wuhan, China, they are confounded by a growing cluster of infections at a ...",the evidence of increasing the numbers of cases that has occurred outside of china these developments in terms of the evolution of the outbreak is of great concern there are now 6065 confirmed cases including 5997 in china information is being updated and changing by the hour it is clearly still centered in china the overwhelming majority of cases still being reported from china so by late january we had uh you know identified uh several cases of kobe 19 in singapore they were mostly travelers from wuhan city in china and it was relatively easy for us to keep tabs on travelers from ohan city where develop symptoms such as fever and pneumonia seen our first singaporean case here as well which is uh slightly worrying because it is the first local case but to be fair she also went to wuhan on holiday so there is some community spread here per se the few cases from china were imported into singapore and so we managed to keep cases in singapore at a very low level january going into february so by late january reports were coming out of china that the disease had spread beyond wuhan city to other major cities in china there is a growing possibility that more individuals from other parts of china may be infected with the virus all new visitors with recent travel history to mainland china within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter into singapore or to transit through singapore as we have said repeatedly there is no community spread of the virus within singapore i recall it was early february we found out that there were three church-goers that were infected with covet-19 at the live church admissions [Music] when we first opened we were actually alarmed of course you know suddenly we have a number of cases that all have links to a church so this was quite concerning for us because it occurred in a setting where there was a lot of mixing and these first three cases were locals so living in singapore and they had no recent travel history to china and we were quite perplexed and also concerned because there was no source for the disease to spread into the church so we knew that something could be ongoing every single case has the potential to expose and to spread disease to many people a rising number of cases could quickly increase exponentially and go out of control and we have to do our utmost to keep that spread in check [Music] [Music] so [Music] when we first identified the three individuals we were concerned as to where they could have got an infection from it was likely because they were at the same time at the same place in church on the same day there was some form of transmission in the church so we interviewed the cases and we try to establish linkages when we have a case of covet 19 essentially what we have to do is to find out when the person's symptoms occurred and also where the person has been to this process is what we call locally activity mapping where we actually map the person's activities across time we were very concerned whether there will be more cases in the church so we will actually have to zoom in on various church services that the cases attended any particular events that could have led to the spread did they attend any gatherings did they also go out for any bible session for your session so we're looking for all possible kind of interactions through the contact tracing and activity maps we found that they all attended the live church admissions on a particular day which was the 19th of january during her church service if there was a cluster other people could have been exposed and infected as well so we actually went to ask the church pastor whether they have a list of the church attendees on 19 january [Music] we were concerned when there is a cluster in a environment where there's a lot of mixing of individuals with a lot of close contact it could result in more transmission and more cases and our main concern was how far did it had its spread because by the time we detected and identified it it was almost two weeks after the potential spread had occurred on 19th of january and much of our efforts then were to do a surveillance of the church to find out if anyone else had symptoms and to send them for testing to ensure that no one else in the church was infected with kobe 19. so we have a list of contacts who will need to actually call one by one to determine if they were feeling well if not feeling well we have to then refer them to hospital immediately if not then we have to place them on the phone surveillance or on the quarantine typically devil will have a lot of questions as you can imagine [Music] so it takes quite a lot of effort to go through the entire contact list [Music] and also we look through the activity maps of each of the cases to identify the close contact of cases of the church until the point when the person is isolated in hospital that period is the period where that case could potentially expose to individuals who have been in contact with that person i will actually close contact cases to establish and verify their interactions so that's the forward tracing process to determine all the individuals that might be in contact with that person we also do backward tracing and backward tracing to determine where did this transmission originate from when you have a few cases where you have no idea where these cases come from they do not have a specific source then you have a widespread transmission the first three cases were local so living in singapore which was why we had to establish resource or infection of that cluster because when we are unable to identify these individuals they might spread disease without us knowing so it is quite a challenge both in terms of time and resources and that's why it's not only the contact traces that are in this we work very closely with the police the investigators because their core business is trying to find out information from people work as an analyst in the singapore police force i was involved right at the onset of this probe into the church cluster my focus is to do backward tracing basically we just pour over the information that we received we have like 100 activity logs so information from the activity logs are actually fed into the different analytics tools that we have we make use of word cloud so the use of a word cloud allows us to visualize our frequently occurring words that we see across the activity logs and these can help us to subject them to further analysis and gis tools are process information relating to date time and place the tools will be able to throw up any links between persons or common places for instance person a was at a place at a certain date and time the tool will be able to flag up for instance person d who was at the same place at around the same time so we wanted to try and establish if there were any common places or any common persons that you know they were linked to so there was a need to look at the individual cases but also to look at cases from this cluster as a whole [Music] at the macro level we zoom out from the individual case and we examine the links across the different cases in all of singapore to help us identify sources of transmission and also how the transmission could have taken place so the software will see through all the words in these logs and come up with like the top 10 or top 20 depending on the criteria [Music] we zoom in down to the micro level we took a look at the activity logs and see if there are any details that we could have missed out in the interviews sometimes there is the lack of information pertaining to a patient's activity or links in some of the cases the patients were not in a condition to be interviewed in others uh some patients could not remember the details or they gave an incomplete information the most challenging aspect is the lack of information time is of the essence there is active transmission happening and is really the race against time so there is an urgent need for us to identify sources of infection [Music] the interviews come in useful because the interviews help to drop the memory and provide the finer details which may have been overlooked in the first place basically what we want to do is we want to narrow down to see if there is any place any shop for instance that all these cases have been to and see if that could have been a potential source of where the virus could have been transmitted and so the interview team will be tasked to ask these questions to the patient i was tasked by cid command center to go down to ncid to interview a few patients that are awarded there my name is dsp tumin fuji i'm the deputy officer in charge of a team at the specialized crime branch criminal investigation department being a contact tracer is a very similar job to my work as a investigation officer the objective is to get the information out from that interviewee it depends on how cooperative is a case person we need to post questions again and again to them and see where are the loopholes and to gather more facts so that it can have a more detailed activity locks [Music] when i reached there with my colleague we got to know that patient a and i wanted in the same way because as long as they are related they can put inside the same isolation room so patient and night couples from wuhan we able to see them through the isolation room window so we interview them via intercom telephone we identify ourselves that we are from the police and we would like to interview you for more details on the past 14 days we know that we interviewed you before but we do need more details so we want to get more information where the hospital team may not have gotten the information earlier we try to interview the husband first but he seemed uninterested most of the patients will say that they have already given the information to the contact tracer earlier so they will ask a lot of questions hey why you need to need so much information [Music] and the problem with that is that we will lose time in trying to contain the virus so we really need individuals to cooperate with us because every minute that we spend in trying to get the information means a minute more that the virus could actually spread of propagate we need to be patient and we try to build rapport again i got the wife to the phone [Music] the whole conversation were in mandarin i told him that i hope we can cooperate with us so that we can help to stop the spread of the virus so we just have to convince them that it's to protect the public then you say okay okay what you want to know from there then we will start it from the first day from the day office onset for case a and i they developed symptoms on the 24th of january and they were treated and warded in hospital on 27th of january then we work back from there what do you do on this particular date and from what time what time from there we go hour by hour they arrived in singapore on 19 january so that was their first day in singapore [Music] so after that i said okay after you arrived in singapore where did you go and they told us that okay they dropped their luggage at the place where they stayed and after they took a bus to attend a sunday church service so i say where's the church service but because they are not familiar with singapore they couldn't tell me the church name so i poked them with another question said can you tell me where is this church the any address of the church they also can't provide it to me [Music] so i started giving them certain landmarks it's the church nearby an mrt station a bus stop is there an overhead bridge near the church [Music] but they can't provide me with that information because they just arrived in singapore on that particular day [Music] then they told me that actually they follow this pastel and social media they were here just to attend that particular church service conducted by this pastor so i asked them who is the pastor that conduct the church service the wife was able to tell me the pastor name and memory so immediately i told my colleagues who were standing beside me to do that internet search research that chinese name the result came back with life church and mission so immediately we submitted this information back to our cid command center through investigations by the police we actually found that the couple who arrived from wuhan china on the 19th of january had gone to church that morning immediately after arriving in singapore and we're likely the source or infection of that cluster we think that two individuals may have gotten the disease through sort of droplet transmission when there are activities such as a singing loud talking there's also greater propensity for droplets to be expelled and the third individual interestingly was not in church at the same time the couple from china went to church that morning and sat at the seat during the service and then the other case came into church and sat at the same seat so we think that it is possible that the other case had got an infection from formic transmission it was very likely that they had spread the disease to the other three church members but interestingly the couple from china in fact they were not yet symptomatic there were no symptoms such as fever or pneumonia in the early phases of the disease there were a lot of things we didn't know about how the disease transmits this is a coronavirus that's very similar to the sars coronavirus in fact the virus that causes covid19 is called sars coronavirus ii and we knew that in sars most individuals would only be most infectious after the onset of fever [Music] and once we isolate these febrile individuals we could actually stop the transmission of sars which is why we managed to control sars in singapore but we realized that some individuals even in the pre-symptomatic phase could actually spread infection we always try to stay one step ahead of the virus but there's a lot of data coming out from singapore and the rest of the world on covet 19. however not all of that data firstly is validated and not all of the data is useful so we have an entire team of individuals that are scarring all of the materials across the world for these pieces of information and we have to then process information so it is a very time consuming laborious and iterative process now as more data came about we found that the optimal time for contact tracing was actually two days before the onset of symptoms and we quickly adjusted our contact tracing protocols to match the evidence that we find still we were relieved because that meant that we had closed that case and it also ring-fenced them and prevent any onward spread [Music] but we could not rest on our laurels we now have a name for the disease and it is covet 19 as of 6 am geneva time this morning tragically we have now surpassed 1000 days [Music] mid-february we identified the first two cases from another church the grace assembly of god church it was a sense of deja vu he just solved one cluster and there was another one subsequently there was actually five more cases that was announced on the next day the great assembly of god church will stop all its services for 14 days as the church has been identified as a covet 19 cluster there are seven singaporeans linked to it including its pastor the church had quite a large complication so this was quite concerning for us because that was quite a large number and was the largest cluster to date we knew that cases within a similar setting could potentially occur very quickly and there was an urgent need to find out his source of infection to stop the spread the grace assembly of god church is not affiliated with the live church and missions likewise none of them had recent travel to china there was no source for this disease to have spread into the church a few days later we realized that there were more and more cases attributed to this church cluster the grace assembly of god is now the biggest cluster itself is sweater in singapore there was concern in what many people would term as a super spreader event the super spreading event is when you have one person a very infectious person that may have spread disease to many people [Music] so we looked through the activity maps of each of the other cases in the grace and then we have got cluster we thought k-48 could have been the source of infection at the grace assembly of god's cluster because he was the first confirmed case from this cluster [Music] case 48 was the index case of the grace church cluster was a staff at the church we had to identify all close quarter case to prevent further disease transmission as a general rule we use 2 metres and 30 minutes of interaction to label that individual as a close contact so we look at his activity log we look at the people he was in contact with [Music] based on case for the accounts provided to the ministry of health case 48 mentioned that he sat close to two different individuals in the civima hall watching the movies we are tasked to find two close contact persons to establish their identity we got the images provided by the staff from the cctv cameras that they viewed prior to our arrival we are looking at two different individuals for a male individual and a female the cctv image is not that clear as such we need to based on their movement their attires and their appearance to search for them one of the individual is wearing a flowery prince dress as such it's easier for us to spot her in the cctv cameras [Music] after she left the cinema hall she went window shopping from level to level there are some points that she went to the blind spot or the missing angles of the cctv [Music] when we lost track of her we need to make some ground inquiries with the shops to try to establish where she went next so eventually we managed to locate her after she leave the mall that is the one of the challenging part because in orchard there's a lot of shopping malls so she might visit other malls also [Music] but for this case for her she hid straight home she took the train and head back to the hdb vlogs that she stayed in a hdb we only have limited cctv cameras so we need to do our liquid to id [Music] we give the description of her and eventually the neighbor pointed to that particular unit so the next day they'll be able to establish our identity [Music] we were still trying to establish a source of infection for case 48. when we do a contact tracing and this is a backward contact tracing to look for the source of infection we always look for sort of a gatherings or activities where there's a lot of mixing a lot of close interactions with people who could be potentially infected and infectious [Music] of course that was the chinese new year period and a lot of people out and about a lot of people coming together from different parts of the country and there's a lot of interactions so we were concerned about whether any one of these gatherings could have resulted in disease transmission so areas that we looked at was the routes he took to go to work for instance places that he went to the people he interacted with i spent a couple of days looking into case 48 and trying to establish a resource of infection we were trying our best to dig up any information that we could get but we couldn't tell for sure that he was the source of infection nothing was confirmed in an outbreak the identification of the cases never follows a nice time sequence of events during the investigations the first case that is identified or notified to us might not be the first case that had spread disease within that entire outbreak or cluster we have to use many investigative tools to piece together what actually had happened one of the qualities of an analyst would be you know having a positive mindset and being you know persistent having the perseverance so yeah we had just had to do it because we knew from the life church cluster that this could potentially grow bigger so we needed to find out the source of infection fast [Music] after working on case 48 for a couple of days other cases within the cluster emerged we found even more cases linked to the grace assembly of god church either directly or through other staff members it was important to find out his source of infection to slow down the spread there was definitely pressure you know coming from everywhere the public was anxious we needed to find answers through investigations we actually identified another positive case in this case k66 case 66 even though he was discovered later through the interviews we noted that his symptoms on set date was actually the earliest in fact it was the earliest among the cluster k-66 was also a staff at the church and therefore was in contact with many of the other church workers and employees we found that he was symptomatic on doing our january and he went to work so subscribing there was also cases linked to the church that was when we turned our attention to case 66 because we had this hypothesis oh could case 66 be the index case for the grace assembly of god church cluster instead of case 48 and could he be the one that had infected the rest within the cluster so this was potentially a need that could bring us closer to finding out the source of the infection at the grace assembly of god church [Music] we had to do a lot of investigation to find out where could he have gotten an infection from because he did not have recent travel history to china nor was he in contact with any other known covet-19 case so we have to investigate all of the social activities for k-66 [Music] so when we investigated k-66 movement history we realized that among many other activities that he had participated in he had a chinese new year gathering on the 25th of january with family members in may 1 drive [Music] this really uh spoken interest in us because as with any gathering large gatherings present the opportunity for transmission to occur [Music] chinese new year is an occasion where chinese people come together to celebrate the new year and it involves gathering of the extended family so usually there are many people who will come together for a meal that's the traditional lohey or the tossing of salad there's a lot of sharing of stories with relatives who you may not have seen for a while throughout the year so there's certainly very close interactions and this of course also provides a lot of opportunities for the spread of diseases like mit so we took a look at the gathering and we got the interview team to obtain the list of attendees at gathering we went through this attendee list through our link analysis tools through the use of our link analysis tool we discovered a couple who had attended the gathering they were locals this couple was from singapore and further investigation of these two individuals found that they had actually been part of the live church emissions which set off alarm bells and red flags so this really sort of arose suspicions and we had to piece together this sequence of events and that was when we zoomed in and investigated further into this couple [Music] [Music] when we further probe we found that they have actually also visited the live church and mission the couple were in church on the 19th of january same day as the wuhan travellers case eight and nine that was when imported cases or work at the church as well and we came up with a hypothesis oh okay so now we have case 66 from the grace assembly cluster we have a gather ring [Music] and we have a couple that was at both the gathering and at the live church could the virus been transmitted from the life church which we already know it's a cluster through an intermediary event that is the chinese new year gathering on the 25th of january the chinese new year gathering and then this case then went on to spread disease to that greater zambia cluster [Music] but of course this is only based on conjectural evidence because this was some time ago and we did not have concrete evidence that these two individuals a couple from singapore who were at the live church at that gathering were in fact infected with covet 19. but this was extremely important for us to prove because this meant that there was not an unknown chain of transmission out there in the rest of the singapore community [Music] we conveyed these findings to the interview team and got them to interview the couple from singapore [Music] when we interviewed the couple from singapore they were well but it was subsequently revealed that the couple was unwell after the gathering during the interview we uncovered that they in fact had symptoms compatible with covet-19 that was during the end of january and they have sought medical attention then so we looked at the symptom onset dates and we thought that okay this is possible the couple from singapore could have been infectious during the gathering and thereafter recovered subsequently one had symptoms after the gathering while the other was actually symptomatic during the family gathering and was likely the one that had spread disease to the grace assembly case but they had not been identified as covet 19 cases we had to go back in time to establish if they had been infected with covet 19 and therefore prove the link between the two church clusters and the family gathering we set them for the routine pcr test which is sort of a gold standard laboratory test which we use for covet 19 and this detects essentially genetic material that's present in the individual who is infected with cova-19 when the person is in the infectious phase of the disease when we tested the both of them the individual who had symptoms earlier the one with the earlier onset of symptoms and likely had spread disease during the 25th of january gathering was actually negative on pcr only one of them was positive on pcr but was not the likely mode of spread and so we did not find any conclusive evidence we thought that this couple these two individuals could already have recovered from their illness how do we prove that someone was previously infected with colvit 19 and had spread to the rest of the cluster so this is where the serology test comes in but at that time it did not exist full cov19 virus i'm juan linza i'm currently professor and director of the emerging infectious disease program at uks i have been working with a zoonotic virus from animal to human for the last 25 years they came to me to say we have somebody that highly suspected now is actually brought virus from one class to the other but because it's already months later usually it's too late to do the molecular tests [Music] the pcr tests zoom into the genetic material of the virus so it only works when you still have the virus in your body but our body fights really hard our immune system and one of the immune system is antibody as soon as our immune system the virus is cleared out usually that takes days to weeks two weeks and usually months later you already recover the virus is gone but the antibodies the molecule which fights you know the virus in your blood will remain for months and years you know symbology test essentially detects for the presence of antibodies to a certain disease serology tests have been used to identify sort of past infection in other diseases but for covet 19 this was unprecedented usually if you want to commercialize a serologic test or antibody test it takes years but he had in fact been working on a new serology test for kobe 19 so we were the first group in the whole world develop a specific test for this normal coronal virus we achieve that in two months so that is like a lightning speed i call it core v19 speed so when we knew that we had to identify a past infection in these two individuals i picked up the phone and rang professor wang to ask him if he could deploy this new test he had so dr lee first he asked me am i ready is your team ready and i say i'm ready and they actually ask how confident you are i said i'm 99.99 confident and they say all right let's do it he was very confident that he had a serology test that was robust and that could identify a recovered covit 19 individual and then he said great we will send a sample to your lab we will send a total of four samples but we did not know whether all four are from same individual four different individuals in a research or downloads lab usually people send a sample blunded so that you're not biased so we did blindly and within three days we had a data [Music] professor wang called me and said i'm 99.9 confident that person had virus infection [Music] when i sent back this to vernon he could not believe it because that's the person is the suspect there was no doubt in our mind that that was the missing link that joined the two church clusters we confirmed the link was that from kids eight and nine they have passed the infection on to venus 83 and 91 and they have passed the infection to k-66 in the family gathering and this k-66 could have passed on the infection to his colleagues in british example of god in what is likely a world first the serological test developed by duke nus medical school uses blood samples that can detect coronavirus infections in patients who have recovered from the disease singapore is the first country use serology to do contact tracing so as a scientist you know that's as good as you can get [Music] i think contact tracing really marries you know um signs investigational tools and also a lot of communication skills all into one it is a bit like a private eye because you really have to think about how things had happened go and investigate it using the scientific basis for how diseases spread our contact tracing and our ring fencing had actually prevented onward transmission in singapore and we could at least say that that closed that chapter of these [Music] clusters i think we were just glad that it's over i mean yeah i mean because other cases were happening so it is not a time to drop the ball on you know the other cases so for us it was yes we were happy at that point but it was time to move on to the other cases we're watching the situation very carefully monitoring the developments we are quite prepared to adjust our posture and our stance as and when we see the development happening around us march was when things started to change singapore's coronavirus numbers have skyrocketed propelled by a surge in infections among its migrant worker population we're not able to keep a lid on it because the virus was obviously out running out gunning the contact racing team [Music] we realized that we had to take a different tack [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

the yes you can do it uh come on uh i will be there for you and we shall do everything just to save our country malaysia that's not happening anymore but a lot more controversies a lot more blaming pinpointing name calling and the list goes on so that is why i said uh to myself let's have someone who can really talk about mental health not only talk about but to decode and that's why you are here today uh once again thank you so much kamadi uh i have got a lot of people here are already writing comments of the comments but i want to go to uh you straight away whenever there is a guest i always ask them what are your moments in life where it was bliss that means the only part would be your childhood moment so can you share it with us your childhood moments your family your friends how you grow up and all that go ahead oh okay um well then i come from a very small uh town uh called as cigar okay so i grew up from there i born there my i did my schooling over there in scholar things kama sbh you know and i grew in a in an environment whereby there's a multi-racial uh people around that means my friends are chinese malays indian and all that it's a small town but most of them knows each other and my schooling was great i was very very active in sports uh studies and all all the time if you ask my friends they know okay who's this comedy all about and uh yeah i was i've grown independent thanks to my mom you know she started very young when i was i think when i first started kindergarten itself you see and i grew up in a family whereby i was given all kind of no freedom means i can choose uh any anything that i like uh there's no um you know uh particular thing that they asked me to do that there's no much rules uh in my life okay so um that makes me more uh creative open about what i wanted to do and uh i feel happy about it okay and i did my uh studies my highest studies in uh uni stimulia i did my form 6 as well instead of mud and i must say that i am very lucky to have good teachers in my life some of my coach i did jim rama you know name naming all kinds of sports i was in and good for the public speech i was also a perfect and you know lead a lot of activities back in my school so that have improved my uh leadership and also my surroundings have been very healthy and uh i will say rich okay and um yeah uh that's a downfall happened in our life uh whereby uh in a very young age my father passed away yeah that is when i was first entered to university first year uh so it was a it was a tragedy i would say but um thanks to my family especially my uncle who was there always my mother she really made me as a brave person and also you know the leadership quality as i would say that comes from my mom as well and other than that um yeah childhood is always colorful you know i never bought school or university i don't know why some students are having problem to go to school but my school life was very very good oh i wish every child could say the same yeah well my childhood was also the same going to school uh is something to look forward to but not that when i was in primary school secondary school yes uh but governor you always speak about your brothers a lot yeah tell us how was that that bonding you and your brothers well i grew up with them you know i'm the bleak sister i'm the eldest so i always have this like a monitor is a spy looking on them i know what they are doing what their don'ts and how does their character what is their strength and of course i'm emotionally related to my siblings also and back in my family we don't have any kind of gender difference like uh you're a woman you cannot study much or you can't do much team only boys need to do it so we came from a very uh the background that whereby there's no gender difference so i can't see any uh issues in that yeah so very uh nicely brought up i should say yeah it always starts from home and i think uh you did it well uh question i hear that you were in singapore uh for a very long time can you share with us your life in singapore how long you have been there and then what were you doing in singapore okay i studied for counseling psychology back in malaysia in university malaya i was the third pioneer student to do counseling that means a proper counselor course during that time okay so after finished studies that i thought that i wanted to uh work in somewhere um i was about one month only back in kel then later on i went back to my hometown then just you know you you are trying to understand the whole situation and uh i thought okay why not i go to singapore because cigar might and singapore is just two and a half hour and same goes to sagamat to kuala lumpur it's the same distance but only the dollar is different so i thought okay why not go to singapore and i still remember uh i was a bit hesitated to ask my mom about money and all luckily my grandmother gave me one thousand engaged at that time she just needed the money and she said uh you want to go to singapore right now you need money so she stick me uh 1000 in get and then i just went there and i convert the money i only get 250 dollars at that time okay nevermind but i have some good people around me who helps me uh back there that actually um bring me to certain places and then they taught me how to get a job within a week i got a job in a bank as a sales manager then i was working in a one of the dutch bank okay for two years i was there and it was called as referral space that area it's actually a very uh fine area whereby there's a merida best science now uh it was built before that it was actually a seaside um then i was working in the bank and i thought okay hey why not i go back to what i studied in a university counseling background because i've been a salesperson before i went to university also i do a lot of part-time job back in cal so i thought okay why not i go back to what i study so i entered as a medical social worker in one of a nursing home uh whereby i need to take care of the elder elderly people of course i need to look into all the cycle system uh overall and of course i manage the discharge plan funding uh you know be the middle party between the government and the people and uh you know uh also discuss with the family about the care plan all that stuff and looking at that i have learned a lot and of course um you know being a medical social worker is not a uh easy job because it's actually a multi-tasking job you need to be a counselor you need to be a manager you need to be a accountant sometimes because you are the one that actually allocate the fund back in the governance okay so after that uh i thought of okay why not from the elder care i want to go with the students i want to work with the students so i was working in one of a reputation university from australia but it was created in singapore so i was a student counselor and also her head department and over there actually for see 3 000 people i mean 3000 students so it was a hectic environment but i love it of course students you have to be very fast all the information must be in your fingertips they lazy to go and research for it everything they'll come and ask you and bug you no matter what's the time but of course from there i can identify some mental health problem among the youngsters uh which comes from one particular faculty i don't want to say what is that then i was keep on thinking why is this particular faculty having this kind of issue attendance issue and uh you know uh there's a lot of laid back uh happening in that particular situation and of course this is international students and also local students and it's a multi-racial uh kind of environment and uh but the problem was same everybody has come with some kind of depression and all that then i thought of moving to another sector whereby it's more deeper which is mental health um then i was joining this company for many years over there i have learned a multiple scale i'll say um i can't i can't say it in a day yeah so over there yeah go ahead so over there we do a lot of rehab uh we do uh evidence education we do case management uh we do a lot of social work uh you you you name it so i would say as a role as a case manager uh it's not only in one room one day you'll be a counselor one day you can be a social but case manager is all about connection that means you will be a middle party this is your client uh this is the sector that you want to connect together but maybe your client you don't know so you start from assessment and you see um when people who have mental health issues they are very sensitive you know so they need someone to discuss but you can't everybody cannot go and approach them you need to be very sensitive to touching their issues and you need to gain this trust first trust is the most i would say is the fundamental of it so we will do like a bridging prop uh program as a case manager then we will oversee the cases and all that so that's i'm making it shorter than maybe we can elaborate later yeah yeah yeah exactly uh yeah we would want to know what is case manager in a more detailed manner but i want to go back to our title uh decoding mental health what do you think this means what are you trying to say can you share a little bit about your thoughts okay maybe i can uh inform about what is decoding itself okay when you're feeling hungry right you will go and eat right you will find food you go to your kitchen and you will find food right yes and when you think that you have some issues you need to seek for help you need to synchronize your issues that means you need to know your the the issues that you are looking at the difference that you are feeling or maybe the person that you love maybe your friends what are the changes in them you see so decoding is you identify the needs and capture it together so in mental health you need to be very vigilant you need to capture all this you must be very sensitive about the environment if your loved one you feel that they are not talking to you for a long time or maybe they are being isolated in the room for a long time maybe there's some help that needed by them yeah yeah so uh there are a couple of times whereby uh i do see that uh you can't even see signs and symptoms as to whether or not someone is into depression now and i'm also using the word depression tell us depression is it something that and and i hear this every other time yeah whenever someone is feeling down uh uh or moody uh uh something that is not right the first word that comes is uh are you feeling depressed uh depression is something that they use it very loosely uh and i don't know what that means can you share with us depression what does that actually mean actually depression is not a glamour word okay everybody yeah every everyone thinks that oh i'm depressed today i'm feeling very depressed but actually the depression is a diagnosis should be diagnosed by a psychiatric that you are depressed yes if you are you're having depression you need to have a diagnosis problem psychiatric saying that you are depressed okay so depression can come any time in any animal any type of like life uh long uh it can be you know it will have a base like it's got a major face miner face uh it's all all about your coping mechanism and there will be a sign of it some signs are very silent uh unseen maybe we didn't notice or maybe we don't know uh what are the signs but it can be uh tackled in the early early age uh early time of the symptoms uh by uh noticing by certain uh mood swings uh differences in their food habits uh maybe in the uh the way they're exposing string they're expressing uh choosing colors for the clothes or maybe how they are welcoming maybe they try to block everyone uh in in their life so depression is very deep it's a very big topic it can come in in any part of the area so i think uh if we want to talk about depression maybe we can have another uh session about it maybe we can go detail on it because uh today i want to talk about happy moment so we don't want to go yeah yeah it's nice and the reason why i'm asking is because people want people need to know that there is also another area that you can tap into it's not always about depression so the moment the day we started mco in uh last year uh 2020 until now the word depression is every other day you know i get this what's up message saying that you know this is what is happening depression is in control and and and the list goes on so we want to see what else we can do to make sure that we are in control of this situation now that we are saying that depression itself is another label yeah it's another uh prescription or something that the doctor only can tell you that you are depressed then what else people are going through is something that we all worry about so how do we manage now that you know this situation is there how do you even manage this type of uh so-called mood swings okay i just gave a simple tips okay when we are doing the same activity every day we will feel burn out morning wake up you go to work you are doing you are looking at the same pc you are doing the same you are talking to the same people you are drinking the same coffee you are wearing the same color every week and you're coming back home you're shutting the same door and you're coming back to your house looking at your wife you can't even say hi to them or you can't even smile to them you see we need to break the secrets enjoy little things in life notice little things in life maybe every morning you can just become say hey i feel good about today okay today is mco at least i got time to learn certain skills new skill there's plenty of new skills even in illate if you look at the hrdf courses i can i can see thousands of courses which has been there we are not skillful in every every uh every i mean every functional level okay but skill is very important some people maybe they are a pilot now but they lost the job but later on they find out that they don't have much skill set why it is us who never developed another skill on us so take this mco i i know this pandemic is not going to be easy because this is not the first time we are going through it this is the third phase but you see we are doing it to serve to save the life correct all this environment all these rules all this restriction is to save the life that is the niche of it so we need to be responsible to focus on it of course even if you ask me i'm a kaki jalan you know i like to go around and think about mcu i feel like okay now i cannot go out that this house is going to be my environment okay what i can do today what i can learn out of it how i'm going to cope with my family members what are the things that i need to do what are my plans i don't know i know until 16 only there'll be mco but i don't know whether it's going to prolong you see and today okay i have an appointment with you tomorrow i might have a point with some maybe not everyone is like me but i can see during this mco a lot of people learn ski like baking cooking you know doing so all these are these are all good things you know um yeah but talking about uh being sad or feeling like um you know you can't do much and also you lost your job or you can't even start up any work financially you're down you see humankind have survived all the time our generation never seen the war but the earlier generation see three wars but we still survive okay but we are lucky at least we can talk from far the technology is there we still can do little bit of things you see it's not our door are shut but we are not very nice please very nicely see uh i like what you said uh you know comedy mankind uh humankind have seen the the the many worst things that has happened in this uh world that we live in and yet we've arrived we've gone through it uh this is just another uh episode i must say yeah and it's interesting even before the show we were chatting a little bit and you spoke about how uh some countries uh have have got zero cases i heard that new zealand is also like uh don't have cases anymore and it's nice to know that we still have got hope what have you got to say about that yeah hope is the greatest uh you know i will say invention by a human being without hope we are no you see so of course the certain country even uk uh they have zero debt yesterday so something positive is there and um as we malaysians i i'm considered we are very good you know once the mco we all go for shopping we just buy the things we come back and we plans our thing we accept it we never grown up say hey no we cannot do this we never burn anything you know we all follow the rules we are very good you know very good people are around so yeah the only thing is we are not used to this yeah we are very you go out we are very used to go to restaurant to have nice food very nice dine we are used to go and see our reality friends because our culture have natured us in that way okay but just use this uh mco time uh to regain your knowledge maybe uh you wanted to read the sajara which you never did during your school time you know um and also try to look for other second opportunity how you can gain uh finance uh if you uh if you feel like okay i want to do for another training i maybe i want to go for uh this course i'll try to look for it and not only uh you know watching and reading about tick tock uh i would say stick talk strong but at least you know get some knowledge be with positive people read positive things capture early morning kept trying to capture like i like okay i was very happy when i know that nobody's dying in uk yeah due to kobe so try to capture the positive part out of it not every time seeing that hey uh you know this is done this third phase is going to make us down economy we going to go off yeah you see if you still remember greek a country whereby it's gone bankrupt rise greece right but do the uh do the people give up no they are very creative people if you see if you go to domestica online there's a lot of people are doing a very interesting kind of uh um you know artistic items so even in renaissance how come there are nice things i've improvised due to war everybody learn new skill we have implemented okay so feeling alone not connecting with anyone it makes the things worse only all right try to see light out of everything very nice try to see the light that's very important and and something that i have been doing now comedy is that whenever i receive any uh messages any whatsapp messages that is so negative the first thing that i do is i just did it because it is not serving any purpose why i say that is because the little little things that you do will save your life and i think that is very important uh comedy i want to share with you a couple of views that i am getting here let me share with you uh wow that's plenty yeah rajvin ko is saying good evening uh a link with him is saying good evening uh susan uh and she is also saying that build the skills that we need to improve ourselves yes very important menega balu i'm sure you know her she says well done combs my bestie there you go there you go so more positive people in our life is very important that's what susan also says kieran says that is so true be around positive people yes that makes a lot of sense um there is a cooking with charles i think someone that you know also excellent advice miss comedy hi bestie there you go you've got all the besties around you yeah og numbers uh say uh it's very important yeah uh and also uh you have got a lot of people saying a lot of good things yeah and i think which is very important yeah you must make sure that you do things in a different manner so comedy i have got this question and i want to go back to the case manager uh what does that really mean case manager i know you describe a little bit but a little bit more detail if you can okay i just give you a scenario okay let's say um there's a case been assigned to us as a case manager we do the assessment first assessment we need we divide it to two side one is action one is control okay what i mean by action for example um let's say uh the family is going through some financial issues and due to that the husband is alcoholic he is taking substance then some shaken situation in the family okay so maybe the assessment will be uh to see what are the other needs the family needs maybe the husband need uh you know a rehab or maybe the the wife need a job or maybe the the children needs education something like that so that is action okay what i mean by control control is let's say that's abuse happened in the family let's say the kid's been abused so as a case manager we will take the action the action will be we will try to uh activate all the um uh our stakeholders who are being responsible for certain uh unit like for example a child uh abused so we will call them in uh we'll do the the the assessment and we will try to help the child and also to try to divide um the problem and also to put the child in a safe place first of course i'm not doing bad here but that is the difference between action and control so as a case manager we need to do the assessment and find out whether this is a action case or a control case okay so after doing all the assessment we will do action plan the action plan consists of all the all the things that we need to uh do for this that case uh weather need to be referred whether the client needs a job whether the client needs a training whether the client needs a treatment whether the client need a you know a cleaning cleaning the house defender need to call the defender and clean the house because there's a lot of hoarding issues also happened you know so um then we try to connect them to the doctor maybe the the client need uh some medical they're having some medical issues having some problem in finance maybe he's not getting fun uh maybe we can apply for the government funding you know so this kind of thing then we have a timeline the case manager have a timeline to all the stakeholders we will do the meeting and we will check whether all these action plans are done oh it's been checked and also we will see uh what are the differences in the client's life is that the changes is this been done is there any other help need to be given so um we will be like i mean will be like a middle party who are very important and also try to segregate um the the rules i would say yeah i see i see so uh what are the type of cases that you have handled can you share a little bit oh my god i have handled a lot of crazy stuff even my family members don't know about it yeah there's one moment i seen a girl she was talking normally to us and my colleague suddenly she wants to jump from the flat you see um you see in mental illness you never know which word will trigger that so using certain words it's very important how you try to mellow down the person you know so this person is was high in substance and she wants to jump out of the uh flat and we are just standing beside ours and we are calling the police the police said they cannot manage this case uh because they are on the way you see so the girl is giving us five minutes she said i'm in five minutes time i'm going to jump so um you see uh we have been trained for uh certain certification and sos and all that i that i was kneeling down you know i was kneeling down and uh had a soft spoken to her and i was calling back her name you know sometimes they are not in their sense uh then trying to you know persuade her to come back to a sense and we try to avoid to touch her because we don't want to trigger and she let go of the real easy so these are the things that actually is that the moment i know that life is so important that not even a person should should be just killing themselves for some you know maybe for us it's not important but maybe for that person it was she was infected badly you know so that was one of the scenario the second scenario is when i opened one of this client house knocking the door he come with the parang yeah so this client have regulated his medication for so long uh so he has some uh cf schizophrenia and uh we don't know what kind of image or voices that he is yearning so he tried to be but these people are actually not dangerous you see we are human being these people are not dangerous actually they have been isolated due to their situation they've been labeled you know they have been pushed away wherever they go the help was not given to them so they use this uh you know aggressive mechanism to get certain things all right so we okay at the end i managed that that that client then we had a very good repo we uh we start off with it so there's many things that uh have encountered due to the mental health and sometimes you know i will dress up very glamorously people don't know that eventually doing this kind of job people might think that i'm working in a bank and you know yeah but it was full of happiness because when you one one person have gone to uh that situation and you pull them out and you have given them a a life actually and you you know that you can't buy that with money see something that you said here when somebody was about to jump a couple of things that you said you need to kneel down and then you need to speak very softly and calling their name many of times simply because they may be off tangent they were not thinking right and something else was bothering them and i think this is very interesting how uh there are ways to actually help people not to just take a video and then post it and making it viral i'm saying this is because of the i don't know whether you saw this or not for me i saw this video i think uh many of us have seen that how a guy was just standing at the very highest uh floor and and he jumped off uh do you have any comments on that uh comedy you know first of all when i got the when i got the video i was a bit angry you see um we human being we can complicate things what i was afraid was a copycat suicidal and that guy is not having fun and he is going off for the last moment you see and someone have the heart to take a video out of it and that i felt sad about it and second thing uh i can't i can't say which is wrong which is right over here because we don't know the situation what happened over there and uh what are the things that people did around him but one thing i would say which is taking me back is the way they took the video and they virally all over the i think all over malaysia maybe even the internationally people seen it uh i think that's not right even when we get i i just delete the entire video once i got it i don't want to forward and i was little bit taken back thinking about maybe we don't know how what is the impact you know uh this one case what happened is uh one of the person passed away he was he jumped from uh from a building and it was seen by one of his friend okay so he did the same after one month so we call it as a copycat society so this kind of viral which you are sending to the the to the public is not going to do any good out of it maybe you can help to stop deleting or stop to uh violate this kind of situation you see and that we don't know what happened to that person why he comes to this uh situation what i can see is he's trying to give himself strength to jump by holding the hand from the reel and uh you know he's trying to give himself strength he was afraid there but that's just one touch it was gone yeah so we we can't judge what is prescription but don't while this kind of video or don't try to help people you can call by the time you are taking the video you can call the police or you can call the civil defense or you can just put a what kind of hundred bets to throw their base on the floor help the person yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know it is sad even when i see someone that uh accident in the road that guy will be like laying down with a lot of blood but people are busy taking video out of it so is it become a trend lauren yeah exactly that's the question that you need to ask is it because of trend and other the next uh painful question that i would ask is if it is happening to someone whom you love how would you feel will you still do the same will you still take the video shot and pass it around something to think about yeah we always do not uh give enough uh acknowledgement to the party that is involved yeah especially the family members can you imagine if the thing is going viral and it is something about someone whom they have lived uh it is going to be very painful yeah so trend do you want it is it necessary something that you need to think about yeah uh uh comedy i have a couple of some uh views also still coming by menega gunasil saying uh good sharing and uttaya kumar is saying good whites and we have got susan is saying oh really ah there you go that's one of your brother yeah okay listen to seeing someone to love care and be there is most important in life dave nunny says good wives uh i'm sure you know that person uh where vishalini arrival again says i'm amazed on how miss comedy can calm down the person yes indeed we are all amazed uh at what uh you have done it's amazing how you can actually bring about changes to the many people ah do you think that movies that we watch things that we speak or hear influences our mood swing you see we cannot be labeling certain things we should stop labeling things it's up to us what we want to gain out of it you see when we watch movie which we never watched before we don't know what is coming out of that movie because we don't know the storyline correct but what we need to keep strong in ourselves is our coping mechanism okay and we know we need we should know our two and don'ts that is a fundamental out of it and when we know okay for example we know that this uh this video was very negative correct you and me what we did we deleted yes correct but i don't know about others maybe they want to forward remember they want to show a share to people what's happening so it's all depends on the individual how they are taking certain things you see but i will say uh it is better to take something positive because when you have positiveness all around you more positive things will happen when even you fall down the impact won't be that hard you see that's always time for you to raise up okay try to educate uh yourself first uh so that you can educate other people you know and um yeah that's all about that very nice very nice okay i remember you speaking about uh the serial dramas my mom is going to eat about this okay okay i want to say it's wrong okay i don't want anybody come and sue me or about this okay yeah i'm i'm a bit anti-drama person not like uh you can watch drama but you cannot have like this habit of watching the drama from morning to evening i remember that those days uh you know the women have a lot of skills you know when four o'clock come they come to okay they go and do tea times they will do it their gardening their flower will be flourishing uh they have more time to do like uh sewing and all this type of things okay but nowadays the drama have captured some kind of populations at that time you know i would say rather than giving a lot of negative stories in that drama i would say i will watch again i will just monitor what is the story about okay oh yeah this story so but i didn't see any positiveness out of it you're not gaining any knowledge out of it maybe it's my personality that who likes to seek for knowledge uh i would say maybe it is entertainment for some people you know some old people will say that elderly people say i have nothing to do only this is my entertainment what else you want me to do remember this is a personal opinion i used mco started i started watching drama i started watching series guess what i am hooked to it i cannot live without it why i'm saying that is because it is something that keeps me going uh and yes everyone have got their own opinion thanks for sharing your opinion i've got a couple of messages still coming by maliga manikam says mental health is most important and yeah it is very crucial in this current situation uh kieran cor says mental health needs more awareness and we must talk about it and to our children at this very difficult times uh kevin summary vikrama samara vikrama hi there uh says hi uh and we have got uh vishalini also says this is a good sharing despite what is happening during the pandemic moment susan says at the end of the day it's only a movie yes she's agreeing to it yeah you have got fan base already yeah and lee gn says uh thank you so much for sharing yes amazing things are happening i want to divert a little bit to something that i always ask remember this show is about empowering and and bringing about inspiring individuals to share their knowledge and i always bring about women why because they have a lot of things to share i'm not saying that the men don't have but a different story all together but this uh question is something that i always ask and i want to ask this to you also discrimination uh i want to know uh what have you got to say about discrimination have you been discriminated and in in any part of your life as a woman go ahead comedy i'm alpha woman i don't know any moment of my life anybody gotta discourage me okay okay but the thing is um everybody talking about it uh you see uh it's all about the culture okay in certain culture this doesn't exist okay and in malaysia i have to say i don't know but in my family it's never happened there's no notification in my family even today uh there's a there's a show is going on right my husband was very supportive you know he changed the bulk we want to make sure the environment is nice and everything i didn't ask him but you see uh he he wants something good happened out of this topic right so during school time also we we are as a woman i never had any issues in working place i work with a lot of male and female we don't have any issues and not even one of my boss said you are a female you shouldn't do this yeah and you see it's all about how you are bringing yourself and we we are nobody to say that hey i'm a woman you know you're a man i also can do like this there's no challenge here that should be understanding only you see um as a as a feminine individual i think that we are families in a different way we we have our own unique uniqueness you see if you see the europeans are leaders most of them are female now even the new zealand leaders are uh female now and they're doing very good in going uh pandemi okay so i i in this era we shouldn't be talking about this anymore very nice yeah very nicely yeah and i like and i like what you said you know men cannot do what women can do women cannot do what men can do so therefore respect each other and that's weird we need to accept it yeah men are good in their certain things like women are good in certain things we are we are different species but we are coming to one uh you know um thinking we are a human being first okay we are all human being first blood is the same color it's just that uh certain uh you know organs are different okay other than that we are all in the same we have a same brain of course women thinks more complex with things because of our uh you know uh task tasks that we do i would say there's a any uh challenge should be there you know even let's say if you have this problem in your working place you know even if you have this in your family members it's always good to understand why is it happened is it because of you is it because you have some kind of uh you know uh agenda out of it or you have the needs uh to come or you have some kind of issues to uh discussed uh for example when i was a head of department all my assistants are male all assistants are male i never seen them that saying that hey i don't want to listen to you you're a woman you know even uh when i was working with a male boss not even once he said hey i can do it you can't do it you always said you can do i cannot do you know so so yeah i i maybe i'm lucky no maybe i'm lucky or maybe my personality uh have moved me in that way maybe i i have shown people the result that this should be uh you know there should be should be this is something that i felt that shouldn't come again and again yeah yeah as a woman we're all unique as a woman we are unique uh you know i i started from my grandmother from my auntie for my mother my sister uh my friends my beloved friends everybody out there we all unique okay we don't need to fight with men men are unique men are unique in a day without them we are nobody without we are they are nobody that's all i would say very nicely very nicely said we are all unique in our own ways here and that's the message that needs to go across here uh you you did say that yeah maybe you're lucky yes maybe you are lucky or maybe you are looking at it in a different perspective altogether it's all about your eye view here how do you want to see there's always i i share to you one scenario okay uh maybe this is uh during my school time all the guys scared of me maybe the power uh maybe because i'm a perfect prefect or something they were very scared of me okay they even they know okay don't mess with this girl all right maybe they think like that but what i felt that is uh i'm not showing off uh being out of it for me at that time even my my school training my running i run with the boys and sometimes say hey i cannot catch you you know you run very fast but they won't say you're a woman they won't they never say it like that they just say it follow me you know you can you can you see so i've been with a lot of positive people also i i never seen anyone that uh you know putting me degrading me and saying that hey uh yeah you are you are you cannot do this you know yeah exactly i won't be with that kind of people also yeah exactly and that's the language pattern i think we all need to practice and cherish speak different you don't have to label someone uh you can always say it in a very pleasant manner now i'm getting a lot of messages after you said uh we are unique yeah and i'm going to read that to you so vishal vishalini says uh uh i totally agree that dramas have given negative impact to people and mainly the elders so i don't know what you think but uh yeah you have gotten okay but uh maliga manikam says what we watch does affect us to a certain extent especially especially what we're watching is uh something that we heard or experienced before yes it is indeed important and you should be very careful malika says uh ashwini sugumaran says good sharing is comedy susan is saying good job to your hubby for changing the bulk sharing a big shout out to your husband ma player you did it well yeah uh lim with him says a very positive sharing comedy then comes the uniqueness susan says woman rock uh legion says comedy very nicely said indeed thank you uh kieran says yes uh we all rock ruby pushpam says wow legions is surrounded positive people unless we are strong enough to influence negative people yes very rightfully said also stay positive and if you can't be with positive people i think that will actually help a lot i've got a question that just came by uh comedy maybe you want to answer this uh if someone wants to be like you uh any things that you do with the help that you render to many people what should they do how do you go about getting yourself maybe certified to become a psychotherapist or counselor go ahead uh even though if i finish my counseling in unistimalaya that doesn't mean i will straight away can get the registration under the counselor board okay so you need to have certain hours of counseling session with clients then you need to register with the counselor board and their counselor board will look into it whether you are qualified you need to have a a counselor to foresee you because every councillors they have another board counselors to support cu and you can study either psychology counseling or social work okay in malaysia help university do have certain courses ukm do have certain courses um do have certain courses upn they have courses in counseling but they have counseling in education okay and uh if you want to go oversea uh like uh of course singapore have a lot of this kind of courses i did in sus singapore university social science you also can do it in nus you also can do in james cook university there's a lot of universities that you can do but underline it's not only education you need to go through uh the job scope you can you need to join as a junior um if even for a case manager a nurse also can be a case manager but prolonged she have a psycho social experience in it if you really want to know the the pathway of it i am not very sure um in malaysia but in malaysia they have certain kind of different ranking that you can go to case manager especially case manager comes in hospital okay some organization uh some be the ngos and all that so it's all depends on the settings some people they call us case work caseworkers some some uh some management they call senior social work worker okay so there's a difference between social worker they need to do assessment okay we need to do the uh january jenna graham is all about how is your family started who who is still living at what age they have passed away and the january is a very big map to know what are the problem is coming so i was a bit lucky because i have seen to be a msw social worker and a case manager so i have circled all this uh knowledge around so um that that is also my choice you see when i was in the swan setting i would be planning after four years where am i want to go in which sector i have lacking of knowledge uh so that's how i move to all this uh thing it cannot be done a day you see you see a heart surgeon he cannot be born as in a day of course uh you need to have the experience the certification uh you need to do uh certain uh courses um like us there's no end in uh education we always need to uh you know we can't come up with our certification i would say but there is a part uh i hope in in future in malaysia also they have a lot of case manager especially during the spending meet you know uh to know what are the allocation out of this stuff yeah yeah so talking about malaysia right what's the state like in malaysia in terms of uh support uh do they have any support areas uh how is it for mental health support in malaysia okay help university have uh uk ham uh have you a university hospital they do have this malaysian assertion of mental health whereby you can go there's a character there's a 11 association that i think they are very active maybe we can share in the link later on to people seek help on it um i will say that we are still new i'll say we are still new to mental health maybe we are taboo to talk about it you see um as we having heart attack yes we are having a leg pain as we are having a body pain our not our consciousness also will have some issues it's also one of the organ you see so mental health is not something that you need to shine away or you know um you don't want to talk about it you feel like people will label you all the time you see you need to come out out of it if you think that any of your family members that need help you want to talk about it you always can bring them to any gps around a clinic that a line of this they can refer your your your case to the nearest hospital there's a lot of psychiatric uh doing this also in government hospital private hospital and you want to seek help there's always that but it's only thing is we don't know how what is the challenge but near the best thing i would say is if you fail that that you need help you can go to any clinic and to seek any doctors uh you can also google and check what is the nearest psychiatric need that you can look for and you can find out and you always can seek help but if you feel that you don't want to go to the doctor first you don't want to be scared right people are going to want to get diagnosed all right okay then then you can seek help in the organization like mental health malaysia uh you can also find out what are the other limitations that you have oh you think that diet you don't know what do you want to talk to anyone okay you can talk to your friends that you think that they can help you or you can talk to your family members first maybe you you you it's baby step you know mental health is all about baby steps some people they really cannot agree also that they're having problems they are feeling uh very scared hey how come i'm seeing things how come i cannot go to work what is stopping me uh why why i'm i'm changing what's the problem i'm having so all this kind of stuff there is a channel to help you in malaysia as well uh always look out for it maybe in future uh if i able to do a lot of uh you know sharing session and where the help that can be done will be very helpful stay tuned with us definitely definitely i will share your info also in my uh i am more than i think uh facebook page so that if they need any help they can contact you i've got a couple of messages coming in uh and then we can uh end the show by the last uh ever question that i will be asking miller when he's saying that what we speak will be uh come true uh bless your life she says ruby bushburn says you are so good and she also says that everything is in the mind yes and nila when he said this and it's very interesting what she said fear of labeling oh my i just learned it is a mental health problem good info so yes a lot of people have gained so much uh info from what you have just spoken uh one last thing any message that you have got for the people out there comedy um be resilient about yourself okay always there is a bad time and good times our life is like a river sometimes it will flow very fast sometimes we'll flow very slow and we never know when is the thunder when is the rain but never give up in your life always uh comes up with the positive vibes and keep yourself uh you know train up uh take care of your health uh always and also love your family you know uh that's that's the fundamental thing love your friends love your surroundings and uh yeah um not everything is good uh but take the bad things in a good way uh it's not the end of it we can start it up again i hope this pandemic will also taught us how to take care of the environment you know yeah okay environment and let's say that mental health we are not alone okay try to look up uh for our friends around family around who are being down trying to check with them what is actually causing them you know always put the eye maybe when you ask them they get treated out but try to look at them don't make them to be alone most of the depression cases happen when they're alone okay when they're there's nobody for them to talk about you see when there's a lot of negative talks about them about a lot of negative thoughts i'm not good i'm not good enough everything bad is happening to me uh i this is end of it so uh try to make it positive maybe maybe good words early morning when you wake up try to say good words to your children don't say hey you're so bad you're so naughty don't say this kind of word just say you're wonderful you're a wonderful child uh tell your husband you are good looking today you know some kind of performance and good words might help them in certain ways very nice very nice now i i wanted to end but i just have this one question that came by because it is mental health uh that matters i don't want to lose this question uh if a person is diagnosed with mental health issues does the family need to attend for check as well can you share a little bit you see uh high scene clients who really don't want to share with their family members because they don't want them to label them they will say hey you you like this you like that okay it's all depends on the uh person itself it same goes to a certain person who having cancer diagnosed with cancer maybe they don't want the family to know maybe they want to make it private you see but when it comes to case management let's say it is a nuisance let's say that the family found it that a nuisance happening in the family the person who reported is actually uh the other family i mean not the patient itself so in that kind of environment we need to tell the family members what are the plans that we are having for the particular patients but let's say if you're bringing the person to clinic and without his knowledge you can't go and inform everyone because this is his personal life you see because in certain countries and certain job scope if you're having depression if you've been diagnosed with depression they won't take you for work certain in certain places not overall but i hope it will change in future so um so labeling again i'm coming to labeling uh to answer to vishal means uh question you always can bring the person if the family if the person uh don't want to share to the other party you see but if they want to share it's up to them okay but of course as a counselor or the doctor they won't go and tell the entire family or any working place but if some of the companies need your verification out of it because i saw some of the insurance companies asking now right whether you are affected with any mental illness or not right yeah okay all right very nice very nice uh comedy uh i've got no words to say yeah there's so much of sharing it is very nice uh i can only say nandreen andreen thank you so much very nice thank you so much for sharing so many details so many stories so many tips why simply because this is the time when we need to help each other and if you can help me i can help you everyone else can help each other thank you so much i think we use the word rather than using help we use the word assist yes you see sometimes we are thinking oh help is not a good word maybe we can assist people in a different way like yes very nicely said uh assist that's the word ladies and gentlemen assist let's start assisting each other means just holding someone's hand and then just be there with them the least that you could do is just give a lending here i must say yeah so be resilient resilience is very important you wanted to say something comedy i think uh break the sequence also don't every time do the same thing every day try to take the maybe if you want to dance the breakdowns at night also no problem but don't want to disturb the neighbor yeah exactly yeah so don't break the relationship with your neighbor neighbors but then do break dance so break the pattern do something different get a life be creative you can do so many things and it's very important yeah copycat suicidal spoken by comedy in a lengthier manner please do not share bad things do not forward whatever that you have got which is so not nice to anyone if can you do the the first move by breaking the chain breaking the pattern delete that message so that it doesn't go to anyone else stop forwarding uh and and and it is very important you wanted to say something comedy just delete it yes exactly so just yeah if it is not a good message delete delete and delete that's it and mental health is like having a fever here seek for help everyone can be safe you don't know when is thunder you don't know when it's rain you don't know when it's sunshine like what former this is so talk to people the only thing that you can do is you can talk to people and something that is very important that comedy said love love love so love thy neighbor love everyone thank you so much for loving each and everyone that's the least that you could do and see how things can change remember you're not alone uh talk to someone at the best person if you don't have anyone else is you yourself i am more than i think i am more than i think ladies and gentlemen thank you so much we shall meet again same time same day next week thank you everyone bye bye bye thank you bye ,False,False,True,False
sz5yEiBAXLA,YouTube drama and getting cancelled (ft: Lingyi &amp; Keiji - Wah!Banana) | Spill It EP 2,UCZIFMbNxioPMocam2VmbhFA,You Got Watch,2020-09-18T10:30:44Z,"spillit #youtuber #yougotwatch Anybody can be a YouTuber, but how long can the job sustain? Watch to find out how Singaporean YouTubers Lingyi (Wah!","I literally had $18 in my bank. How much? $18. Oh my. Hi, I’m Lingyi. Hi, I'm Keiji. and we’re both YouTubers. Today we are going to play Spill It, and we’re gonna answer all your questions about being YouTubers. So, Wah!Banana has been around for 8 years. It was on YouTube but it was not Wah!Banana and it was more gaming specific and then we decided to try something
that’s more generic and targeting the mass. I actually started YouTube on my own. After poly I decided that I kinda need to work full-time. So I joined this company called TheSmartLocal and i was heading their video department. After a year, I left to do solo YouTube again and in the end, I ended up with Wah Banana and everything is great and rainbows and sunshines. Ya, cause you are still with us. I’m hoping for juicy questions for Lingyi. Huh... I’m very scared of
relationship-related questions, that’s all. The rest, I’m super okay with. I’m an open book, I’ve nothing to hide. To start the game, each player will draw 5 question cards from the deck. Players will then take turns choosing a question
card from their hand to ask the opponent. Players will also be given 3 action cards each, where they can Skip, Swap or Switch 
questions at any point of time For Skip, skip the question. Swap, ditch the question and
answer the next card from the deck. Switch, get your opponent to answer instead! Wah… If these questions were for me, I'd be like yeah easy. Thank god, this question is not for me. First question Keiji, Yes. True or False: Sex sells. True, you gotta be honest lah. I think when you start off Youtube, it’s very hard to get eyes on your
channel if you're a brand new channel. You get a pretty girl in your video, you’re gonna get views. Or a pretty guy. I want to emphasize, nothing wrong. I mean you’re not breaking any law. Now, do I encourage such behaviour? Not exactly. True or False: Anyone can be a YouTuber. Anybody who uploads a video
on Youtube is a Youtuber. If that’s your definition, then yes. But, if you’re talking about someone that is uploading quality content, then no lah. What type of content are you least proud of? Honestly, I’ve no video that I will take down. But, I guess maybe content that I totally sold, sell out. Like it’s clearly an ad. But you must understand, we also need to make money. There’s no creative way to show you. “Hi, please buy this.” True or False. This is a hard one, alright. Being on camera has affected my mental health. Yes, so body image lor. I think appearing on camera itself,
does not really affect anything. But the comments, does. The comments… Yeah... I had a funny comment once
when I was on a flight right. Some audience came up to me and then he just said this
“Wow, you’re actually not fat in person.” And I was like… Thanks? True or False: I secretly hate the attention. It’s not like I love it but, it’s part and parcel of so-called our lives. So, if you’re someone like
“Walao, I don’t like the attention.” I think maybe YouTube is not the correct career path. I’m quite thick skin lah, to be honest so... Fame, come my way. What is the best and worst thing
about being a YouTuber? So, I’m gonna switch. I’m gonna let Lingyi answer it. Being able to create content
on Youtube for my own channel is, the feeling is unbeatable. Like you have the freedom to do whatever you want. Kinda like your own boss. Yes, I love that. There is no restriction. Okay, one of the bad things is I think, because it’s relatively easy production wise and to us because we’ve been
around for so many years. So it’s quite easy for us to sustain
and maintain whatever we’re doing. So, we get comfortable. So, the kind of content we create, 
sometimes I feel it’s not that great. But, because we’re too comfortable,
we don’t want to change. True or false: YouTubers are public figures
who should always uphold a proper image. Personally, I say true. I feel like as long as you have a certain number of young, impressionable kids looking at you, at what you do in your life you do have a so-called social thing where you kinda not want to
influence them in a bad way. But also, they are humans. Everyone makes mistakes and it’s
very hard for you to be a perfect person. What is your weirdest fan experience? The DMs are pretty crazy. I’ve been offered quite a lot of money to, Let’s just say spend time with a certain person. How much money? We’re talking about monthly allowance. Why I no receive such offers? I mean the reason is very obvious, ya. What do you think about the type of content
that Singaporean YouTubers put out? I’m gonna be honest and say it has been pretty stale. Like everyone has been pretty much doing
the same for the last couple of years. But, it has been improving. Everyone has been copying the
formula that you guys set. 10 types of… Listicles video. It’s a formula that works. It gets views, it gets your channel growing. Honestly, Singaporeans a bit lack creativity. There are a few YouTubers popping
out that I really enjoy their content. Shout out to: Sneaky Sushii. I think he is one of the… He is definitely going to grow. He’s kinda like Pewdiepie. Have you ever struggled to pay
the bills because of your profession? I would like to switch that question. I have, it was when i left TSL and I started doing solo YouTube career. I hit my lowest low. I literally had $18 in my bank. How much? $18. Oh my, okay. And it’s so sad because you can only withdraw $20. It was hard. YouTube don’t earn money guys. Please don’t join so that we got less competition. What is the meanest comment you’ve ever received? Cos, we’ve been trying to do different content. Like younger audiences might not get them and older audiences like them but they don’t share it so, it gets less views. But, there are some comments about those
seriously good videos that we make. And they say stuff like
“You guys have run out of ideas.” And I don’t think there are thoughts
behind those comments. They are set out there to be mean. What have you given up for YouTube? I think I’ve given up privacy. Pretty much my life, my friends. It’s out there for everyone to see. Even my home address, if you Google it you can find it. Have you ever lost friends because of YouTube? I did have a very personal fight
with one of my ex-boyfriend. You know there is a kind of boyfriend
that takes photos like this. And there is another one that takes like this. I was sort of made fun of, like why you pose like that, that, that and that. We had a fight but my finishing line of my fight was, “That was my job.” That’s when he understood. True or false: I have a different personality off-screen. I just want to use this just for the sake of using it. I want to swap. It’s worse? Do you feel threatened by the new 
generation of Singaporean YouTubers? Not gonna lie, I do feel a little bit threatened, because, they’re definitely growing way faster and reaching my goal at a faster rate than what I took. Shout out to once again: Squishy Sushii, Sneaky Sushii. But it's good, we always need more content creators. The YouTube scene definitely needs more help. Have you ever secretly left a bad
comment on another YouTube channel? I’m going to skip this, not because I’ve done it. Okay, I’ve not. I think I’ve made it when… That’s a hard question to answer
because I think I’ve already made it. To be realistic, it’s been so long and
I’ve not gotten my YouTube plaque yet. Because I need 100,000 subs. Just having that kinda like validates what I do and it confirms that, yeah people enjoy my content. So, that’s honestly a goal I set for 2020. But guess what? 2020 says no. The general public think my job is … Pure fun and no struggles. I would agree that the majority of my job is pure fun. Ya, there are struggles just like any other full-time jobs. We’ve employee issues, we’ve hiring issues, we’ve budgeting issues And with COVID, we'd have no jobs. Same as anybody else. Have you ever been done wrong by another YouTuber? When I started YouTube, I didn’t have a lot of help. So, there was another YouTuber that actually
lived literally 2 blocks away from me. We shared video ideas and everything and he basically stole one of my idea, filmed it and uploaded it on his channel and claimed it as his own. I’m not going to name names obviously but, ya. I’m going to name names. Like okay, to be honest, there
is a lot of YouTube drama. It is Jian Hao. It’s not, it’s not, it’s not, it’s not, it’s not, it’s not. True or false: I have a fear of
being forgotten or irrelevant? Of course. If people don’t like us anymore,
then I’ll lose the business. Hence, all my guys won’t get paid. But how do you keep relevant then? How do you keep up to date? There’s two ways to do this YouTube thing right. So, the first one is you grow up with your audience. You know 8 years ago we do certain type of content. Then along the way, you change your content
because you are more mature. But, there is another logical explanation of why so many programmes
they are so long across years but they are still popular because if you believe your audience is, 
let’s say 18 years old, once this 18 year old grow up, there is 
always going to be another 18 year old. Have you ever dated a fan? The question is easy to answer. I’ve never even gone on a date. If they know me, I actually feel
less attracted to that person. Because it becomes a very weird relationship already. True or false: Sometimes I regret taking this route. I have never regretted it. I think it is one of the most interesting 
thing I’ve done in my life. This one says: Ask anything you want! If you have done something
politically-incorrect 5 years ago, and it's now being discovered by the public, how would you address the problem? I think first, we got to look at
how you’ve grown as a person. If your behaviour is consistent
to what you’ve done 5 years ago, then, good luck to you. But if somehow, something came
out that I did 5 years ago. I offended someone or I did something really bad, what you should do as a human
being is to apologise for your actions. And kinda explain to people why you did it 5 years ago. At the situation, no one knows
what’s happening with you. You could be going through some stuff
personally, that no one understood. And you just like rage, you just want to vent out your feelings. So, I feel it is very hard to cancel someone for something they did so far back. 5 years ago, I feel like a lot of things have changed. And also, jokes that you said 5 years ago,
it's funny but now it’s no longer funny. It’s offensive, correct. What is the most ridiculous thing
you’ve done to gain viewers? We’ve used you know questionable thumbnails, that may not be very relevant
to the content of the video. Have you bought views? No, we have never bought. I don’t know how to do that. Let me teach you. Okay, lai. Last question of the day. If I ever quit YouTube one day, it’s because… The main reason why I started YouTube is 
because it is a creative outlet for me. I like content creation. But i think, if it comes to a point where I get fatigued, I’m like I don’t want to create content anymore. A scary reason to leave YouTube would be,
I did something wrong. I think that is something that
keeps me on my toes as well. Some mistakes, let’s just say,
it's hard to come back from. So to the kid who is watching this video, who really wants to become a YouTuber, I would say, do it and you can be as big as you dream. If you want to do YouTube, do it with a purpose of, something that you either do
to have fun or with friends. If you, in your mind be like “I want to be famous,” “I want to earn a lot of money.” Let me just kinda like break your dream bubble a lil’ bit. It’s going to be a long time. So, if you come to YouTube just having fun, no pressure of being famous or what, you’re gonna have a great time! I think making content to impress yourself is
something that you should always remember. Otherwise, you will lose your path
and you will lose the purpose. Okay, thank you so much for

question and answer session prof chan please thank you uh eugene i hope you can see me hi everybody david chan as eugene from word publisher has informed you this is the first time i think we are doing this just for the record it is not really a book launch it is a book talk as most of you would have known by now this book is about the kovic knighting crisis and i decided to write it quite recently and then the book was published in fact in july so it's just about a few weeks old i think it's available on the website uh available at the bookstores and when world publisher uh uh wsbc uh scientific and i we talked about having a book launch obviously we cannot because of the physical restrictions of gathering and then we ask ourselves should we do an online book launch instead and i said no maybe not i think what we should do is the book talk and the reason being that instead of publicizing a book which is not an intention perhaps the intention is for us to have a conversation that's why we decided to do this live i was told that right now we have about a few hundred people uh listening in and i'm unable to see you unfortunately you can see me i hope and some of you are my friends but there are many of you according to the registration list that i actually do not know who you are and i apologize for that but uh from the organizations or the occupations that you listed i noticed that we have a few hundred people right now listening in who are from diverse segments of the population we not only have academics we have policy makers we have people of course from the public private and the people sector and there are just a few of us who are just logging in uh just uh having an afternoon listening to a chat talk and so on so first let me thank you once again uh for spending your precious friday with us uh what i'll do is i'll just spend the next few minutes not too long uh very casually colloquially and formally to chat with you about some of the ideas that i've written in the book in order for us to reflect on not just the last few months that has happened quite quite dramatically to the world and to us by looking forward and say what can we learn from some of these lessons and my purpose of doing this talk is really for us to think through uh because it is really a protracted crisis right it is not something that uh that is just going to come and go in a very short while and from all predictions uh you know for the next year or so not only we cannot travel for your holidays there's going to be quite a great disruptions in every aspect of our lives um and the way i see how we can organize our thoughts and reflection whether it is for individual actions or for collective action or for policy making or even as an employer or a co-worker how do we navigate the harsh realities that's ahead of us perhaps is to look back and document and think through and reflect uh what how have we behaved how have uh the government behave how has the businesses behave uh how have our family and friends and ourselves behave and the way we think the way we feel can we learn from these lessons in the past few months because if it is a protracted crisis uh things that have just happened could very well happen again and i'm referring not just to waves of infection it could very well be in the case of singapore that there could be another outbreak in the dorm that could be an outbreak in the community when we have certain gatherings or when the fiscal restrictions are eased a bit further and if we are complacent uh if we are not socially irresponsible or even if even if we are and there could be things that happen and when we find ourselves having to go through different types of restrictions again it could also mean that those of you who have gone back to the office may not be able to have to go and go back home and start working from home it could also be a same business model that you have been working on and you thought it is fine i'm going to revert back to my old business model and then you find that you can't do that again so perhaps the way to look at it is to organize the kind of information that we already know after the six or seven months of outbreak uh into three types of issues which i'll briefly share with you about and then i hope to be able to pause and take live questions uh that from you uh eugenia will be able to see the questions that you put into the chat box i'm unable to see for technical reasons and then i'll let the eugenia decide what questions to ask so that i get to hear from each one of you and try to address issues perhaps issues that are not even listed in the book now back to the issues that we want to organize to reflect ourselves to reflect about the issues i tend to look at it as three broad issues and the first issue is for all of us to understand the context of this virus and the second issue to understand the leadership and the public responses in reaction to this crisis and then the third type of issue is about the psychological preparedness for that all of us have to be prepared as we move forward as we think and as we look forward so the first issue is about the context now by now unless you're living in a cave right all of us know that it is a pandemic um by pandemic if you think the epidemiological or public health definition it simply means that you know when you have an epidemic that's already occurring in various countries in multiple continents and then you get declared as a pandemic like what wh o the world health organizations did some months back but i would say that this is really a crisis of pandemic proportions and by that i mean that it is not just a health crisis right by now we all know that it is also an economic crisis and even not just an economic crisis it is really a crisis that has multi-faceted dimensions it has affected us sociologically socially politically psychologically and so on um and so it means that it's quite important for all of us to come together it's not just a political propaganda kind of a statement to say let's work together and much stronger together i think the important point is for us to be a bit more humble all of us take a step back and say you know there are things that i have assumed things that i thought i knew perhaps i don't know everything and i don't know as much as i thought and it is time to look around look back on the assumptions that we have made whether it is in organization leadership business or just the way we react to uh we relate to our families and think through and ask ourselves say are there things that we could have done better what are some of the things that we have done that in retrospect uh we really shouldn't have done it not so much of hindsight buyers but actually over there in the past when you look at the information that we had we could at that time have made another decision which could have been better but i know it's the kind of a humility that i hope that all of us can can have and the kind of a spirit that when we have whether you are reading this book an article or speaking to another person or having a meeting to review issues and so on so the context of the crisis then uh the pandemic crisis crisis that we're in the the properties if you like the features of the crisis it is very very important it is not something that is just meant for academics or public health professionals or profession or politicians to profess about but let me try and explain this this pandemic is one that's undergoing exponential growth so what that means is that if you just follow me here if you have a graph that's on the x-axis representing time it really means that when we say this evolving rapidly it is not a straight line right it is actually a curvy linear line it's an exponential curve it goes this way and then it goes out very rapidly so you know that is why it is not surprising at all for those of us who understand the statistics behind the spread that within a few months you find that the numbers get doubled in the shorter time so we actually we as globally the world actually managed to reach a 10 million cases in about six months or so and right now in seventh month you already have more than 20 million right and it also means that if status quo or if nothing is done if people or government do not take precautions and continue to be complacent or become more likes the cases could increase dramatically and when that happens it also means that governments have no choice but to take actions in order to protect its citizens that means you could go back and revert back to lockdowns and so on we have already seen this internationally we saw this in vietnam we saw this in hong kong even new zealand which has been a model you find that just recently there are some cases again and the government has decided to impose a some kind of a restriction restricted lockdown so in singapore we seem to be pretty fortunate as some of us would say in a sense that while there are quite a number of cases in a relatively short time compared to the population they are relatively contained within the doms of course it raises a second a different issue about what's happening in the dormitories uh in the case of the community the cases are quite low and in fact it has been falling at rather low and stable for the past few weeks um just bear in mind that there are cases that are mount symptoms or asymptomatic uh from all evidence we can tell the virus is still in the community somewhere and that is why you can continue to have community cases which are unlinked there could also be people who get the virus but because it's asymptomatic and you just rest and you recover from it and there could be that time that you are actually also infectious so i just want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that wearing your mask social safe distancing and all the safe management rules are actually as important if not more important than the previous months that we have been vigilant and so on i think that's an important point for us to note when we think about the context of the kovit 19 virus now the second thing i just want to talk about is the leadership and the public reaction right and that presupposes or rather a premise on the important issue about adaptation demands now what do i mean by that it means that when we are confronted with this crisis there is not just a crisis of public health but economically it has affected businesses affected families and in a very drastic way because of the lockdowns and various fiscal restrictions on people movements and people mingling in the community we find ourselves confronted with demands that we have never experienced before now some of you i know will disagree with me and say look david we have gone through various crises we have gone through the sas crisis we have gone through september 11 we have gone through asian global financial crisis you know in about the last 17 20 and even as recently as the last 10 years now i would argue that all these experiences that we had which we did well we came back and bounced back quite quickly are really qualitatively quite different from what we are going through now for one this is a very protracted crisis the second this is an extremely multi-dimensional crisis unlike the previous crisis where the domains or the people who are affected are relatively contained and in some sense if you were to just spend less money if you were to just hunker down be more disciplined be more prudent you know when the crisis in the past blows over we can come back and this is like business as usual from all that we can tell now i think people recognize that when this crisis is over it's going to be quite some time but even then even if it's eventually over things will never be back to a pre kovit 19 status so hence the term post pandemic realities and what those post pandemic gravities are becomes important but even before we get to the post pandemic realities i for the past few months have gone through various demands demands that are new to us right you know in the past some of us love to work at home and we thought that working from home is wonderful and it is a privilege that belongs to only some select field now after working from home for many months some of you actually detest you know i don't like to work from home and to be fair uh even from day one there are many families that find that working from home is really quite tough especially when they coincide with hpl right the home-based learning where you have to deal with take care of your kids to make sure that things are okay take care of households and all happening at the same time where you are doing zoom like this having a meeting and having to meet the demands of your bosses so we were in a situation where the demands were completely novel to us you know i i'm very very sure that none of us have had the experience of having to work at home not by choice but by constraint for several months right just that alone is something quite dramatic for many of us but much more important than that where the economic crisis the smes and that we're talking about almost three quarter of the singapore's population have gone through a very tough time and that economic uh difficulties that that the people have gone through actually spilled over to many many different parts of our lives of the singapore society and it's not just an economic issue and that is something that leadership becomes important our public responses become important how do we deal with some of these negative reactions that will happen how do we enhance and make sure that that continues to be social responsibility and how do we make sure that anything that is negative can be contained can be dealt with very quickly and also for example when we start having technology to do contact tracing uh you know do people have that trust uh in what you say as a government that you are respecting the privacy the information you collected uh the way that you're dealing with it is indeed the way that you would actually deal with it so issues of public trust all this becomes important and of course you will need to read the book uh to understand my views or to to get a sense of what i think is happening in the dormitories uh and how we have dealt with that successfully but also at some parts where communications especially could have been much better and those are very important issues i think for policy makers uh public servants some of you are probably listening in right now uh to reflect on because as time goes by remember the same things can happen again and when the same things happen again we really need to do better than the first time that we did because we all should have learned from the consequences of certain mistakes or certain things that we should have done otherwise and so so the first issue as i said is the context of the virus the the pandemic that we need to understand the second issue is about the importance of leadership the importance of trust and the importance of the public responses in terms of being socially responsible how to handle the negative reactions as we adapt to the various demands and the final thing that i just wish to say is the notion of psychological preparedness um many of us will just use the the term say resilience you know let's go through with it and so on it is really much more than that right the good news is that if you were to reflect back on the the various months that we have gone through even people who found themselves in difficulty took time not just to appreciate our frontline workers but also took time to help out with people who are in in fact to seek them out but not just our friends but even strangers and that kind of positivity that all of us have in the sort of innate in us it is a very effective counter to the negativity that we sometimes have no choice but experience with the difficult demands that come along and in the book what i try to explain is that there is no contradiction to feel negative sometimes and sometimes you really ought to feel negative when things are not right with the notion that we need to enhance the kind of positivity that all of us have as individuals as groups as organizations or collectively as a society so in the third part of the book what i did was try to let us take a step back think through about the positivity constructs that we all know about actually and how to apply that in our personal lives apply that of course at the workplace and also apply that in your policy making in your communications for those of you are policy makers because it's a protracted crisis uh positivity is just critical i think if we are not uh aware of positivity and if we don't start enhancing positivity i think it is very difficult for us to develop the social and psychological capital that we need for the country to emerge stronger and for the country to actually go through this crisis there are going to be a lot of practical things that uh uh uh to be sure they're gonna be a lot of practical difficulties right that we will face uh let me just give you a quick example because i noticed that while it is being talked about in mainstream media uh maybe less so in social media i don't think it has been given the kind of attention that uh it deserves you notice that during the the crisis and it's still ongoing there are many people who have lost their jobs and we are very concerned uh and everyone is very concerned right both the people in the government with people from lower income families and you want to make sure that they are taken care of you know that they can still have their meals they can pay their rent and things are okay with them on a very basic sustainable basis but i think what we have forgotten also is that it's not just the lower income right there are people who are in what we call the middle class even the upper middle class that as a result of the crisis you could have closed down your business you could have lost your jobs it is quite a different set of issues altogether because what happened is that for many of these people who have been getting a very decent salary all their lives suddenly when they move from a state of self-reliance to a state of dependence and when you're in a state of dependence uh when we're not careful uh when things are not clear you might first not get the help that you need and second you might actually lose the dignity that you have so it is very important i think for the government for the organizations and employers to recognize that uh the people that we have been dealing with the people that you know that we have been dealing with on the day-to-day basis where you think that everything is fine you can take care of yourself might not be quite true right in the next few months or even one or two years to follow it is important for us to be sensitive to their needs uh needs which traditionally we think that it will not occur to them because they are self-sufficient individuals so to speak so that is a something that i think we need to give much more attention to both in the media in policymaking as as employers and co-workers we will need to look out for each other i would love to go on and on but i don't think i should uh the purpose really of uh having this job talk uh the purpose of having this book talk uh is to really uh get a conversation going with all of you and i hope that all of you could uh be very frank and ask questions by typing into your chat box any questions that come into mind we probably cannot address all questions i'll leave it completely to eugenia to select the questions and then can speak aloud so that everybody can hear the questions and we try to deal with these issues each one of them as much as we could in the remaining 20 minutes we have so we're on time we have exactly 21 minutes now to take some of your questions uh thank you eugene can i hand it back to you thank you very much for your insightful comments let us now begin the q a session i can see that we already have quite a few questions from our live audience um so the very first question is from justin and justin says question for dr david chan amid the health pandemic and a economic depression on the brink of occurring was kovit 19 a gift so as to speak that it polarizes the structural changes that are already occurring even before covet 19 and that kovit 19 was the catalyst of that forced singaporeans to adapt and transform digitally on top of that do you see singapore coming out stronger mentally after this covet 19 crisis especially those growing up and entering the job market as a fresh grad thank you all right thank you justin i think your question really has four questions in it right the idea of generally uh is this the plus or minus and secondly whether structurally uh it actually is useful right it's a blessing in disguise so to speak and you give the example of digital digitization right where singapore and many other countries are trying to push us towards not just cashless payment but to make use of a digital electronic communications ict information communication technology much more and the assumption is that there have been some resistance either by employers by different segment of the population and this kobe 19 is therefore a blessing in disguise it has catalyzed and forced us to go ahead and do that but in so doing uh which is the third and fourth question whether people are affected are there going to be some people that is going to fall behind and uh and do better or do worse so uh i not sure if i can take all four questions but let me just say this right uh in most crisis uh there's always plus and minuses the very obvious thing is that the initial reactions as you notice uh what i try to say in my book is that you must pay attention to the negatives first because in the crisis management any good leadership will know that if you are not paying to the to the situation of preventing the adverse consequences from happening and when you let it happen when it is actually preventable there is no chance to talk about positivity later because you simply cannot bounce back right so i think most governments in uh in the world except for some which i shall not name most governments in the world actually did the right thing by very quickly uh ring fencing by very quickly doing lockdowns either partial lockdowns or full lockdowns contact tracing people and having what we call relatively harsh fiscal restriction kind of a rules whether you are from the eastern or western culture they proceeded with it and i thought those were very important and correct things from the public health perspective as well as from an economic perspective because if we don't take care of the public health situation and let it run out of control we cannot talk about you know bouncing back economically and so on so it is never an either though you take care of the life first without life you can't have livelihood and so it was right in the first few months to focus so much attention on the life and sometimes even at the expense right requiring businesses to close down and by and large i think people are reasonable they understood that situation but you cannot maintain this situation forever and hence you needed to focus back on the economy to bounce back because people need livelihood and so on now the plus that justin talked about is about the digitization i think it's a yes or no clearly for those of us who refuse to learn zoom and some of you have now learned zoom because now you're with me myself included right i've never used zombie for the kovit 19 and now we know how to use zoom and that has been helpful without zoom i probably it's not so easy for me to have an audience of several hundred listening to me right now uh and then i could only share it with a more limited group of people so clearly what uh what the kovit 19 unintended positive consequence that has happened is that inmate digitization the good things about digitization happening faster than it should because we are forced to do it so you do not talk about communications talk about delivery and so on but remember the faster you do it when we are not careful and when you don't have a caring and a good government to take care of things there will be people who will get left behind right people who are not necessarily just elderly folks but people who may not just be having conducive environment to do things electronically if we don't take care of these individuals and these families then you will see the the larger the digital divide in singapore we are pretty okay because i think uh government ngos and people do pay attention to this widening digital divide and as we move along we just make sure that nobody is left behind so it is not a given that things will all be positive but what we can do is to ensure that the positive to be and the positives don't turn into negatives eugenia all right um so another question from alif so alice is wondering what is the psychological impact of how people view work moving forward and what are some tips you might want to give to better leaders i suppose i suppose leaders you men are leaders in the organization but actually it will also mean leader national leaders right our political leaders because they have a great say and a great impact in their policy and decisions on a day-by-day basis to affect how organizations structure their businesses structure their work and so on i think the psychology of work of course is multi-dimensional but the psychology of work is pretty important uh let me just go back to the example i gave right the example that uh that your traditional groups that you are vulnerable we tend to think about vulnerable groups as elderly people you know people who cannot find for themselves you think about low income you think about people with with various fiscal or mental disabilities yes these are vulnerable groups in fact because precisely they are well-defined vulnerable groups uh government and ngos pay a lot of attention to them so in the history of our country i think we are quite confident that we will try our very best to make sure these individuals don't fall behind too much and make sure we equip them with the necessary skills not just for survival but to to actually do well subsequently to have a social mobility to have a good good quality of life so to speak uh recall that i mentioned that there are many of us who may classify ourselves as middle class or upper middle class doing very well you could even be staying in a private housing estate but things have changed so much that suddenly you find yourself in both economic and social difficulties now these are the individuals i think we need to be very very careful now recall that we have a jobs council uh started a chat by uh senior minister tarman where we are going to have uh trying to create job opportunities training ships so that you can transit and take up something before you move on to a permanent job and so on the message will be and i can understand the message is that we should not be choosy you know you should learn to adapt and you should take up the jobs but you also need to understand you meaning all of us need to understand that it is not easy for somebody who have been living a life of self-reliance for many many years having a decent salary with a mortgage to pay and a family to support to suddenly change and do a job where you are quite skillless where you don't have a necessary skill to do it for long what will happen well people may just not do the job or when people who do the job they will not actually perform well so when you ask about the question of the psychology at work it might sound fluffy to you but i would say it is totally critical for us to ensure that as we create jobs as we find people and move people to jobs never forget the importance of the fit between your job demands and the job skills and the interests that you have because those interests while you can develop there are some sets of things that you can imagine some sets of things you can't match now what can we do as a co-workers or employers in the organization you can do relatively simple things that are free of charge you can make your job make the redesign the job so that it's more meaningful so that when the worker is doing it the worker continues to feel motivated because you are able to use the skills that you have and able to work with people to accomplish a task and see how the tasks relate to what i'm doing so the sense of responsibility the sense of autonomy the sense of meaningfulness in a job is absolutely critical it will continue to make us motivated to learn new skills to stay in the job to do well and so on so so don't take this as a transient things and and don't send the message that everybody please lower your expectations yes we need to be realistic in our expectations but it doesn't mean that we need to sacrifice the meaning of work because the purpose of work and remember this for all employers and all psychologists or policy makers we must make sure that through work we enhance our human dignity and develop it and not to work you diminish the dignity that we have regina yep right so the next question is singapore has been doing very well in handling the pandemic compared to many other countries so why do we still hear so many criticisms do you think these criticisms are ignorant or unfair well that question is quite tough because you started with a premise that singapore is doing very well relative to other countries is that a fact well it is a fact in from many perspectives uh but it may not be effect from other perspectives if you look at death rates we are exceedingly low you know we are very good and that's because of our wonderful not just healthcare facilities but the healthcare workers that we have their commitment and so on but it's also because of the ecosystem the healthcare ecosystem right whereby it is very well linked with other public services linked well with contact tracing we are very good in our contact racing and also with the political and civil service leadership that they had to make difficult decisions so it is a whole health ecosystem that that we have built up uh and so we managed to actually on the healthcare front did very well in a in context raising uh in the quality of the healthcare now from that perspective i would say that we are among the top in the world uh and that is something that you don't just accomplish overnight right it took a four-sided to build up but then there are other things that some people will say that well how did the large number of infections occur at the dormitories uh there are various perspectives to it right i can't go into detail given the little time that we have but as i try to say in the book that there are some things that we could have controlled better but there are other things that we actually did extremely well so whether we did well compared to other countries it very much depending on who is evaluating it and which aspect of the issues that we are looking at it is true right compared to many other countries we have been doing a pretty well in many dimensions but don't let that get into our heads you know and be complacent and say you know we are wonderful and so on and bear in mind that even if we have done really well we have to open our borders at some point it's 20.5 million right now and is and all over around us there are there are many infections we can't close your bottles for too long right and then soon you have to deal with imported cases community cases and so on so i think that is kind of a reality check when we make the assumption that we have done relatively well to other countries so i'll just end this answering this question with one more point and that is that the question seems to also assume that why singaporeans or people living in singapore could be singaporeans pr or foreigners tend to be very harsh right with either the authorities on how we manage the crisis because the question says why are we criticizing are we ignorant are we unfair in every country yes there will be some very negative criticisms of the authorities of everybody in fact that are ignorant that are unfair that happens in every country and there's no reason to think that singapore will not have a segment of people that adopt that attitude but i dare say that that is a statistical minority that most people when they criticize it is not based on ignorance or unfair right it was based on a contextual situation that you were completely affected by the crisis and there's lots of uncertainty it was volatile and the situation was such that um the response either in policy or people or yourself or your family were not meeting those demands and those challenges adequately and in the absence of good communication then the criticisms arise so i would argue that don't blame it on the people the critic being ignorant or unfair there will be some but understand why those criticisms occur especially when those criticisms are occurring and they are surprising to you because you thought that you have been doing very well when i say you it refers not just to policy makers it could be an employer of an organization and so on right so i want to take these opportunities to call out those of you who have some influence right in leadership positions uh do not always not always to not uh try to whenever possible externalize the problems right the first step is to have the humility to say hey could it be me could it be my policy could it be my leadership reaction that actually caused this as opposed to saying that oh people are full of negativity in the way they criticize they are ignorant they are unfair you know what we need to avoid in the country and everywhere else is a kind of destructive cynicism people who just criticize with no good reasons right regardless of the facts but what we want to promote is actually not just positivity what we want to promote is also a sense of healthy skepticism because we need a population they are able to descend right to be able to know that when someone say something what is the evidence for the claims uh we need to ask because transparency and accountability are important once we adopt that attitude uh things will be much better you know and you want to turn the person with a healthy skepticism to one who is actually positive understand the situation do well and then we can work collectively together and then you can talk about notions that emerge together stronger and so on gina yep thank you paul johnson you mentioned borders reopening i have a question here about that so from ac he is asking kobit will be here for a while and when the borders reopen we may see spikes after spikes until a viable vaccine is available at a large scale so we can be looking at yes how do you think the government can help sustain and for how long with the help of measures and relief packages or how can it tweak the current approach after all the governmental surplus are not unlimited and income tax receipts will fall as more lose their jobs or switch to lower paying jobs yeah the person asking questions the person asking these questions sell very much right from the ministry of finance so i'm just joking it is true right and it's a very good question because i don't know how much results we have we don't know right but no matter how much results we have it is a limited reserve but you can't possibly use up all your reserve for one crisis because a subsequent crisis may occur and so on it is also not right to keep on using the reserve remember i talked about self-reliance you know there are many people who are not just there waiting for money to drop on the sky or given by the government there are many people who want their problems soft and what they want is that to have the kind of money to be able to tie through a period to have the kind of opportunities to restart your business to go back to work to take care of your children take care of your elderly parents and also to find your own job so that you become not just independent uh self-reliant but be able to to to lead a good quality of life by your own motivation and your own effort the psychology tell us that that is true of all of us right and don't have don't ever have the mentality that you know singaporeans are all just waiting for money to drop from the sky i don't think that is true and i think the government recognized that and hence uh the government actually took a very drastic step right in not just the amount of money you withdraw they withdrew from the reserves in the four budgets that was given up in a very very short time but also in terms of policy ideologies right the underlying the ideology you are giving out people giving money to masses right in fact you read the papers that you were giving out money to people sometimes without requiring them to produce any documentary proof which is something that is entirely unusual of most governments and especially our government who are very particular about doing things systematically being a good stewardship of public money and so on so the point to remember is that we don't know when some of this help is going to stop at some point you will have to stop what is important for the government and the policy makers to recognize is that you know you just can't win people and say i stopped giving you money you're on your own right you need a graduated approach right aggregated approach whereby you you have need to have a something in place of that right and that's why you have the situation of not just having job fairs but able to try to match people with jobs get people trained with the necessary skills and the very harsh decision that the government has to make is to sort of allow some sectors to die off because it is not viable in order to make sure that the people in these sectors have time and skills developed to move on to other factors other sectors and then continue to do well i think those are the difficult challenges on paper in theory it is simple to say simple to to talk about in practice it is going to be very very difficult i should just make a point since in last week there was a news that ministry of manpower has been releasing information going to decide to release information on a weekly basis about jobs in order to help people to get jobs know what skills you need to pick up and so on that is a pretty tough thing to do you have to release information weekly i would suggest very much to the ministry to think through uh how do you want to release information quickly promptly but may not need to be weekly and also what kinds of information you want to release because there are some macro indicators information they are not useful for the individual to make decisions about your career choice about shall i go into this sector and so on so we need to ask ourselves what kind of information that individuals need and then we release those information so that they are not flooded with all kinds of information that actually may not end up being useful to them right so that is important i think a issue right there as we try to help and release more information we release useful information that is important i should also add that it's not the number of job fairs that we hold that is the kpi that's important the key performance indicator because these are activity-based they are not irrelevant they are useful without job fairs you cannot reach out to people but these are outreach indicators what you need is to make sure that you have impact and outcome indicators there must be a way of tracking that all these efforts and money that we have put in or you have put in as public service you are indeed matching the people to the jobs you know they are actually getting good prospects they are getting the proper training that eventually they are likely to turn them into some permanent jobs and so on so try and make sure that as we continue to have activity based kind of kpi have a very good measurement and tracking system right to follow through to make sure that we we understand the outcome and the impact are actually the intended ones and not have a whole whole flood of unintended negative consequences gina all right um i think that's about all the time we have let me just round the q a up with this final question um prof chan so what is the most important impact or change that you hope your book will bring about okay just the last last question you get back to the book uh i don't want to say too much about the book because i think some of you have already read the book i heard and the book is freely available that you can get access to but i do want to share with you since the question is being asked about the impact of the book we kind of go back to the chapter 1 of the book of trying to explain to my readers why i write the book i think when you think about a crisis like this unlike say even sas or or the asian financial crisis whether it is relatively short it is a protracted crisis now if we don't start documenting things that happen like in a book and don't document it honestly accurately and don't give and if you don't try to explore the kinds of actions that we have taken that could improve on and if we don't talk about the underlying psychology what that means is that if you wait until the pandemic is over and you start doing a review and you start talking about it it is too late right over the one two years there will be so many people's lives will be affected negatively because we have not reflected and there will be so many of us that could have done things better had we given alternative perspectives and so on so that was the purpose of why i decided to write the book in a very rare situation of doing it in a very short time very quickly when we are still in the early stages of the book and i hope to the question right i hope that the impact of the book is that it will make us reflect um you don't of course you don't and you probably won't agree with everything i said in the book and that's not the point the point is that to have it documented as accurately as i could about what happened provides you the basis of what we know from science about what psychology psychology tells us of how we can do things better about how we can counter for example negativity with positivity how we can be better in our policy communications to ensure that we build trust and so on so that when things happen again and it could be very soon uh we can do it better in fact i think i would be extremely pleased if you read the book more than once and that is because when you read the book the second time compared to the first you have accumulated real life different experiences and then if we can reflect back from some of the ideas of perspective in the book and then we can ask ourselves uh could we have done things differently maybe the first time you read the book it's quite different from the second time and hope hope that it is a more positive situation because you are able to apply some of the ideas or some of the ideas approach or appeal to you in quite a different fashion so i will just conclude that uh the purpose of this is not uh a book talk really right it's not even a book launch right and the purpose of this i think is to start a conversation for us to be courageous in speaking up what we feel and what we think and be constructive in the way we do it so that all of us can come together and have what i have been uh calling the hlc you know hlc is my acronym that i've been advocating for many years h is humility because without humility you can't learn and l is your learning orientation then we need to learn things that we don't know and c is your collaboration so before we can get people together to work together we really need to have hlc that the humility the learning orientation and then we can talk about collaboration and with that uh i think the notion of working together emerging stronger can really make sense i hope uh in this short time i've helped some of us to reading some of the ideas uh it is kind of incoherent in a short time to to cover something as as proportional as a pandemic but i'm sure if there are interests you know we can have more of such sessions again i'm done i think eugene can i hand it back to you all right thank you again prof chan for addressing all the audience questions and also taking the time today to do this talk for us um ladies and gentlemen this brings us to the end of today's session so on behalf of the organizers the behavioral sciences institute at smu the national library board of singapore and also world scientific publishing thank you for joining us today and have a very lovely evening we hope to see you again for another session soon thank you bye ,True,True,False,False

big thanks to richam and all the speakers for making time to join us this morning um i'll start with a quick introduction across the table so we'll start with arnold but before we do uh want to keep it in lighter vein and considering we've got some really awesome brands on this in this in this conversation we'll start with uh an introduction to what you yourselves but also what you're watching on netflix or what you're binging on netflix at this time so we'll start with arnold on that right thank you so much um i seldomly watch uh to be honest but i have been watching it with my daughter uh sometimes from time to time i'm spending like 10 minutes 15 minutes a day uh with her and there is a lot of animes that she has been watching and every time i join her room and it's a different set of animates so um don't ask me what's the name of it i could not understand or remember but i think that was a fun experience awesome learn a little bit about yourself as we go right um yeah so i work for gsk i joined the company about seven months ago and currently responsible for all the capital projects delivery and the performance of the departments and so before that i spent about 11 years in the banking industry as well also running corporate real estate thank you thanks oh what do the master of netflix uh phil yes good morning uh currently watching our summer blockbuster movie army the dead which it says very much what it does on the box essentially it's las vegas and lots of zombies so there's no love lost there um personally so i've been with netflix for a few years now uh part of a global team that essentially finds builds and runs infrastructure for netflix for us to continue to bring great product awesome thanks thanks phil over to darren hi um so i've just finished watching jupiter's legacy on netflix and i mean that's next up for me so i've been with iwg now for just under 10 years working in the flex sector um both in the uk market spend a bit of time in china and i've been covering and managing the singapore market for the last couple of years now awesome thanks dad and oh we'll do another hello you can choose to answer what you ordered from amazon last but we mystery type thing so anything that comes out that looks like that i i watch and i binge on it excellent thank you all that my own binge isn't as as uh diverse but i'm watching new amsterdam with my family so that's a really nice medical drama so netflix is keeping us all sane as the heightened restrictions obviously help us um rethink what we're going to do with the office so that launches us into today's topic um the topic is is a fairly interesting one but at the same time it's interesting because of the people on this panel so in terms of what we are looking to discuss today we want to discuss three main buckets of what um core with 19 and flexibility and all that's transpired in the last year and a half has has done for us so we're going to discuss what it did to our place or our place of work or our workplace as they say then the second theme is around productivity and how does that get connected to hybrid working or going back between home third spaces and the branded office as such and lastly there is how does that impact our company culture like what are we doing to sort that out so that's the broad theme and it's a very informal uh discussion so we'll go through the panelists in the order that they're showing up on my screen but we will encourage cross discussion as much as possible so starting off uh with phil uh phil in terms of occupancy or place we know that netflix is a very flexible organization even pre any change happened in 2020 what has this done to your regional portfolios or your singapore portfolio of workplaces uh so essentially netflix's culture even leading into this time was was extremely flexible essentially we lent into the culture where the freedom of responsibility and and essentially you could work from anywhere before we came into this so the impact to our staff on a day-to-day basis was quite minimal um i think the only thing that was really missing was that physical interaction with people which we're all kind of seeing at the moment um that's something that as we kind of start to come out of this we're very interested to see what the trends are going to be moving forward to see how people come back and interact with the space but in relation to kind of how we're tracking and how we're using the space nothing's physically changed in relation to the infrastructure that we have in place the only thing is you know as we have across the whole region you know clear understanding of social distancing clear adherence to what's going on in relation to government regulations and essentially being extremely mindful that people are going through you know a very special time you know in their careers but also you know for all of us general but but personally as well as professionally indeed yeah that makes sense that it shows a perspective of how flexibility from a long term has uh kind of endured uh unexpected changes so thanks to that bill uh we'll quickly move over to arnold uh for a different perspective um we are not as flexible so uh however we are taking this i mean the uh kobe is really accelerating things but i think gsk in gsk we have these smart work guidelines 4.0 recently so you can tell by the name it is already the fourth generation of smart working and then we um introducing a relatively aggressive ratios and we believe that in the future even when we back to bau mode we're assuming that 50 of the staff would be still working from home so it's only 50 in the workplace so work from home co-working space is definitely a long-term strategy in the in the real estate portfolio for the company and that's very interesting so one of the topics that uh has been quite much debated is this change enduring so gsk's commitment to enduring change or introducing flexible spaces into the mix of the portfolio is quite interesting and you're saying 50 of gsk's staff would be in flexibility whether it's a different kind of space or remote or from the office interesting and slightly different perspective from netflix so thanks for that arnold uh we'll seek uh the occupier perspective but also the hr perspective on what space is doing from manella uh on aws your thoughts please okay sure um so we have uh obviously just like uh phil and um arnott said we we definitely are ensuring that we follow all the country regulations and when shutdowns happen uh what's the social distancing requirements however um our our overall philosophy is that we want to ensure that our culture remains intact and that we're continuing to develop and build for our customers um so our overall philosophy is that we we we are creating what we call hybrid work geographies which means that um we want our employees to be able to land in the office um whenever they feel like it's appropriate uh and that we want them to be within a commuting distance from the office um so that they can come in and work together with other builders and other employees um this uh means that we we do have seats for our employees and we're going to continue that we had that before we're going to continue that after and again they still have the flexibility to work within the the hours that they want to work the locations they want to work and and there is some flexibility still to do that but we believe that being together in the office is important for innovation for collaboration for mental health for all the reasons that it's important to have you know face-to-face time with our employees so we we do allow the same level of flexibility uh but we also allow our employees to come to the office and they have a seat at the office that's amazing so three different degrees of change um and darren as an industry expert in flexible spaces what are your thoughts what are you seeing uh which bucket do you think people are more leaning towards if i may say that yeah so i i think there's a variation we've seen that already from the other panelists here today and it'd be easy for us to assume the shift in the way that people are working in from a shared physical environment to a home environment whereas most convenient and productive for them has been entirely driven by kobit but the reality is the pandemic has certainly been a dramatic one um and it's had a permanent lasting effect i think in the way that people look at their workplace strategies and their hybrid solutions but for us as a as an occupier and in the field of flexible working um we certainly feel that what it's done is it's accelerated some of the trends and the sort of thought processes that have been in place for a period of time in the way that people shifted their work space and we're seeing that heightened desire for organizations at the moment to really review and readdress the workplace strategies whether that's more of a shift to a home hybrid working environment as we're seeing enforced at times across the world or if we're looking at readdressing how we utilize our workspace presently in a more agile way indeed uh i i completely agree with you and this is a considering this is a um interactive panel just a quick drop to sabine we've got some nice quick questions for the audience and the panelists to discuss so they kind of are on each theme we're going to discuss which is place productivity and culture but back to darren uh that's a very interesting point and what phil uh uh arnold and arnella mentioned we ran a survey at knight frank for 400 dodge uh occupiers and one of the things that came out of that was the comparison of this change or acceleration right so there's a global level of expected change and there's a apac level of expected change uh apac is slightly uh lower in terms of change so they're not looking to change as much as perhaps some other locations are so very interesting to see uh the mix of uh different uh aspects of change but quite good so sabina is that question coming up it'll be interesting yep here we are so please do participate please do what it's a simple three choice question around what we just discussed uh what would you like your space to be uh and we'll quickly discuss that answer with the panelists as well meanwhile darren are you seeing any uh any specific modulation of flexibility that occupiers are looking at uh of course with heightened restrictions that's a different timing but pre perhaps the last month in singapore uh what were your observations of uh larger occupiers doing enterprise overflow or uh smaller startups what we're sort of seeing is we were seeing the nature of sort of flex environment really targeting around smes and small startups historically with a mix of larger enterprise users within that space but that was a small proportion of the overall users we're now seeing a larger take-up and inquiry level from large users across our network and those users are looking for agility around the locations that they can provide both from a physical fixed office location and also the the drop-in locations that are closer to the users homes to add that flexibility and ability to to remote their teams without having to put in a large infrastructure cost so there's a lot of those sort of conversations across singapore and across the region happening makes sense and i think that's a it's it's going to be a moving feast as we we understand over the next uh short while until this all kind of settles in as phyllis said they're observing what trends come out so a quick trend from our audience here um 88 want their workplace to be a hub of gatherings with the colleagues uh for over that could be visited multiple times a week but not as it were but seemingly there are some participants who do want it to be as it were before the pandemic uh no one thankfully uh wants it to completely disappear so the workplace indeed isn't dead uh which is which is a heartening sign but also a good sign as an ella mentioned on well-being and productivity and mental health uh which is uh interesting lead in to our next theme which is productivity now i'll say this from personal experience we've gone back and forth and back and forth between working from home and oh well three days a week or five days a week and then suddenly work from home uh with this being a bit turbulent and not consistent discussing understanding the pandemic my productivity obviously has had to catch up with personally with with being in in the space and not being in in uh office space so how what has your organization done uh to enable that that kind of uh ecg of of working from home and not working from home but also has that had an impact on the technology you use of course initially a lot of switch in using you know vcs versus in-person meetings but what is an enduring change on hr technology applications in your organizations that we can all learn from uh we'll start with arnold on this one right thank you so much i think uh from the pool questions that we just had is very uh similar to what our own survey results within the organizations so we run leasement survey the work from home module for our major markets and also we run standalone country based that work from home survey just trying to understand what the employees are looking for and over 90 percent of the staff were saying that they still prefer uh postcovid spending two to three times a day uh working from home and thailand for example is an interesting market it's a traditional market for us the gm initially believed that employee wants to come to the office because of small homes uh poor connectivity etc and then after he saw the survey result he was a bit surprised but at the end he was saying that if this is what our people want then then we should be giving it to them so i think that's a very good uh example in case study for us in terms of workplace technology we have for new offices of course we have occupancy sensor we have test booking systems and apps and we try to implement iot where's possible and for home working we support our employee by giving them some subsidies reimbursements uh work setting uh setup and to help them to be more productive at home okay that makes that makes a lot of sense and i think a lot of good companies have done that for their for their colleagues whether providing a subsidy on on prices of the hardware they have to purchase uh or providing some kind of benefit on internet payment so that's really interesting arnold and i'll come back to that leadership change and per square foot piece that's very dear to my heart towards the end of this but over to phil uh what has changed aside from there being nobody in the office indeed um basically well i mean uh as i lived in in earlier was essentially the culture for netflix already atlantis into to being able to be productive wherever we are i can't talk to overall netflix's productivity but i know for my team you know the um the leaning in on what's happening in relation to pandemic as well as still delivering projects um during this time remotely you know productivity i wouldn't say has gone down it's just become a little bit more active and you have to basically embrace the technologies and your relationships you know with the people you're working with and in the market to continue to be successful so it's essentially it's it's technology is a piece of that but essentially it has to work out with you being able to you know leverage your your resources to be able to be successful and to keep moving during these times and has that kind of is there any support that netflix is offered differently like you said they're already quite flexible pre-pandemic but has this uh with the restricted travel as well of course as as is expected has that done any difference to any the technology that you've provided to your colleagues and stuff uh technology hasn't changed significantly it's definitely the the trends that we're seeing is change of how people interact on on vc everybody's trying to make that a little bit of a better experience than it is today um making that a little bit more interactive making that more diverse and inclusive and ensuring that everybody gets an equal voice is always going to be a challenging one that we're going to continue to lean in on to try and make that a better experience for us working remotely but also when we get back to whatever it is that it's going to be it'll be part of a meeting room normal which we're looking forward to seeing indeed and this was a very very good linkedin discussion i had with a bunch of workplace strategists and it was around hybrid meetings right being cognizant of behaviors during this and while some countries were returning a couple of days back they were still rostering and restrictions on how many of what percentage of occupancy at the time was allowed in different countries so making it a standard to include let's say a teams link or a zoom link into your meeting invite and for people to choose spaces even physically to meet with the screen available small steps uh are definitely in a hybrid space set up are quite quite helpful uh so thanks for that phil um over to darren on this one what are you seeing in terms of technology that iwg has offered to its its uh occupants yeah so you know technology has been a massive driver for us as an organization over the last couple of years but really heightened in terms of how we give full access and integration to our users through our applications and beyond that in terms of how we interact and the customer journeys and experience of a client the days of just taking a physical tour in a physical office i think are really gone and what we've integrated into our solutions is a end-to-end customer journey where our teams can do a teams meeting with customers they can take them through the design planning 3d modeling now of the space and across most of our global network in singapore particularly we've launched our own design your own office features where customers can pick and choose their furniture options from a suite of options because we know customers want to change the way they're working they still want physical space we've seen that from the from the poll that's just come out but they want to use in a different way and so we've adapted our offering to ensure that customers can choose to work in the way that they wish to work and have the social distancing element as well as the design specifications to their particular brand and their office as well and that's been quite a big change in terms of um you know people change mindset change and integration of technology into the into the flow that makes sense and i think it's a really good step for even the people who are interested in looking at iwg spaces to be able to do so safely and remotely um as things change so that's a really cool step thanks for that over to anella productivity how's that being supported um so first of all i um like phil we don't really see a drop in productivity in fact i would say our people are working more hours than they have ever been in the past because now you don't have commute times you don't have you know water cooler chit chats and you don't get to go to lunch with your team so i find that they're actually working way more hours than they would normally work if they were in an office so i don't think we've seen necessarily a drop in productivity i'll plus one all the stuff that's already been called out i think one of the things that we found that makes our our employees and our builders much more productive is the ability to especially new hires the ability to onboard properly and it's very difficult to onboard um in amazon's peculiar culture um when you're doing it um on online versus being together because you know as you know culture is abso is imbibed and absorbed and experienced right and so trying to explain all that in in videos or in zoom calls or we we use chimes or chime calls makes it very difficult to actually have the right onboarding experience for for employees as they come in but then also just the touch points to ensure that um you know that the they did the culture remains intact because that's really important to amazon is the culture stay strong and and intact and it's been one of our durable competitive advantages as an organization so i think from that perspective it's been very very interesting um the other pieces you know we have to quickly pivot from we we do used to do on-site interviews and we have this process called the loop which we put an interviewer through multiple managers and leaders to to interview and we used to bring them on site to the office and so we had to quickly pivot to doing that virtually and it's very you know it's it's always better to have face-to-face interviews so you can get a sense of the the individual but we've had to do that virtually and it's it still works but you kind of miss that experience of actually having a face-to-face meeting with a candidate and so i would say while it's working we still think that actually meeting someone face-to-face the one thing that's really worked from a productivity perspective especially here in the region where we're so far away is we actually are getting more of our executives to meet our customers so in the past it was very hard to get andy jassy's time to go meet customers because he had you know it's flying right so you fly one place you meet a couple of customers and you fly back and that's a whole week right so but now it's been really good to get all our executives in seattle um into executive meetings much faster and much more effectively so andy can meet our customers in korea and you know in japan and china um much faster than in the past um we could we get we're able to schedule that so i think that's been a better use of of our executives time it's been a big productive way to get our seattle and our global executives to meet our customers here in the region i agree and they're two really fantastic points and ella and as sabine puts up the next question for the audience i'll run this past phil and arnold uh phil i i remember we had at some point discussed the onboarding experience uh as you moved locations but that was pretty pandemic how's netflix looking at onboarding or initial um times for newer employees in this virtual world so essentially my onboarding experience with netflix thankfully was done outside of outside this time and was predominantly virtual my i'm part of a global team so essentially i didn't see anybody until kind of week two week three week four um when this first started off my team went out and started doing uh videos of all of the locations so our japan office our career office our separa office and india and they did a virtual tour of the office so from a workplace perspective that onboarding experience was we're going to show you the environment that you can't necessarily go to today but we're going to highlight all the highlights and the best parts as well as you know that standard tool that you do with a person on their day one we made that virtual we gave everybody an opportunity to see what it is that we did and that became a bit of a trend and essentially you know was picked up globally during during the pandemic as people had an opportunity to kind of go in make these videos and then essentially as that onboarding process happens so as you can imagine right now our onboarding process is extremely virtual um the other thing is with netflix is they they partner with an on-boarding buddy and that person is essentially there to ensure that you you have a very seamless and easy transition into the workplace and in some cases they don't necessarily need to be your manager or somebody that you report to or so on it's just somebody that's going to give you the the inside of the netflix culture where it is you're working who it is you're working with and how that works um so you spend a fair amount of time sitting with these people and just chatting through you know netflix's culture is very unique and essentially getting your head around how that works especially in the first few weeks of you on boarding is very important and and you know one of those things that all companies should do is just give everybody the opportunity to understand the culture as they come into an organization and that's what we essentially lean in on indeed and it's really interesting on how that's you know how an existing piece of uh process has transformed in a in a or has been of use in a pandemic situation uh but arnold you actually transitioned during the pandemic uh as you said seven months in so how was your experience yes i can talk about my own onboarding experience right with the company um yeah it was well gsk has a very structured onboarding so again they will tell you day one what do you do after first week after first month after three months etc so it's a very structured uh onboarding journey but lacking the face-to-face and lucky with the team dynamics in the office is is actually quite hard so i i admit that it's actually take longer uh for me to settle into the team and into the organizations uh but the lucky thing is i got a very good buddy as phil mentions that the person that not as a peer that person is actually feeding a lot of like um informal information uh to your day-to-day work which makes which makes the whole thing different um and yes it would the lucky thing is in singapore we were able to go back to the office for a few months um and during that time and the team has also agreed that we spent two days in the office trying to do some connections collaborations which also helps to start knowing the the the colleagues as a person because usually even during the video call we have meetings day to day but it's not really the the real persons that you're you're trying to understand yeah thank you indeed indeed arnold and and i think that uh it's a oh wow the whole results are out but we'll get to it uh darren uh as a i've been referring to you for market intel but at this time as a very large organization yourself how is iwg uh taking on very different community management colleagues management colleagues how's that on boarding and transformation being dealt with in iwt yeah so um from from iwg's perspective and singapore's perspective um you know we've been i suppose fortunate enough that we're operating throughout all positions in the market space because we look after customers that have specific needs to be in in the space we've had to adapt and pivot how we would train and how we would develop our new team members and part of that has gone to a global learning platform where we digitally engage with all our staff members but i think the one thing that we've taken from from this experience with the pandemic and the more remote teams and the lack of travel that we've maybe had as a senior level is putting a lot more time and effort and investment around the mental health and the well-being of our employees and ensuring that you actually have those touch points and engagement points um on a very regular basis not just from a leadership team but from a from a team to team peer-to-peer level as well because that's the part that really we found was missing initially when you transition to a home working environment or a lockdown environment and it's taken a lot of organizations us included a while to get maybe the right balance and i think we still got a lot of learning and journey to go along that way um but you know i think for us that's really the key takeaway indeed and i i think this the whole um impact of of onboarding and culture we're working with a client across the region that we actually asked uh their employees saying well we've got to take a decision in the middle of the time which is quite unpredictable uh and real estate decisions as we would all understand are not short-term decisions at least a couple years locked in unless it's iwg and then it's a very flexible situation but we also we asked these people a fair amount of of colleagues across that organization on productivity and engagement which is quite similar to the question we just asked here and surprisingly or unsurprisingly the answer is quite similar so in the poll we just ran very interestingly 30 percent are highly productive highly engaged when they're working remotely but 60 57 or nearly 60 percent are exactly what my survey with with other uh another organization gave which is high productivity but low engagement so there is much to be done uh much to be done to make sure that while people are more productive as analysts said uh and phil phil already has been that productive work from anywhere more for a while but there is much to be done to make sure that it doesn't take longer to do simple processes uh and special attention from management to make sure engagement stays in one of the pieces one of the examples that i have personally observed is making sure that there are certain types of spaces and activities that happen within the office and even remote staff and during remote staff are made to feel a part of that design process and made to feel a part of that ownership of those spaces but that's just the space angle right there's tons more so interesting result but there was uh there was a last uh question there were 14 percent i believe and i think the screen isn't showing the results anymore but uh 14 were low productively low engagement thanks sabine um which is where i think there is uh an interesting debate to be had on what functions they are and how can we help them first on on priority and then the highly productive ones which are feeling a bit disengaged but overall a fantastic subway into the last bucket which is culture and engagement now this is i think any any senior leader we meet generally is talking about making sure staff are happy their mental well-being is there of course productivity goes up and down and it's an external environment uh dependency but the engagement is where we we directly link it to the tension and attraction of staff which is the organization itself so very very um simple question across across the table starting with an ella uh how has the cohesion of your organization changed or culture evolved as we've gone virtually and back have you felt any changes in how the overall message of the organization has changed or any thoughts would be much appreciated i think i don't think that there was a change in the overall messaging or how we did things different i think the the one thing that we tried to stress to everyone is like we're in a never normal situation right i mean things change so fluidly these days like who would have thought a couple weeks ago that singapore would go back to to this situation right so it just things are just so fluid and are moving so quickly that you the messaging has to be that we've got to be agile adaptable flexible um able to you know to pivot uh depending on where the situation um is with kovid um and i think our our teams have done that very effectively i think they're used to now seeing change and so much more change um able i would say than in the past and so i think that's been a positive but i think the other piece that i noticed is that you know in the absence of having face-to-face interactions you have to find a way to create other interactions that you know that happen in the past that are not happening because of this situation so for example you know i was very skeptical about team building online because i was like this is just i can't imagine how you do team building online um and so we tried it actually it worked you just had to adapt it to maybe four hours versus whole days you know so you have to come up with new techniques to make it a little bit more engaging and fun and you know put a lot of events within the event and so i think you just have to be creative and use a lot of different tools to engage um and what i've found is that the employees themselves are are very interested in participating so um so you can actually enlist them to help think of different ideas to make the events or you know interactions more productive and fun and uh and lighthearted so that they're not you know not so heavy i mean it's very hard to sit eight hours for example right so so trying to chunk it up in smaller pieces or do different things have been quite effective but i think i've i've swung the other direction saying oh no events to we've got to do something you know because i was like how can you actually do some of these things um virtually but then i decided it's better than nothing and you just have to find a way to make changes 100 of that i think there was we all remember the initial zoom drinks last year which everybody did which by the end of it were not as popular and i think there is a very interesting debate on getting team building and you know the friday evening pub onto zoom because that adds to your zoom fatigue and doesn't take away from it but it's a debate and nonetheless not something we have uh clear feedback on but before i move on to phil a quick question has the cohesion or are you getting any feedback that employees are feeling our you know the engagement is feeling lower than pre-code or any any such information um so our uh there's definitely a difference i would say it's not all it's all not all negative um so if you look at the data it's it's it's mixed um there there are positives and are there there's a balance of positives and negatives and so overall i think that's not a bad thing um so we have to find ways to improve the negatives and try to reinforce the positives um one of the things that i will say is um our risks are you know our outcomes and results still don't show that there's a an issue so but we have to keep at it to try and dig to make sure that we surface any kind of potential things that bubble up in the future but our data doesn't actually play out to be one or the other there are both sides some are positive and some are negative no that makes a lot of sense to know and as it's it's a change it's not one way right it has yeah it has both uh pros and cons and give backs and takeaways so fun uh uh thanks for that another we'll quickly switch to phil i feel i've spoken a lot about culture so far so i'll try not to go too deep on that but uh essentially um as we come back into kind of this hybrid workplace you know partnering between real estate and hr to develop whatever the company's culture is and you know replicate that into a physical environment and make it meaningful for somebody it's going to be a big challenge i think the the connection between hr and real estate is going to get even stronger not that it isn't today but it's going to get even stronger as we move forward with with these spaces and really address how people are going to going to use it and interact um it also comes down to i mean the culture of any company i mean if you really believe it and you're really into the mojo or the people that you're working with you'll work in a basement you know it's essentially you know how do you double down on the culture how do you make it relevant to the people around you and how do you then you know essentially create that that feeling that you want to be a part of it regardless of how it is or how it works out or where you are working from um and it's then a challenge for us to create the environment that's going to fit somewhere in between there that's awesome uh and and i'll take that sentence if you if you're into the mojo you'll work in the basement that'll uh that that's a really cool way of putting it thanks for watching nice place and playstations um but before i move move on to arnold on this uh a quick piece on mental well-being is we've seen this become a debate recently of course uh mental well-being in like i said a back again on again off again kind of situations hi there um has netflix done anything specific to take care of mental well-being of their employees or is that again a part of the culture anyway and it's not a huge change as you've mentioned this is the film oh sorry i was too busy watching you know school time um sorry repeat that question no you're gonna love his distraction i love it um we've got we've got an additional panelist uh but it's so phil i met has netflix done anything uh specific on mental well-being as this as this pandemic has taken us back and forth between home working and then back to office and back to home yeah i mean it's part of the culture anyway but i think we've recognized uh especially in the past at least the past six months that you know there are a lot of people who are still struggling with this there are a lot of people that are that are you know working essentially working to do their best um the other kind of flip side is leaders and managers need to be able to recognize some of the signs not only of what's happening in their own teams but also for them personally you know recognize some of those signs that that are saying that you know you're getting you know where you need to help where you need to reach out um i think most organizations have these sort of services available and just making people aware that they're available and there's no no real stigmatism to reaching out and having a conversation to somebody about it also the being able to instill a level of trust with your teams that they can approach you and have a conversation about it as well is very important the indeed i personally felt that with knight frank as well that as things have gone back and forth uh i've had no death of people asking me to reach out and saying hey in case you need something so the culture itself is is a big driver towards effort towards well-being that makes a lot of sense uh hopping on to arnold uh arnold how's the cohesion how's the uh well-being part in gsk what are your thoughts um right yeah that's a pharmaceutical company so we cares about the well-being of the employees right so same as other organizations we do offer yoga class like well-being talks and and it's just no different um i remember but i remember that in the previous organizations where at the starting of the circuit breaker we actually have our frontline staff trying to call the individual staff trying to check out things on them and the employee of the of the financial organizations they were very pleased about people checking things on them on are you still mentally healthy and things like that so so i think that was a very good practices also in terms of culture related to the workplace we have this performance with choice so it's uh programs that top down from the ceo and so employees are encouraged to make the right choice to help them to be more productive so that's actually also echo with our uh smart working guidelines that i mentioned that earlier okay and that makes a lot of sense arnold uh and i think overall we're seeing a a nice part of culture and cohesion being you know drivers of well-being so over to our industry expert darren uh that and how has iwg used its space uh to enhance culture for its enterprise and and sme users across the world is there any specific effort that has taken place so i think with iwg and our approach is obviously to be user-centric um you know as you can see from the panel today in the discussions and the polls there's a varying mix of how people will engage with their employees how they look to recruit and how they bring talent into the business and look after that talent so one of the things that we've been doing over the last 12 months plus is building our hub and spoke network moving and acquiring more locations in community locations to add that ability of choice for the users and the employees because what we have to provide as the largest flex provider globally is a platform of choice of products to enable people to work in the way that they want to work and allow organizations to be agile in the provision of the flex provided provision that they offer throughout their strategies um so you know what we're seeing is really a adoption of different solutions by different organizations to meet the demands of of how they see a new hybrid way of working and we do that as an organization through engagements with like memberships where customers can allow their employees to work from home for a few days work from from a location the iwg offers across any global city or regional town but also really importantly providing the same user experience when they go into those spaces leveraging of technology and we we've all been there we've gone to work from a from a cafe or from a from a place we've just sat down in and you've got to log into a wi-fi connection that's not a great environment for somebody to go and work in but if they can leverage on technology and they can have a you know a globalized platform where they connect in one time to it and they know that if they walk into another location all of their it's already synced to their to their business it's safe secure and that's what the blend between the employee engagement the employee expectation and the company um demand really is where i do each year trying to you know blend the two and provide the various solutions make sense and i think it's as we've all understood that the flexible space or traditional space or community space offering is increasingly one that will have to measure up to what the branded workplace used to be and of course large leading organizations like iwg are already making taking steps to make sure that enterprise occupiers are not it's seamless or as close to seamless as possible but one interesting debate that one interesting point that jumped out to me as sabine pulls up the final poll question is different cities um and different cultures are reacting differently to to hybrid or or if that's a word that's still not uh overused uh one second i'll just vote for this um i would think that the culture and cohesion of it is a different different outcome in different cities so for example if you look at per capita as as uh anila or sorry arnold mentioned around thailand per capita square foot uh in different cities in asia is very different uh residentially and that has an impact on your decision to go to office to be productive or not to be productive uh again commute times have the same decision so i think there is a really interesting part around people feeling like they're being cared for in this hybrid environment when you have the choice to make a decision say listen uh i'm in i'm in mumbai my commute time from point a to point b which is my office is one hour i'd rather check into the nearest iwt center uh or spaces or regis next to me so i think there is there is a hybrid but there is also a pretty interesting point to be made around how people care during the strategy for engagement so we've asked that question now on what people feel around culture and cohesion sabine are the results in oh wow 46 percent have said their organ their culture has become less cohesive um in the last year and a half as they worked remotely and that is is a clear indication that as we develop hybrid strategies real estate has a big part to pay in culture and the more we care for it and more we think about it the better it will be for culture and engagement but pretty interesting results overall uh conscious of everyone's time i just want to once again thank everyone for for making time for us and sparking such an interesting debate with a mix of three awesome occupiers and great market market intel and guidance from darren uh it's been a pretty cool session and thanks audience for responding and spurring on the conversation it was quite interactive uh we once again want to thank our sponsors uh for this and we will see you in the next one sabina would you like to share your screen thanks so again our sponsors are potential for this and also watch out for our upcoming uh similar conversations with great panelists and varied views and again interactive around the virtual speed networking or celebrating diversity and future cities as you can see on our screen thank you all for your participation and see you in the next one just bear with me while people leave the webinar sure great well thank you so much uh samarth that was great moderating and uh awesome time management as well so we can not have to use any of your extra time to do this next section so um samarth if you have your prompts ready uh we're going to this is for the social media push so what we're going to do is sir martha's going to just mention we've had a great wrap-up session and then the title and give some thoughts and then he'll turn to each of you to give um some of your uh thoughts on that and then at the end he's going to say watch this space for the upcoming video we hope you enjoy this session so if you're good to go with that i'll just hide myself and mute myself and then i'll come back on for a quick thank you and then i let you get back to your day so just give me two seconds and then start when you're ready sir thank you all for the for your time and such a wonderful session um as such i'll i've had learned a lot on the session and have some really nice takeaways um i think this is really interesting as a mix of discussion and panelists on various stages of flexibility various decisions uh what we've seen different in this particular panel is that many of the occupiers uh that are in this panel are at different points in evolution different points in adopting flexibility different views on what the workplace means and i think it's really interesting to balance that with the guidance that darren's given us from a flexible space perspective so really interested to see what the future of the workplace is and uh i'll now pass on to phil for a crystal gazing which is one quick takeaway and what do you think this where will this land it could be aspirational it could be crystal ball gazing as you would like uh look there's a fantastic discussion with a great distraction in the middle um and essentially you know it'll be uh i mean it'll be a fun watch for anybody i'm sure um crystal gazing i think essentially the relationship in in our workplaces between hr and our workplace executives and real estate can be a very stronger bond and essentially seeing companies essentially looking to double down on their culture and really understand what it is that drives and motivates people to to basically either work for them and or return to these environments thank you very much oh sorry muted thanks phil over to arnold right um thank you so much i think that was a very informative session um i've also learned a lot from the industry peers hr expert and also what the trends on the flexible space market will look like um about the future i really would be interested to see how do we material materialize workplace as a service in a corporate environment that's a very good point dan awesome over to darren yep thank you very much it's been a great session with everyone here today and some great conversations i think from my perspective in the industry we know the pandemic has certainly made some drastic changes and you know i expect those to be lasting and effective changes as we look at more people-centric organizations where that drives the strategy and delivery of every organization into a hybrid model of working which i feel personally will be different for every organization as well and that's very key for me indeed and thank you for your guidance hi um sorry for me i think first first a great discussion but i feel that we're still in the very forefront of this future of work i think we're just at the beginning phase and we still are going to have to see various iterations of what it will look like for the future but clearly we're going to have to be regardless of which organization clearly we have three different models that we talked about today and and regardless of what happens we know it will be more flexible more agile more digital more purposeful but one thing that was called out by all of us was the culture it has to fit our culture it has to fit the organization and it has to really um ensure that it it embodies the organization values and for us our leadership principles so at the end of the day we're going to have to continue to iterate and test and see what works um and it's probably going to change every time a new situation arises so we just have to all be flexible that change is just a never normal situation these days indeed and i think this is a really good summary of it so thank you once again all and uh thanks for making time at the top of your day thank you sabine over to you that was great thank you so much guys so listen a big big thank you on behalf of the chamber for taking part and giving us so much of your time we really appreciate it i will let you all know once the link goes live and we will be tagging you all in our social media outputs so please do share like and comment um to help drive it amongst your networks and just a big thank you on behalf of myself and knight frank as well for taking part so thanks so much and enjoy your day and i give you four minutes back to your day thank you great thank you thank you nice meeting you all nice to meet you you ,False,True,False,False
CguIUBjCCkI,ASEAN 1st Engineers Mental Health Awaress 2020,UCfwHyDstjEhBEYik8cgNXVg,Emerging Journey Asia,2020-06-05T03:58:46Z,,"hello everyone first of all thanks for being here today it's a pleasure to have all of you and again thank you to three all the way from Jakarta Indonesia and thank you dr. Kong all the way from Penang and not forgetting our little sister Bea why you need engineers right so I'm Sangeeta from emerging dirty Asia so my tagline is always your mental health okay all right so a little bit about myself is last year I've organised Malaysia's first mental health experiential conference for working adults all right so this this conference held three days where we had the Ministry Minister of Health Human Resource youth and other organization agency such as NIOSH all was on board and about accountants and all that why is this important why mental how is it is important is because we all need and will I mean we all will go through or might go through mental health challenges okay and that is why when we talk about mental health normally it's difficult for people to absorb because they associate mental health means going crazy mental health means you die dealer you know you go to mental institution you need to take drugs you cannot function so that is why I start advocating mental health and what EGA emerging UDA theatres is also we do a psychometric assessment we do talent development programs for employers and employees for their performance and productivity so basically that is emerging journey Asia and myself okay back to you py thank you so much dr. Sangeeta so now let us move into the interesting part of today's agenda and yeah let us not hear from our panelists today on their thoughts about the topic of Engineers mental health and so let's start with dr. Sangeeta focus on Gita could you please provide an overview on why we have chosen to talk about this topic and please do a dress outline the definitions or terminologies regarding you know the common jargon used in mental health because you know most of us are engineers you talk to us about balls and knots perhaps we can understand that so let me pass this to dr. Sangeeta okay so I just share my screen yeah go ahead well when you talk about bolts and nuts that's not my my ex parte de that's where we all need to work together and collaborate so I'll share my screen on okay so hold on okay all of you see my screen right now yes yes we could see it that's okay all right okay so I would like to know from the rest of you what does mental health meant to you can we ask dr. Khan and three based on your understanding very simplistically for me it's just a basic happiness and the state of mind that allows an engineer or research scientist to carry on doing what they are doing in India in the better basically so an unhappy person coming to work will be less productive and also may also cause other people to be unhappy okay yeah that's my very simplistic engineer scientist approach to mental health so my main job is to make sure people generally okay happy okay thanks doctor come here for a brief brief definition of the mental health means that a condition of person which is related to psychological and emotional will be something like that so yeah I mean like what the Co mentioned it's about a happiness yes and any which is related to our psychology okay thank you when we talk to people we get about be our views on mental health and the way we the way we view mental health we are all different we view it differently therefore we process information differently so if you generally mental health and what both of you saying is is correct all right so mental health is actually a state where someone are able to function okay so they are able to function in terms of their emotion in terms of the behavior you know and they are able to do things for example you are able to wake up in the morning brush your teeth have your breakfast or go to office or start your work these are you know normal function and you are happy you can articulate your emotion you know what to do next you don't get easily angry right so you are functioning at a level where everything is at the momentum the moment someone unable to function at a satisfactory level for example right when things are going into their mind too many things are in their mind sometimes they feel that it is don't wake up or sometimes you know they might forget things all right so these a sign or a signal that you need to look at your emotional well-being and also how you react and behavior at this all right then we talk about mental illness mental illness is when you are able to function at your satisfactory level that means right now you isolate yourself you know you will get angry very fast you know your mood will will will just change or you might have fear and anxiety to the extreme where you need to seek medical attention all right you need my medical treatment so that is to the extreme so what I'm sharing right now and why this whole talk today is to create awareness not everyone need to go to the you know to see a doctor on on mental health but there are difference in terms of who can I go up to hook at I seek out and earlier dr. calm and we had a conversation you mentioned you know peers and friends you know and family which is a good thing right so always sick up so the next thing that I would like to share is we need to know the difference between what is a counselor what is a psychologist and what is a psychiatrist okay so if you look at it counselor we have around 8,000 / counselors in Malaysia all right all registered with lembaga counseling Malaysia comes Alicia so a counselor they may hold a degree or master's in counseling and then they see less disturbed client okay they cannot prescribe medication they cannot diagnose you all right and they will talk to you in terms of getting back into function what what is bothering you how can you move so this is a councilors role and duty and a lot more so when we talk about psychologist psychologist they need to have a degree or higher in psychology all right so they can diagnose but they don't prescribe medication so they also do assessment okay and the last one we have psychiatrists okay psychiatry is a medical doctor they need to be a medical doctor because they need to prescribe medication and people who have severe again moderate to severe symptoms will be in psychiatrist's department but it doesn't mean you unable to function those individual who go and seek psychiatry treatment if they take medication and they go through the recovery journey they can't function has has normal yeah so this is what I would like to share the difference between counselor counseling psychologist and psychiatrist yes right okay any any question anyone wants to ask is it clear right now about the three different roles in terms of counselor psychologist and psychiatrist so we want people to be aware aware about these the the channels that you go through yeah and also again we do have befriend us we do have snake where it's online you know you call them and and and you you voice out your worries or your concerns okay yeah yeah it's just a quick question psychologist psychiatrist somehow I think we know where to go to basically Hospital right yeah we have referred a few cases from people we have contact with that we referred to by counselors we don't hear much about counselors where where are the ideal hospitals are they in agencies what all right so like myself I'm a licensed counselor with lembaga counselor Malaysia a body under the country and running okay and counselors they can be everywhere you can hear them in school counselors you see that in universities okay you we also have counselors in hospitals all right and there's a lot of counselors where they are practicing by themselves okay so we have like if you go to the bucket counselors website you have the list of counselors their contact details and then we have like NGO that source then we have Mental Health Association so we have counselors in those NGOs so counselors do they specialize in certain areas are they like specialist counselors or engineers for example or they go by profession work what what are the lines of specialization basically there's so many ways occupational counselor be a school counselor it can be family counseling it can be special need counseling that's there's so many areas to look at him hi dr. Sangeeta oh yeah we have a question from savanah son okay it's a qualification in counseling compulsory to be a counselor okay so if if you are then you can practice counseling okay and and because it takes you a number of years to master the skill in counseling because when you talk about counseling there's so many things you need to learn about the ethics you need to learn about multicultural you need to learn about countertransference we don't like other people's information and experience bother us so much you know so you need to be qualified to be a counselor but there are skills that you can learn where you can assist people right okay that's very good because only when we know the correct way how to assist someone without you know jeopardizing ourselves that's the best way of you yeah what about Indonesia much a ministry we can hear you sorry I forgot I forgot the Emir sir then we have a similar scheme I guess that means we have a counselor for what God is specific area like oh yeah family counselor and then I did it all the name of them but they have a they have a specific expertise or the the counseling that they are given to the customer but then we also have our coded psychology psychologists and psychic psych secretaries and in the hospital so I think it's similar with Malaysian we have okay thank you three and three I understand that you are from Jakarta and currently the Indonesian government is enforcing the combat asan social buzz calabasa right it's also known as the large-scale social restriction in English at me and I think it's similar to our movement control order so could you please share with us how has this affected engineers as a whole or your staff as a project manager okay yes you're right that we have what I call as a piece become PSP be here it is come with us and so she were scallops that if it's commands on the 10 of April and then it's been extended for what for time so basically as one term is is for a forty days so the last PSP be basically for Jakarta I'm talking about the Jakarta that's actually yesterday so I may have to explain because in Indonesia we have for certain praveen's or our city we have a different type of recorded different mechanism to to avoid spread of the coffee at 19 I mean a certain local city or praveen's like jakarta we have a psdb and others have a different different type of stuff so let me talk about the errata because I I live in Jakarta then yes and and today is basically we enter into what I call in transition periods which is from from today to the end of June that's what local government has just announced yesterday so the transition is to see whether we have a while got stability in what collip the there is no I would say that if the condition is terrible so then we can complete the transition period and then go into what we call as a new normal so so currently we still in the transition period if you ask me about what it is effective to the engineer I may say it will be different from from person to person because it it also related to the what we call that through the policy that has been imposed or enforced later the company where they are working so then because in toccata a number a number of company shut down ominous and forced a work from home scheme or the employee but there's certain company are not doing that so then they also the only limited the employee is working in the kappa in the in the office and a certain time of period so but I would say them from what I learned also from what the cadet my project team basically we are okay with work from home scheme right now because we still have been able to basically communicate every day while you're different yeah why social I mean by teleconference and kind of thing we still be still able to do there but then yeah we just we just has a different this one environment or the way of communication that's all I mean I mean we still okay I mean if we focus to the to if if I'm focused to the project thing that I'm managing now so far our chemists they okay with the work from home scheme thank you so much three I believe most of us who welcome home is experiencing the same thing you know we are so not used to read a stat but I think now so many of us are div pros we are pretty good at IP now so let's move on to dr. calm dr. Cole I'm sure you miss spending time am i right yeah because you know we we are a sign center I know that you really enjoy and yes do share with us how has the MCO affect that science and personal and the other interactive stem learning centers and you know what is the way forward now we are way forward for such learning center so could it be high tech solutions such as online science interactive programs perhaps science kit delivered straight to your homes of parents interested letting the children explore so we share us dr. Cole yeah you know sighing sighing centers will be greatly impacted because the Bunco activities you know involve interacting with students and also you know with the public okay so our mission is essentially to promote science and then the other aspect of our work is not just people coming to our place for programs and events we do incredible outreach work so in terms of numerically wise in terms of you know people coming to tech do last year we do about 140,000 visitors so this year will probably drop that by 90 percent so does it give you a scale we put to generate in February but for the rest of the year we think it's going to be a total white top then our outreach programs as well we are unable to go out you know and with an a big power audience of schools and now even in school reopen I think there's going to be a lot of restriction on extracurricular and all that we are extra curricular to the schools ready so outreach last year we went out to about a hundred and forty thousand so total impact numerically wise visitors to a place for programs events and all that plus outreach we are you know are going to miss out on about two hundred plus thousand people right so the impact will be huge I think like everyone else you know trying to get online actually we did have a strategy for the next three years we do our strategy planning on a three year cycle so we do have a strategic element called go digital so I guess the MCO and kobir has pushed us into this fear and caused us to accelerate a little bit on this front everyone like here for example you're doing webinar online videos and all that so just to get on get us rolling very quickly we have two immediate programs we call it science at home so with that you know we try to engage our audience with things I can do at home in terms of you know science right then the other one is science cream which is a sort of an interview webinar type and everything we do on every Friday and this is more for the general public but as you can imagine most of the talks are focus on on Kobe now so all the sessions have been on Kuwait we had because of our linkages with international science centers you know we got speakers from overseas like from from China mainly because of the we talk interesting that it was the epicenter we got people from the China Science Center give museum researchers and medical people are coming for the interview beyond that we are working on different things so now we try to move rather quickly to develop an integrated STEM education resource platform so that people can go into that platform online and pull out all sorts of Science and Technology related material and hopefully we can slant most of the materials related to the Malaysian school syllabus so that immediately helps the students and the teachers all this while we have been focused mainly on extracurricular because he said that wealth in the school is doing the formal curriculum we don't want to imitate them but now there's a need because students cannot go to school so we got to bring things that they can use online for you know as instructional materials for them and also for teachers as well so we are trying to build those resources thank you so much dr. Kong and yes I you know how am I in stem outreach and all I believe working with you for quite a few so yeah I do miss do extend outreach as well so we have current lead we are going to enter the first Q&A session and I see question from mr. Amash Amiri so I believe this is directed to dr. Sangeeta let me read out the question so in Malaysia do we have specific counselor for engineers to refer to or the counselor is referring to what kind of problem they have not by industry or job nature so this were before you dr. Santa yeah thanks thanks a lot for the for the question so in Malaysia the counselor are referring to the problems that they have yeah so for example we will talk about industry we can talk about engineers we can talk about doctors we can talk about accountants lawyer or normal general worker it's just a specific job that you have but when we comes to two problems we might have similar right for example you might have anxiety right now with a Corbett 19 to go out to you have fear of mixing around socializing with people even if you are engineer the same anxiety of missing around and going up can be with a accountant or or you know or a lawyer so it doesn't look at roles or position or industry because mental health you know it's it doesn't city your position it doesn't see what industry does since you are color what race you are which country you are it will affect and how you identify it earlier right by addressing this issue by acknowledging you you need some sort of help it might not be to the extreme of seeing a psychiatry but you need to evaluate you need to be mindful of your behavior of your emotion and your thoughts so it doesn't really specifically say that or if I'm in this industry therefore I have this issues no all right so I hope I answered that question okay thank you very much dr. Sangeeta and this is why we open this forum up so that people will be aware what mental health is and we have another question from mr. Mohammed care engineer Mahatma care sorry let me check because okay is there any quantitative measures hold on a minute okay is there any quantitative measure to measure the satisfactory level of mental health as in you know how to determine the satisfactory level so that's for you dr. Sangeeta okay so if you look at it they are research there are assessments to to measure somebody's anxiety depression stress happiness and mental well-being and I do agree there you know we are all different we are all unique therefore you know we address things differently okay but there are measurement that say that if you are within certain scale then your mind you might have mild symptoms then within the second scale then you might develop a moderate symptom and if you are at the extreme of the spectrum then that's where you know it's severe symptom alright so everyone is different we evaluate it differently so the satisfactory if you if you ask me the best way to look at it is first are you able to function satisfactory that means you are able to wake up you're able to do your task you're able to move around you able to socialize so when this is up to your satisfactory level that means you have a you know a good mental and emotional towards the things that you do but if suddenly the satisfactory level drop because you need to evaluate yourself right you feel that you don't meet people you have fear all right now we call it every time you will wash your hands you know if people coffee you start to let oh my god you know someone is coffee or someone is busy so it's time for you to reevaluate okay so when you evaluate how you do it is do i watch a lot of negative news in social media you know do I read a lot of negative you know articles so that might contribute to your satisfactory function of you fear or anxiety or have this kind of challenges yeah okay thank you so much dr. Sangeeta and let us attend to the third and last question for these sessions Q and a so this is a question from mr. I'm not sure sorry Satyabhama so it's directed to Sri sorry how's the delay of your project is it three to six months perhaps okay thank you for the question sir then so so basically I may have to explain more about the project that I'm amazing now so this is basically a engineering consultancy engineering surfaces a project so so we are more doing I will be called up from from initially from the office but not from from home so so basically it's not a construction project the other thing because construction project most of most of the construction project is actually still still undergo at this moment with a certain limitation limit certain restriction apply so for for us I mean because this is engineering and what I would say that basically we don't have a significant delay on the on the project because it's we still we still can be able to manage from a distance I mean truly teleconference we use also have a sort of a teleconference with the client earlier before the work-from-home scheme so then we also used to have sort of a review online review with the crying - so I would say that there is no significant delay on the project if there is a certain slip on the schedule that's more because we have an additional we've got additional work coming and an additional request coming from the from the cry and so so that's kind of thing hopefully that sense or a question there okay thank you so much three so this is the end of the first Q&A session so next moving on to our next agenda of the day let us now talk about how what are the challenges faced by the industry meet the unpresentable and threes event covet 19 pandemic sorry my English I have a bit of you know the business now and you know we can view it from the employers view the employees view are even the regulatory standpoint so we are very fortunate to have family from different backgrounds today to share with us about their insights so let us start with calm so doctor calm as the CEO of tech company could you please share with us how has MCO affected the operations of the Science Centre in relation to issues that you know like cash flow I mean no business of coffee table at cash flow and regulations like SOPs the help screaming you know supply chain management restrictions all this so we shared us yeah as mentioned just now you know we are kind of a high-touch high interaction type institution where we engage the the public right so the MCO that the answer that is very easy you just had to stop everything nothing goes right he just had to shut the door so no operation you mentioned cash flow we are not for profit but you know we still need to earn something to keep ourselves of look right and that is very significant I think we lost like eighty percent eighty five percent of our revenue this year okay of course that's offset a little bit bye-bye I'm not having the user running costs but at the same time we still to continue to to pay pay salaries okay and so if you look at from a cash flow perspective that means that we are not able to pay everybody the you know the full salary so our our strategy is that we take care of those who are earning less so generally they don't suffer they practically suffer no salary but then those earning above a certain amount would get a certain pay cut right of course being a CEO I gotta be there you know to be seen as sharing their pain so I myself take four months no pay right for this year okay so that's a financial impact from the ground level the equipment you know your engineers you know the equipment don't rise just like your car you can't just leave it sitting there so inspired MCO we need people to go in like once or twice a week just to make sure things are okay those poorest stuff don't get moldy and kind of things so we still need to duplicate we still need to check even though things are not running so that it all it'll all break down and we the open a game okay now with the CMC oh the conditional movement control we are allowed some movement so what we do is that we basically just take the rule of thumb no order you just social distancing washing your hands personal hygiene that kind of stuff so what we do is that we we stagger the number of people going into work so all the office spaces to be basically half the number right we have a various office spaces so if it takes four people now any two people can go at a time so we kind of like schedule it so that we make sure we don't clash another kind of stuff so basically this is what's happening on Andromeda before us here okay thank you very much for your response so do attendees let me remind you there's a second round of Q & A so you are welcome to continue putting your questions up in the group chat and next we will move on to three so Sri I understand that you're currently working from home and you know working from home means you know that your conference call ",False,False,True,False
P20BKp5ssyc,Don&#39;t Put Me In Jail: How Young Offenders Become Probationers | Inside The Probation Service | Ep 1,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2021-03-05T13:00:08Z,"These youths have broken the law and would be placed behind bars, unless they are put on probation. Why do they deserve a second chance? We follow ...",when having fun like all of a sudden like this boy just came like look look at us like i didn't want to fight him with it but then my friend confronted him and said why you looking at us like he scored all of us so that's when we get a holla we are circling him like he was did he want to fight us like my friend is in the glass bottle to the sheet then they punched my friend when your friend went for him what was your immediate thought my friend was being beaten up like quite badly you all voluntarily caused her uh you kicked the victim's rib cage and kneecap two to three times and then uh you also punched the victim on his face about three to four times while he was lying on the ground okay do you have any friends on probation so you kind of know what it's like like right it's a community we have annotations so that means he will be able to go to work go to school stay at home okay but there will be a lot of conditions placed on him and it might also feel like the family also cannot provision together with him [Music] [Music] did anyone explain to you why you're here today no because you're below 21 years old when you're charged in court most of the time the court will ask for a probation report usually we get our cases from the courts they are referred to us because they have committed offences so my job here is really to understand whether you are suitable for probation you do know that if you are placed on probation there is no conviction record right of course i'm looking forward probation is essentially supervision of an offender in the community it is a second chance because it is an opportunity for them to recognize the harm that they've caused others to make amends to stop offending your first procedure offense is you decided that you will bring the earphone out of the shop so your second charge at around 3 a.m you were outside there was some yelling the police officer spotted you and then told you to stop and then you actually hold some involution okay your third chance you decide to steal alcohol so these are the three offenses there's no dispute right if not for probation the court can actually commit them to an institution like a juvenile rehab center or to prison what was happening at that point when you decide to steal the earphone i actually went to drink alone then i was very dipsy i thought like india needs to know i also don't know what i'm doing they call me oh my god yeah can you tell me a little bit more about the one where you hope for guarantees at a police officer [Music] [Music] when i drink i want to get drunk so i fall down force down force number four i keep drinking drinking drinking i just felt like a lot of emotions i cannot express draw anyone i cannot talk to anyone so if i drink then maybe people hear me out [Music] so your parents are divorced do they know that you're being charged for the offense how can i never tell them that also it starts does not do anything my mom and my dad i didn't know they were separated the teacher tell me that i come from separate families [Music] um a lot of patreon [Music] self-pity hatred how are you going to repay me my life are you going to give me back my tails my emotions do what you're going to take back my my cases like everything because of me like just gathering eating together and doing things together okay i sense that it's more comfortable so today we could talk a little bit more about the sensitive issues i want to find out a little bit more about you attempting suicide when was the last incident i think i do want to do it my homework what triggers you to want to harm yourself i don't know i feel like i cannot let go it's only when some wound opener then all the other ones will open as well who would you worry about most if you have to go into jail i think my my life will be easier without me i'm not even but i'm her grandson but i actually bring no trouble we are going to continue our previous interview are you a part of any secret society currently or before before okay why do you join looks like amazing back then but have a lot of friends if there's any problem just be like get involved smart you want your name to be popular like they started doing this again how many of the settlement talks like ended up in the fight we are pulling up we can't talk but then they are like very serious they started [Music] the first session what the parents reported in terms of his habits and in his history and his background did not seem to be congruent with the severity and the type of offences that he committed in this second session with the boy i'm hoping to find out a little bit more information from him what time do you come back from meeting your so do you stay out late with them sometimes no no not at all can i stay late let's say the judge decides that you are suitable for probation and then gives you a bunch of conditions to follow time restriction community service reporting sessions do you think that you're going to have a problem with the condition you've got some problems i mean i'm not used to giving him earlier i still stay from home before you say no right and then but then now you say actually you have problems with following the pr because you used to not get home a lot a lot of the times do you see how the information is very inconsistent i don't like to stay home because it was very boring like i wanted to stay with my friend i can be outside for one week three four days why the inconsistency with the information are you worried that you will affect your chances yeah even if the details are not offense related at all we still want them to be forthcoming because these could actually give us insight into the youth's offending behavior and if they are not truthful it could affect our assessment today i'm going to make a home visit to meet the family the boy the parents and just take a look around their home environment we are used to sleep together when we are homeless we are all together i don't have money also i must have my children in front of me so home visits are crucial to our investigation because we are able to pick up any concerns that were not flagged up during the interview sessions in the office from the first interview you all mentioned that he didn't start smoking until he was secretly 15 years old but he said that you know actually he started when he was probably six yeah i remember that time that one social worker came to send some food and saw him smoking in the staircase so they told me parents also you all reported that last time how often he would stay out is probably just once a month to fish oh right until about 6 a.m how come there was so much difference because he's saying that every week he'll be going out three to four days at a time i'm not sure about it because sometimes when i came back home i take my shower and then up to the sleep actually is a very good boy when he meet the age of the nation he starts to mix around with some boys that have some bad influencer at home i can control him but outside i can't control him now i'm so angry lah because he said oh his friend uh always dissima so you just want to show them i said you don't show off your mindfulness then you do stupid thing when you didn't really follow my instructions in the first few weeks then i scolded you if you are placed on probation if you don't follow instructions right you'll get 10 times worse than that you're ready or not yeah i trust him and i make sure that he pay the trust which we give it to him we had a cjtv why don't she raise about our call and check that's the cctv my instructions was was that if he wants to work um he has to ask me for approval first despite those instructions he went to work uh without informing me he was frustrated and then he responded in a way that was quite rude but then after that whatever messages i sent or any calls i made he didn't pick up we want to make sure that the jobs that the youth has applied for they're not jobs their negative peers have engaged in as well and so the probation officer would require the youth to get their permission first before applying for a job the father was very frustrated just now also i guess in the fate of anger he was telling me that she might even consider divorcing the mother this could possibly be something that has been happening for quite a while already the inconsistency in that parenting and supervision everything escalated really fast in just one day today i know for sure i assess la that home probation is definitely not suitable for him [Music] there were two incidents of him not informing me or seeking approval for me to get uh to work when he's away in hostel he's in that structure he learns to be disciplined tailors to be accountable for his own actions because in a hostel the consequences for not following the regulations are very concrete [Music] in the progression order one of these conditions may include a stay in a hostel and usually a residence in a hostel would take maybe 9 to 12 months and in that period they're only allowed to return home generally on the weekends the probation officer consider many factors in assessing whether they are suitable for probation or not whether they are involved in school or any positive activities whether they are motivated to change we also look at the severity of the offense their history of offending behavior as well as the family makeup we have to ensure that the community safety is also gathered yeah so it's difficult because there are so many things to consider and this is why we usually take a long time four to six weeks to assess a case suitability but you know this time if you're on probation is everything will be taken into account right it's just better because you didn't give me a chance because my family support you say i need you to think less about your family situation being this and that yeah looking at what you already have for you to be on probation you also need to say yes they're going to take responsibility for your own life it was difficult initially because the very first line that he told me was i'm an orphan and it struck me i wasn't sure how then could i support this person and ensure there would be someone in the community to support him so when i reached out to the grandmother then i realized that the family situation is not as bleak so on the 28th right i will be in office waiting for you right after oh i know that i can come down or not if you cannot calm down i will also be informed by the court or the issue yes i will wait for your call here if you are on probation but uh [Music] everybody say i did i'm not that happy when it wasn't my son i know that he's guilty but the decision is that he'll be staying doing in boston's home after that uh he'll be transferred to monster photography for germany then after that four months with integi at one in house probation singapore boy's home is a closed institution which is a short and sharp treatment before he starts probation so on probation he's required to reside in a hostel which is different from the singapore boy's home because he is able to still attend school or go to work in the community we talked to him we hugged him and then we said don't worry take care take care of yourselves inside because uh learning i have wrong confidence that he will do it and he will change [Music] you i'll try my best to spend more time with my grandmother and make sure not to worry her as much maybe if possible i wish to make her proud not right the judge asked me go and study but i don't mind uh it's a normal life i haven't been living like a proper [Applause] do you remember your probation conditions uh formless e-dagging the alcohol therapy image counseling [Music] cheers previously when we meet um i could sense a lot of uncertainty finally this sense of uncertainty is over because the it's a new year already it's coming already so new york knew me it's finally gonna happen usually after a person is placed on probation there's a lot of motivation to want to do well there's a lot of excitement perhaps the first three months is a period of adjustment and after that three months he would probably go through another phase the change process is not monotonous it can go up and down in the initial few months you want to increase their whole disposition and their capacity to receive that guidance as well and they must be convinced that there's value in it [Music] [Applause] yeah we went to bed at the boys homes bring him back we have bonding time for a while then i sent him to herself so far he's in the hospital he's good he said he can adjust himself over there can see a bit of change and his behavior how he stopped last time he never watched alert in hostel you have to watch everything i have to wake up in the morning you can see his changes a bit i always tell him this is the second chance that you get in future if you want to find a job or he really wants to get married when the other side family wants to know his background then he had a bad record sure there's some rejection right [Music] i want him to be a good person have a stable job and build a good family that's my hope for him [Music] some people believe that probation officers are really rigid and really strict um and then some people believe that probation officers being uh counsellors are really lenient or very soft um so that's actually not true probation officers have various roles so we do try to balance that enforcement role with the guidance role as well do you bring a phone today yes all right so we just looked through do you use steady gram as well yeah so you've been looking at cars still yeah mostly it's gym and cars can i look at your browser sorry okay so you didn't really like close any tabs or your history you just left it there right okay that's good and you're your mom does she actually still check on your devices every day in the morning she'll like scroll through all the history on this she does not mean try not to watch others like pornographic material or anything related to it i say that maybe lead me to reoffending for this case he was actually placed on probation for insight of modesty essentially he committed voyeurism he used to struggle with family related stress as well as bottom i deleted tiktok and instagram because there are some like maybe immunity or maybe females exposed these factors like contribute me to like have an increased sexual urge so i try to minimize it there's no condition to say you cannot watch porn but it's part of our intervention plan or some of them they can abstain from it so for those cases you you want to find out what's the frequency how intense for many of them it could be a trigger that could lead to reoffending behaviors a common risk factor is early exposure of internet pornography those that involve children those that involve violence or those that are voiced in nature can lead to a deviant sexual arousal pattern that means they are no longer get you know aroused by normal stimulus but if you were to see an advertisement if you watch movies um is there anything that you feel or is actually i've discovered a way to not think about it okay what i will do is stop whatever i'm doing and then i will take a deep breath and then try to clear my mind and just swipe it away you try to distract yourself in the morning i will shower in cold water daily as i think it's safe to depress the sexual urges nowadays like it's miraculously like the sexual earth does not come out as often asking these questions um getting very personal um is it is just part and parcel of the job i would actually be looking at the offense itself right so being very objective in that manner on a daily basis they have a record down like what they're thinking the frequency of masturbation the sexual thoughts that they have uh such external monitoring is important because eventually we want to build up their internal control sexual offending in itself is a very sensitive topic there's a lot of embarrassment and tendency is also for families and youths to to downplay their seriousness but it should not be minimized or trivialized in the longer run we don't want such behaviors to get more entrenched or to escalate and so if there's an opportunity to intervene early to address the issues then we should the offense happened last year at that point i was trying to seek a higher level of sexual gratification i knew that was wrong but it is very hard to shut out the unhealthy thoughts which floats my mind so majority of uh sex offenders do not have mental illness it's a means to think that they all have mental illness it is about them having distorted uh thinking about sexuality for example they might think that a girl wears short skirt may be okay to have sex and such distorted thinking will need to be corrected in interventions because it can lead to deviant sexual interest as well as given sexual arousal pattern previously i was sexually preoccupied i can't concentrate in my studies when i'm in my room alone i would have the temptation to watch pornography [Music] at the point of time i was caught i was feeling very worried and anxious to and how would my parents my siblings and even my friends feel they were very angry and also shocked my was feeling very bad there was a sense of guilt i'm also afraid that i would like lose some of my friends whenever i have a sexual urge i would tell myself that no you need to control this urge you need to suppress it no matter what you cannot reoffend again dreaming has some principles which progressively helped me to increase the levels of my self-control i'm afraid that the public would recognize me and then have different opinions about me but slowly i start to overcome that fear by stepping out of that house my family will go out for some religious events and shopping for me not to feel bored which might lead me to re-offending whenever i'm feeling down or bad if my mom has she's at home every day and i'm thankful that most of my friends supported me throughout my probation period we had an incident where you didn't turn up for work and then the internship employer actually terminated you right [Music] we had an incident where you didn't turn up forward and then the internship employer actually dominated you right what were the issues that you taught in something you can work partner mental management if let's say you wake up late because we realized that happened before right and then you am i a so what can you do update you and loves my boss why is it important to update me and your boss said that you know and then we know what can we do help help me okay so this contracting right is a promise right you know that my economist her case was transferred to me around march she has multiple risks and needs issues such as poor emotional regulation poor frustration tolerance so coupled with quite a complex family background so she also seems to like fluctuate her in terms of her motivation level and then she will sometimes also be unresponsive [Music] [Music] how do you feel about your graduation emotional so today is a big milestone for you it's towards the end of your probation already and then it's finishing nine months in hostel it's a up and down right is there anything you would read one like just now the stuff yeah even if i stay out of trouble trouble still can find me with the friends tomorrow onwards leave me a voicemail what time 9 pm 9 pm itself or before nine all right in one minute after how bridge you know uh you know very well right i'm quite worried that when she comes back to the whole environment her neighborhood when she makes us back with her old friends and it could lead to a lot of misbehaviors on her part if she can't refuse them properly on a scale of one to ten right one means her probation progress good that means her progression program is very bad since june she had some [ __ ] of a curfew so these are things that have escalated more and more over the few months you are outside today i'm doing a home visit to prepare her for a court review he's six hey why is he six not ten do you hope that you're judged before another chance yeah see my six six my six why not then so let's say not them what have you things that have not been so good tell me how about your timing do you think we need to call you you see we obviously want to make your life difficult i just want to check chief breaches like failing to comply with time restriction or failing to attend school they are not criminal offences but they are big deals we're trying to teach them that rules are important they need to follow rules and of course by extension they need to follow the law so if there's a breach of probation conditions then it's perhaps their lack of motivation to want to make positive changes and also perhaps it's a deficit in their skills most of my cases also i follow friend one of the cases it's at night so we hanging around yeah then suddenly my friend come and ask me whether i want to go like take a ride because you see one of these men never knocked actually i don't want to go yeah but they like forced me to go now [Music] of course not happy now everything is island i assume is the police investigate them first it's either they say the wrong thing or they put me in blame percy is under the wicker death after that the second one stole the hair color ah yeah again i need to bring her out then from there the last that she have to go to this family court on saturday i think but on that day sadly that she have to go to the state court then after that she have to go to the prison reminder for one month he's really shocking on that day [Music] so what's going to happen when we go back to court the judge may actually ask do you see any changes and what you hope for and is it correct to say that you hope she can continue and then she may ask you about your curfew what are you going to say you know who happened to judge save your mom position for you know how does that make you feel we look at the circumstances of the breach uh how serious the breach is and also we look at the reasons why this happened um and whether they've done it before and probation may be taken away um if the breaches are really severe that time yeah i went out if my friend afternoon then the place is fast so i reached over a bit late that one is considered i think i need to sign for music it's a written warning like i don't know like sometimes i just cannot learn but still need to go through everything sometimes i just mad at myself cannot really start with that we do see a number of probationers who struggle to keep to their curfew and that's also because they want to continue to associate with their friends and have in late night activities and they hope that they will not be caught okay another four months the judge actually gave her a port warning she was also ordered to go for a court review in february during the clock family conference we actually signed a social contract basically her saying what are the areas she want to work on exactly what is she going to do and how is the family gonna support and how is the po gonna follow up on it but i feel quite accomplished because today i also managed to get buy in from the stepfather to be more involved so this is johnny book help us learn what you have gone through in in your nine months in master so this is the favorite quote grow through what i go through and become an independent and useful human being and future because what i have to go through in hostel is so tough i was triggered by the victim she spread rumors about my family she shocked vaguely and i can't take it then i accidentally slept after that that thing went viral i remember the virals and all my family members started to pm me you know then i get shocked luckily my daughter talked to me mama my friend wanted to bring me more run i saved better so the next day i let my daughter surrender rather than this eddie come and pick my daughter right i have to write a letter to one of my family members [Music] hi my name is mother i hope everything is fine outside i just want to say that now i'm in hostel i will make four years of this time to change don't worry i'm going in here to learn a lot of new good things that will make you proud okay i love you so much wait for me to come back in [Music] it was very cool in the rock that's the worst place ever if only i turned a bit right i wouldn't end up being a probation [Music] it's quite common that we hear this comment just got away with probation people may not know enough about what we do on probation it is not just about supervision or reporting at the end of the day we also see probation as an important change element it's an important intervention in the lives of these youth in your nine months do you feel that you have improved in your firmness yes because i don't mix around people then they were on drugs and then um some of them were really caught yeah and then also some of them just released from prison then on tagging so i [Music] how does it feel locked always pressured for time lack of freedom now of course do how long has it been since december have you realized it's been so short [Music] how does it feel a lot always pressured for time which is always rush lack of freedom now of course probation essentially requires a substantial change in your lifestyle we do have probationers who tell us especially in the initial few months that it's just too hard it is too overwhelming they want to give up what's the most difficult matter what i'm just gonna have that lifeless face also that i just don't care because i didn't really care what [Music] i just failed to recognize it whatever you deem up to me the only one that evan hasn't given me is really my grandma maybe it's because she hasn't given me i pay pa i say to give up myself i want to look forward to this year but then you know you can restart scouting online so i'm looking for the radiation so where are you it's like outside here cannot be because i caught your siblings that's not what they said now sorry i need to check my mother when i could take food from my auntie house or not you don't remember or you don't want to see my number so make sure you reach your curfew right forgot now why are you taking this so lightly we just went to court you know you see you don't care you don't care about your provision then why you behave like that even after the necessary interventions if you find that this is not being taken seriously then the whole goal of probation is not there you know and essentially you are also taking you know very lightly the chance that is given for you to make comments you don't even take care of yourself properly how to take care of other people [Music] i wish you can love yourself more i'm telling you the next time we are going back to court is for bridge and i really don't know whether you can still continue prohibition [Music] if your attitude continue like this you know i said i cannot remember i can't remember you expect my memories to do it there is always going to be a consequence to the behavior as long as it's something that goes against her probation order at this stage currently we have tried to work on on the issues that she had and it doesn't seem to work so definitely because of this breach there will be a behavior consequence which is going back to court to reassess whether probation is still suitable for her or not [Music] we're here to do the closing session or the domination program with you right congratulations on finishing our probation i see myself grow from i don't know anything to like everything is like under control not everything about most all the things very tough because when it's also like it's industry when probation comes to an end uh the probation officer's role in the youth and the family's life also comes to an end yeah because we're bounded by the court order after today you got no more bo my role ends here and you're on your own you need to be independent it's considered your case is closed on the same note i also want to remind you okay probation one time finish right what do you think will happen if you get into trouble again reason do you think you will still get a chance on probation noah [Music] i cannot believe that i've finished probation i gave her some time for her to prove that she can change but now if i rate that thing about 40 percent [Music] 1400 [Music] [Music] wow this is the first time you said you were proud of me i honestly remember last time when i'm on probation she told me if anything happened to me i go inside like she want to visit me she'd want to help but then she's take him thank you for going through with me this [Music] so at the end of the day probation is not just reporting a one-off session for one and a half years to two years of your life almost every aspect of your living your progress your thinking your behavior gets to be monitored it gets to be supported gets to be challenged i went to canterman to be a witness for the police yeah because i saw some of the things happen now he reminded i'm actually disappointed angry i think i used to eat i already like free now and then someone else has to like go inside every night we built the youth and the family up on their skills things how to handle obstacles in their life we also link them up with community services because for permission it is a temporary thing they have the necessary support that they need which one is a true friend and richard is not right yeah and then i decided to just be gone from them [Music] so i don't have to think about anything i must control what i must be formed to myself also [Music] how come you feel that like it's okay to scam people if you have whiny and curry ,False,False,False,False
o7BhJhSA2hs,Millennials Discuss Consent in Singapore | Noted | SG Layers,UCgjODwLxcG2D3h3XQrgdU_A,SG Layers,2020-09-28T10:00:12Z,"We invited five young Singaporeans to discuss whether the idea of consent. Considering 2020, there are many things to consider when consent is involved - a ...",[Music] yeah so if you if like is within two constructing adults then it's not ideal so we all have to we all have to know that we are taking risks [Music] hi everyone i'm lauren and i'm 23 this year hi everyone i'm nicholas i'm 26 this year hi everyone i'm gracia i'm 19 this year hi everyone i'm ryan and i'm 24 this year hi everyone i'm brian and i'm 22 this year consent is bounded by age i was thinking of this question like specifically in the context of a recent influencer saga so in that context i felt like you cannot really blame him fully because we live in a capitalistic society right so you come into a transaction with each other so even though age is a very important factor right but 15 years old i feel it's a very enough age to make rational choices and decisions so i feel like only for those that like ultimately saw what he said and like rejected it and reported it to the police i feel like that's not very applicable to them i agree to a certain extent with what you say but the reason why i agree that consent is bounded by age is because when you are a minor you are still highly impressionable because when you're put in that situation at that certain age and you're offered um something that you currently do not have a large amount of money uh a certain favor to do a certain thing then your judgment wouldn't be as experienced as someone else who is mature ideally people should well from a church should be able to give consent so i think 18 is an all right age but if you drag it to a far end of the spectrum like or even younger combiner there's a gray area where the microscope things government cannot account for every single individual so uh personally it was interesting for me to realize from the saga that 16 above can give consent but they cannot be paid for it until they reach 18. i think why um there there's a so-called age restriction on consent is actually because like there is a sort of a standard place for you right that when you're 18 years old you actually have the mental capacity have enough sort of iq at you to actually know what you want or what you don't want from life that being said um i think there should be some exceptions for like people who actually show exceptional levels of maturity uh be in their actions or in their words or exceptional levels of naivety right because like ryan said everyone tends to mutual at different ages and that's why i sum up the green self agree from my personal uh experience i didn't make very wise decisions when i was 16 and below so i would say of course after the saga i did some uh mini research myself and i understand that those age 16 and below whoever consent they give is actually not valid according to the law so i would say that it actually makes some sense because i really made very very bad decisions so i believe at that age money is a very important thing for us so if you actually pick up money to entice these people who are in a secondary school mostly they'll just consent to it in a tender hookup a victim who consented should bear responsibility for the outcome well let's say you agreed to hook up with someone on tinder and you realize that this person maybe wasn't very truthful about maybe his sexual health then yes it is the person's fault for not being very honest but having consented to it you must be able to still you know consider these consequences and still take responsibility for this i mean nobody uh the you wouldn't have known that the person had std or not so that is technically out of your control and i feel that they should not bear the full responsibility of that outcome because it wasn't what you had in mind in the first place specific to this context okay really just specific to this context because um i believe there are other situations where victims shouldn't even bear any responsibility but in this specific context of course this person shouldn't be blamed entirely because he or she wasn't aware of the entire truth but when you put yourself in that situation and you say yes to it it is not entirely coercive from the start so emphasis should be placed on knowledge if you if you know that this person perhaps had std and you still wanted to go along with it then i feel that yeah you should bear the responsibility but if you didn't really know i feel you shouldn't be your responsibility yeah of course that's not what you technically uh agreed to right what's more also called in life i'm doing it based on the concept of like conditional agreement so like i agreed to these terms of having like a hookup with you based on the agreement of not knowing that the person has an std so it's like if the person actually has an std but it conceals the fact then i feel like there's a bridge of concern really personally just to me i think it's reasonable for people to actually assume that uh the party that they're hooking up with actually this clean line actually won't uh transmit any stds to them i think this is a reasonable assumption to make um and that's why maybe personally to me um i think by which this isn't disclosed right i think it's pretty unfair uh because like you are misleading someone into doing something they might not necessarily consent to i believe that things out there are complicated so a lot of times things happen because people assume so to prevent this assumption from happening you should be responsible as a consulting adult and think of think through the consequences like you cannot expect someone else to protect you if you can't even protect yourself this is where maturity comes into place yeah so if you if like it's within two consenting adults then it's not ideal so we all have to we all have to know that we are taking risks correct correct but that being said yeah that may say i'm not i'm not trying to victim shame and i believe in certain situations victims should be you know given that that kind of protection now but specific the situation must give this claimant asking for consent once is sufficient so uh basically for this it depends on the situation also so for example if it's some something related to work for example if you sign the content one time i think that's sufficient but for the point if it's in a sexual relationship i'll also say that one is enough but if you keep asking i'm pretty sure you'll spoil the mood but then again yes during the process is a bit uncomfortable yes definitely you need to ask more than one time for me i agree with like nicholas that like in the sexual perspective like consent given once is definitely not enough especially if you are a virgin right so if i give you consent to take my virginity but being a virgin you know like it's going to it's going to hurt a lot right so if i suddenly withdraw my consent i feel like my consent should be taken into account and the guy does not have the right to continue the procedure because it is hurting me and i feel like my consent is withdrawn i feel it's always better to keep asking if i mean not in an irritating way of course yeah they keep asking whether the person is like okay with this okay that you may not know it's suddenly the person feels uncomfortable with it how with you and then they just want to stop so it doesn't hurt to take the better step mp it's slightly more concerned to what ryan said earlier because if a person kept asking me whether i really consent to it i will start to think whether this person is actually being legit you see like being unbelievable that actually i consent to it so i'll have second thoughts very keep asking also wouldn't second thoughts be good here though as it if if it actually perseveres so-called better decision-making i feel like it reflects like the concern that you guys have also because like you're not just driven by impulse you're also taking into consideration like the other party's feelings by asking them if they're okay and observing whether they're actually fine with it yeah so i don't think you'll be a turn off for the mood right so when i say somewhat agree right i'm operating from the pov that these people actually know what they're consenting to so like to me insofar as the terms that i agree on actually clear at the point of at which you actually ask for content i think that's okay right i think asking once is okay if the terms change then that's when i'm like yeah sure ask again right but i think you should the term should be very clear i feel that in terms of consent um there are many different forms of consent there is the yes i agree and there's also body language um by body language i don't mean physical arousal because there are scenarios where people try and justify that oh you know this person was very sexually aroused but that that is purely physical so i believe that the reason why consent needs to be consistently assessed not directly asking hey are you okay if this and then five minutes say hi hey are you okay with this again it's more of like i asked you first and then if you're okay with it and then during the whole entire process of course you continually monitor whether this person do you feel that this person is pushing you away thank you for watching this episode of sg layers what are your thoughts about consent is it something

Carlos has worked in public hospital and community mental health services ...",[Music] hello and welcome to episode 27 of on liberty coming to you live from the center for independent studies in sydney australia i'm your host salvatore bonus and joining me today is dr carlos debrera dr breira works on the front lines of public hospital care and community mental health here in australia i'll be talking to carlos about the psychology of fear and the complicity of the public health system in further isolating some of the most vulnerable people in our community dr carlos de vera how are you very well thank you salvatore and thanks for having me on oh no thanks for joining us you're much busier than i am that's for sure uh look i i was reading recently that the staff at the abc declined to take a pay freeze to help out the abc during the coronavirus crisis and of course you know more power to them i work at a university i have a secure job you know there are people like me and abc reporters who simply have had a good coronavirus right we our pay hasn't been hit at all we've accumulated savings but public health orders certainly have harmed many other people do you think they've harmed do you think they've maybe aided the few and not the many yes look i think there's been a disproportionate impact of the coronavirus and more importantly the coronavirus lockdown um in our society and i think probably across all western societies not just our own and yes you're right i think in in universities and in government and certainly in public health our salaries are pretty much guaranteed and underwritten by the taxpayer but certainly there are um vast swathes of people who are suffering financial um hardship as a result of the the consequences of the lockdown um and um find themselves unemployed and at home and possibly facing indebtedness and difficulties making mortgage payments and i think there will be a lag but at some point when the the rubber meets the road there is going to be a um a widespread catastrophe public health catastrophe with uh with psychiatric symptoms as one of the core features of this catastrophe right now i know psychiatry is your own specialization what does it mean when people lose their jobs i mean even if they have job keeper and job seeker allowances is that it like are they fine because they have a little bit of income streaming in well that's an interesting question i mean i think there are in society there's certainly a proportion of people who in the short term would rather be paid to stay at home than to work so there are powerful disincentives to employment for a proportion of people in our population in the short term i think in the medium to long term the consequences for the individual and for society of of not working um can cannot be understated i think you know work provides people with structure and routine and the ability to um to mix with with others and it gives them respite from the home particularly if they've got a difficult domestic environment but i think once you withdraw that you end up with a whole lot of of consequences which ultimately i think will have uh psychiatric effects i think you'll see increases in um alcoholism increases in domestic violence increases in in obesity increases in smoking um and and a whole range of sort of unintended consequences of the lockdown so so i think the the the job keeper and job seeker payments are kind of um kicking the can down the road a little bit with this uh with this pandemic response and once those um financial um platforms are removed i think there'll be a catastrophic collapse both economically and also in terms of people's mental health so the short answer is yes i think employment is very important for people it's important for for people's self-esteem it's important for their self-worth and once you remove that what are people left with well not a lot look we've seen reports from england especially of people no longer being willing to comply with uh coronavirus public health orders if they feel they're ridiculous if they feel that they're just not well targeted now even in england which has had a very serious uh pandemic experience people are kind of having lockdown fatigue what about here in australia where let's face it i mean the numbers of coronavirus cases are extremely low so i think i i probably at the start of this pandemic uh overestimated the the the the prospect of early lockdown fatigue and i've been quite um amazed by the the degree of patience and the degree of um of goodwill shown by victorians particularly in the face of these very prolonged and onerous lockdown restrictions but i do think that that even victorians will have limits to their patients and i read this morning in the in the australian that that um that the prospect of a third lockdown um by daniel andrews will will be the the straw that breaks the camel's back and i think there's probably some truth to that that as human beings there are limits to our abilities to withstand long-term um social isolation and just the complete disruption of social bonds and um and social activities and even the even the the ostensibly harmless act of wearing a mask in the long term i think will will end up um wearing people's patients um and and they'll i think end up refusing to comply with that restriction so yes i think there are limits to the ability for for human beings to withstand these um these strictures and you're right to say that that particularly when they're ridiculous or don't make um medical sense i think the government is is playing very dangerous games here because if they compel us to do things which are obviously ridiculous like wearing a mask if you're out by yourself um in in the countryside then they're going to have a lot of difficulties a lot of difficulty asking us to do things that might have an evidence base to them so it's it's a it's not a very smart tactic in my view to force the populace to do things that that they know are ridiculous yeah that's really interesting point because i think most of us are very happy to do our part if something's meaningful so every restaurant i go to has a qr code to scan in and of course i scan in they ask me to scan in what's the problem it seems reasonable enough uh people are happy to sanitize their hands especially if they walk into a hospital or a public building um it's so it's those seemingly meaningless restrictions that seem to erode public confidence uh do you think that public confidence in government will decline i mean after all in victoria it seems like public office confidence in governments at record levels despite the mismanagement of victoria yeah so i think that speaks to a different psychological phenomenon which i've talked about which is a sort of stockholm syndrome effect that people tend to some people at least tend to perversely fall in love with their captors and and uh you know andrews has has done a very good job of being the the hard man of politics and the hard man of the lockdown um extending um as far as the the black mask that he wears you'll probably notice he doesn't tend to change the color of that mask it's very it's very dominant and very kind of morbid and i think people um like the idea of having a strong leader even if that strong leaders um policies are ultimately harmful and counterproductive so i think there is a degree of that in victoria although i note that his popularity has been slipping from sort of i think popularity of of in excess of 80 now down to i think 60 or or thereabouts in a recent poll so i think even amongst the true believers in victoria he's beginning to to to lose popularity as as fatigue sets in but you know this just back to the notion of making people do ridiculous things well um you know that's quite clever i think in some ways even though it's a dangerous game as i alluded to before because if you can compel someone to do something which they know to be ridiculous then um that that's a very impressive way to to demoralize a population and without wanting to get all conspiratorial about things i think that there is an element of um of uh of of of of masochism and um and of demoralization of the population that's going on in victoria if you look at the the police crackdowns on on quite ostensibly benign um facebook posts in victoria this is a population that is now living in fear i think so he's a very clever manipulator is is uh is dan andrews um and whether he's doing it deliberately or is it has an instinct for it what he's doing is very effective i don't think it's going to be um an indefinite thing and i think he'll come acro at some point but it's very effective at the moment well i won't ask you for a pop diagnosis of dan andrews at a distance but i will ask you to talk about your actual work there because you're working in melbourne is that right i know i work i live and work in sydney oh you're in city i'm sorry i'm from melbourne family in melbourne but even here in sydney of course you you have a real um you know forgive the analogy finger on the pulse of uh of our health system and you see things that the statistics won't tell us for a couple years yeah have these sudden uh ice episodes of isolation where people have been pulled out of their social networks has that led to a spike in suicide cases or at least attempted suicides that you've seen or are more people needing uh health care as yeah and are they getting it so that's an interesting question and i think we're only just beginning to get some some data on it i mean i work in a hospital where the majority of patients are long-term patients with chronic and severe mental illnesses i think where we are seeing a spike in demand for mental health services is in um in the world of general practice predominantly and probably to a lesser degree in community mental health clinics now i don't work in any of those settings but i have heard anecdotal reports from colleagues who do that there has been a marked spike in depression anxiety deliberate self-harm um drug and alcohol abuse domestic violence um and just a general increase in um i guess a general reduction i guess in in disorders sort of depression society certainly the fear that has been whipped up by the media about the contagions this virus certainly led to an increasing in in suffering for people who have excessive compulsive disorders because we hear about immediateness viruses everywhere surfaces in the air and so yes we are seeing spiking problems and i think that there will be a lag before there is a spike in this environmental process don't do anything [Music] well we've had actually uh it seems like we've had a deterioration in the link and for some poor sound quality we'll see if the producer can fix that if there's anything we can do about it uh let me take a moment just to say hello to uh our viewers anthony emily gay courtney thanks for tuning in live we really appreciate it uh carlos there's there's one related question i'd like to ask you which is about the uh ability to access healthcare we've heard a lot of stories of you know people not getting cancer treatment or not getting heart treatment because hospitals have been no go zones is that also affecting people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are are they have they been unable at times to access health care because of hospital restrictions um look i i don't know i mean from from my observations um in the public health system in new south wales during the height of the early stage of this pandemic the number of presentations to the emergency departments for mental health problems dropped off significantly and and opposite to what you might expect we had um vacancies in our hospital for for psychiatric beds right and i think there are possibly a number of reasons for that it might be have been the case that such was the the panic and worry in society that people who might have had a lower threshold for seeking help um increased that threshold and just sort of managed at home looking in australia the vast majority of psychiatric services are community-based services rather than inpatient services and certainly it is the case that during the pandemic um uh it became more difficult for um community services to to function effectively and to to see people in their homes because of the restrictions put on travel and and uh and uh social distancing and so on and so forth in response to this the government um and the the the college of psychiatrists expanded the use of telehealth telehealth assessments and telehealth treatments for people with mental illness now that's all well and good for people like you or me as you as you open this conversation with but for people who have perhaps limited access to information technology and to the internet and to laptops these people are likely to go without necessary treatments so there are limits to what telehealth can achieve in in dealing with people who have perhaps more severe and enduring mental illnesses right now dr bera people who want to find your work can just google spectator carlos de vera they'll find your column there i know you do a lot of public writing so people please look out for that but you've also written for the center for independent studies and uh i'd like to feature this report that you authored i think it's a couple of years ago now yeah uh it is dying with their rights on the myths and realities of ending homelessness in australia we've had a lot of talk this year about how easy it was to end homelessness that once it became a government priority in march april homelessness was just taken care of does that feel good story true have have we seen the disappearance of homelessness in australia um it's a very good question again uh look certainly walking around the streets of sydney um it appears that there are fewer homeless people on the streets i mean certainly in the early stages of this pandemic there were virtually no homeless people um in the cbd of sydney that i could see um i think we're seeing numbers of people sleeping rough on the street corners increase as the lockdown restrictions have um have lessened in new south wales and i think we'll probably have a return to the status quo at some point but yes it was remarkable how quickly um people who'd been sleeping rough for years um were able to to access a roof over their head at relatively short notice when when the government was was keen to have uh people off the streets and look certainly um there is some evidence that the homeless population um there was a lancet article came out about a week ago in the uk the homeless population are more vulnerable to covert infections and are more likely to have comorbidities so you know it's certainly the right thing to do to address the needs of of homeless people in the face of this pandemic but yes you're quite right it's it also the speed with which housing was um was found for for these people um sort of really uh i think highlighted the um the lack of will perhaps the government has had prior to the pandemic in housing people who have uh uh uh homeless people who have mental illness well i know a lot of the stories were these uh puff pieces about you know from the streets of king's cross to a five-star hotel uh but clearly five-star hotels are not going to be used as a long-term solution to the homelessness uh situation and in your own work i found it very interesting you distinguish between sleeping rough yeah and the homeless numbers that are peddled kind of by the the homelessness industry which is much more focused on solving the problems it seems of people who have an inadequate home instead of having much more difficult problems of often mentally ill people sleeping on the streets what's going to happen to that core you know serious uh problem group the mentally ill who are sleeping rough they're not going to stay in the five star hotels wherever you go once the pension passes well i suspect they'll end up back on the streets salvatore and uh and we will revert to policies the failed policies that have kept them on the streets and those failed policies are a reluctance to manage them assertively and to manage their mental illnesses and their drug and alcohol dependence problems where we will see so that's that that's the rough sleeping population which i think will probably remain relatively unchanged that said there is the the larger population who will um be at risk of uh of um unstable accommodation once the economic catastrophe of the lockdown um takes a grip i think we will see uh people who previously had secure accommodation face the prospect of of eviction and of uh perhaps more transient accommodation and and and maybe even um sleeping rough but we'll see once uh unemployment hits a certain level and once job keeper and job seeker disappear and and once the the economic uh armageddon hits us i think we will see an increase in homelessness how much of that will be rough sleeping i'm not sure right now dr burr i have to apologize this is the moment when i ambush you but our viewers will be well aware that this is the moment when i ask them for money what we'd like to have is members uh for forty dollars you can join cis i'd really appreciate it if any of you who join join now during the program so that it can be explicitly linked to the success of this program and reaching out to people around australia and around the world you don't have to be an australian to join the center for independent studies if you're already a member you can upgrade from the 40 membership level to the 250 membership level and if you do i will personally send you a signed copy of liberty and liberalism the first work of classical liberalism published in australia by bruce smith now this is not the original edition this is a reprint put together by the center for independent studies under the leadership of greg lindsey i'd love to send you a copy i have a copy i have actually mailed out four or five copies of this book to people who contributed at the 250 level of course please just thumbs up the video uh we offer lazy about liking videos but honestly if you want more people to see dr debra talking if you like the video the youtube algorithm will feed it to more people and we'd love to get the word out about that dr vera thank you for being patient while i make a pitch i really appreciate it uh we have some questions uh first let me go to anthony anthony asks has anyone done a cost-benefit analysis of the measures taken to combat the pandemic is someone working on this yes so i found one this morning undertaken in the united states and i don't have the reference in front of me sadly i should have printed it out looking at the cost-benefit analysis of comparing a complete lockdown to a partial lockdown to a no lockdown at all and and interestingly that was a study undertaken looking at a u.s population where of course they've had more coronavirus deaths per capita than we have had in australia and and even those researchers and these researchers are generally quite um left-leaning in their in their political views concluded that the cost of a complete lockdown or what they call shelter in place in the u.s would only be worthwhile if there were hundreds of thousands of deaths um more than we're actually seeing at the moment so they argued for a partial lockdown in terms of cost benefit analysis um julian cevalescu who people might know um a famous uh oxford-based um ethicist um and traditionally someone who has been a friend of the left um uh published an uh an opinion piece in the conversation um just uh on the 17th of this month um arguing that in terms of cost benefit analysis the the lockdowns that we're seeing in australia are a sledgehammer that was his quote and and probably cannot be justified in terms of quality of life here analysis or other cost benefit analyses so there are researchers um arguing now which is good to see that maybe the sledgehammer effect of a complete lockdown can't be justified in terms of cost-benefit analysis right um gay suggests that we should be in regular contact with our friends especially victorians including them in things we do virtually in her words tears fears and laughter does virtual inclusion does this reaching out to your friends and loved ones via you know zoom or skype or uh what's happened does that facetime does that help them psychologically or really do you need in-person contact to make a difference in person contact is obviously better because it is something that uh that occurs across a range of sense domains not just not just auditory um and i guess visual with zoom but nothing can replace that but of course this is a second best um and and and we should of course communicate with people as often as we can who who are in isolation sadly a lot of people who are in isolation don't have the capacity to communicate with others even virtually you think of some very elderly people who perhaps are unable to use zoom or social media who are kind of languishing by themselves with very little in the way of support in victoria must be tens of thousands of these people and and what what what happens to the quality of their lives and why politicians not more interested in the quality of their lives right um cameron wants to ask if kova 19 is going to be with us indefinitely should the recording and reporting of statistics be reset seasonally so we think of flu seasons and we give numbers for flu seasons well for covet there's just a kind of running tally which gets worse and worse and worse if we accumulated all the flu cases for the last 50 or 100 years we'd have an awful lot a big tally of blue look absolutely um i agree with that and i and this raises the very interesting point that i was going to talk about um relating to the way that that the media and the government um report these statistics right um and and very briefly without going into into um into detail um there is a there is a phenomenon that has been recognized for about 20 years or so and that has been recently reported in our college of psychiatry in australia wherein people disproportionately pay attention to to negative aspects of news reporting rather than to the positives the government and the media have done a very very good job of manipulating this cognitive bias that we have of attaching significance to negative outcomes rather than to positives so when um dan andrews gets up every day and does his his his uh um black masked um sort of roll call of the people who have died he is reinforcing in people's minds that this is a very very dangerous virus and and then this kind of very pessimistic world view is spread through social media contagion and it's no surprise therefore that people overestimate the risks of contracting this virus or the risks of dying from it and i think the government and the media are quite happy for this overestimation to persist because it allows them to continue the measures that they have undertaken the disproportionate measures in my view to reduce our abilities to earn an income and to communicate with others and to to to live a normal life so this idea of negativity bias and of negativity dominance and social contagion is very very powerful so yes we should be recording things in an honest way but not in a way that catastrophizes the situation right right actually i teach an undergraduate quantitative methods class and i've devoted the entire class this uh year to focusing on chronovirus statistics how they're used and i am i'm certainly with you on that that there's a lot of misuse going on um emily jane would like to ask says doctors in melbourne have written a plea to danny andrews uh because they're worried about the mental health concerns of lockdown is causing yeah what restrictions would you recommend be lifted or any at all uh well you know i would recommend um that that restrictions that have no scientific evidence base to support them be lifted immediately um and obviously the curfew has gone that seemed to me a complete waste of time i would lift travel restrictions i would lift restrictions on on dining in public and on social gatherings and and as we've proven in new south wales it is possible to lift those restrictions um but to still um keep the the spread of the virus at bay you know we've got a very good a b comparison between victoria and new south wales you know roughly equivalent populations and roughly equivalent demographics yet we're managing to live with the virus here with far fewer restrictions than we have in victoria currently so i'd reduce most of these restrictions and and sort of really adopt an approach that um prioritizes individual responsibility as they've done in sweden and perhaps to a lesser degree in um in korea and in singapore uh and just get on with our lives um managing to live with this virus because who knows how long it's going to be with us and if it is seasonal are we going to see a recruit essence of the infection every winter um and is a virus is a vaccine going to come in the near future probably not so we're going to have to live with it whether we whether we like it or not hey vladimir putin already has a vaccine and donald trump will have one by november 3rd so watch what you say congratulations well let me pick up let me pick up on that issue of individual responsibility the cis of course thinks of itself as a classical liberal think tank we're after all peddling liberty and liberalism here the show is called on liberty and part of that is the idea that people should take responsibility for their own lives and specifically for their own health now i think there was a widespread popular demand for government to do something in february and in march to keep it safe government spectacularly failed in february march to keep their population safe but now um shouldn't we be seeing a shift from the government has to do something to okay we've got the basics down now it's just to individuals taking responsibility yes we should whether we will or not i'm not so sure about um there is a there is a a phenomenon um wherein complex problems are best solved at a local level rather than at a at a central level in the sort of hierarchy and um this is indeed a complex problem um and uh and it has been shown i think in sweden at least that that that solving this at a at a local level is optimal and of course the the most local you can get is individual and i think we're well and truly now um up to speed with um hand washing and um and keeping distant from one another and staying at home when sick um and and i think it's time that the population be trusted to do these things to stay at home if they've got a flu-like illness and so on and so forth without having to beat them over the head with rules and regulations in indefinitely which i think ultimately will be counterproductive so yes i would love to see a shift away from government dictat towards individual responsibility um you know interestingly the the one um demographic that in victoria who are very keen for these restrictions to end are the elderly people over 65 who potentially have the most to lose from the lessening of restrictions but who would like to have um quality of life rather than than longevity necessarily right although of course these things aren't mutually exclusive um you know if people don't have quality of life they're probably less likely to live long anyway uh so so i think that you know all these calls to to protect the elderly at all cost um need to be need to be taken with a with a grain of salt because it's the elderly who are most disadvantaged by these locked down measures right and these calls are these uh rules are ironically paternalistic it's us being paternalistic towards our own parents yeah uh look anthony's curious of your view on contact tracing he's wondering what do you think how good is our contact racing system uh how does rank with other systems you know there are other countries like singapore doing this better do you have any feel for that the success of contact racing in australia no i don't and and that's really outside of my of my uh of my expertise to to comment on i will point people to my foreign policy article about covid safe [Laughter] which we don't hear about these days it sort of disappeared didn't it really everybody downloaded it i didn't but other people did and and that sort of disappeared a little bit i think if you ask gladys berejiklian should tell you that contact tracing is fantastic in new south wales um it's probably less um effective in victoria um but i don't have a firm opinion one way or another as to as to whether or not it's a good thing or whether we should have more or less of it and what we should have is less panic i think and a greater sense of proportion and perhaps an acceptance that this virus is for the most part um either asymptomatic or relatively mild in terms of its symptoms um and we need to take that into account when um formulating public policy and alan jones is right you know he says on tv that the government needs to have an honest conversation with the population about the dangers of this virus and how they've been exaggerated and i've not heard a politician really talk um sensibly about the the risks of this pandemic they they all whether that liberal or labor want to exaggerate the risks um without having an honest conversation with the population and as i said it's very hard to um to undo panic and to undo fear uh because we tend to attach greater significance to negative um consequences rather than to to to positive ones now australia of course is a federal system are there states and territories that are doing it well i mean is there anyone you would hold up as an exemplar of public communication or you know appropriate uh taking an appropriate approach here well and the best of the bad bunch is probably in new south wales from from what i've read it's hard to comment on other states because we're not allowed to go there and of course um you know they're it's it's it's difficult to know really um what's going on in individual states in regards to the response um i'm not a fan of of border closures and i think the the evidence behind them in terms of uh spread of of illness is very very limited and i know that the federal government health advice at the start of this pandemic was that water closures were were uh not necessary and it was the individual states that made those decisions um i look at west australia for example which is basically now virtually seceded from the rest of the country and they've had i think zero cases but what happens when they open up and they have their first case i think that's almost inevitable as we've seen in new zealand which had a very hard uh initial lockdown so i don't know i i think i think this um i think in some ways this has tested federalism and has probably led to an ugly parochialism in some ways victoria queensland and west australia probably being the worst offenders perhaps tasmania as well and i think gladys is probably doing a good job of balancing um uh sensible uh uh antiviral measures with um uh optimizing people's individual liberties and and uh and business um prosperity now we're going to be wrapping up in just a minute or two but we have some final questions i have one from stephen one for myself uh stephen asks how do we support people with mental illness who perhaps uh cats themselves uh do social distancing or personal hygiene very well um so i have this problem uh at my workplace because um i struggle to get my patients to to wear shoes or to to shower regularly because they have very severe mental health problems so wearing a mask for many of them is is an impossibility right and it's a very very difficult thing to to impose now that's assuming that you think that a healthy individual wearing a mask is a good thing i i tend to think that it that it isn't um so look we we you you do your best with that population just as you would with perhaps people who had alzheimer's dementia or or people who had other sort of cognitive problems you you do your best to look after them and you do your best to to try and limit the spread of infection um in in institutional settings but i but i i think that um again even for people with severe mental illness the costs of the costs of these measures um probably outweigh the benefits right and and certainly my patients have had um very severe restrictions on their individual liberties um in terms of their ability to go shopping for example or to have leave with family or carers because of the lockdown restrictions um and these patients often don't have a voice and have little in the way of sort of public advocacy and um and aren't likely to complain so so much as i'd like to see my patients not get sick from coronavirus i'd also like to see them not have to live even more restrictive lives than they were already lead right right so let me ask you a final question when this is all over yeah whether it's next year or 2022 or 2020 or whenever it is if you had to guess are you going to guess that in australia more people have died of coronavirus or more people have died of government policies put in place to address the coronavirus oh golly um that's uh uh that's putting on very questioning it is just a little bit but here's your thoughts on even if you can't answer the question you can think about let me let me answer it this way if it turns out in five years if we could invent a time machine and travel five years into the future and it turns out that the number of deaths or the number of shortened lives let's say um caused by these lockdown measures and the ensuing economic catastrophe exceed the numbers of people who died of coronavirus um i would not be surprised all right that's all i will say and i will say that that even if we don't have to consider deaths if we consider morbidity from other medical conditions or suffering i think we'll see we'll see that far exceed the amount of suffering caused directly by the virus right dr carlos darbra thank you

including two universities in australia one in the philippines another in poland and then in singapore cecilia will be speaking this afternoon on covet 19 pandemic and locked down the impact on the mental health of adolescents over to you syria okay thank you very much for that kind introduction and thank you very much for having me share some of the research findings that we have over the years so i would have loved to join you in penang but given the current circumstances uh i'm stuck here in london since the last seven months so this is basically the uh presentation overview so i'm going to be talking about anxiety and anxiety disorders talking about the differentiation between normal and clinical anxiety i will be presenting some data pre-covet and then we'll be talking about what we know about anxiety in children and adolescents i will briefly talk about the cross-cultural and family aspects of anxiety and then talk about some of the studies that my own research team has been doing since covet so this so we started the um the online survey around around may uh so we were we were looking about mental health problems in general but also more specifically about addictive behavior and then i'm going to be talking briefly about adapting to the normal to the new normal and just very briefly because i know priscilla who uh did a workshop yesterday and today a little bit about super skills for life some of the emerging data that we have in different countries so very briefly what do we know about anxiety so i thought it's quite important to to define this first so we will come so we will have a common uh idea about what anxiety is so anxiety as we see here is a state it's a mood step characterized by strong negative emotion and bodily symptoms in which an individual apprehensively anticipates future danger or misfortune and i underline the word anticipation anticipation is very very important in trying to differentiate what normal and what normal and clinical anxiety is and anxiety is we can look at anxiety through three systems so it consists of the cognitive the behavioral and the physical aspect so what we see here is a table that shows the function of the different kind of components of anxiety and [Music] and how you see it as a clinician so what happens is when we see when we are approached with something our body actually responds so the whole system is responding so physically cognitively but behaviorally so from the physical point of view uh you see people sweating blushing shaking having dry mouth but to some extent some people also having a stomach ache so when people are highly anxious they sometimes feel that they you know there's a butterfly in the stomach so and this has a very particular function because it helps our system to prepare ourselves for the flight fight reaction and we can see this uh through the behavior here so in young children for example they start to scream and this you know some people start to bite their nails and in fact we do have patients sometimes don't even have any nails because they keep biting it and we can see the way they look at other people so generally there is a tendency not to look at other people's eyes so this kind of avoidance of eye contact but more quite difficult is this cognitive side because the physical and the behavioral aspect you can see but not not so much so for the cognitive aspect cognitive aspect is so when people are highly anxious they try to look around their surrounding and if they cannot see something that is of immediate danger they become they tend to look more internally look at what happened in their body so what we can see here is people will express being nervous being panicky uh have difficulty concentrating so when we work with young people very young children we could hardly see the court i mean it's very difficult to differ to to narrow down the cognitive aspect of anxiety so normal anxiety is actually adaptive you know adaptive in the sense that um you know it's you try to avoid the situation when there is a real danger and anxiety is also a very basic emotion that already is present you know during infancy and during childhood and it's also a brain response to danger so this is really the normal aspect of anxiety but when is then anxiety become a disorder that need to be treated and i think the differentiation between what is normal and what is clinical is very very difficult to to do especially for young children of course we do have our classification system that guide us to differentiate between what is normal and what is clinical but broadly speaking we can say that it you can look at the duration and intensity of the symptoms so that's the question that we raise it does it correspond to the real danger of the situation so sometimes we do have passion come to our clinic um parents complaining about children not wanting to sleep alone because of the small spider so one would then question does it correspond to the real danger of the situation this despite that does it is it really going to fight and and kill you uh this these are the questions that we will raise and the other kind of a broad question that we might want to question is um the experience of the symptom is it a one-off thing or is it chronic does it happen over over months or in some children even over years and then the symptoms itself in terms of causing impairment and impairment is a very crucial aspect of that we do for example have um have children that manage to go to school uh but then they're impaired in all kind of things they they they're so nervous of talking in front of the class they're very nervous and of interacting with the other children and we do have i remember one of my patients have a social phobia so didn't want to go to the toilet so what happened is she wouldn't eat and drink anything during the school time because she's afraid that if she drinks and eat then she would have to go to the toilet yeah so so this is in some ways in impaired because then she desperately sometimes needs to go to the toilet and because of because she's afraid of going to the toilet um she is experienced pain you know and then as a result she cannot focus in class so that's one of the example of impairment um and this i mean when we talk about anxiety anxiety disorders we are talking about different subclasses of anxiety disorders so these some of the examples that we have out there quite common in young people is in in secondary school especially is these generalized anxiety disorders so these young people worry about all kind of things worry about the negative aspect of you know the outcomes worry about what they wear what their peers group will think about them and so forth and in more younger children we um it's separation anxiety which is very common when young children are afraid to be separated from their parents because they are afraid when uh when they're separated they will forever be separated from their parents because of harm to themselves or to their parents and panic disorder is probably one of the most cv of all the anxiety disorders we don't see very often in young children but we begin to see quite often uh in adolescence so it's one of the key symptoms of panic disorder is panic attack so this is when young people suddenly feel very very intensive anxiety and they're afraid of losing control or going crazy social phobia is also very um very common during the adolescence period and this is when so the main worries here is to be negatively um judged by their peer group and they're afraid um you know they're afraid of being negatively charged and being embarrassed so these are you know some of the key um components of the key the common subtypes of anxiety disorders in young people so pre-copied findings shows that up to 32 of the adolescents worldwide uh experience anxiety disorders uh this this is the data from the general population so if we were to include clinical data the the percentage will be way more and for anxiety we see it being more common in girls than in boys there's a lot of speculation why that is the case one of the reasons they have been discussed heavily in the literature is socialization so that that means the way we raise boys and girls tend to be very different and some some authors say that it might has to do with the hormonal change and even some study shows that girls tend to be more affected by trauma than boys we also know that over the years that the presence of anxiety disorders tend to have a very negative impact on emotional social and academic development of young people but what is really important is this co-occurrence of disorders so that means especially in the clinic when we have young people coming to see us with anxiety they have almost 90 percent have other kind of disorders so the most common disorders that co-occur um with anxiety are things like depression for for girls and for for boys these are anxiety and substance use uh disorders so when young people have multiple disorders we see that anxiety usually come first in in a lot of our in our own studies is about 70 percent so anxiety come first and then depression it's very rarely that we get the opposite that the depression comes first and then anxiety so this i'm i'm sure you're familiar with this the national health and mobility study in malaysia shows that the the adolescents with anxiety and depression and stress it's very much similar to the to the data that have been reported in uh in in the west for anxiety is even you know for girls it's almost half have anxiety but what is striking is that um this data here so we always know that the transition years from primary to secondary school is very very crucial so studies have shown this worldwide is very crucial so if young people have problem adapting to the secondary school uh life you know they have problem catching up that's why we have received quite a bit of funding where we are preparing primary school children in the uh in in primary five and primary sick to prepare them for the transition to secondary school but this is the first data from malaysia that shows that suicidal behavior is is very high in in form one so you can see here even suicidal attempt is 10.1 so and i think this this kind of stress the importance of preparing the young children um during the transition years and also especially pay special attention to what happened during form one now i mentioned that this is this is a little bit complicated so i try to explain it we know that um there is a high rate of commobility so that means that when one when young people have anxiety they also have depression and other disorders so in the literature among scientists we try to make sense about why is it the case why is that when one person and one disorder is the likelihood that they have other disorders is very very high so what we try to find out here is try to find out because symptoms across disorders uh some of them are very very similar for example if people have worry if people have depression and anxiety one of the key symptoms of both disorders are worry and low self-esteem and this is what we found here when we look at the different symptoms here but what we also found is that some of the predictors very strong predictors of anxiety in depression here is actually lifestyle factors so these are things like not having enough sleep not pro having proper food healthy food healthy diet so this this is very very very important so um so it's very important not to not only to focus on the fundamental aspect of of young people but also the physical aspects so we need to take a very holistic approach to helping young people young people to live a healthy lifestyle so what we also know over the years is that when left untreated anxiety disorders that begin early in life tend to be chronic and also tend to increase the risk for developing other mental disorders for me anxiety disorders or anxiety high level of anxiety is really the roots of many forms of problems during late adolescence and also during adulthood so this this this particular study is um is very important to um it's very important to highlight what i just mentioned so this study was conducted uh when the children was 14 years old we followed them up until the age of 30. um over a period of 16 years so what we saw here is those adolescents that have anxiety during the adolescence years actually have a very high prevalence of developing anxiety depression alcohol and drug problems during adulthood so during the during the age of 30. so it actually ex you know emphasize the importance of early intervention and what we see here i i didn't have the result at the slide what we saw here is it's not only in terms of developing disorders but they are impaired in different aspects of their life so they have problem with unemployment they have problems in their family settings and and colleagues so very very important uh to have early intervention so in terms of the risk factors there are a lot out there so in terms of anxiety the respect most some of the most consistent and very strong risk factors for anxiety disorders of being female having cognitive dysfunction having life you know life events family genetic and aggregation and family environmental factors so that includes parenting style family climate and childhood diversity i'm quite interested in culture because a lot of the because anxiety is very interesting because actually what we do as part of our life many of them is actually anxiety reduction strategies but it's part of our life and i hope i will convince you with what i said um here so culture there are two aspects so john berry defined it in 1976 uh this is what culture is but what is really more important is these two aspects of culture explicit so this is what what other people can see what we see consider as you know is a valued object but also implicit throughout the values and the beliefs and the attitude we have about certain things so i'm very familiar i'm sure many of you are familiar with all of these uh some of the stuff that we do during subtle ceremony here you have a banana i think we have quite a few indian uh delegates out there you might know why that is but from my own culture the iban from sarawak we this is when the child in the long house sleeps and we have the black cloth here yeah and to our belief if we put the black cloth here it prevent the children sleeping being interrupted being disturbed by the evil spirit yeah so we automatically put it there i don't know if if anyone in west malaysia have this kind of this kind of uh belief and the ebons for example also believe in in dreams so when we have bad dreams we will make some special offers so that that particular bedrooms will not come true similarly if we have good dreams we also make celebrations so that the this good dream will come true so uh so and i think these have all to do with um with the set of belief that we have many years ago i was in pakistan and some of my colleagues said after i give a lecture they said well in pakistan you can see all these big trucks so the more decoration the big trucks are people believe that pakistani believe that the less likely they're going to have an accident so again it's a it to me this is um a real form of anxiety reduction and in japan some of you have been japan you see all this colorful technology here uh and i some of you might have heard this story when i first went on the visit i went to japan uh i was um i was in the mushroom uh i need to flush a toilet but i couldn't find anything so i press all kind of thing in the toilet nothing come out so uh there's only one button that i press and this button start to laugh and but no water the water was not flushing so i tried and this button kept laughing so i went outside and i met one of the students i told her what happened and she said well you know our in japan we are very shy people she said so when you have somebody who who next door uh you want to press it this button so that the person next door will not hear what you're doing so again this is a form of um anxiety reduction and this one here does anyone know what this is this is 30 this can be considered as an anxiety provocating or an anxiety reducing egg this actually means this is in one of the schools in asia i took this over the summer this actually indicates the number of days that the children are going to have a public exam yeah so we get so a lot of um so what we do in the society can actually be can actually be anxiety provocating or anxiety reduce reduction and also we have something called culture bound syndrome so so anxiety can manifest itself in different cultural background yeah because it's very much influenced by what is expected in a particular culture and this one we have done quite a lot of work in japan for example with something with hygiene confusion this is a this is a this is um something very similar to the our west the western concept of social anxiety so social anxiety is very much uh the fear of embarrassing oneself but tai jin kofo shu is very much fear that that whatever i do displease other people or cause embarrassment or offense or will be offensive to other people so the focus is very different so in social anxiety the focus is in on me but tajin kufoshu is very much on on other people so when we so when we try to try to understand this this difference focus we need to understand the japanese culture you know this japanese culture is very much afraid very much related to not causing uh disturbance to the people around you yeah they want to keep as much harmony with especially with india in group so um so it's very much uh so it's very so a lot of the uh symptoms associated with culture bound syndrome for anxiety is very much related to the cultural value so we um cross-cultural psychology is very interesting because we want to see the universal reality of anxiety and the factors with which is selects that illegitimate and also is very much related to how do people explain why they become anxious because this is also very important because then it determines health seeking behavior so people that think that they are being possessed by the evil spirit they are most probably most likely to go to the local healers um instead of going to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist one of the things that we have been quite interested is trying to you know all these models about the development and the maintenance of anxiety is very much dominated by the western um theories so we want to make sure that whatever is developed in the west can be replicated or maybe the difference and they they they're a good reason why they should be different because we live you know um very different west and east but what i'm particularly interested is using all this information to make a intervention and prevention program that is culturally sensitive sometimes i bother about the fact that people simply kind of translate western uh develop intervention into whatever culture they're working in without really considering the cultural context one of the risk factors that i mentioned before is this the um the family aggregation so that means that up to five pair children whose parents have anxiety disorders have up to five times higher risk of developing anxiety disorders there are a lot of debates so it's really nurture nurture debate whether you know whether the genes are passed on from parents to children and what we can see here is that you know it's actually about 50 of them is related to the environment and actually very small percentage is related to the gene so which really you know from a psychological point of view we could you know it brings a lot of um um positive things so it's not like you know when the parents are are anxious or depressed that the children automatically become anxious and depressed so there are a lot of things from the psychological point of view psychological psychological intervention that you can work on so in terms of the model trying to find out why pair children or parents uh have also high rates of anxiety um there this model um showed that three pathways so one pathway is true modeling of anxious behavior one the second one is related to the information learning so actually children receive the information that make them scare from their parents and parents are really good in terms of um you know looking in the internet and some of the information and not really uh evident based so there's also a danger of that and the other thing is reinforcement of anxious behavior so one of the things that we see again and again for example if children are very anxious taking a pass and then they start to have stomach ache and headache and what parents normally do is go to the doctors and they get sick leave and they get a six certificate so that so the children will not take the you know uh stay at home and not take the exam so in this case it's a reinforcing this anxious behavior so if this is a case this is one of the things that we work with with the parents and there are a lot of studies that you know that try to provide evidence-based um information to show the importance of whatever parents do to the children so i think i'm running i don't have so much time but this is really quite interesting um quite interesting way to you know to provide evidence that whatever parents said is very crucial uh the other thing that um a lot of studies have been conducted uh in the past is this uh excessive protection and controlling parenting uh parents are very are over controlled so what kind of message does it bring to the to the parent to the children it's not only it's not only parents that are very or that are overprotective in controlling but also but also teachers so when this happened it actually convey a message to the child that the world out there is a dangerous world in it also doesn't give the uh children the possibility to you know to to to do an independent copying to to try the boundary to be to do things independently and a lot of studies that again that provide evidence uh information on that and this is very interesting study conducted by my colleagues in writing so what what they actually did was here they have mother and child working together in one room so they have two group of uh mother and child so one group of one group of mothers is that the mother was was asked to be over controlling while the child was preparing uh for a speech experiment and another group of mothers was taught to be more autonomous grunting so what you can see here is the mothers who are very controlling and overprotective the children were much more nervous during the uh during the uh speech task experiment so um and i think this even though this is a lab-based uh experiment i think it brings a lot of messages on the way in which parent can do in terms of promoting independence behavior so one of the things that we have done in the past is looking at well we know that anxiety cause all kind of impairments or anxiety disorders or high level of anxiety but what what do they do do they seek intervention unfortunately this data doesn't seems that is the case so in the study that we conducted many years ago only 19.2 of the children young people that have anxiety disorders actually did so did sick treatment so this study is particularly interesting because it was conducted in germany where we have you know we have a very comprehensive healthcare system especially for mental health services so one of the things that we were interested in looking was looking at um you know what are the predictors what factors actually um lead people to sick uh intervention so one of them is the presence of suicidal attempt or the age the presence of other disorders so mostly anxiety depression and other disorders and then parental anxiety and the depression so now with kobe i mean it has um um in the uk the schools are closed for about six months so and the school closure has a lot of implications especially on those who are living in poverty so school closures especially in adolescence means that they are at home most of the time with the families this test lead to a lot of uh you know conflict within the family um this also means that they're not able to see friends and peer groups in some schools they have access to that top but then especially those from uh from poor family them there are several children so most of the time they only have one laptop so that means that although almost all the teaching are done online so that means that these young people also have trouble assessing um online learning um in and we know that adolescence is a very crucial um age in terms of skills social skills development and also in terms of developing a sense of identity and all these are related to interaction with their peers which during the pandemic is completely out of uh very very little occurring and this was the a lot of a lot of studies are being conducted but a lot of but not yet published there are only very few that have been published and this was among some of the very first studies conducted in shanghai involved more than 2 000 children aged 6 to 17 years conducted in five schools um so they did it over over two period in january in in march and what you can see here as predicted you know there is a significant reduction in their physical activities a significant uh more uh screen time uh and for leisure and also for the long term you know more than two hours a week and this is our own study so my former phd students and myself and several other colleagues we were also interested to look at the screen time we look at different kind of screen time how much they spend in social media looking at social media doing gaming and doing streaming services and shopping online and well-being but what we can see here there is a significant increase in the number of hours that these young people uh look at social media this is the the the blue one is before covet and this the red dark red one is uh during copied period and lord significantly smoke more as you can see here during the copied period we did not find any significant differences in terms of alcohol consumption and in terms of taking drugs slightly for drugs so this is mainly marijuana and looking um across the literature out there a lot of position papers a lot of discussion papers saying you know saying that the impact of copied on adolescents could be related to all of these so uh post traumatic stress disorders um that could lead to all kind of uh what is happening to the brain because as you know you know adolescence is a period where the brain is still still forming still developing uh lead to anxiety depression suicide a lot worldwide there is an increased prevalence of suicidal attempt and actually suicide itself addiction grief and also because of uh family family members dying and also not not being able to uh to say a final goodbye in the uk it's restricted to 10 people who could attend the um the funeral and lots of family of intra family violence we actually have just put a research proposal with a colleague in in in the philippines and um according to my colleagues there there there is an increase of 240 percent in um in in um in what you call it in sexual online abuse among young people during the lockdown so this is very very dramatic and also in terms of domestic violence there is a report also in newspapers in the uk showing more than 200 percent increase in the number of call to the nspcc of um of domestic violence we know that as i mentioned before um the free fighter cortex which is very much central to the development of the executive functioning which is very much related to imposed control planning and problems solving is is still developing uh and it became you know fully mature uh between adolescence and early adulthood so that means that we have a very we still have a very good opportunity to do whatever needs to be done in order to have a a long-lasting impact of uh what might be related to copying in relation to anxiety and so on um there is so as far as i know there's not yet any intervention um out there evident based that try to um you know prevent the long-term impact of covet in adolescence but there are few things out there for example for from from from the children society in the uk would mention that you know waste to general well-being and i think it can be applied to how we deal with um with the coffee as well so to connect up with with families see friendship uh keep learning read for fun and disown look around you listen so it's more like mindful about your situation walk cycle run so physical exercise and be creative so this is something which priscilla is um is really being uh very good at you know painting drawing play more dreaming and this one a colleague in the us did um a paper on um you know trying to help young people to cope with kobe and she said well try to talk to the young people what your understanding of copying what are the symptoms what are the way to uh to prevent you know to prevent it in terms of doing the prevent health prevention in getting the transmission of cockpit and understand how you feel when copying first begin and now because they're different stages and use using positive way to cult so monitor the normal uh routine but one of the things that she they mentioned was also reduce exposure to news and on social media so i think it can be very scary i remember myself in march and i was really glued to the social media and you know it can be quite scary um you get all this information and then write your thoughts and experience experience of your consciousness and i think one other thing i'm not going to go through this because i think priscilla did a workshop on this is and i think we can adapt it quite easily on the super skills for life program i'm almost done so that quite a lot of development in terms of super skills for life and i have done quite a lot of online training and there are a lot of colleagues worldwide that are delivering uh super skills for life program online and i know priscilla has done a fantastic work and helping young people in malaysia doing that and the result in one of the things that we have done this paper just came out uh where we use super skills for life in mauritius in residential uh child institute emotions i would also like to stress that one of the things that we've done was we were not only interested in looking at whether anxiety and depression have reduced but we were also interested in how does the heart function like in terms of reacting to stress before after the intervention with super skills and here in this their mauritius data we were able to show that after uh taking part in the intervention there is an increase in concentration of young people's increase in in working memory which is really fantastic yeah and that's it i think i'm a little bit over my tongue so sorry about that and uh i think the question is at the end i think right thank you okay okay thank you professor esau uh yes questions will be taken at the end okay is actually a native of sarawak okay before she started traveling all around the world thank you so much okay you're welcome thank you all right can we are those of you who are here in the hall let's thank her a very comp i think a very comprehensive

not sure how much i owe you for that but thank you for having me um fatima for inviting me to be part of this prestigious event and i'm glad that i'm able to come in and share a bit about what i know i'm sure you know most of you would have some you know skill sets that we can learn that i can learn from you um well today i want to talk about balancing um how we can balance online learning and let me just get my okay i'm not sure how many of us remember this computer game it's called bong in the 70s how many of us remember this yes you spend time on that you spend time on that yeah during those days in the 70s right to us who played this one this was like wow this is the game and then we upgraded to this this those spaces remember these two yeah yeah yeah this was the time when he was playing all this we were caught playing but we have to go to a gaming shop or some kind of us in our outlet that we can just put some coins into it and all that those were the days when we played this and when i showed my children that this was our computer games when i was growing up and my son looked at it but he wasn't very impressed what do you do for fun this is fun because really you know the the latest computer games is incredible so it has a sort of retro look to it as you're driving through it looks kind of like pixel art but in 3d and given it's a cyberpunk city that is perfect it's wonderful in your deliveries you're going to be doing both driving and walking driving is probably more fun but i'll tell you well i mean games like this is so engaging it's no wonder that it will capture our adolescence and our children's attention uh you know when and they become fixed sacred and even addicted to playing these games by you know through their devices with the complete 19 situation as uh cecilia has let me point out it also increases the use of devices but it's not helped man this country to have a lockdown they did a study on this and um you have um could you speak louder okay hold here to the computer is it all right now okay our shout it out from singapore excellent i'll get all my neighbors here all right um so china being the first country to have to lock down and so they did a study on how these internet addiction can call relates with the lockdown and and this uh research done by all these pr uh eminent uh academicians and researchers found that in the this was done in june the conclusion was that these three coping behaviors internet alcohol smoking during covet related crisis appeared to have increased the risk of substance use disorders and internet addiction subsequently they did more research on this in september just last month they published a paper on this research on internet addiction and related psychological factors among children and adolescents in china during the coronavirus disease 2019 they came to the same conclusion that we observed internet use even we observed internet use among chinese children and adolescents during the outbreak of covet 19 age gender depression and stress were the potential key factors affecting ia there is internet addiction extended family and professional support should be considered for vulnerable individuals during this unprecedented times so it is certainly not um helpful when the world goes into online learning so you have your regular classes the school are all closed and children are tasks to you know learn via online you can see that zoom application has sought up since april this year because of the lockdown and um the growth of moc smokes that is uh massive on open online classes and has also grown uh phenomenally you know right from 2012 there wasn't any uh courses that was offered online just eight years ago just eight years ago eight years later in 2019 and um and right now in 2020 there are at least over 13 000 courses that are offered online and these statistics does not include uh china can you imagine if you include china you know the online courses um there will be there will be certainly more than these thirteen thousand cocera being one of the most popular online providers has saw their new registered users also showed up from 8 million in 2019 it showed up to 20 million to date and it's still growing in total they have 65 million users uh in their platform can you imagine a physical campus can possibly hold maybe 20 25 000 students like we're talking about big campus but an online campus like this they actually have 65 million registered students in their courses well this coursera has certainly gained from the covete 19 just like zoom that um you see cosera crosses um april this year the the enrollment showed up exponentially now all this means that our teenagers and uh even ourselves are now looking at screens more than ever before and in the us as you can see that um the regular delivery has come down drastically because of the lock down screws are closed and the online courses show up and then right now um i think schools just opened in america and they are you know when they were at their peak they were at the same level as the regular delivery classes that means students and children and teenagers um subject to more screen time apart from their online learning they also use it for their gaming and their social medias and things like that and then there is this new it's not so new maybe about two three years now um this order called screen dependency disorder sdd children are addicted and also dependent on their devices and research proclaimed that excessive use of mobile phones and exposure to blue lights can impact your kids brain which can lead to a disorder called sdd screen dependency disorder and screen etiquette kids have shown up with problematic behavior like withdrawal symptoms including no interest in outside or indoor activities and their social abilities because is becoming more impaired because of you know uh this uh because of this disorder called s d d it's a serious problem and in singapore it's a national institute of education they did a survey with parents and this they found that 65 of the children 65 percent of the children started playing with electronic devices before they turned three that's that's going to lead to abnormal development of children because they become so dependent on screening this is why this this disorder is a global phenomenon it's a big problem and 95 of those children who play with the devices play video and simulation games on their devices now this is a singapore nie survey but there's a big but here only 30 percent of parents surveyed have rules on how much computer time their children were allowed that means if there were 100 parents being surveyed about you know the children spending time online on the computer only if there were 100 parents surveyed only 30 pair of parents would say that they uh have given a strict rule about the computer time for the children that means 70 other parents were not was not supervising their children and that would lead to more severe addiction is the result of that so the lack of supervision is also one of the cause of all these screen dependency this order there's another disorder that's now this a new uh disorder it's called noble phobia nomophobia is a term describing a growing fear in today's world the fear of being without a mobile device or beyond mobile phone contact that is just like you're fully stuck with you anymore you know we would have gone drive to work for 45 minutes and then we realized that we were without our phone guess what we would turn back and drive all the way home you know miss all the traffic just to get our phone to be with us it's called normal phobia and so you know you can imagine in the 21st century when our children grow up they need to have these device attached to their bodies because they just cannot leave their device at home so it calls for right balance yes they need the device and the laptop and computer for learning but then you know they also need you know to be supervised so that they will not go into a form of internet or addiction or you know suffering from screen dependency disorder so a lot of these balance need to be done at home so parents is the key to this balance parents cannot expect the society the school the system to monitor their children so especially during during a lockdown parents would be the key to to prevent a child from suffering from screen dependency this older parents during this pandemic can be you know going through a very stressful time you know they have to work from home at the same time they need to monitor their children yeah given all this um children is still their priority priority and they do need to set a balance of boundaries and have a right balance you know for the children i'll give you three suggestions three suggestions on how to break screen dependency and they are not new perhaps some of you already know this number one supervision is needed number two you know we need to have more activities with our children and then number three we need to touch and play with them is very important so these are the three ways to break a heartbreak screen dependency let's go through them one at a time supervision remember what singapore the national institute of education uh surveyed was done and um you know only 30 percent of parents actually took time to supervise a children or you know a set time limit for the children as far as using their devices or their computer time is concerned and and this is um is scary because when we don't supervise our children then they they will get into all kinds of sites and they will get into all kinds of games and they can be so addicted to this device they become personally become part of their body the american academy of pediatric success suggests zero screen time until kids reach between 18 and 24 months of age today if you walk into a lot of restaurants i suppose the lockdown is over or the mco in malaysia when it's over when you go into restaurants and we have children with family parents they are actually given their devices while waiting for the food to arrive and that's really unhealthy you know sometimes when i see these young children like babies are giving devices you know i felt like maybe i should go over and tell them um and maybe give my name card to them because i said that in five years time in seven years time you might need my services because right now your children is playing this games on their devices at such a young age you expect them to have a you expect to have a very torrid time when you want to remove these devices from them so parents will have to supervise their children otherwise once they are addicted to internet and suffer from sdd there will always be resistance especially when they reach an adolescent stage i suppose most of you are secondary school counselors i was told this is the most challenging stage if you can do preventive work i think we can help parents you know uh to let them know about this sdd and that you know prior to arriving into applying prior to the children getting to adolescent stage you know they need to prepare they need to set up rules and boundaries at the same time they need to have that maintain that relationship with their children you know there will always be fights uh shouting matches you know when parents you know turn up the wi-fi at home or take away the child's device i think when if the child is suffering from sdd more than just seeking professional help their parents will need to be firm and at the same time they need to relate with the child so rules plus relationship or rather rules without relationship leads to rebellion so you gotta have the balance between the two yes we have to have rules we have to enforce rules like you know the the hour the time limit as far as using the computer the device is concerned at the same time we need to relate rules without relationship equals rebellion so using this two as matrix roots and relationship you arrive at four uh variables so if the parents has a balance between okay i need to set rules at the same time they can understand they can empathize with the children and so it's not just all rules at the same time they know they can relate they can listen to the child's complain and cries you know and and the problems then the child will grow up but if it's all relationships and no roots at all anything goes then the child will grow up to become very powerful meaning i grew up with a sense of entitlement because i need anything i got it my parents did not stop me who are you to stop me so they grow up to be puff up if it's all rules no relationship i know parents love their children but it's a perspective of the child that is more important because all the child here is rules rules but they don't see you know relationship the relationship a lot from their parents and so they grew up to become very fed up people no rules no relationship well this child will grow up to be pretty messed up pretty much because there's no relationship with the parents it's that no rules at home and so you know there are no boundaries at all and so um most people who commit crime are usually children who grew up in broken families where there were no relationship with the parents you know and there were no rules that was set on them and so parents would need to understand this that okay if the rules have been messed up and your child is already addicted to um internet addiction or some form of addiction then we we need to understand what we need to do you know if we are relating without rules parent then we need to set up some rules if we are a real person like a tiger mom without even you know the child do not see that the the sense of belonging is a sense of attachment to the parents then you know we need to learn to be able to be more affectionate there are four kinds of parents as most of you would know so firstly the permissive parents uh in class soft ages that means um how i interact with people there's permissive parents have very soft ages right when they interact with others everything can and also they have very soft call conviction so it's like okay if you want to do this all right you want to pick me but actually okay just play you want to play for two hours it's okay so it's probably sick all right so very soft edge and uh very soft in the call and children love this kind of parents because they get whatever they want and sometimes it's not the parents like this sometimes it's the grandparents that is causing diseases like this and um well permissive parents um they're a little weak because the call is weak so there's no conviction of what's good what's not so good for the child it's just like anything goes so you had the permissive parents you had the absent parents where the call is not as solid but the edges it's not there i mean there's no edges there's no relationship uh all you have just come come in you can you have to do this you have to do that but there's no relationship and the parents are so busy in the interaction like in singapore we have a lot of absent parents not that they don't love the children but they are so busy in their work in their career and so they leave their raising of their children to you know a domestic helper and so there's no interaction with the child as a result of that the child do not have the sense of belongingness and sometimes because of the guilt of the parents not being there for the child and so whatever the child wants they will then splurge and indulge on the child then you have the disciplinarian the tiger mom you know very hard tough ages and very very hard cold it's like i say this you do this non-negotiable okay non-negotiable you do this you don't do that push uh so these are the disciplinarian rights sometimes the disciplinarian made the child feel that they are not loved all they hear from their parents are rules rules rooks and then you have the authoritative parents not authoritarian but authoritative they are they are not authoritarian like the disciplinarian they have soft ages but a solid call they know what they want some things are negotiable some things are not and i say no means no but i still love you i would like to i like to listen to you so these are the parents that possibly can you know set that boundaries by the same time relate better with the child so you have these four kinds of parents i like to use watch a video of this little boy so he was so cute he was so angry take a deep breath and count to four me you see all four kind of parents can be found in this matrix as well the authoritative parents are those who have the children to grow up i love you but there are some things that are not negotiable and the powerful parents on the path of children who grow up to be perfect people usually have permissive parents at home the fed up children or the fellow teenagers tend to have a disciplinarian at home and the mess of children than to have excellent parents at home so there are times we need to be a disciplinarian there are times we need to we have to take authority especially when the child is already admitted then sometimes we need to be the disciplinarian sometimes we need to meet that tough love and then we move back to the authoritative so studying who's supervising the children is a child from um is also very very so we gotta be creative spend more time foreign okay okay is this better now now it's okay yeah there was a sound that was um interfering i'm not sure where they come from maybe it comes from my computer or whatever by the way exercise is important you know his parents need to set an example um in terms of you know doing all these activities it's not telling the child to do it and the parents don't do it you know then maybe go out for a walk you go biking and all that more parents need to um need to set that example as well not only is your brain dumping out good a few good chemicals but exercise also helps our brain get rid of chemicals that make us feel stressed and anxious so we need to imagine and create with the children you know creative play like telling stories playing word games dressing up or drawing is good for your child's creative development it helps them learn how to experiment think and learn how to solve problems i think sometimes we can come together and play monopoly and uh lego or cassettes construction site these are very good tactile games and activity that you can have with your children sometimes get into pain it's all right if they get dirty it's fine you know asian parents tend to be a bit too sanitized you know we want everything to be cleaned it's okay if their hands get dirty they can always wash you know such activities you know it will be a lot more healthier than for them to get stuck with their devices so supervision uh having activities with the children can help especially with adolescents can help to take them away from their devices touch and play it's very important for us to actually touch our children and to make sure and heart them to make sure that you know that they have been loved there's a good father and son bonding time you know sometimes the father inside coming together and physically touching one another in this case he's carrying the baby at the back i think this is very important to the brain development there's there is this part of the brain called the posterior superior temporal cortex psdc or psds in some cases this is the part of the brain where it helps you know the person to have the ability to understand others perspectives and actions meaning i can empathize with you when this is working right so uh there's a lot of studies on on this you know mentalizing and role of posterior superior temporal uh skulls is sharing others embarrassment and and this this is important because when we are able to empathize with people then we are able to relate with one another better but when we are stuck with our devices this part of the brain will uh be blocked out because all they play all they do is to play with the computer game but they don't understand how others are feeling so abnormal development of the posterior superior temporal circuits a key processing for language biological emotions and social context may play a role in these deficits abnormal development may be too much screen time that the person the child will not uh go to learn how to interact and understand how you know what is the social norm recent studies suggest that posterior temporal lobe areas typically associated with visual processing of social cues also respond to interpersonal touch now this this is a very interesting study that when we touch the skin of a person you actually activate this part of the brain called your posterior temporal lobe uh superior posterior temporal lobe that means that means when you touch the skin of the person it actually triggered the part that they can feel that okay now i'm interrupting now i'm doing something you know this someone is another human being that i am i'm connecting with and they activate this part of the brain called the superior posterior temporal lobe and so you know touching playing with your games hugging your children you know is so important in developing this because um children who are addicted and given teenagers they somehow display similar symptoms as those who suffers from ase for this autism um they no longer are able to interact with another human being and there is a matter of concern but personal touch touching the child you know playing with the child touching with the child it's interesting um okay these are my three suggestions of what parents can do to break us yeah serious screen dependency all right yeah thank you very much dr fredko for your very enlightening talk um do we have questions if not i have questions [Music] we are starting to see my husband teenage boys who have physically attacked their fathers when the father tries to remove the devices partner you know when the child began to use violence i think without the coinage to come and help because um the child would not the child needed control to set their boundaries and calling the authorities of love it's not having the child i don't love you but i need you to correct this behavior and i cannot help you i would need the authorities to come in and and so when authorities come in you know try and go for mediation uh as a for family therapy and then that might help to resolve something so the parents the father we may need to adopt that you know the authoritative uh parenting style soft on the outside but firm on the inside um so that will then be able to relate because if the child is hard on the outside heart on the east inside and our parents also adopting a heart out and heart in you only have more flesh so sometimes we need to absorb this we need to absorb this you know and then we need to bring the person over flashing like this may not help but in this case when the child ends up in violence and beating up the father then i suppose you know the best remedy is to coin the authorities and then seek help from a mediator most parents will not report to police unfortunately yeah right this time when you want to think about the rules and relationship that parents should build up build their relationship with the children rather than just impose rules how do you think i'm looking at an alcohol full of uh school counselors here what kind of advice can the school counselors give to parents i've actually attended parent teacher meeting whereby the mother slaps the boy right across the face okay then when she sees the report card slapped across then there was another incident whereby the mother was shouting so loudly that we could hear her from downstairs and she was not using a mic i mean she was louder than me so what can school counselors as well as our school principals do to help in these situations i think in this case based on uh the story that you just shared i think it's the parents that need help not really not really the child yeah yeah yeah how do we first of all how do we tell them to go for help and i think uh the next problem is that we in penang we need to build up that help that support about family therapy and all that yes i think this calls for family therapy and they must be um you know people need to be trained in this area and then if the parents is the perpetrator we call it the ip the identified perpetrator and the child is now identified as the identified victim and so then we need to then do a motivational interview with the ip to tell them that they actually need help in raising their children because if your child is continuing to be a victim of your demands very soon you know when this child grows up uh you will not have this relationship with the child that the relationship is not going to be there anymore so um motivational interviewing skills of counsellors is very very important you cannot go to the mom and say you need help you need counsellor obviously the parents say who are you to tell me i need help you know so we need to soften that blow have that ability to help them to understand that they and get them to be motivated to seeking help so that they can they can have a better relationship with their child um you know nobody want to admit that i need help in public especially in the school setting so the principal come in and call the child to come in and say i've called the parents and said you need help i'm going to send you to the council obviously there will be there will be resistance so that was there's this thing called in counseling called motivational interviews so we need to be skilled in that so that we can motivate the ip into seeking help so that you know they do not embarrass the child anymore in public like this thank you right just to let um people know soon parenting training will be available in english mandarin uh pm and we are trying to set up a tamil uh parenting course as well this program will be organized by purdue bohan vanita muttera and the penang association of counseling and psychology all right uh so i will let i will make sure that you all are informed because maybe some school comes a school counselor from every every school may want to attend just to see how you can better deal with the parents right um we are dr lai and i are also looking into family running family therapy courses introduction to family therapy courses and that will be in next year and we will also inform you okay uh thank you thank you fred cecilia are you there yes i'm still here listening okay um you were talking about excessively controlling parents okay so what advice would you give the parents or what advice would you give the school counselors to work with parents oh this is a this is a tough question i think one should really have the opportunity for uh for them to test out their own boundary i think this is this is really important uh because if you cook if you do everything on behalf of your child and don't have the opportunity to test out what they can and cannot do there is also um a very trained a general trend in the uk right now especially for young people to promote uh adventurous kind of play because play even sm even the gps are actually um almost like refer the children to have played because of because of you know because of their screen time because a lot of people are not encouraging their children to play so that's a there's a lot of approach especially in in oxford for example there's a working group that deal with a play encouraging children to play in true adventurous play i mean this is quite uncontradictory because in you know at least i know in in some parts of malaysia you know people try to reduce the number of planes as children to be more like studies that they study which is good but i think they also should have time to play because true play it involves interaction with the other child and as i mentioned before it's also a place where they they develop social skills thank you so much questions so we have got to um can i invite the leon lindsey to stand up and also priscilla hall both these ladies are play therapists very interesting huh they teach okay they play with children and also they can actually have sessions with parent and child so you can do what's called filial play a lot of parents don't know how to play with their children ah okay so we got to the point whereby we need to teach parents to play with their children and we also need to teach parents how to relate with their teenagers and all right all of you here and and the others who are in like lecture theater too you are school counselors and you're placed in this position whereby you can actually become the mediator between parent and child it's a very important role i want to thank all of you for taking on this role uh do that fatima hassan from the penang education council know any of your training needs and we'll see how we can support you in your work this is the end of the webinar on kovit 19 pandemic and lockdown the impact on the mental health of adolescents and we like to thank cecilia and fred for their time and for their sharing their expertise we have really learned a lot okay and fred thank you for two new uh disorders huh one uh no was it normal phobia and screen dependency ah they can tell me the answer excellently remember okay right and thank you cecilia as well um there are requests of cecilia for your powerpoint from some lecturers if if you can share it then all right i do hope that you will send it to me yeah okay i will do that okay great uh fred as well right okay shall we dr thomas and professor anna are here thank you so much for the very generous all right offer for us to use open university without this contribution by wawasan we won't be able to have this all right us mental health forum thank you everyone and thanks to fatima had a team for organizing do you want to have another forum next year at wawasan ah excellent okay so dr thomas and anna you're stuck i already booked the whole phoenix here okay i'll book the i'm now going to book the speakers as well okay thank you good all the best thank you bye all right bye see you guys take care bye ,False,False,True,False
a-ofeOFVJBs,How the Brain Weighs Risk as Covid-19 Restrictions Ease | WSJ,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ,Wall Street Journal,2021-05-27T16:15:27Z,"Indoor dining, workout classes, concerts. These once commonplace events are coming back into daily life. But because of Covid-19, everyone now has a ...","- [Narrator] After more than a year of living with COVID-19
safety precautions, quarantines and social isolation, life is starting to return
back to pre-COVID normal. (dog barking) And that's forcing our brains to rethink how we behave socially. - Now we have to make individual decisions about what are environments in which we feel comfortable and what are environments where
we don't feel comfortable? - [Narrator] Should I eat indoors, go to that concert, wear my mask? A new mental toll is emerging. Many people are reevaluating
the habits they formed during the pandemic and reassessing how safe it is to resume once-normal activities. But why do some of us find it difficult to make these choices? It has to do with how our
brains process information. Let's take a look at what happens when you're finally reunited with friends and you're faced with a choice. (people murmuring) Mia is in her 40s,
healthy, fully vaccinated and is attending a
backyard barbecue party. But it starts to rain and the party moves indoors. Though CDC guidelines say the risk of infection is minimal
for people like Mia who are fully vaccinated,
she has to decide whether she feels
comfortable going indoors with a big group of people. - When we're making those
decisions in our brains, what we're really doing is
weighing three sets of factors. The first factor's almost
the easiest to understand and that's what risks am I willing to take when I understand the risks completely? - [Narrator] Making a
choice can happen quickly as several parts of
the brain work together to come to a decision. When people begin to move indoors, Mia faces a known risk: the chance she could
get exposed to COVID-19. Her prefrontal cortex
starts to assess that risk and the possible outcomes of her actions. The second is uncertainty aversion. Things that are ambiguous and obscure. That assessment happens
in part in the amygdala, which is associated with processing fear, distress or anxiety. The more ambiguous a situation is, the more likely someone is to be cautious. For Mia, the ambiguous risk is tied to how much she doesn't know. Is everyone vaccinated? How high are infection rates in town. Is there enough ventilation in the house? If she has a good handle
on all this information, her ambiguous risk is lower and she may opt in favor of the reward to go inside and continue spending time with her friends. The third factor is the habit system. That's located in the dorsal striatum, near the amygdala. - When we come into an environment that we've been to a million
times before the pandemic and we have some set of behaviors that we've learned to produce
in those environments, like walking up to
someone and hugging them, these habits are gonna also
influence our behavior. - [Narrator] Prior to the pandemic, Mia used to hang out at her
friends' homes regularly. But COVID changed a lot of her habits. She only saw people outdoors. - In each of these brain areas, there are millions of brain cells. And those brain cells
generate action potentials, these little electrochemical impulses with which they send
information from one part of the brain to another. - [Narrator] So as Mia weighs her choice, the brain is calculating
the risk and reward of going inside versus going home. In the final stage of decision making, information from multiple
parts of the brain is integrated to make a final choice. This includes the prefrontal cortex at the very front of the brain and the ventral striatum, a neighboring region to the
dorsal striatum and amygdala. - So there is where we
find groups of nerve cells that represent each of the options and have aggregated together
all of the different factors that are gonna influence how much you like or don't like doing that. And then in these areas,
in areas closely associated with them, that's where we
expect to see this competition where the group of cells
that is most active, the ones that are encoding
the more desirable option with greater electrochemical activity will sort of take control and lead us to the behavior that we've chosen to make. - [Narrator] But we're all different. Our personalities, age and
life experiences influence all three systems uniquely. So what Mia decides could be different from her friend Mark. - Some of us are more
concerned about ambiguity. Maybe because of prior life trauma. Some of us are more concerned about risk and some of us are more driven by habits. So there're individual differences in the way we weigh each of
these three sets of factors. And then, of course, we
all have different inputs from the world around us. - [Narrator] Another factor that could influence our decisions over the next few months may be related to trauma from the pandemic. Dr. Glimcher's actively studying how the events of the last
year can affect our choices. He says there's still
a lot of unknowns but. - We do know that while trauma
changes the way people decide and changes the way people behave, it makes them more ambiguity
averse, for example, it doesn't completely disorder the brain. The basic rules and structures for making decisions remain the same. It's the weightings that are different. - [Narrator] So for Mark,
who lost his grandfather to COVID-19, the decision
of whether to stay or leave the party could
be weighted differently due to that trauma. As the pandemic eases in
many parts of the world, it's unclear how trauma
and fear associated with the past year will continue to impact people's lives. But the brain is flexible. It constantly learns from experience and as we're testing our
boundaries of what feels safe and what doesn't, we're learning to adjust to all situations that now feel new. It's that learning that will
ultimately help us get back to a new normal. ",True,False,True,False
AlGytLNfSAA,Day 4: Unravel COVID-19 From a Systems Thinking Lens,UC9lIjdIBVE0k8qkqL3auJ2A,NUS ISS,2020-09-19T09:41:19Z,"COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the gaps in every countries' infrastructure and society. As we deal with one threat of the crisis, we are quickly overwhelmed by ...",hi everyone i'm brian from the smart health leadership center at nus iss so together with burnham and linguei we'll bring you on a journey today to unravel covet 19 through a system thinking lens in the next 15 minutes or so we'll have you have a broad introduction to what system thinking is and explore the phenomenons that we are seeing in the behaviors that we're seeing in the real world through system thinking through archetypes mental models and a kinetic cycle before we do that we would like to take some time for all of us to reflect on kovit how did we manage uh kovit through the outbreak so far who were the people that influenced us and what were some of the programs infrastructure or objects that actually helped us cope with staying healthy and staying safe or which organizations played an active role in keeping us safe during this cobit period so if i can trouble everyone to take out your phones and scan the qr code or go to pull ev.com and enter iss 2020 and from there put in some of these right so what what did you do in order to cope with kobit 19. can we do that okay let's see what are some of the responses that are coming in [Music] i think some of the typical things that that most of us uh start to do is to start to wear a mask i see people starting to stay at home having takeaways rather than eating out uh in in the public right gaming that's this is a good one i think that a lot of uh youth especially um because they are unable to interact with their peers now they they go on to gaming in order to stay is to stay connected right so i think that really helps with mental resilience um family yeah sure family is also something that really influence our behavior um we'll talk a little bit more about that in a short while zoom yeah so i think a lot of us are starting working from home and i think this is the thing that we really rely on these days i so see cooking and things like that okay great so i'm gonna move on to the next slide so we know that mask wearing and social distancing does really have play a big role in keeping us safe from kovit staying home is also something that really keeps us safe the behavior of staying home is also influenced by other things such as you know if we are monitoring our own temperature regularly you'll know that okay maybe i'm not feeling so well today and i should really stay home um if i'm also uh have a company policy to say that i have to work from home that also helps me to stay home right if i have a senior that that's at home then you know i might be that might influence my behavior in terms of social distancing and as well as perhaps i would like to also stay home rather than exposing my family members to seniors at home to to greater risk right these behaviors are also impacted by other things right so how many community cases do we have out in the community is something that if there's more cases out there then for sure there's a higher risk um and how do we mitigate that as as how the government put in place is to have contact tracing right so if contact tracing is done well then there'd be less community cases in the public and therefore a lower risk at the same time there was also traced together and safe entry that's been implemented that also helps with the context racing efforts temperature screenings out in the public also keep us aware of our well-being right so company regulations also plays a part things like mass distribution having that availability of masks given to everyone that also promotes uh mask wearing and therefore also mitigate the risk if we zoom out a little bit more then we also see that there are other factors that are out there as well such as mom advisories uh to the companies in order for all companies to add her to similar uh regulations um and and then comes down to opening and closing of borders right so if we open our borders there'll be more people coming in more people that are perhaps may or may not be adhering to the quarantine or stay home notice and that will also influence the number of people with covet and in the community and ultimately we also look at the broad picture in terms of the singapore economy um you know economy will then affect whether if we open our borders or not so some other uh cities for example in jakarta um the way that the the balance over here right between people's livelihood and the risk of getting coded unfortunately in some cities they have decided to open the borders and start business much earlier just because of people's likelihood is at stake and they rate that as a greater uh impact to the population than covet so they have to make that choice so as you can see that um the risk of i think covet 19 contracting covert 19 really sits within a broad system of interacting factors so when in system thinking when we talk about systems we're not talking about i.t systems and such but rather we are referring to a group of interacting entities right that each of these things would cascade and and have an effect on one another and ultimately this interaction would amounts to a certain result in this case the result would be the risk of of contracting kovit right and in a system you can also look at it at multiple different levels at a micro level is something that perhaps what we do and influence us directly the relationship that we have with our family our choices as individuals right if you bring it to the muscle level then you look at some of the organizational decisions that help keep us safe or what is happening within our immediate community what are the choices that people take whether to to avoid or to go to with crowd crowded places right so that's at a muscle level and at a macro level that we look at at the nation level economy level you know what are some of these factors that actually influence the entire system so what is system thinking system thinking is a holistic approach for us to analyze a system uh all these different interrelated relationships that we see in order to appreciate the bigger picture in order to make better decisions right it allows us to look beyond the trees and understand and look at the entire ecosystem of the forest rather than focusing on just the trees now we are able to then look into what is this ecosystem and what affects one another it also allows us to appreciate the complete picture and make more sound decisions such as if you're for example if you are making policies as an organization or if you're making policies for the public from the ministry level then you might want to appreciate you know what are all these different factors how are they influencing one another before we create a policy that might influence many many people fundamentally why do we want to do system thinking is so that we can have a better understanding of how the system works and get some insights as to how it operates and therefore be able to find some leverage and make better decisions with this i would like to hand the time over to punam that would then bring you through more examples of kovit 19 and how to look at it from a system thinking perspective when i'm pleased thank you brian so brian has given an introduction to system thinking in the context of covet 19. so let me uh so brian has given the introduction to systems thinking in the context of uh covet 19. let me go into one aspect of covet 19 next slide please oh sorry yes yeah one aspect of kovit 19 which is the wearing of mars so in the ideal world ideally governments would encourage the wearing of mars people will wear masks sorry people will buy masks and people will then wear the mask but in the real world do you agree that things go as smoothly and as simply as this simple linear flow so we'll open up the pole ev and can you go in to just answer yes or no in the real world is it so simple so straight forward [Music] just ah okay so uh i think the wow do you agree that the real world is so straightforward everybody uh the the government says uh where mars uh we can just go out and buy the mass and straight away start wearing masks and everybody will follow and by and and everybody will be very obedient and follow and wear masks accordingly okay so the answers coming in shows that the majority feel that the ideal world doesn't work in such a simple manner so maybe we go to the next slide okay as you can see the majority um 60 also feel that the real world is not so straightforward let me go to the next slide yeah okay uh so the next slide is actually the next poll so what happened what do you think happened in the real world well uh were there sufficient marks uh were the prices stable uh did people follow the recommendation of the government to wear mars when you're outside oh he already have one answer of course not uh okay so what happened what were the prices like uh okay now yes agreed uh generally okay now um were the price how are the prices like when uh this thing initially started uh when kovit 19 started people wanted to wear mars uh how was the prices uh was it stable was it were you able to buy a must simply go to a shop and be able to buy a mask okay so we have many answers uh some attributed to singapore's culture there was a need to do some uh quota of mars that were given out free the government needed to impose certain penalties to make people comply prices increase because the demand came up and of course there were mass sellers out to try to do profiteering et cetera yeah so okay let me move on to the next slide then i'll let the pro ev be stopped first okay so um yeah all right so why so we realize now that the real world is not so straightforward it's not uh the government says wear masks you can go out and straight away buy the mask and wear the mask so why is the world complex one of the reasons is that in a real world when an action happens there will be reaction so for example demand supply gap when the mass requirement came out either from our own individual perspective when kobe 19 started we felt we should have a need to buy mass then there was a demand supply gap and then the prices will increase and then there should be a reaction normally the manufacturer will increase the supply so as to meet the demand and the prices should come back and stabilize but the real world is not so straightforward there'll be other impact coming in the mass factory capacity you'll notice there's a two strokes at the action reaction line that indicates a delay yeah i'll explain more in the uh in the subsequent slides and so overall because of all these various actions and reactions uh the real world becomes much more complex so i'll go into some of this in the later slides the other reason why the real world is complex is that of human actors in a complex system so i think if i ask you the question are people easy to understand most of you will say no are we able to predict their actions easily again all of you will shake your head right so this is the one of the key reasons why complex systems are so difficult to predict to analyze to design good interventions for but there are tools and techniques to help so one of the tools and technique is system archetypes because uh some of the uh experts observed the complex world and found that there are some common patterns of behavior in this complex world and that and this common patterns take into account actions and reactions and also take into account common behavior of people uh we won't have time of course to go into all these system archetypes but i'll just give you a flavor of through some examples so the first system archetype that we'll go into is feedback with delay so this applies to the price and supply of mass basically what happened of the price uh in terms of the price increase is similar to a thermometer they're slow to react so how does a thermometer work if it works properly like in this picture you set the temperature to 19.5 degrees then a proper a proper working thermometer may let the temperature go up a little bit to say 20 degrees and then it will start blowing more cold air and then the temperature will come down and maybe it overblows the cold air and it drops to below 19.5 to 19 and then the thermometer will then stop the aircon that cold air so that it will stabilize back again to 20 degrees right so it will fluctuate a little bit but not much but if the thermometer is slow to react then this is what happens uh when the temperature goes up above 20 the thermometer still doesn't do anything it goes all the way up to 25 then the aircon starts to blow the cold air then when it becomes cold below 19 it still doesn't do anything it waits for the aircon to be very cold at 15 then it stops the cold air so this is similar to what is happening for the issue of mass there was a mass shortage prices increase normally the factories will increase capacity but they are slow to react why why are they slow to react because most of them in the initial stages of kovi 19 would have maxed out their capacity already the only further way to increase capacity was for them to order new machinery and bringing new machinery in actually takes a long time all right and of course during that delay the prices increase even further increased to such an extent that what happened i think during the pole ev some of you mentioned the profiteering took place people bought the mass and then resold it on carousel for prices as high as uh 288 dollars for just one box right the other aspect uh another example of system archetype that can help you analyze the situation is this uh archetype called escalation and the best explanation i can find reading to kovya 19 is from the governor of new york state in the united states who is quite well recognized as one of the more effective politicians in the u.s handling the kovi 19 situation so i'll let him explain what he did but look at the bizarre situation we wind up in every state does its own purchasing so new york is purchasing california's purchasing illinois is purchasing we're all trying to buy the same commodity literally the same exact item so you have 50 states competing to buy the same item we all wind up bidding up each other and competing against each other where you now literally will have a company call you up and say well california just outbid you it's like being on ebay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator and you see the bid go up because california bid illinois bid florida bid new york bids california rebids that's literally what we're doing i mean how inefficient and then fema gets involved and fema starts bidding and now fema is bidding on top of the 50. so fema is driving up the price what sense does this make so uh the all the 50 states of the u.s are fighting for each other for medical supplies uh in this case it's talking about the ventilator but it also applies to mars and then after the 50 states start bidding with each other the federal government comes in and also bids against the 50 states so that is uh one example of escalation that happened during this covet 19 period the last system archetype i'll give an example of is fixes that fail or fixes that have side effect so in the complex world we would prefer that whatever fix we put in will solve the problem once and for all but unfortunately most in a practical world most fixes will have some side effects and the fix that we had for kovit 19 in many countries was a lockdown and lockdown does help but unfortunately it does have side effects and the side effect is a big recession that is happening around the world and imf sees it as the worst recession since the great depression all right so and there is now even a phrase that is used to describe this fixed with a side effect and it is lives versus livelihood all right so system archetypes basically can help you uh through this taste of these three examples i hope you can see that system archetypes can help you analyze common patterns and that will help you predict and hopefully avoid issues all right the next technique that i'll quickly cover is that of mental models basically the human aspect and one way to have a shortcut to understand how people behave is to first put yourself in their shoe what is their group's shared thinking and view all right so let's look at one situation when the authorities ask people to wear masks and it made it compulsory did everyone follow i think there was one group that did not follow and this little clue will probably give you the answer i think most of you who looking at a clown at the crown will immediately say it's the people who consider themselves sovereign all right they do not follow and if you know the mental model of such people uh then in that same news article by the straits times they explain the mental model the mental model of such people is that they feel that government authorities police are all people who should not be governing me i am a sovereign i am totally independent all right so that is their mental model and knowing this mental model you then have to think which uh measures will be effective for such people with more publicity help more education help i think you'll know straight away it doesn't help because it is already their attitude so you probably have to look for some other measures in place all right okay so uh yep i've covered this so now i will hand over to linui we'll go into the connection cycle linguine uh thank you bonam okay hi i'm lin hey and i'll be taking you through the canary cycle okay so what you see over here is uh essentially the carnarine cycle and it's essentially a conceptual framework that is used to help in decision making based on the nature of the problem okay so let's start from the bottom right over here okay so if you explain a problem and you realize that the cause and effect is very obvious okay then um then the way the way to solving it is basically to sense and categorize the problem quickly and then respond based on the best practices okay if the relationship between the cause and effect uh requires some form of analysis or expert or knowledge then this problems are uh is what is in the complicated space okay and the way that we usually go about dealing with it is to sense and identify what is the scope of the problem before we analyze and then respond to it okay for complex issues okay like what bruno has been explaining okay this is where the cause and effect is not obvious at all it's very hard to find out what are they uh exactly all about okay and usually for this kind of cases is when the relationship can only be perceived once you sit down in height and then reflect upon it in hindsight okay so how we usually go about dealing with this kind of complex issues is that we try to probe okay probe around and see what are the patterns and you know uh scenarios that come out of it before we try to sense where exactly is the real problem that we are trying to address and then that's where we come up with the uh response plan and and deal with it okay if relationship between the cause and effect doesn't exist so um it is usually what we say that you know this problem is uh chaotic okay so then the the way to deal with it is essentially to act fast to establish self-control okay sense what is working or not working and then respond to it accordingly okay so a question for you to think about okay where do you think covet 19 pandemic would lie within this canary cycle okay i would place a kovite 19 panda make somewhere in between the complete uh complex and complicated space okay why okay copy 19 is actually a complicated scenario because it is not a total stranger we have dealt with you know similar uh viruses in the past like sas and mers so it is so many countries are more or less ready and all they need to do is to activate their disease outbreak protocols and then to manage the spread okay however it is still complex because of its unprecedented infectivity okay i mean we have never ever met uh such a virus with such a high infectivity that you know it takes a few weeks before you even see a symptom so you know by the time you know someone you know exhibits a symptom they probably have gone around within that two weeks you know probably infecting a lot more people and that kind of scenario is very hard to predict and manage so this is where the complexity comes in okay so for this kind of responses government needs uh to be able to be very agile and then keep on probing uh you know probing what exactly is this uh scenario like how has it developed and then respond to it accordingly so the approach here rather than saying that it's a probe sense and respond okay on most parts we can follow the complicated uh quadrant where it's about sets analyze and respond but you know government needs to keep on reassessing the effectiveness by probing around and then have that you know um experimental approach to see what really works and then uh reevaluate again in time to come and see you know if it's something that you should continue or is there a need to change their approach accordingly okay so let's take a look at how some countries have fed so far okay so over here you see uh this is some charts on on the government's response tracker by uh john hawkins uh csse um okay so over here the line represents a seven day rolling average of the number of new cases per day okay and the color that you see over here essentially uh shows the level of restrictions imposed on the population so blue being no restriction and rate being a total lockdown okay so let me start from the left okay with sweden okay sweden took a very lenient approach in managing the spread of covet because they want to actually cultivate some form of hurt immunity okay and largely the decision was because at that point in time the science was saying that you know um kobe 19 isn't very lethal so that is why the government decided to take that approach but you know given time we realized that you know the situation hasn't really worked out for them and but the sad thing is that the government has not reacted to the new developments of kovit 19 and we can see how the spread has increased exponentially with you know right now close to a thousand new cases per day okay on the other hand germany has been doing a fantastic job in curbing the spread okay they actually took a very methodical approach in um you know in managing the spread through aggressive testing and safe distancing okay a large part of their success story lies in the fact that the government uh you know really scrutinized the spread while managing the easing of the restrictions with time to come okay and you know they uh and they did exactly what you know the carnavaline cycle was actually trying to say where you know in this kind of scenario where you know it's something for the first time and you know we have that kind of infectivity and you know it's very complex in nature um you know they follow the probing process of actually re-evaluating you know whether something works or not and then they they have a very agile approach of you know saying okay this might not work this might work okay should we continue or actually you know can we do something better and it's actually that's what they did and we can see how you know the numbers starting uh start to deep down while you know our restrictions are being eased at the same time okay so okay we know that you know certain measures work you know such as wearing a mask and doing a safety sensing so but then you know at the end of the day execution is what is what uh matters right and we can see that for some very interesting examples like us for example um for the population you know a significant number of them has little trust in science and government which actually makes it very difficult for all the governing states to impose which uh you know to tell the population and say hey you need to wear masks you need to stay you know one to two meters apart from each other so because of that um you know implementations of certain policies that the government tries to push down can be heavily uh affected by all this what we call non-deterministic factors you know such as social norms you know um family structure or even you know fatigue level of the population so again you know reiterating the point that you know when it comes to really um complex scenarios you know um it is uh very important that we take a very probing uh approach and then keep on reevaluating what really works and what not and be prepared to you know face certain forms of failure and say you know hey this is not really working you know it's time to take the approach and make the stand as early as possible especially when we deal with pandemic when you know life as uh life is at stake okay so essentially we come to the end of our segment okay so essentially what we have done is to give an introduction of what systems thinking is and to give you a bit of a flavor of what are the some of the techniques that we cover during our course uh to you know analyze what are some of the complex systems out there and then to introduce certain ways to manage these kind of systems okay so a little introduction uh before we end uh we are from the smart health leadership center and we are uh established in 2015 with the vision of transforming future experience of health through data technology and innovation okay so we do provide uh you know a professional diploma in smart health leadership which comprises of this five different causes over here with system thinking uh covering the complexity in uh you know transformational efforts in organizations so if you have uh you know interest in finding out more about how you know how to deal with this kind of of systems especially even within your organization itself you know do consider signing up for our courses all right okay so with that uh we thank you for your time and now we invite uh bhunam and brian back out on stage to answer any of the questions you might have so uh in the meantime please feel free to add any questions and we'll be ready to answer them okay okay okay while waiting for the questions to come in maybe we can explain a little bit more about smart health so smart health is application of digital assets as well as the related disciplines such as design thinking business process re-engineering and so on analytics etc to enable a more effective uh health uh system all right and helps us by health system we are talking about not just the acute health care uh which is things like hospitalization and all that but also uh the well-being overall well-being uh of uh the citizens uh and residents of uh singapore so uh it will cover areas including uh services uh etc right so for our professional diploma course uh it's targeted both as uh at healthcare professionals uh as well as those in the social service sector and also those in the tech industry are providing uh health or wellbeing related services and products okay we have some questions coming in uh maybe uh brian you can suggest uh sure so one question from kansas what software is available for us to map out a system okay the actually without having to spend a lot of money uh we advocate uh in in fact uh try not to use software initially when you're starting this thing uh what we normally do in our courses is we will use the good old post-it notes because that allows for learning through all your senses and uh also the quicker uh a ability to reorder your post-it notes to uh analyze the system and so on and and to design the interventions right but subsequently you can go into uh software uh you can start off with just vizio uh what we can't currently use is miro it's uh ideal for the current kovic 19 situation where most of us have to work from home uh so it's a team sharing whiteboard where you can do all this type of uh whiteboard activities like post-it notes etc uh on the shed uh device itself okay brian any other questions brian can take the one on uh design thinking and how it's related to all this um so for that i think that once we identify a certain behavior a mental model that's out there from there then we are able to understand these people a little bit better develop some archetypes or personas around them and from there then we can explore how might we design better services or solutions in order to mitigate the situation on the ground so i think that's where uh design thinking can be applied after we have um first understood the and the big picture yeah so i think that's just one way that the design thinking can be put into play together with system thinking okay so maybe i'll take this question uh since you know human behaviors are unpredictable how is systems thinking different from uh scenario planning uh i would say actually they are more or less the same essentially it's just taking on that lens of systems thinking uh in planning out the scenarios because uh i guess that's what you have guessed by now um you know we are affected by um many many different uh variables and even uh uh conditions and constraints so there is a need to you know at least uh take a step back and appreciate you know what is really affecting all of us in uh in any scenario and then you know plan out what are the response plan from there accordingly so um yeah so i would say that actually system thinking is quite integral in planning out scenarios so we have a question here on the profit program it asks how long does it take to complete the smart health profit we run two profit sessions every one that starts around march the five courses will end close to mid of the year in june july and then you'll start a capstone project after that that that is if you're coming in for a public program um the second run starts about end of august september uh run to the end of the year and you'll start your capstone project at the start of the next year and that project also lasts for about six months to the middle of the year so i guess uh if you're coming in as a public right you are it's in a stackable format you can choose when you would like to take um the five courses and once you have completed the five then you can then proceed to your your capstone to complete it in six months um so yeah it can take um whenever you're available i would think depending on your availability of work um for people who are interested in other forms of a program in terms of professional conversion say if you're coming in from a different industry and you would like to do transformation work within the health industry for that for the pcp program entire program can can be covered within six months so for example the upcoming one starts in september and you can take all five courses in a relatively small uh period of time one after another and at the same time do your capstone project and you'll be able to complete the entire course in six months of course that the pcp has got different requirements we'll talk a little bit more about that uh later today at 1pm so if you're interested uh do tune in later on okay so if one question maybe bruno can take this okay so now that we've identified the type of you know problem through the canaveral framework you know how do we actually go about solving them these problems uh so as linguist uh presented earlier the first is to identify the different elements of the problem you're having some may be simple then that is quite straightforward to solve the second complicated so the first thing first is you have to understand that what you see as one problem may be actually different types of problem and each type of problem you must use the correct approach to solve it so simple is usually very straightforward complicated would need a process of analysis and usually you will need an expert in that particular domain area to help you with that analysis so um so in the hospital in the normal healthcare setting when you need treatment for your illness you go to a doctor the doctor will then use a method of doing hypothesis getting some data of the symptoms that you have uh doing hypothesis of what based on those symptoms what could be wrong then from those hypotheses they will know that okay if you have uh covet 19 what do i need to what if i think you have cova-19 what other additional data i need to have in order to confirm whether this hypothesis is true or not so usually complicated problems go by this method of hypothesis and data and using the data to confirm which hypothesis is correct and you need an expert in that domain area for it then when it comes to complex situations as what let me say usually even if you are expert it may not help that much because a lot of the things are novel a lot of the things are non-deterministic you cannot predict and guarantee that your analysis is correct that your solution will work hundred percent so a lot of it will then go into the agile cycle of probing getting data confirming whether things are working or not and then pivoting to change accordingly to something else that may work better right and then finally in a chaotic situation what we normally do is that in a chaotic situation people don't have the set the the sense of mind to help solve any problem they are all stunned by the chaos like in some emergency situations some of the uh some countries were overwhelmed by the cover 19 situation the hospitals were flew were full the mocks couldn't handle mortuaries couldn't handle the number of deaths that were happening so in that state what you need is more to stabilize every people's everyone's mind so that then they can move on to concentrate on the problem so in a chaotic situation is usually strong leadership uh making assurance to people gaining trust and then once they have this then they have the sense of mind to look at the problem and usually the problem would then become a complex or complicated problem and they will solve it accordingly okay so maybe i'll take one of the questions okay uh has any new project tech being done you know invented during the kovit 19 situation with systems thinking to improve care of patients or curb spread or improve living hoods uh i would say during this time you probably realize that there's a lot of initiative that has gone on uh whether or not it's system thinking it's not i wouldn't say that it's very specific to you know system seeking uh methodology but i would say the thought process of coming out with these solutions you know uh when and whether is it you know uh realize true technology or certain uh uh scenario planning for example uh all these had some form of systems thinking uh considerations in mind so one example is perhaps you know in the social care space you realize that you know once everyone is locked up at home you know with uh cis distancing and whatnot you realize that a lot of our social problems start to exhibit itself whether is it through stress or through the fact that we are just isolated from each other so um i would say that uh the agency of integrated care has more or less stepped up to you know realize that there are all these different problems that are happening within uh within the society and then what they are trying to do is actually to link up different uh social service agencies and to to more or less better deliver and basically to connect all that and better deliver their services to the people who need them so i would say that during this uh the time this is one example where it's uh aic actually um you know think of you know all the problems at some point ecosystem and then cause it uh and then carefully planning out you know if i would um you know how if i were to deliver this would i be affecting something else or if let's say you know for example um you know uh elderlies in the rental flats for example they have um you know they may have some form of social issue which is one thing but then then again the bread and butter you know of you know getting food every day might be an issue as well so rather than to say that you know i i have two you know agencies um you know providing you know services for each of these problems they actually think they actually gone out their ways to actually combine those services together and basically you know deliver those two services with only one touch point for example yeah and then other things would probably be you know true um you know certain tech technologies that we have uncovered such as you know trace together for example i mean we know that um you know people might not be uh very um compliant in reporting all their locations and every every step and time so you know part of the part of their i guess design thinking uh um appreciation is that you know why not just design something that you know is able to do all this automatically but then again you know it has to tie in with the rest of the infrastructure that is available in uh at that point in time so i would say um although you know these are tech solutions maybe realize through you know technology but you know the way that the design had uh went through some form of systems thinking considerations maybe it can i can add to to that so uh if you look at the latest one that has been put in place just last month um people that are coming in from overseas now have to wear a wearable when they're on stay home notice that actually clearly shows the appreciation of system thinking when they came up with that solution why because we know that we can't close our borders forever we know that in order for the economy to stay vibrant in singapore we have to eventually open and start working with our neighboring countries and and start the communications right with different places people will have to come over to singapore so that is in in effect right understanding the system entirely and how in order to protect the people in singapore you know we have to bond this wearable solution in order to better track them uh and make sure that people are on safe home notice stays at home uh rather than going out there and contributing to the cases in the community um so they i understood the system and therefore they then put it put this in place similar for for both um traced together and um safe entry right so those two solutions do not directly impact the risk of covet but they impact the number of community cases that are out there so again it's the appreciation of this entire situation as a system and coming from the perspective and coming up with these solutions [Music] okay name putnam can take this question can a problem move from one canary category to another yes so it can move from any category to any category uh so and the author of the connection framework itself says that the even from simple it can drop off into chaotic situation because some problems seem simple but through necklace and so on things may fester underneath and it then erupts and it becomes a chaotic situation and then what may seem complicated initially uh may also uh turn out to be something new because uh your initial virus if it wasn't kovya 19 or something else the initial virus could have been very straightforward to deal with as long as the doctor analyzed the symptoms he can get some medication that will cure it but viruses are part of a complex system they evolve so it could end up that particular virus evolved into something equivalent to covalent 19 and then it will move the situation from complicated into a complex situation right so maybe i think now we only have time for one last question sure [Music] any software to identify positive people from long distance like 30 50 meters no but i think we'll be talking more about digital solutions and transformation that we are seeing later at 2pm so if you're interested in more of the digital solution uh aspects of things and how digital transformation will be shaped in the coming years do stay tuned and come to attend the session at 2 p.m we'll talk more about uh digital transformation with relations to covet at that time so i think that is almost all the time that we have there's a qr code on the screen um maybe you could take a scan at that and leave us some comments for the events today thank you so much for joining us that's all the time we have for now thank you and see you soon thank you you ,True,False,True,False

Isn't studying abroad supposed to be all rainbows and ...,oh right with a resin well I had enjoy a heavy bomb or a competitor [Music] okay I'm Kristin nice to meet y'all I am 22 Oh going 23 this year and I'm a mana student in my current my final yeah yeah my name is Michael I'm from University of Melbourne I'm from faculty of medicine dentistry and Health Sciences hi I'm Kimberly and I am studying in the University of Melbourne and I'm doing my business a class name is Wayne I'm from Monash Faculty of Business and Economics the last time I cry I can't remember but I'm quite shy know why I cried about it who was that probably just being vanilla new year and like having not really having my close friends around me compared to by being back home yeah I just trying to deal with being alone and I've cried a lot this year even though it's only February you know yeah maybe I probably doing anything I guess yeah that time I was in quite a bad place I was seeing a girl and we recently broke up and from there onwards like I just spiral downhill picked up a lot of that heavy salami we heard a lot of people like most of my relationships with my friends were strained as well yeah I quite quite often and easily so actually the last time I cut was just like two days ago yeah my best friend was in Singapore told me that her mum got me to a hospital so yeah that was right so like my mom has like stomach cancer and I actually she's been like battling it for two years so it's like kind of like an ongoing thing with which like has been going on for quite long already but then like um recently like the Mamas are going to a lot of pain at home and like she just I said she couldn't like to get anymore so I decided to bring her to like the A & E and like that they found it she has like pneumonia and I think it was quite hot like receiving the news from her truth that cost like um like Julie's two years from like the beginning it's like I was kind of like there in Singapore and I was like oh okay I can like go visit you now or like you need anything I can like buy food for you but in like this time when she told me is like I'm just here and all I could like do it like you planet-x yeah and I asked for updates it was in 2017 when I came back for college I'm cleated so this I'm doing Trinity I stay in the city so and I moved to Clayton was a big shock to me because it was very quiet at night there was nothing to do and Baghdad knows I can make any foreign kitchen so my friends went back in the open yet so the first few days I actually cried myself to sleep there was quite an interesting experience because um I felt very lonely those my friends wouldn't back the time difference then was three hours so while I was trying to sleep my friends or bagging a piping dinner my sister wasn't in Albany yet so I had no one to know to find a night and the real key I would say that crying is just partly yeah pretty much yeah I mean obviously there are some moments that you get disappointed because you don't get really what you want all the time but I would say mostly I'm quite a happy person now yeah I think I'm like okay like um because it's to quite reach done yeah but yeah I think I saw want to do okay yeah of course [Music] I think now I have this very healthy habit of journaling when I feel like  or when I have like oh and I feel like something wow this journal if it gets ready if it's to a point where like I actually feel sad then I just cry and I think lately I've been crying a lot because I think a lot of people just generally don't want to cry cause they're like oh crying it's just like being weak so I would try my best not to cry but I think now and nowadays it's like when I feel sad I just tried to let myself cry and it feels really good yeah I guess it's like when you get drunk you don't really think about your feelings yeah but I guess that was not very healthy so high climbed out of that horse mostly like having better coping mechanisms I started seeing a counselor I even went to a GP to get a mental health care plan so I could see a psychiatrist as well I know not really psychiatry sorry a psychologist yeah so I actually helped me work through my feelings back then I think for me I try to like talk it out as much as I can but personally I'm quite like introverted so there are times where I don't feel like talking it out and I do like just okay like that myself okay - now I'm just gonna like stay and on my sheets and like cry and like eat ice cream and it's just watch Netflix but yeah I tried to like make time for myself to like feel like yeah [Music] pretty much got used together so the first few days were rough then after all sort of got used to the fact that was going to live in Clayton with uhm yeah so staying in Clayton was a bit difficult because I'm quite active so I don't like to stay at home I like to go out but there's nothing to do so I just had to make some lifestyle changes I guess so I did was I would I used to go to the city in the day so just take the train all the way just spend a day in the city and it cuts come back at night and after a while probably like like one week my friend started coming back so I had more people to hang out with [Music] if you are alone overseas I think it's a really good opportunity for you to as cliche as it sounds just find yourself find your thing find what works for you and I realize you have to do things like you can't just like be alone and not do anything like that it's not productive and if you do that you kind of like you yeah you you don't know what to do with ourselves so you have to give yourself like something to do work exercise do something and you know if you have to cry we have to I guess the most important thing is like to have friends around you there are very good support mechanism family members as well I think the best is not just just keeping your feelings bottled up and to share with others like what you're feeling at the moment some people have definitely been through the kind of things that you've been true so they can give you quite good advice as well yeah mmm I think it's like quite important night not to be so hard on yourself like comedian is like not easy it can be like really fun and it can be like really bad on certain days as well and try not to compare yourself with like others cause like yes like a lot of people come here to like study but not everyone's journey is different yeah [Music] definitely talk to someone about it because even though this are on the time difference in the distance in what not right at least your friends are still available to text so at least if someone to talk to you can always your feel better if you talk to someone yeah hi guys I'm a service or char representing our video producers team fluent in da thank you for watching your video I hope you liked it do remember to follow us on our social media and also leave a comment down below on what other videos you like to watch next see you next time bye Cordova cuz crash-landing you um the new Netflix series just ender I don't wat to do in my life now because the female lead and Maori are so handsome everything so yeah I cried every episode but yeah after you in a Korean drama used to know what to do afterwards really ,False,True,False,False
6iC0aDFReNc,Teh Tarik With Walid - Episode 20: Sarah Bagharib,UCtM5-vboYHOEzTdsQhUnnpQ,Walid Abdullah,2021-06-11T13:12:39Z,The person at the centre of the controversy involving the People's Association and usage of her wedding picture shares her thoughts on multiracialism in ...,hello everyone so welcome to episode 20 of the turret with walid it's a special episode because it's an issue based episode it was somewhat impromptu because i i asked our our guest uh sarah bahrib only four days ago probably uh around there and it's basically due to the incident that that i will talk about in a while uh while i wait for her to come on and before that so today is the 20th episode so every season hi hi via cross so every every epis every season will have 10 episodes so tomorrow we'll have another episode with professor chiron george discussing the state of the media in singapore so that's episode 21 season 3 just for marketing purposes and we will have a couple more in the next week one of them with ng but i don't wanna i don't wanna uh jump the gun yet so so today we will have a discussion with uh miss sarah miss sarah bahari and it is essentially on the incident that went viral i'm just looking at her instagram profile her her post uh about the incident about the people's association incident uh he got about what seventeen thousand probably seventeen uh likes yeah so 17 800 likes that's that's phenomenal right numbers that i can only dream of so uh obviously the incident struck a chord so what exactly happened she will share more so let me just set up the the session first so essentially there was a there was a banner uh in radio mass smc single member constituency and uh there was a standee there of sarah and her husband during their wedding so that was the wedding picture and somehow the faces were cut off uh and then there was a big uh picture of the mp behind wishing slamat hariraya to the constituency constituents and in the constituency so if you are familiar with your own constituencies you will know that every single constituency in singapore has a version of it in some you see uh a bit more of an obnoxious display i guess by the parliamentarians on on whichever party and you see their faces and uh uh their pictures are much bigger than others so i've i've been around uh the island and i've seen there's this variation so for some uh i i know for speaker tan chonjin uh for instance he's you know he's very media savvy social media service so he's the best in his constituency usually with him and some residents no in tampines it's not the case if you see you will see the five mps their pictures are huge uh uh everywhere almost everywhere so so that part that part is somewhat normal or has been normalized however the usage of the wedding picture first of all is not appropriate for hariraya and second of all it was done with without her permission so she she wrote something which was really quite uh quite eloquently written i think uh adequately articulately written yes so beyond king is everywhere in our estate but not just not just him all five mps uh in tampines and you see uh he she sarah was basically saying that uh she used some some really strong words and she said that there were theatrical elements for clownery for an amusement referring to the wedding picture being inappropriately uh used at least it was culturally insensitive and the the people's association eventually uh apologized uh so i want to read uh the pa's apology first and then we can discuss this later and i don't want to misquote them so the they said that there can be no excuse for breach of copyright so this is the mp saying there can be no excuse for the breach of copyright and the declaration should not have been allowed uh to be put up pa said that the vendor so they apologized uh and then pa said the vendor came up with the concept and designed for the decorations unfortunately in doing so they downloaded and used missouri burger ribs photo from an online source and then used it for a cut out standy so it seems it seems that the apology was shifting the blame to the vendor right it was shifting the blame to the vendor so i i i thought that since okay since sarah is that in the thick of things and this incident is not just about sarah and a bridge of privacy if it was about that i wouldn't ask her i wouldn't ask her on but this is more than that it's about multiculturalism it's about accountability in some some way so that's why i thought let's hear from the horse's mouth and i think sarah i don't know whether you are on you can hashtag sorry not sorry i think what sharia is saying is i think shana's uh said as well i think a lot of people were thinking that well i think that was so i definitely have my own thoughts on on the apology as well can you hear me okay i i can't hear you very well can you hear me okay i can't i can hear you okay so as i was saying i uh we are having this session at 10 pm uh because sarah puts her daughter to sleep at 9pm yeah she's a good parent so my son is still awake for a couple of hours i have my husband she helped put her to sleep a bit more while i brace myself for this so okay okay so firstly i think uh just personally i think i would like to thank you for not just this session but for putting yourself out there i think not many people who have done done that and i think it really sparked a good conversation amongst uh singaporeans among many singaporeans at least so thank you for that and i always have the utmost respect for people who do the harder thing you know speaking truth to power you know speaking truth is is hard but it's not as hard as speaking truth when when there are things at stake so i would like to commend you and thank you for that so maybe sir before we get to the incident maybe can you tell us a little bit more about yourself so so the audience knows my my followers know who you are i mean your followers obviously sure of course um i'm sarah i am a communications specialist uh for an international humanitarian aid organization um that's my full-time job i also run a side business a media company um called crazy cat which is um a media platform that helps to empower everyday women help them shine build their confidence through digital content events and also workshops i'm also a mom to a toddler she's studying two this week um oh yeah and wednesday wednesday on sunday okay yeah and i'm also i guess an advocate for a lot of different things um different causes and one of them is um for greater minority representation okay so it's coincidental perhaps or it's divine intervention or divine were the one intervention you were the one then uh to be involved in this because i was i was talking to my missus as well uh just now and it's yeah why of all pictures it had to be you right and i mean i mean i'm glad uh in some ways uh it was for for the broader society not for you so i mean obviously you have been thrusted into the national spotlight and i mean it's not a nice thing or a nice way to be trusted into the national sport yeah so maybe you can tell us more about the incident and its timeline i don't know whether you heard uh my preamble so did i get anything wrong or did i miss anything no no not quite um i mean yeah i think most of you who are who joined us this evening um know more or less what has happened i first got to know about this through instagram actually two of my friends um they fold you know they have a mutual um person a friend that they follow who happened to be in you know in tune bar rocket where the stage is and where you know the standee was um the banner is right the whole shebang um you know the coconut tree and uh and yeah so happened that that's you know obviously my our you know my photo my husband um and i our photo um and they recognized that you know that's a photo from my wedding um and they just you know which that one's like hey i think that's you and that's really the only how i found out about it i wouldn't have known otherwise um so i actually sat on it for a few days before deciding on on what to do um you know i talked to my husband about it talk to my family members because again you know um we could have just asked pa quietly to take it down right you know reflecting on what happened and again just thinking about okay why of all people that this happened to me the very person who's been advocating um you know specifically about having integrated minority representation cultural appropriation and and all of that as well and and just about like a month ago i think i posted on instagram as well about another um organization in singapore that was doing you know have this mentorship program and it's more or less like a national program as well but um all their mentors except for one um we're all chinese and so it's you know for me it's like okay if you you know you're trying to um promote i don't know or or cultivate more female leaders for example then you should also be representative of all women in singapore um so that was something i just brought up like a month ago and then i saw this and i'm like oh okay could this you know why is this happening specifically to me um and you know talking again to my husband um you know and we realized i mean for me all you know being a mom has truly um we really uh revise about change renew without my sense of purpose and a lot of all that i do right now really is to try to create a better world or better singapore for her um and i thought okay this could be one of the ways that i really highlight um what's completely wrong on so many levels with this and highlight this publicly as well and and start and not start honestly continue um the conversations that are already online um you know that platform such as minority voices i've already been having labor conversations so many of these platforms i have already been having about um yeah the need for greater management representations about racism and and all of that so yeah that's why i decided to do it right okay okay thank you thank you so there are a couple of uh interesting comments that i want to read out and by the way uh please keep the questions coming so i have one uh a question uh which says that what is our response to uh suhami yusuf's uh comments so there's a question that came in uh and that person said that uh he or she i don't know who who it was uh feels that uh sohaimi was mansplaining but we will get we'll get to that in a while but there are a couple of interesting comments but before that it's it's it's fascinating to hear that parenting has such being apparent has such a profound impact on you yeah because i i need to re-evaluate i'm sure i need to evaluate my own parenting experience so uh so there is uh there's a comment is sarah sonket background intentional 100 points or something i knew that was going to come out somehow no no it's not i live with my in-laws so there is a comment by somebody who has been there done that right she says thank you for being so open about your experience so so that's that's really nice uh and there's another one that uh that is quite intriguing right and it's probably true or i mean we don't know we cannot speculate but maybe it's true so it probably means just that uh it has happened many times before it's just that the flow has finally been interrupted by someone eloquent and insistent enough and i guess that's the value of making it public right because if it's if it's done privately we don't know whether it would have the same impact the next time right so so for instance right i'm quite confident that the brown face uh a brown face incident would not happen again or at least in the same manner it did after pretty places intervention in the in what happened two or three years ago and probably moving forward something like this would not happen to the same degree or at least at a lesser frequency so so i think we have you to thank for that so so let's get to the more let's get to the slightly tougher questions right so so some people yeah yeah yeah yeah sure carry on canon no if i can see as well um you know i think last year just last year something similar happened as well we had a former mp who you know water hijab um for a hierarchy too and that also sparked conversations um but the fact that it happened again it just shows that i guess there wasn't much um you know reflection done i'm not sure i mean you know what other processes in place that this is still happening um yeah yeah so yeah you are referring to libya wearing the hijab for her yeah yeah so this was 20 20ish i think uh around there yeah probably yeah yeah yeah okay all right so uh there there have been some people who have said this um that you know rpa already apologized right so what else what else does what else do minorities want right why are minorities so sensitive right and i saw this comment uh quite a bit i mean not not a lot but i saw this sporadically so what how would you respond to that what is it exactly that you wish to achieve or are you just being too sensitive you know it's the standard one right is there if we cannot take a joke right oh why are you so sensitive right when people are gonna erase this joke right yeah so what what is it that you wish to achieve i mean honestly if this happened with just any other i don't know private organization i mean yeah sure it is important to still you know raise awareness about why it's wrong but the very fact that this happened by a government agency and a government agency a government body that was established for the very purpose of promoting racial harmony and built social cohesion in singapore it's just really really really not acceptable um and the fact that it's you know hasn't this isn't the first time as well so yeah what do i want i want to for them to have greater tangible accountability what does it even mean like what did this apology really mean what does taking responsibilities responsibility really mean um what are the next steps that you take to make sure this doesn't happen again it's so easy to pay lip service and just say oh yeah i promise it won't happen again but it has happened and and and i think you know this whole talk about you know minorities being so sensitive i mean look at what's been happening in the past couple of days with the blatant racism that's been going on you know it's it's it's years and years and years i think of just um pushing for greater racial tolerance and and just dismissing um the real lived experiences of minorities and discrediting our reality and again we're not we don't want to be divisive we're not here to tell you how it is for us to be to to i don't know incite racial disharmony or whatever it is it's not i think you know we're just talking like this it's exhausting to feel like we have to justify and say this again and again and again and i think um we just really need to move beyond that to move beyond this superficial understanding of um our differences essentially i think it's just you know the constant guess lighting as well you know people saying that i mean me saying you know sharing my experiences and have people say oh you're being too sensitive that's guest lighting that's making trying to make me doubt my reality or my truth and instead of doing that maybe take a step back reflect or maybe have some you know empathy i guess you know it's right and and for me just thinking about all that's happened and reflecting about this is just making me realize that you know this process could really possibly be an emotional response to something really uncomfortable um and this is because you know it is uncomfortable to talk about race it is uncomfortable to acknowledge that um yeah that you know what you have known all your life or what you've been you've conditioned to know about race and racial harmony and racial tolerance is not exactly what it is um you know it's not comfortable and it's confronting so that before you react you know i guess you know as a society we should just take a step back and listen right right okay thank you for that so so basically what you want to see is at least some assurance what are the next steps that the pa and other grassroots organizations would take to ensure that such a thing doesn't happen again yeah no absolutely what are firstly what are the policies that are in place because how did the breach happen i mean the policies were in place and yet you know there are obviously flaws there right there's some there's definitely something wrong there because firstly you know there's that infringement of privacy um and copyright and then there's also um yeah cultural appropriation or just that superficial understanding of hari raya um and we can again unpack you know all of that in itself um you know the display itself which i think um we both saw um alfie and you know that was that was brilliant yeah yeah and you know like not just malay not just malays celebrate haraya there are so many other races they're indian muslims they're arab muslims do you want to say do you want to say something about that sarah because i mean i mean i don't know you personally but i assume you are arab from from your surname so or what do you identify as or why was there an added dimension for you uh as to why this incident method yeah yeah no absolutely thank you so much for asking and giving me the space to talk about this as well i mean this is something that's honestly been triggering and confronting just racial identity and talking about race because um i think i just just shared this on my instagram today as well this you know the cmio model and how um for me being categorized as others because yeah my dad's arab so you know on on ic and race it's era my mom is you know half japanese half me now so i'm a mix of a lot of different things but just categorize um as others and i think you know when we talk about representation of minorities there are minorities within minority communities as well and i think for me you know we've been part or rather my community have been parked under malay muslim rather and i think it's just yeah seeing this it's and reflecting on all of this have um yeah just forced me to really confront my racial identity what i identify with and all of that and it's uh it's just it's just something that's constantly um right yeah there's something i constantly think about and yeah there are different layers and i honestly am still making sense of it um right now i'm 30 this year and i'm still making sense of it right um so yeah yeah so i guess i mean we are in similar positions in that way right so i'm i'm indian muslim i speak malay so culturally i'm a mix of malay and indian culturally although i identify myself as indian so i mean in this i mean it's not it's not that confusing for you existentially right because people exist multiple identities right but for a lot of other people it's confusing right they will i had a neighbor right of the previous neighbor right so after after 10 or 15 years of living there he still wish me happy deepavali even after i told him i don't know i don't celebrate yeah yeah so uh so yeah i mean these are perhaps the the nuances right yeah perhaps in the cmio model yeah yeah the intersections for sure so uh so i just wanted to read a comment from artika just just in the uh interest of fairness because uh she said that libya actually visits masjid ahmad ibrahim yeah no it does but i mean if you want to wear the the hijab and celebrate it then maybe i don't know in parliament advocate for hijabi women um who you know yeah who can't you know um work in the public service or in hijab all of that so there's so many you know different layers together so that should be absolutely should be this absolutely yeah absolutely i mean no disagreements there so uh so before i move on to the next question so i i mean i i recently got to know uh of your work uh just just a few weeks before uh this incident i really i really enjoy your commentary although i i have to say there was one thing that almost made me want to cancel this live session uh i thought it was quite egregious and that's you you went on tick tock a few days ago or a few weeks okay it's fine i guess that's that just tells me that even smart people sometimes do silly things right so well you said that you also had you know i agree i agree that is a silly thing yeah this is an embarrassing moment but okay anyway so uh and waste your time unfortunately yeah so uh who gets to speak for minorities right so uh because i mean you obviously are speaking for a section of minorities right so but you are not you do not purport to speak for every minority right and i mean it's not possible for for you to do that as well and i think also we must not pretend like there is a minority uh minority type right that this is the minority the modern minority that can speak for every single minority group right because there are different groups different interests different personalities in the minority communities right so who gets to speak for minorities and who are the minority elites i guess right so uh i guess sohaimi yusof was speaking and what he was saying probably represents a segment of minorities as well maybe maybe not in our age group i our i see our age group broadly speaking so our probably not our age group but i'm sure there are minorities who think like him uh as well so have you thought about that engine and you are now probably being put in a position of being um someone who is an elite in a different way right not not the conventional one but because you have a platform and you have a voice so who gets to speak for minorities okay so i see this as like two separate approaches like for me you know if i i really want to approach it um from a place where uh you know there shouldn't just be one representative for a minority community or group of people who represent minorities because again i believe in the power of collective voices um you know all of us have a voice and and most of us ethnic minorities we have you know experienced some form of microaggression or if not blatant racism you know some have unfortunately experienced even racist attacks and i think from that place i feel that all of us you know should share about our experiences and not you know to be divisive but to really raise awareness of um our unique gift experiences that can help with this conversation um because collectively like you know you can't you can't you can't go against that i think if all of us share um you know it's it's harder to ignore is what i'm saying so i think you know from from there i think all of us if we can you know even you know as equal stakeholders of this country of this nation we should be able to openly share about our lived and personal experiences respectfully um i think i need to add that as well we can do this respectfully and we should um but apart from that i hear what you're saying about you know minority elites or privileged minorities right like whether it's you know um minorities with financial privilege they're without the class or if it's privileged in a sense of someone who has a platform you know if you're a celebrity or public figure um should they do they represent minorities should they represent minorities i think in in that for for those with a platform who are celebrities maybe it's just you know i guess that's just their you know how they say like with great power comes great responsibility like that i don't know if they should have their responsibility but they should be mindful and conscious that because they have a platform what they say can influence um and i think yeah that's that's really important to note as well um and those who are privileged minorities i guess i mean i consider myself a privilege minority i'm not gonna shy away from that um and i think there are other people who have um shared this before you know that they come from a place of privilege um they should you know use use that you know use their privilege to to shine a spotlight on those who are less privileged who who don't really have a voice um yeah and but i and i know like this you know i've seen i think it was ryzer herself um during what happened i was gonna mention right so yeah so she mentioned about how she comes from a place of privilege and she was attacked just for that yeah yeah it was it was strange it was strange yeah yeah you see what i mean like people because it's they've just decided you know that um you know you are a bad person and you are doing this to be divisive and whatever you do is just wrong without taking a step like you know hey this is someone who actually has the intention to help you know she recognizes her privilege you know um and just wants to use it for good why can't people just accept that exactly and what else would you want from a privileged person other than to acknowledge that privilege and use that privilege to advance certain causes right well i mean what else could a privileged person do right i mean so i just found that line of attack against raisa a bit desperate uh yeah so yeah thanks thanks for bringing that up so i i also wanted to comment a little i don't know i don't know what you feel about uh sohaim yusuf's uh statement because he was a far more forgiving probably than than you and your eye and he said uh that i'm paraphrasing okay i'm paraphrasing he said something along the lines of you need to look at the intent of the mistake right you need to look at the intention of the person committing the mistake which of course matters intention matters but and he said if something along the lines of his if his son did something accidentally he wouldn't be too harsh on on that person so uh i mean i get that i get that but i think i think his analogy was completely off right so if his son was 56 years old and his son's sole purpose in life is to uh create racial harmony and his son made a mistake and then blame it on his friend i think that would have been a better analogy right because he was saying as if opa is just some random jew on the street right it's not it is not that right so i think i understand and you know he is a much funnier person he understands comedy and humor better than i ever can right and they are different i'm just analyzing it politically there are different types of community right there are some types of comedy that uh engaged in resistance right and not all committee needs to do that uh but i i definitely prefer that kind of committee but i just felt i just felt like i always have this problem you know when you are punching up are you punching down and not punching up i always have that problem right so uh that that is how i would say uh that is how i would analyze his comments i don't think no i know uh i mean the other way to to to do it is mansplaining and that i think him being a man or him being elderly not elderly older than us i mean it doesn't doesn't take away his right to comment on an issue because he's a minority as well he's a minority as well so he has every right to command and every singaporean has a right to comment in this uh as well it does that i think his comments were off uh in this particular area and also i felt like you know i want to see that same gusto when when there is actual when you have to punch up right when you have to punch up if you punch up equally as much as you punch down then i would take your punching down it's much more palatable to me i mean that's that's what i would say i don't know if you have any comments on that i have a lot i don't know okay um honestly his i mean first when i saw his meme that was hilarious and i thought great great great comic relief right um and then i read his interview and that was just that threw me off completely honestly and um he i'm just gonna say it as it is he may not have had the intention to do so because he may not have the awareness maybe of you know saying some of these things or doing the interview what he said but that was guest lighting and that was guest lighting to a whole other level because he's a public figure and a minority and that completely threw me off because you know again he may not have that intention but he did say that you know oh something again i'm paraphrasing as well but something along the lines of how um like okay you can take 10 or 20 minutes to you know be upset about it and then move on was something that oh did you say that did you say that oh okay oh wow so to yeah and i thought i thought that was it just wasn't right and again he may not have had the intention to personally attack me or my husband or whatever it is and he was just making comments you know from the perspective of the ethnic minority because i said from this that this is this is an ethnic minority issue and he has like you said um uh the right to talk about it but there wasn't any you know this happened this doesn't happen to him personally you know it happened to me and i think that's something that people tend to forget not just in this instance but just any specific um you know any incident as well forget the people who went through it yeah who were directly yeah directly but they were hurt by it i was hurt i was hurt by all of this and to read you know that comment discrediting or belittling um how i've processed this or how i should and telling me you know how i should or shouldn't do it and then yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm pretty sure that's what i read i think you can pull that out as well yeah so to me that was yeah it really threw me off um and again you know if someone from a place of um privilege you know having a platform being a public figure um i think should just be more mindful of this as well right okay so i'm just reading the comments there's a lot of love for you uh there's not too much love for me uh about my comments about tik tok so so i will i will i'll do the the pa okay i'll stand correct on that and i shall not comment on it there is a lot of blow free i don't know yes i don't want to lose followers over tick tock okay so so if you had one chance right sarah to to speak to the organizing committee now what would you say um what would i say i would say you know if you can you know have you really internalized this um have you had like honest reflections about this um the apology itself to me didn't weigh much at all um and again i'm saying this and you know allowing more gas lighting to come to me and like you know why am i pushing for what more do i want what more am i pushing for um but yeah i think i asked them you know do they recognize um exactly their position of power the position to influence the position to really listen and um yeah like really create you know safe spaces for not just minority communities but just all of singapore to to talk honestly about race um openly and honestly about race um you know do they you know have they really reflected on their mission um and what that means um because all of this and not you know just not the incident itself but how you know their statement how they apologized um and also just you know if they can take a look at some of the comments i i chose not to read most of the comments but i friends who told me about them um and just you know realizing that this you know it's an issue that needs to be fixed it needs to be corrected it needs to be addressed and they are in a position to be able to facilitate that um yeah i just hope that they can recognize um all of it really and yeah to be a big part of this all right so okay thank you for that uh thanks for that so uh there's uh sofia actually uh quoted what so i mean yourself said of course you can be tense and angry but not for too long after 10 or 20 minutes analyze and take a look at the crunch of the issue probably he meant crux of the issue but anyway so uh moving on from swami yusuf i always feel like there is this tendency for people to dismiss the opinions of minorities or women or female minorities minority females by by saying that oh don't be too emotional right when uh i think being the antonym of being emotional is not uh it's not irrational right uh the antonym of emotional is not rational right the antonym of rational is irrational not emotional right you you can and should be emotional on many issues right i mean if you're not emotion and these are the same people right who would get emotional over far less right people who tell us that we shouldn't get emotional they get emotional over far less right when their football club loses which is a perfectly valid reason to be emotional right but then they would tell others oh we shouldn't get emotional we should get emotional but being emotional doesn't mean that we would act in irrational ways right and in fact emotion is a necessary part of activism if you are not emotional about something there's no way you would do something about it right you just accept status quo yeah so i i just felt i always feel that when people are throwing that i mean it's a lazy way to dismiss people's concern by saying oh don't be emotional don't be emotional right i know i get that and i'm sure you'll get that oh gosh you know you brought up you brought up the whole issue of being a woman in all of this as well and that's again you know yeah i don't know again if what his intentions were but we're talking referring to tsuhami but yeah there's definitely some form of um gender you know issues surrounding seeing through a gendered lens through all of this as well and um yeah i think you know being a woman it's yeah it is an emotional thing but again like this didn't just happen to me it happened to my husband and i and he's obviously not a woman um you know um he may be less emotional about it but it's just he's built up in his makeup and i'm just naturally a really emotional person um and and i think you know what you know emotions uh you know it's it's my strength i think that's one of it you know being able to empathize being able to take a step back reflect um and think before i react i think um so i think you know when people say i'm being emotional or i'm reacting emotionally or whatever actually there's a lot of i me reacting emotionally wouldn't be this it wouldn't be the responses right of course they're actually quite calculated as well um you know so so yeah um yeah i think all of us a lot of us are emotional and i think the biggest emotion that my northeast and i think minorities feel is exhaustion um and just you know in malay we say not really and and yeah what what how long more you know it's like a roller coaster it's like sometimes this happens it blows up and then you know it dies down and then it happens again but we can actually use this and as an opportunity to um yeah do something about it you know because especially because this happened to pa i think they can and should use this as an opportunity to facilitate real honest conversations about race you know use this opportunity to um engage platforms people individuals communities that are already talking about this you know like i mentioned earlier minority voices laid back conversations so many others i'm just mentioning the ones that i i follow um as well so yeah this is a real chance for them to do that right right and i think i think what you said that i mean it it hits the nail on its head right because if this was the only time such an incident happened right then and yeah maybe even then i'm not sure whether you you are making a big deal out of it right but but maybe those criticisms could uh would uh have more weight to it right but it's a series of incidents over i mean this is this is not at all new i mean all right okay i cannot say all but many minorities have gone through a lesser version of this in their life right so i'll give you i'll give you an example right so there was once when i was reporting for my first day at work uh it was a different i cannot tell which which employer it is but uh so my first day then the person just said to me uh so there were two two new people who were coming in so uh both indian so you know where i'm going with this right so the person actually said to me are you this person or are you the other indian person i cannot tell i cannot differentiate between the two of you right just just say it right right so uh right to my face right i mean just uh the night the night uh before hari raya right so i was with my brother at my mom's voice deck and somebody came down to us and just came to us confronted and i say excuse me do you guys speak english right that's the first thing the the guy said and you know these are the things that um happen to us on uh i won't say a regular basis but it's it happens to us enough it happens to us enough so that there is a there is an excellent comment by z uh which says that uh uh wait that means there are so many comments so they said we are so scared of you as an emotion but angered social issues is a healthy reaction i absolutely agree so there was a question by fadilla apparently but i've missed it but celine said that building on fabila's question what can members of the majority do in addition to listening more openly and deeply uh do you what do you want oh yeah yeah sure yes she asked what would it take for there to be real change um right going back to the question of who can speak on behalf of minorities does it require someone from the majority group for something deeper to happen um i think i think definitely allyship is a huge part of the equation for sure and honestly um you know just this going through this experience i cannot be any more grateful i mean yeah to allies who you know have you know used their voice to talk about this to some of them have fought trolls on my comments as well it's i think you know seeing this made me realize even more that you know this issue is not just a minority issue i mean the issues of you know that minority space and microaggressions and all that is not just a minority issue but a signature issue for sure as well you know we are all equal stakeholders of the society um you know the singaporean society we should all you know play our parts i mean as you know minorities we share what is going on what hurts us what continuously exhausts us as you know the majority allies you know thank you so much for using your voice to to highlight um why it's important that we constantly talk about this and contribute to the conversation in a respectful way as well and you know empathy which i think should be a big big part of of this conversation about race absolutely i think i think you said it perfectly there i i don't think i mean the last thing we we want to do is to isolate our our allies or potential allies among the chinese i mean there are you know sometimes you know like like the comment i mentioned the first one at least or do you look like uh are you the other indian person i think that that's i mean it's hurtful but i wouldn't say it's super malicious i mean and also there are gradations of of comments right and maybe that that person should not be we should not treat that person the same way as someone who goes out of their way to be nasty right so there must be different levels of education for on on our side or attempts to educate them uh so uh so uh i wanted to ask you guys is it our responsibility to educate okay so i don't think it's our responsibility we don't have a responsibility but we would be more effective than others in doing it right so uh so okay so when i say our responsibility it depends on who you mean by my hour right so i wouldn't expect my parents my dad uh passed away about a few months ago so i wouldn't expect my parents or my mom or my uncles and aunts to to do the educating right but for someone like me who who is quite privileged right uh i do feel that i have some responsibility to educate right uh i think you have about what six thousand eight hundred followers now right so you have some rest i i think right but it's not just about responsibility right it's about effectiveness right i think if we do it i think we would be quite effective right so uh i get that i get that it's it's tiring for us to it's all the time we have to do it right but uh you started off by saying that you wanted to to make the world a better place for your daughter right so if it's not your responsibility as a minority would you say it's a responsibility as a mother to educate other people yeah yeah yeah so i guess the responsibility question i mean it's i know i mean it is frustrating you know alfie mentioned this before right but he mentioned that it is but unfortunately we i mean especially people in positions of privilege have have more to do like i suppose yeah yeah but i think there was a question about um something about how um it's systemic as well that's why it's exhausting so in this in this question like in you know with this comment you know what do our leaders you know have can do you know how can we hold them accountable to make sure that the system is set out for not just for minorities to succeed but also to change the narrative surrounding the discussions on race and and and all of it i don't know this is just something that i've also been reflecting on you know as well and pa is part of the system right it is an extension yeah yeah for sure for sure yeah yeah i think i think uh one of the things that i worry about when when we talk about representation and diversity in the in the broader sense right uh just like climate change just like mental health and also on diversity it's very easy to make performative gestures it's very very easy but actually without doing the the necessary thing it's very easy to come up with for status when everybody is doing it when everybody is super uncontroversial to do so but when actually there is when it's uh it requires a bit more courage right that's when okay so i would like to see the pretty place incident for instance right so i mean this this is this is just my opinion you don't have to comment and i don't want to bring any uh get anybody into trouble but this is my opinion okay so uh the pretty place incident for those who remember initially when the brown face act was there nobody commented amongst the politicians when pretty please came out then there were a few politicians who said oh pretty please what's wrong and the brownface ad was wrong but before pretty please came out with the video why didn't anybody say that so i think that's where uh sometimes these gestures even though that statement is i mean it's good that they they could condemn the brownface ad right but i guess the timing always makes me feel okay is this performative why are you doing this so so that's why i think that that's we we need a lot a lot of them to do that no i know some of them and i'm not just talking i'm not talking about politics i'm talking about elites and even elites within minority communities sometimes they still have succeeded from uh in the system and i'm sure you have experienced this as well uh sir uh sorry your your video hanged for a while so yeah so it's yours i mean i can't hear you i can hear you as well so yeah yeah so let's just this is gonna be possible yeah yeah okay so so i'm sure you've heard this as well right so minority elite so so so far for instance drive i've heard before right people who are more successful in the malay community saying that they wouldn't let their children play football because they don't want to let their children feel me i mean you you know that you know they don't want their children to mix with other other malays as well so i mean there are all sorts of issues that i think we need more space to to discuss this and i think incidents like pretty places uh and yours have opened up the space for that for sure so that's why i really i really want you i want to thank you for that so so sarah if melvin young asks you for te tari or maybe he has i wonder why he hasn't actually would you accept and then he's gonna take a picture with you and say oh we've discussed this oh no yeah sure if he wants to have data you'll be sure but um yeah it needs to go beyond i met with sarah and apologize in person and you know um and just you know i really wonder you know if he because there was a light up incident at the incident there was a light up event um you know at the for for the kimber rocket with where the standee was as well and i wonder if he saw it um and what was that there was a light up high raya event um at that stage that very stage with his face and coconut tree and all of it um and yeah so i wonder if he saw this dandy what he thought about it if he did and he didn't say anything or think twice to think that something was wrong about it so um if i do have the therapy i would love to know if he did see that and if he if he did and he didn't say anything about it then something is definitely wrong right i think there was a comment there as well about internalized racism um which it is what it is we've been so conditioned to you know to think that this is a certain way you know that oh it's there's nothing wrong with this because you know people are colorblind i guess or blind to like racism at play or there's nothing there's nothing wrong because it doesn't impact them right um yeah so you know the that that's probably what i was asking if you saw it right right you can't say anything if you did it right right right right okay interesting right so that's that's a different there's another angle to the to this whole saga i i mean suppose quite complicated right so so uh are there anything it's not very complicated no no i agree i agree i actually actually i take that back actually it's not complicated right and i think i made the mistake that many people do fall into the trap of when they say when an incident racial incident or this is so complicated right well a lot of times it's not right so this is not complicated in the sense that who's right who's wrong that part is quite it's quite uh certain i'm just i'm just intrigued by the fact that there was a light up incident and wonder whether he saw whatever he said you know even then he definitely saw you know for a little deeper right are there the grassroots organizations what was the level of representation for instance of the minorities right so i mean these are hard and tough questions but i think questions that you asked i think in the initial yeah yeah you did and i i think i really really thank you uh for that so uh are there is there anything that you want to tell us about the incident or anything else yeah no i thought i'd just share that um pa has replied privately to my um response to the apology but because their email has been classified as restricted i shall not um share the contents of the email but my husband and i as if we have agreed to meet um the chief executive director of pa in person to discuss this further because their response to me was also not satisfactory so i thought it'd be easier to just meet in person and talk about it because i don't know who actually came up with the statements and the replies you know it might be easier to talk in person and and really find a common ground i think because i really think it this it would be such a missed opportunity to yeah take a step back and reflect and really think about what they can be as an organization and how they can you know lead the way in terms of um yeah moving beyond racial tolerance um and just really facilitating deeper real and honest conversations about reese what would uh take thanks for that update and it seems like you know you you did something that really didn't like you know you tell us half the story but then you say i cannot tell more right i mean it makes it okay so uh what would you say we need to move beyond racial tolerance and this will be my final question uh what would what would that look like what would racial harmony look like to you in singapore uh it would look like acknowledging firstly um you know that whatever we're going through as minorities our unique lived experiences that have happened that continue to happen is real is valid um it's not something we're making up you know it's not something we're seeing to get more attention um you know racial honey looks like them not not just them you know this isn't a majority this is minority again like i said this is a singaporean issue right i think um just some form of like leveling the playing field um you know that we set all races up for success and not just you know one group or one community over the other and what that means is to get to the root of the issue you know and it starts from the top i think because they set the tone and then it trickles down to different pockets of society so um yeah i think there needs to be some unlearning um you know in it amongst our leaders and again i don't speak i don't speak i'm not a politician i'm not a community leader um i'm not even a scholar or an academic that's why that's why you speak the truth you are not a politician that's why you are free to say yeah a singaporean who is an ethnic minority who is a mom which is once you know who's invested in the future of singapore because i have a daughter you know and and yeah and and yeah i just want it to be better you know have the lift experiences her future lift experiences to be better than ours today right final final question is a follow-up to that so does that does that have to take place outside the cmio model or can that thing inside this is a loaded question [Laughter] okay so i think i think it can take place in the cmio model my my worries i understand i understand the shortcomings of the cmi model my worry is if you remove that and you remove the safeguards for minorities for instance like the grc right like the grc um what if we do not have malay or indian representation in the parliament right and then we have no uh safeguard or fall back so i think whatever you said i completely agree but it can take place within the cmi model i understand that a lot of people are advocating for it to take place outside the same model i think that's a perfectly legitimate point of view as well but i've really thought long and hard about it but i remain to be convinced that the letter is better than the former even though i think it is legitimate so uh so i just wanted to clarify cindy asked am i saying that all politicians don't speak the truth no but politicians embellish and sometimes they are very self-censored especially in public right it's very it's very hard to get to extract truth out of them yeah but yeah so sorry final word yeah no i think about the cmr model i mean i guess it could but it can only um take place you know within that premise if there is acknowledgement um and validation given to the nuances and the intersections of us right then it will it could work because if not then it's it's just counterproductive really right okay miss sarah thank you so much for today and and not just today but for everything that you've done and been through over the past few weeks for the larger course i want to say thank you for your service no thank you thank you for having me thank you for yeah i think just anyone and everyone who has used your voice about this because again while yes it happened to razif my husband and i personally it you know we are also ethnic minorities and it impacts you know the whole community as well and i think again like my intention to continue it for this conversation is solely for my daughter um first um and yeah i'm just yeah it's been a lot it's been a lot and and i'm grateful for it to you know provide this space for me to share this and and what's going on as well but yeah i think i probably am going to take a step back a bit after this right because it has taken a toll on my mental health too i can't imagine i think people do not appreciate it the emotional tool and mental tool i mean i can imagine every day you'll be waking up to see why are there any updates and what i mean as much even for

you today we are going to attempt to clarify your questions and provide you with guidance on your role and responsibilities as a deputy now if you are considering applying to become a deputy this webinar is also very useful because many of the issues raised will be issues that you should be considering before applying to the court to be a deputy for loved one we would like to welcome miss Regina Chang and it's detention yet to our panel today Regina was previously District Judge and assistant registrar at the Family Justice courts hearing divorce guardianship of children Mental Capacity Act Koby and adoption cases upon the 1st of January 2016 Regina was appointed to be the public Guardian and she has headed the office of the Public Guardian since good evening everyone and Schenck yet is director of kith and kin Law Corporation and head of its mental capacity law practice shank yet sits on the Law Society probate practice committee that provides guidance on probate and mental capacity issues he is also registered as a professional deputy with the office of the Public Guardian thank you both for joining us today hmm ok some housekeeping before we get started relevant materials relating to today's talk can be downloaded through the documents icon on your screen please feel free to ask any question during the webinar just use the question mark icon on your screen we will do our best to address them during the talk or at the end of the talk please be reminded that material in this webinar is not intended to substitute any form of professional legal advice you should consult a lawyer if you require specific legal advice to begin let's look at mental capacity now under the mental capacity act a person is defined to lack capacity if he is unable to make a decision or take an action for himself at the time the decision or action needs to be me when a person has been formally assessed to be lacking in mental capacity a deputy as that appointed to handle this his affairs um perhaps Changkat would you like to simplify this definition for the benefit of our participants I think for the viewers is important to know that firstly mental capacity is not something that you have all your doing is not a blanket statement that a percent lack capacity or or whatever is a gradient mental capacity at least in a spectrum so for someone for example was in a coma of this is your percent mental capacity for someone who's also suffers from say dementia Alzheimer they would be kind of quite fluctuating capacity but essentially there's their capacity to carry out certain daily activities right so I think the point is that don't take capacity as something that is really a yes like that as trillion years all that all right okay so keeping that in mind let's begin by talking about a deputies role and responsibilities so what is the deputies rule well it's a she a deputy is someone who is appointed by the court to look after the welfare of Southwest at capacity we call the person P right very simply the role of deputy is to act in the best interest of a fee and in a nutshell you can reframe it as a way as being an extension of keys personality but you are the one making the decisions right interesting if I could just add to that it's not it's not that's not the complete picture I think in order to make the best decisions for P you would have to know what P's preferences are so in advance even before even before you know you take on this role you should know what the person lights and hide up in that person making that decision what that person would have me yeah okay yeah yeah so that's an interesting idea because in the context of say a family member meaning a lady 15 one can imagine in most circumstances he or she should know he quite well yeah I have some idea of his or her preferences so maybe in the context of a professional deputy what would you advise you know for that deputy to consider before making an application to quote a builder deputy I mean in the context of you know that he or she has to know quite well know his preferences in that sense Lord detective work needs to be done beforehand the detective work can be accomplished by talking to white on the ecosystem surrounding P so there were three is under any social workers case focus attached to P about peas current family members my best friends is he a regular patient and especially at this particular hospitals when we have access to some of these information so that we can form a more complete picture of these preferences of and also he saw a financial status as well Wow so so there's quite a lot of preparation what I would say before applying to court to become a deputy yes okay very interesting um maybe we talked about the five principles under the mental capacity and that should guide a deputy in making decisions on behalf of P so maybe you can shed light on you know how a deputy should be guided by these principles I mean I found some of them quite interesting because she should be he's not to be treated as unable to decide merely because he makes an unwise decision so you know it's a if I were a deputy yeah yeah I mean like you know we are human beings we experience differences in opinions we have different understanding of how a person's life should be lived out right very safe example of the relationship between me my wife right so if I do this capacity and I love to eat my play of chocolate era even though it's very hot unhealthy and we down the money basis not once a year then my wife would be my representative should even though she loves to eat salad she should allow me to eat my chocolate out because that's very good for my mental health in a sense reiterating ask about mental health sir I think that the point is that one of the principles of our best interest best interest comes from the opposition of key what we have done if peace here we taste capacity right so that's my preference obviously if I'm the representative I'm a no fever chocolate yeah i'm kefir salad so that s why i think it's also important to note that all practicable steps needs to be taken to an above key to express the professor's I had a situation where I met out client Matina care facility and from first instance it seems that the particular client or patient is a bit incoherent cause he sounds like he was slurring and we can hear him upon I know some of the vision will ask that actually maybe the possess missing of her dentures what I'm so how can we then get him dispel denture so that he can better articulate himself as opposed to take the whole complete package and see their achieve a capacity voice is very incoherent not very articulate that's very interesting what about I know one of the principles is regarding making decisions that are the least restrictive of keys rights and freedom that's another of the guiding principle that's right that's right it is actually a interesting guiding principle we got to the practical issues that he brings up for damn Papa Brian who is appoint as deputy for the father the father developed alzheimers with a propensity to self-harm so as the deputy the he has considered few options available to him the first option would be to maybe keep the father in a playroom meeting a house have like the father's you know favorite drama serials and was no snakes is reverse net trickle music a plenty of natural sunlight air conditioned etc things that make wasn't comfortable but you know in a room they will remove all the sharp objects right so they cannot harm himself the second option would be maybe if the enough resources to hire a caregiver it could be a nurse it could be a maid it could be on a full-time basis so because the ADIZ Gilmore town right so the nurse or caregiver company either you know on his daily walk about so that his condition will be carry a much slower pace the option be to send to a care facility it could be a daycare facility it could be a futon but then you know my client the deputy has a considered shoe he send the father to a facility that's far away from home but more cost-effective or somewhere that is closer to for our friends and family can busy on a more regular basis so in a sense he has to apply this particular principle I was considered under the less restrictive option others in the interest of the father very interesting okay do you have some personal experience where a simple you know some other similar decision like that has to be me where you then had to decide and what would your decision be in a similar context well because it is one thing to leave three options out there but to provide guidance on what you the least restrictive or less restricted well what do you think if the other is my father or if you were a deputy about that you probably try the second option for us the second option which is how your caregiver right right see how far I can stretch your resources maybe use it for trial period six months to a year right if it doesn't work out there's always time to people to either option three option one and I was gonna say I suppose keeping in mind what you said earlier that mental capacity exists on a spectrum so for someone with dementia or Alzheimer's I think we have to just keep observing and keep considering and be prepared to as they move up and down the scale the decisions may change you want it be fair to say that it's fair to say okay interesting okay so moving on are there decisions that a deputy cannot make under the Mental Capacity Act yeah quite a few dishes that the deputy cannot make on behalf of P but first and foremost always refer to the Colorado because the car the leaves are what the deputy can do encounter right and then we have the statutory we have the legislation that states even with the colored water things that the deputies cannot do so under Section - Tony says we have a scale on what we term as good as decisions and we shoot at the oceans in a nutshell very commonsensical star such as you cannot consent to the change of religion or P for example you cannot consent to marriage or divorce the making of advanced medical directive to decide for people - with in donating organs for transplant or for medical research or to be more concerned if they're ready making you know such decisions that's also restrict additions with regards to the ability of the deputy to for the chemical wheel or to make sepia nomination issue nominations on his behalf I having said this what I'm trying to say this as are things that the deputy cannot make directly on his behalf but this they can apply to the court that's right to ask the court to make the decisions on his behalf in the our capacity as please representative in that thing is in please best interest all right so for example the court could actually make a statutory will for P or the court could give the authority to the deputy to say consent to a divorce so that that's actually possible but it means having to apply to the court for that permission okay giving very good reasons why that power is necessary okay so if I were a deputy and I feel that I want to make certain to Sean please the half but appears to fall into this category oh he's an excluded on restricted decisions um what do I do can I come to the office of the Public Guardian for guidance if it's a fairly big decision or do I just straight away apply to court I mean you know other exceptions to these exclusions or should I just assumed that whatever stated in the list in the act I'm in Section 25 I just don't touch okay I I will take this up but it just us actually it's it's interpreting the MCA so it was kiss be in the nature mm-hmm so I my office can't help but even advice okay unlesss practice or procedure related hmm so I would say if that's something that you think the deputy he needs to a decision which he needs to make then go get legal advice on the matter yeah for instance like the making of the will in something that's right you should apply should seek legal advice and restaurant okay sure okay that's good to know okay moving on let's talk about the court order so I understand that the office of the Public Guardian often receives feedback from some deputies that he need help with understanding their quarters so for this part of the webinar we would like to talk a bit about compliance with court order okay so maybe for a start Regina maybe you can tell us what is in a typical court order for deputies I'm sure I will start off by saying that once you've been appointed by the court you're most of the time you would have counsel representing you the lawyer should actually explain to you what's in the court order and the powers should be granted to you but generally there are two broad categories first relate to the authority to make what we call personal welfare decisions on behalf of pique the other relates to financial decisions property and a fan matters so to read broad categories generally those for our personal welfare it's quite generous for example you can't restrict P from certain lessons you know so that's that's an example for the property and affairs matters but the financial matters the typical core does seem to be you know consolidate bank accounts if PSL bank accounts and then open a trust account in piece name you know put all the monies that you belong to be into that account other typical orders will relate to CPF given authority to withdraw PCF and needs to know sometimes to also early withdrawal as well but you know but at the end of the day if you are asking for these orders is the quarter makes the order and I always emphasize that you have to have give the code reason why those orders unnecessary for care for peace care okay yeah Anthony so perhaps to just add on we asked for the car orders besides asking for the authority to do certain things it's also important to specify what's along the DQ Ezra in how you're going to extract his power so take a very simple issue of managing bank accounts I've seen countless of quarters that allows the deputy to manage the bank accounts but they're only allowed to receive a bank statement sneem your bank statement from the way we know once every month obviously that were hindered I ability to laughter for the affairs of the EU I mean that says called the issues asked for power - maybe manager ATM car to be able to do internet banking so it so be so my points besides going into what's up cause you're asking for you to ask for specific instruments to carry out the popular power I can give another example actually I've seen sometimes they are orders for the power to sell the property so yes so you get the power to sell the property but you forget to ask for the power to sign the documents to sell the property I mean that's as good as long I think uh I think that it's okay thank you I think that yeah yeah yeah are they everything to help you buy a property for example right yes but causes can be very but it would be more work yes in additional cost as well yes it would sound like um so a plane to caught to be a deputy because the scope of the order is so important I think I would imagine it's actually more advisable for deputies to seek legal advice and and and more thorough guidance because I especially in the case of maybe lady beauties it's a bit hard to foresee the sort of tools that you might require to carry out your duties well yes or no army if it is I mean my view even if all you need are quite simple straightforward orders there there are guides which can allow the percenter to to applies the court in person Adamo engaging a council but having said that too I think it is also important when there are more complex orders and if anything they're not too clear about its best and together you can advise on the method because I think I shouldn't care see although the called it can be very it means going touch the call on another time spending more money or paying coffees and stuff so it's best to me to write it for school yeah so let's just quickly take a glance at the screen so that's what a typical order was that's right that's right a lot of words there but there is some some form in the madness the first part that the first part of the form if you look at it relates more to property personal of their personal welfare and then the second part relates to a property and affairs so look up for these keywords that's how it's divided into two and I think the last part would have this paragraph on a no reporting to my office oh okay get it somewhere somewhere at the back key yes yeah and I think because deputies role is limited by the code I Ling Shankar you will probably advise that is crucial to understand everything in the court orders around them that's right okay okay that's interesting um so what should deputies then do to ensure that they comply with the court order I mean so now they've got the court order they've read it day to day [Music] you know clearing out of their duties is not you you don't um how cautious and and how should they die I think I would say this um usually Whitley at the point of time when you're applying for the court you may not have full knowledge of exactly what he might have an example is that you know you may not know what's the balance and all the bank accounts and usually the banks won't entertain you until you show them the quarter so once you've been appointed a deputy I think the first thing you ought to do is some housekeeping do an inventory right now from the SS which P owns so that you have an idea as to what how you can deal with it alright that's that's one the other one would be to keep very good accounts of what you are he spending I mean it's a very heavy responsibility right being tasked to take care of some person responds mental capacity but what for remembers you're not actually spending your money you're spending someone else's money so because of that the law does impose the but the duty of my office supervised deputies which are appointed by the court and you do so by asking you to give me a nano report hmm it's tedious but you know you got to keep good accounts right money oh wait you received a proof of payments of me right yeah that's true anything to action yet I really didn't see it's very important to come out with a proper entry of the finances of key I will also add that it would be helpful to concurrently for me live what you think would be a Kaplan on behalf of P as well so that the way you utilize the monies of the hummocky can be matched to the Kaplan in fact partner that how the deputy she application we mean to state Howard is application and the P mu me so if we go to the epic poem wire that you put in the annual statement after you obtain the honor and as for the reporting requirements I think that what Oh piggy wants to see is current even a best interest on the I of what has pyramid why how does the deputy carry out activities to show that they are acting a best interest of P right so many companies that I mean to that that means I don't want to see every single receipt produce every single receipt of grocery shopping or marketing which have done on behalf of P that's really not necessary unless the total amount is some phenomenal extra but I'm out of the ordinary exactly but you know common sense rule of thumb if it's a reasonable amount I'm not going to answer every single receipt okay okay so in the so now we move on to maybe a situation where someone has not complied with the court order what then would be the consequences of non-compliance okay maybe before green to the consequences I I will just say I'm I think when supervising deputies also we've come across cases we're genuinely people don't comply because sometimes you don't understand the Co order or you really not clear but it is just supposed to do hmm so and of course you know how other is in English I do appreciate that some deputies are not the truth or can read English so in those situations it's good to actually ask someone who can be to help you with some some of things which you need to do and if really it's a case of you know I did I don't know how to do it my off you can come to my office offices may be able to explain some things to you but if you're talking about a case with person deliberately it's not complying with a call right for example but the caller tells you to close the bank account and put all the monies into this new account we just was open for people instead you choose to take whatever money and you put it into your own bank account alright and then you come to my office and say oh but actually you know I'm using the monies people know in this position you must not mix monies makes it very hard to account for it then in this case I would ask that it be rectified you take the money out and you comply with a call to open the bank account put the monies back into peace account mmm right and really in the worst case in spite of what we do there's still non-compliance and this is after many many rounds of emails phone calls and you've been house calls you knock on your door then I may not have a choice but to go to court to ask the court to relieve you of your duties as a deputy and after the court vault okay so the the main consequence when it comes to that level of non-compliance is to have your deputy ship revolt yes that's right and there are certain things also we could also yeah I mean remedy okay mashenka in the course of your work have you either advised someone or help someone who either found himself accidentally or deliberately in a non-compliant situation may be more common I would imagine accidentally because deputies are either professionally appointed all the loved ones and you know in the course of carrying out their duty as I'm sick maybe they somehow mix monies or or have you yeah maybe just pray technical stuff like for example I have a client who felt that the case and these old man needs to take care of P it doesn't need to include the amount inside the report and I have also fans who missed the deadline yeah but early submitting a report they can use jail time because can give me is just you know the stressors okay give me just tremendous so they have that well there's the deputies so given the example I can think of the P decides to take them instead of leaving the money in the bank account takes the money and open suffix T a fixed house it sometimes in peace name but sometimes in their own name so whether the reason obviously given is that or you get more interest right if you put the money that the fixed deposit account well technically there is a breach because the core doesn't allow me to do that hmm so Jeremy in such cases of my office comes across this what we would do is find we let you have the deposit which are but thereafter rectify unless you want to carry on doing it then go back to the client as a call for permission okay yeah mom based on experience and it just occurred to me how often do deputies have to go back to court because something they want to do is either not specify in a court order or not clear is it something that you encounter very often I know you ever know the true number because you're busy asking the deputy to give a cell triage or themselves right and we normally see clients when they want to do something big like buying a property or P that is already obvious that they can do it and then they will come to know yourself then very recorder so then they can do something that they're on behalf of their you know how especially I was not but generally most people but is the system matures we I think more people realize that maybe yeah cause I swear no miss efficient because the institution it's say the hospitals are interacting me reject rejects them because the orders of the purpose we might see us finding the cases for rectification well which is why we said earlier that you know try to get it right in the first place so that you don't have to go back to the call yeah and you know just what you need right but in the same vein it's just a question it doesn't mean that you can at the very beginning ask for a huge or wide-ranging caller so that later you don't have to go very so as and when issues arise and that makes sense I suppose because in again mental capacity occurs on a spectrum then depending on how much the P can make decision on his own behalf the court order should take that into consideration right you know I have a blanket order something is nice base I was running like I'm a client who actually discovered that with I mean special means but with the ability to draw and he has been commissioned by corporations well I need to enter the legal contract and right if the corporation are you can do so and the chordal obviously never specify them so this is a heads up or need space well then we need to vary the order on your decimal deputy she to then include such an honor besides rather yeah that's an interesting example okay um okay so moving on from non-compliance let's talk about reporting because I think that's also one of the more common issues in the office of the Public Guardian faces rain so on the topic of deputy reporting why is there I have shrinky you can start for deputies to submit and more reports to the public Guardian I guess from the first piece of all of you the deputy is appointed by the court right the court needs to be clear that this person is acting in his best interest and the only way to do so is to do a best interest Adie I should fire the owner report year after year is unlike say up here where you appoint someone on your own volition right based on your own free will to take care of you this is deputy who knows what's the nature of you know dynamics of family relationship and something I don't think any risks can be taken so hence the nature or the requirement photo for the enemy pop so bottom line I think is really a protective yes definitely comes from the protective telephone yeah yeah because the P does not choose a deputy unlike in the lasting hope it's lost in poverty situation range range it's intrusive Tony right yeah yeah which is why I think the office and likes to encourage people to to do a lasting power of attorney because right at the point where you can still choose who's gonna be taking care of you correct once you really do yes yeah okay but back to the topic of WT reporting I have here a picture of the online submission website maybe you can take our participants through mine when they go online sure how they can identify the form yeah maybe before before we we get there wrong what will happen is I think we have a lot of Deputies I've been in the audience today but what will happen is once you've been appointed as a deputy my office will actually you right - right - you say congratulations you are now a deputy these are the things which you need to do and together with that we I think we give you a copy of button and report you look like right order words are hard copy we have actually recently built a portal online for you to submit an online report instead so that's actually so what you see now the screen is the my reporting tool hmm I think you know you can just this is the landing page you just click that and it will bring you to wages so it is a template so you just basically fill in the blanks and you should be able to tell you up certain things so it's a lot more straightforward here's an interesting question where a deputy has used his or her own monies I think you mentioned that earlier Shing care to take care of a piece needs how should that review reporter how does it come off is it even necessary to report it because he or she thinks this is all - right well review okay because what we actually look at is what's the bank balance at the beginning of the reporting period and what's the bank balance at the end so if you've been using your money's to take care of your loved one then obviously the bank balance I assume will will not decrease them right it I mean it's unlikely assuming that there's no income coming in so you know you could you could explain to us if you want to buy the story there's no difference but if you choose to continue paying for these expenses so then okay so that that would be then I suppose not necessary for you to submit the very detailed receipts and maybe that would apply more to a case of say a parent of a child who lacks mental capacity parents who are you know taking care of the child's expenses even if the child in the earlier if alpha - and kicky is actually able to earn his own income through perhaps a special gift as life the statement doesn't show or the bank account is insure decrease then it's fine - it's not so much that it's just that whenever there is because it's like a balance sheet right you put in the expenses and when when direct and if you put in the expenses it has to be supported by documents so receipts so in this case if you choose not to put in the expenses the money you spend on that person then I I'm not looking for receipts so by the same token for Matt for income coming in I think in the case if the he is able to get income income or go into the his bank account right and that will be supported by bank statements I see yes so so it's not just simply but that it's more or less yeah it really depends on what is declared there's being spent on Pete hmm earned by pea-brained or received into his account right okay yeah they make sense of some interesting questions someone has asked can i as a deputy apply for a bt or flat on piece there have been people instead but only if you've got the power from the call to do so mm-hmm so that's why I'm like what she gets it just know a lot of it needs space so most people go to the court to appoint us at that pretty simply because they need to do certain things and I think a plan for PTO is killing one of those yeah right so again it's you can but you didn't need a caller to do this right and this one is interesting because I don't know if called us cover these things if he wants to take health supplements that are not prescribed by doctors maybe TCM or some kind of health products from multi-level marketing this is my deputy's advice does the deputy allow P to carry on and help you to purchase the product well I mean we talked about the five principles earlier is a factor so for example you might think there's a way some money to spend you know to spend X amount of dollars on health supplements because they may not do anything actually for help but that may just constitutes an unwise decision as opposed to a decision that gives it lung capacity from on the other hand if you frame it framing it in such a way that P while you know he or she can decide that this house of limits are good for her she does not have the capacity to manage of financial matters well I only had this fixed amount resources and she needs to be able manage it for long-term care right she might be able to mesh for most maybe five dollars $10 do buy some people Hawker Center but to clone such a huge amount of money for some MLM stuff maybe not right so that's an example of how my Tiki were welcomed and just to add to that because I think you mentioned that to do a care plan for Pete you really have to plan because you for the entire thanks man so you have a certain amount of money that's finite so I would think it'd be prudent to see how depend probably ought to be spent mm-hmm so when the deputy applies one of these five principles as you similar because earlier it was very interesting we said well acting in a best interest of P where we have to keep in mind and keys financial constraints as well so if he thinks that every night hanging he or she needs to have butts nest by his finances will allow then really it is the deputies prerogative to say that this might not be in the best interest of people yeah that's right that's rocky that's very interesting okay so um on the topic of deputy reporting um are there any other things that we need to point out to deputies and I understand many many times they struggle with for instance the extent of the thoroughness of their receipts and all that goes like you say over the course of a year in reality more often and not caregivers get inundated by other issues and you get so what then happens so if you're one of the things for is this because if you realize her when you applied to the court to be appointed in the affidavit document and support you actually have to spell out the expenses piece monthly expenses how much you spend on them and that usually is that is the starting point for my office all right we will always look at that and so what if the first time you're reporting to us if there are substantial changes right from what was declared in the affidavit and the current then you know explain explain to us and then support it with the receipts but I I would say that in subsequent subsequent years right if the expenses don't pay me that much then perhaps it may not be so less may not be necessary to produce f single receipt yeah so intermediate pants yeah yeah you also reminded me of actually had to know wisely my my my know this very well question there an Obama claims to last me annoying then that question basically is yes maximum dollars on P before their obtain the deputy she recommends so can they claim that this amount from his estate after they obtain the order and subsequently let's say even if they are the main financier behind you know his welfare in the Senate they pay for peace money be a partner in the event key obtains inheritance in the future how important is the annual report to them being able to claim that these monies that are spent on behalf of the post deputy ship appointment sure answer it must be section not a cop yes yes so it needs to be sent you about the cop how does it well maybe we can interpret it for only deputy sanctioned by the court so you then apply to the court to try to get these monies Bagla yes so and give your reasons so far for the monies obviously that were spent pre deputation order then we need to itemize this spending right and I did that and we also need to prove that this spending is the relieve a little piece of another piece nursing home piece right service and Kosovo's it is paid to beat a piece house right because there's no access to piece money so either itemize all these and proof that is this person who has paid this sum of money at the point for a specific reimbursement to the specific person who has clearly some monies which may or may not be the deputy oh I see okay that's true but if you were the deputy who has been spending your own money it therefore is a good idea to be quite clear in keeping records of your accessory right whether or not you put it in a report or as an aside to the report is good to have them all state it because when the time comes it will not be so difficult that's right okay that's a very good point okay let's move on to the next question so that that is the entire deputy report force right and at the very end when can deputies stopped reporting okay well the reports carry on for as long as the court order is in force hmm right yeah they are there could be reasons why the court order may be revoked one is if P retains capacity right ankle bets across the islamists right anymore and obviously reporting but stop of course the other side event is if pre passes away then obviously you don't need to keep reports anymore regarding the termination does the deputy have to go to court in the case ap has passed on or is it a procedure that doesn't require doing that um if I'm totally passes away there's no need to go back to court or revoke the order okay my office will know oh and we will ask for the final report thank you okay and what about in the situation where for personal reasons or maybe even good reason um but that lead apply yes that he or she is unable to or doesn't want to continue acting as deputy anymore they would have to go that's the call to get the order of a meet but I would say that before they do that they should actually make alternative plans because one of the questions I think the court will ask is so if you step out of the picture who's gonna look after key mmm who's gonna be asking for peek so I think yeah that needs to be done yeah that's right now I mean specifically issues regarding personal welfare in a legislation is there is not known that either so the call really wants to know who you know carry on in that if then you are discharged as a deputy I think maybe I do around that maybe that's a reason why sometimes people also apply for mmm that's right deputies so that in the event that one cannot cannot continue that they are the person will take over right but also means that I think a deputy needs to consider seriously if you are not already one before you apply to be a deputy for someone that came into capacity because that role can go on for a very long time yes consider the permutations available to you yes on the number cranky-puss okay so before we close um any last of all we've got some more questions okay let's see ah okay this actually brings to mind a question that I have but I'll do this one first my husband and I cannot agree on some matters pertaining to our child what steps can I take to make sure we have the right decision in place I suppose I mean practical command people disagree all the time right between Xavier wife I can't advise not watching so what's the dispute resolution mechanism between you and your wife right me and my wife or your husband so so that's one I'm sure it's not a situation where you know they disagree and they have no capacity to reconcile these disagreements the second point I want to make is dead maybe if you think of it from the position that is about P it's not about you P rejecting the emotional stinger of someone disagree with you because both of you are collaborating together to decide what is in the best interest for this set person that Bob you care about it's not an affront to your behavior okay but how do you think all right so it may not be so personal in that set so my approach would be you know to be my both parties that you are thinking about the welfare someone else and you guys are on the same team even though we may disagree mm-hmm and I suppose to get to worst case scenario consider a mediator if you get to a point may you just cannot come to a decision on something and no matter there is some some importance and okay um here's an interesting question I think one participant has asked when I get into trouble if I made the wrong decision for my ward hmm why can I guess it depends on yeah I was about to say depending on what the deputy what was the deputy's motivation and whether or not he or she applied to the question of circumstances yeah which is why we mentioned earlier about the best interest auti it's not about the niche of the ocean that you make it younger dating but the process they eventually come on you deposition yes right so for example I'm a client who came into a lot of insurance payout moremi oh she loves her family and she wants to bring her fairy members on a holiday obviously she doesn't have become as you measure financial matters but client did allow her to have a pocket money of ten dollars so that she has pay off whoever that she loves however that she was what other family members that disagree with the deputies one of you - issue she should not even be given this $10 to spend Wow right every single session you don't be managed by the deputy my having said that I think that my personal view is that in the best interest Audie the deputies way of thinking was tell others cookie when I would also add that from a practical point of view document the steps you took to reach that decision mm-hmm right and and sometimes before you reach particular decision there may be a lot of alternatives as we make sure that you've considered the pros and cons of each and why you finally reach that and I think that's that's a probably a practical thing to do yeah yeah I think that's very assuring for a deputy because I was just imagining a situation where maybe family members unhappy with a decision that I might hear me as a deputy and you know once you apply to court to have been removed or something like that so documenting the basis on which I make certain decisions is very important yeah suppose all they know when someone makes a deputy application they also have to notify the relevant persons right so my my my sense is look if there are other persons who are not that it is really want to be so careful that you have some schemer give em be a deputy yourself is that that's a reason why the quality on D having people account assistant of the relevant person to skill appoint you as the deputies so should proceed if some degree of confidence that you are the improper person for this for this job yes I like that that's very assuring and it's very true I mean that's the reason why I understand that professional deputies especially have to go through causes and that's training they may be a part of the officer that's right so they should be quite a of the powers under the court order right okay here's another interesting question my father's mental capacity is deteriorating do I have to reapply for you know to maybe very my deputies ship duties what if he starts to need more assistance to make decisions or to move around I think we did cover that to some attendant because we talked about mental capacity beyond a skill so if things are getting worse I suppose the application will need to come in when a big decision needs to be made maybe moving into the nursing home something like that would I be right to not to say that I will ask this you were asked this question is wait for the feedback loop I say feedback loop meaning if with the current card that he goes to a nursing home he wants to make a decision on behalf of his father and he realizes unable to because of nursing home reject and then maybe they'll be a good time to review the current order to see whether is it your fee for purpose very much okay that's good advice okay and I think my final question before we close when do we apply for deputy ship for our child with nonverbal moderate to severe autism after 21 years old or before 21 years old but so I think this is Richard ah before if you can the child is still in school and I'm assuming that this is not high-functioning then I think the there is if the child is still in a special special education vet school then I think there are processes therefore to help the present in class for them to apply for called for definition for the child hopefully she can be used in the transference to anyone the child has turned 21 more minutes to do it again so do that okay yeah yeah so I will also add just because your child has special needs or intellectual disability do not be discount there are potential ability to or excessively to say make a LP for them oh right like professionals involved I think it depends on it yeah it's highly dependent disability yeah okay before I close let's just make sure we have no more questions okay so thank you for the

Karageorghis (Brunel University London) present ""Stay Home, Save Lives: Physical ...",today's talk is physical activity sensory behavior and mental health during coping 19. and this seminar series is jointly organized by brunel's sedentary behavior health and disease research group led by dr daniel bailey and the health behaviour change research group led by myself dr emma loris and dr kai long chung all at brunel so today we're very lucky to have two presentations from professor mark hamer from university college london and professor costas clara georges from renault university in london so first i'd like to welcome our first speaker today professor mark hamer from the institute of sport exercise and health at university college london mark's research focuses on physical activity and population health especially in relation to heart disease healthy aging and mental well-being he is involved with a number of world-leading cohort studies including whitehall 2 study the 1970 british cohort study and the prospective physical activity sitting and sleep consortium professor hamer will present on the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for coping 19 using prospective cohort data with national registry linkage hospitalization so thank you to both our speakers and thank you first of all to mark for your presentation we really look forward to it so over to you mark thanks very much emma um and it's thank you for the in invite from dan uh it's a pleasure to come and uh speak this morning um so as emma mentioned um going to be talking about some of our work on physical activity and community acquired infection from some of the large epidemiological cohorts that we've been working on so the prime question i'm going to ask this morning is can a physically active lifestyle reduce the risk of serious outcomes from community acquired infections and um what we're not obviously trying to investigate is whether being physically fit can stop a person from actually getting infected with a virus but what we're more interested to know is whether once that person gets infected with a virus if they're fitter can they actually cope with it better and just to put this into context why would this be be relevant to the current pandemic um well pre-pandemic we know that a large proportion of the population do not meet the chief medical officer physical activity guidelines which is 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous physical activity um and you know if you even lower that recommendation down to what proportion of people are active for at least one day a week there's still a large proportion of people that don't meet that guideline so these are some data from sport england from their active live survey and they were actually able to look at what was the impact of the first lockdown on physical activity and and you can see that they've got this year-on-year data so they can make these comparisons from 2019 to 2020. and they estimated that in that first lockdown about a year ago physical activity levels dropped by around about seven percent which um may seem trivial but in england that reflects around about three million fewer adults being active so if in the backdrop of a population that is already relatively inactive the pandemic has clearly further reduced that and so potentially this could be a a recipe for for disaster with a highly contagious virus and a pretty sedentary population so the whole area of exercise immunity is certainly not uh it's not a new area the first studies in this area uh probably took place around about 100 years ago and these early studies were in animals and they looked what happened when uh you you infected an animal and then you got the animal to perform exhaustive exercise and actually the animals didn't fare very well because those that went through this exhaustive exercise protocol um had much worse outcomes following the infection and and this has led researchers to look at how elite athletes fare when they're under very high training loads um what happens happens to their immune function and in in some athletes um when they're under high training nodes this has quite an adverse influence on their immunity and and their risk of catching various infections and so this has really led to this um what you would call this u-shaped hypothesis where what we think is happening if you look at the y-axis as risk of infection and on the x-axis you've got level of physical activity when when athletes are under very high levels of intense training they're possibly at high risk of infection whereas people who are not doing any exercise at all are also under a similar greater risk of infection but actually we don't really know very much about this in the general population because most of the work has been done in in elite athlete populations so the aim of our work was really to explore this association between physical activity levels and community acquired infections in general population cohorts and some of the key advances in in our approaches have been the the use of some of these very large representative large-scale data sets um we've got prospective linkage to clinical records so we're not relying on uh symptoms we've actually got clinically verified uh infection data and and hard outcomes such as mortality whereas many of these previous studies and athletes have actually simply relied on symptoms to define uh for example an upper respiratory tract infection um so this is a general overview of the sort of design that we use in these the studies i'm going to present to you um these are prospective cohort studies so we start off at baseline where we recruit our sample and this is where we collect our data such as physical activity and some of the other important covariates such as smoking body mass index social status etc we then sometime in the future perform clinical linkage which may consist of hospital admission data mortality data and what that captures is all of the events that took place between your baseline and your your follow-up linkage so i'm just going to start firstly talking about the study that we did uh pre-covered using health sofa england and the scottish health survey um these are both household-based surveillance surveys um they that we would say this is probably these are our best representative studies that we have in in the uk because of this multi-stage stratified recruitment methodology that we use on average obviously these surveys take place every year um with a different set of participants and you you get of a sort of like a quite variability in the the proportion of people that actually take up the uh the study although what is really good is we get a very high proportion of participants that consent to prospective linkage with mortality and so the analysis that we did with with this data set was to look at associations between physical activity and risk of infectious disease mortality now in the uk by far the most common um infectious disease type of infectious disease mortality is pneumonia and these are the the the the basic unadjusted numbers uh looking at the association between uh physical activity and uh infectious disease mortality so on the y-axis we've got the number of events per 10 000 participants and then what we've done on the categorization of activity we've put people broadly into three categories those that didn't report any moderate to vigorous physical activity um those that weren't sufficiently active so people that reporting some but not reaching the current cmo guideline and then the active people are the people that do reach that 150 minute mark and and you can see just from the quite crude look at the data um that the the rates of uh infectious disease mortality are far lower in those people that are physically active now when you dig into this a little bit deeper and to look at the sort of detailed dose response pattern and also obviously start to adjust the models because one of the things we're concerned about with this sort of analysis is obviously confounding um so in this analysis we split the group into into five categories using metals per week um so that first category less than 1.6 meta per week is literally people who are really reporting very little activity at all that's that's less than half an hour's walk a week and that's reference category and you can see these are hazard ratios with confidence intervals we can see even with some physical activity we have quite a large reduction in risk of infectious disease mortality that continues to go down somewhat although really you can see with these high levels of activity there's lots of overlap with the confidence intervals so um when i look at this i would say that's really an l-shaped association it's certainly not linear so the biggest benefit is certainly moving from that inactive category to the category where people are doing some activity and these models were adjusted for these key confounders such as age sex existing illness at baseline social occupational strata body mass index smoking and alcohol so just wanted to move on now to the second study that we performed which is a similar type of study but we actually performed this during the pandemic with covid19 data um and we we did this study using uk biobank uh uk biobank started back in uh 2010 when the the the team recruited uh knit over half a million people across 22 different research centers in the uk this cohort is restricted to participants who were age 40 to 69 at baseline and you should note that the response rate was was very different to what i've just shown you in health survey for england the response rate was much lower which which would suggest that uk biobank is a far less representative cohort in terms of outcomes for this study we used linked nhs records um with which reflects uh kobe 19 admissions between the 16th of march to the 26th of april of 2020 so it was really in that first sort of six weeks that first lockdown period that we had and just in a similar fashion we've just presenting this in exactly the same way as i showed you for the hsc analysis we've got these three groups for physical activity the inactive the insufficiently active and the active and we've got events per ten thousand you can obviously see that the uh the absolute number of events per ten 000 is far lower than the previous analysis because um don't forget that the previous analysis was a follow-up uh over nine to ten year period whereas this is a follow-up uh this this reflects um an outcome follow-up period of six weeks um so uh like the previous analysis when we look at this in a survival model with um covaria adjustment these associations between the protective associations with physical activity with kobit 19 remain very robust so we went on to do a further analysis which was to calculate something called a population attributable fraction um and just to put this to explain this in in a simple fashion the the population attributable fraction really tells you that if you were to remove a certain risk factor from the population what effect would that have on your outcome of interest so in other words um if i were to remove smoking from the uk population um what proportion of serious covert admissions might that prevent so the calculation is based on two key factors it's firstly how prevalent is your risk factor in the population of interest and secondly what is the strength of the association between your exposure and and your outcome um so because i i mentioned that uk bike and is not hugely representative so we have taken prevalence data from health survey for england which i'm showing you here so the current figures from hsc suggests that uh in england we've got around about 17 smoking um um just over 25 would be considered inactive that's based on a 30 minute per week uh guideline so quite a generous uh cut point there and in terms of obesity it's just under 30 so those are the prevalence data that we used in the calculation um and the uh the relative risks were generated from the previous analysis that i've just shown you so these are the actual paths um so if we were to no so so i should also say that a key assumption of this calculation is causality so the calculation assumes that our exposure is causally driving our outcome so that's something to bear in mind so if we were to eliminate smoking in england then um we might expect to see to remove just under 15 of serious covered admissions if we were to to remove all inactivity in england uh we might see just under 10 reduction in admissions uh and and the but the really big one is obesity so if we were to eliminate obesity um we may see a reduction uh in 30 percent of serious code admissions and the reason that number is big is that firstly obesity is highly prevalent in england but secondly uh there's a very strong association between obesity and covid so morbidly obese have over three times increased risk of a serious kobit 19 admission so just the last piece of work i want to show you is actually something that's currently uh impressed and this was a meta-analysis that we did to look at associations between physical activity and various immune markers um but one of the outcomes we looked at was um infectious disease mortality and there wasn't very much data in this area but you can see the the data that we do have is all pretty consistently showing that physical activity is associated with a protective benefit in terms of reducing risk of of serious infectious disease so just to summarize uh our findings um habitual physical activity uh measured in the general population was associated with around about 30 to 40 40 lower risk of severe infectious disease outcome and that's after you account for these confounding factors when you when you control for these covariates what's interesting is this association doesn't really seem to be linear um you seem to see quite a sizable reduction in risk even at that very first part of the curve so when someone jumps from doing zero first activity to doing something we certainly didn't replicate this u-shaped association which has been found in athletic samples um and that's probably because we are working on a general population cohort obviously some of that code those co will be will be into quite heavy devs of exercise but um we certainly don't replicate that u-shaped association and just to summarize our population attributable fraction calculations um if we were to get the british population uh healthier in terms of their lifestyle then that that could certainly prevent a large number of these severe admissions if indeed these associations are actually causal i just my last slide i just wanted to talk about the sort of biological plausibility um is it really plausible to think that physical activity could could improve our immunity to the extent of uh reducing very serious illness i think there's a number of plausible mechanisms there's been a lot of talk about covid19 being quite a a peculiar virus in that it's um seems to have been associated with the endothelial function and if if it is indeed having that sort of origin we know that physicality is extremely important for cardiovascular health it's been linked to improvements in the endothelial function and blood pressure and vascular health in general um we know there's lots of data to suggest physical activity is very beneficial for metabolic function in terms of glucose control visceral adiposity reduction and so it may well be that physical activity is very important in mediating or moderating this link between obesity and covert risk and lastly we know that physical activity is a powerful anti-inflammatory mechanism and there has been talk about this cytokine storm or an over inflammatory response to to covet so maybe that physically trained individuals are better able to control this sort of mechanism once they are infected um so i'd just like to thank you for listening and i just want to acknowledge um some of my colleagues that that were helped on these various analyses uh david batty mika kivamaki thank you very much thank you so much mark i think the one takeaway message that we can all take from that presentation is basically the biggest improvement is to go from no activity to something so if we can all take that kind of key message away from mark's talk i think that's really important um so i think we've had a few questions uh to mark so we'll have some time now and then some time at the end for kind of overall um questions and discussion as well so the first question that we receive mark um is why does high intensity of activity make someone more susceptible to contracting the virus i thought that the more active you are the more preventive the effects would be yeah so um just just to highlight that we didn't actually find that um so i think um i referred to prior work in athletic samples that has found um athletes under very high training loads uh do seem to more susceptible to infections um but as i said we we didn't find that um one of the reasons for that may be that our outcome was a very hard outcome so we were looking at um uh you know death we were looking at hospital admission for for infections um the previous data that has generated this sort of u-shape type uh association has used symptom-based measures so when these athletes are contracting infections um we're talking about them coming down with common cold maybe flu but it would be very very rare for these athletes to actually get be hospitalized so i think there's a really important distinction there um you know this this earlier work showing the u-shaped curve was really not looking at very hard outcomes which is which is what we have been doing [Music] thanks mark um next question is for the activity to be considered physical does our heart rate have to be of a particular number of beats per minute i.e 220 minus person's age or does the beats per minute not matter thank you okay yeah thanks that's really good question um sourcely heart rate's very individual um it will vary with age um and training status um i think often um a better guide to use in terms of how how intense you know the interest the whole intensity issue is um whether you can still manage to have a conversation when you're exercising so um if if you you know reaching that sort of like moderate um form of exercise a good guy is that you should still just about be able to have a conversation but obviously you should be you know breathing quite hard once you get to the point where you're not able to have the conversation with with somebody then you've probably moved into that vigorous zone um and as i mentioned you don't need to move into the vigorous zone to get health benefits um keeping it that moderate level is is certainly going to give you benefits and in fact brisk walking is probably one of the most popular forms of activity uh in the uk at the minute from our uh health center for england yeah so probably uh don't get too worried about heart rate i would use other more uh subjective markers of effort and with the question from from ruth would these findings help explain some of the variance immortality figures between different countries e.g japan and where they have much lower rates of mortality yeah that's a really good question and um interesting the um world obesity federation um have just released a really interesting port last week that didn't last is based on each country's prevalence of obesity and they compared that with their number of deaths relative to their population and what you see is there is a round about a correlation of 0.5 between a country's prevalence of obesity and their death rates so there absolutely is a very plausible and good link between um you know obesity levels in countries and how they've you know how they've fared on on the covered front another question this time from christine immunity is a complex phenomena and it's great you looked at a range of confounders however is it possible that part of the association is psychological factors which draw people to exercise and these are also linked somehow to improved immunity yeah so um in in this in observational epidemiology residual confounding is always a big worry we can never possibly adjust for everything we want to because we we haven't measured it um i think it's absolutely plausible that there are unmeasured confounders that we haven't accounted for that could partly explain some of the associations um i haven't seen we know that mental health has has probably suffered during lockdown um i'm not aware of any really convincing evidence that has suggested a link between um mental health and serious risk of serious covert admissions um but but i may well be wrong and it um i may ask costas to pick that up if if he knows of any data um but i think it's very very plausible uh very plausible suggestion um and another question so given that physical inactivity is higher in ethnic minority groups in the uk did you explore this in your studies yeah so we in health survey for england we have previously shown that um participants from with south asian backgrounds so bangladesh pakistan india tend to report much lower levels of physical activity so that would be an obvious confounder in our associations and ethnicities is something that we adjust for in our analyses particularly um in the uk by bank analyses because we have um pretty good data on ethnicity having said that in these cohort stories i've presented um 95 of the cohort is actually white british so we we don't have huge options we don't have a huge um level of statistical power to actually examine that question um but obviously ethnicity is a really crucial factor uh in in covid for sure it's actually a related question um which is the last one that was asked so could you explain what you mean when you say hate to see data is more representative than biobank so i guess yeah yeah sure so um hsc um has a very um particular method of recruiting participants in the study um which is designed to in essence it's a random postcode kind of lottery so they try to to pick up people randomly across the entire country um this is quite different from the uk biobank approach and the main problem with uk biobank is although they sent out random invitations only five percent of those invitations that were sent actually got picked up um so if you look at the basic characteristics of uk biobank compared to the general population it contains people who are probably from higher social strata they are a bit healthier than what we would normally expect from that age group so that's why we would say that uk biobank is um not considered to be a particularly representative of of the english population compared to something like health's over england which is not perfect but it's it's it's quite a bit better thanks mark and just for one more question before we move on to custer's presentation from maria since obesity is the biggest risk factor that is strongly associated with kobit 19. is there any data of how much obesity has increased since march 2020 should advice about being more physically active be shared with gp practices and with people who are considered obese by bmi standards yeah i mean that's excellent question and i completely agree um you know i think i think this has been recognized i think the prime minister uh recognized this and he released um or he's supposed to have released some some money for focus research on this this area um you know if you look at the data i think you'll find that some people have put on weight um whereas other people haven't they've you know they've fared better so i i don't i think it's quite complicated um the data are probably quite more complex than they than they seem it's not simply a case of everyone as put on weight but obviously i think there has been a potential to put on weight we've all been stuck at home um if i think about my own kind of lifestyle i you know that incidental activity has all gone because you know i'm not walking to meeting rooms anymore walking around campus um you kind of get up go to your desk um i may get out and do some very structured exercise but i think what we've missed is all of that sort of an incidental movement um so yeah i think obesity is an absolutely crucial issue in this whole uh pandemic thanks so much mark um a really great presentation so we'll pick up on some more general questions between the two speakers at the end so now i'd like to move on to our second speaker um professor costas curry georges from the division of sport health and exercise sciences at brunel university london so kostas is divisional lead for sport health and exercise sciences at brunel he's internationally known for his research into the psychological psychophysiological and neurophysiological effects of audio visuals stimuli in exercise and sport classes will present on the effects of kobe 19 lockdown on physical activity sensory behavior and mental health across four western nations ussa uk france and australia so we're really looking forward to a presentation costas and thank you again uh emma and dan i'd like to thank you very much indeed for your kind invitation i was delighted to be preceded by professor mark hamer professor hamer was actually a student of mine believe it or not i know i look quite fresh-faced but more than 20 years ago i remember him as a young triathlete wearing quite garish all-in-one uh sort of lycra body suits he was sort of a slightly less ostentatious version of mr motivator um so yes a great pleasure to follow mark and it's interesting how our paths have crossed over the last 20 years in various projects as emma mentioned my main area of research has to do with audio visual aids in the physical activity sphere but about a year ago almost to the day i had three experiments in train and the physiology technician at brunel burst and summer into my office while i was in the middle of a tutorial and said cost has cost us all of the experiments they have to stop at once you need to get all of the students out shut everything down and of course that put paid to all of the work that i had in train at that time and in the days that followed i had to really refocus and and think what i would do during this um this health crisis covet 19 has been the defining issue of our generation um and so what i did do in fact was that i made contact with many of my colleagues around the world with whom i had collaborated over many years in the music and audio visual aids sphere and i asked whether they might be interested in doing a study around physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health during the pandemic very early in my career i did have an interest in psychometrics and physical activity i worked with um peter terry andrew lane simeon vladovalos in the sort of mid to late 90s so i had a little bit of a taste for that sort of work back then but mainly working with people who's 40 that was um so in the uk i collaborated with dr jonathan bird at exeter a formal doctor of students of mine and of course i've already mentioned mark with whom i've collaborated for many years on a variety of projects and he's a very fine colleague there's a group that i've been working with at springfield college in the usa they're probably in the land of nod right now two colleagues at the university of lille in france uh professor ivan de la voir tyrell and segoline quaran and of course from australia peter terry with whom i've worked in the music sphere over three decades now um and uh renee parsons smith and victoria terry so i think it's worth just acknowledging the uh the assistance and guidance i've had from my co-workers uh in relation to the work that i'm going to present i did try to get a group from um brazil as well to collaborate in this study but things were really going off there in terms of covid and i didn't manage to get the brazilians but i was happy to get samples from the uk usa france and australia so in terms of some background to this particular multination study clearly as mark alluded to earlier lockdowns by their very nature reduce opportunities for physical activity so that is a given and they encourage greater sedentary behavior such as sitting playing video games watching tv netflix i know a lot of my students were immersed in against what we have learned is an existing backdrop backdrop of very high levels of sedentary behavior in developed nations i was reading a paper just this morning published in bmc public health um which stated that obesity has caused more deaths in england and scotland since 2014 than smoking so i think that follows on very well from some of the data that was presented by mark earlier so of course a concomitant of sedentaryness is compromised mental health um and a very interesting study by mark and his colleagues in bmj open looked at associations between objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary time with mental mental health in adults so uh marketal's uh sample was drawn from the 2008 health survey for england um they used the 12 item general health questionnaire which is actually one of the instruments that we used in the study that i'm presenting today they had over 11 000 participants who self-reported their sedentary time and around 2000 from whom they collected objective data by use of accelerometers now the highest turtle the highest third in terms of objective and subjective sedentary time were associated with higher risk of psychological distress in accord with the general health questionnaire so you know that that was interesting and provides part of the background for the study but in terms of my own mental health and my own anxiety um some of the aspects that really got me going was just seeing the physical damage that people were suffering at the hands of covid what i've presented to you here on the left hand side is a healthy heart versus on the right hand side the heart of a coveted patient and what you can see on the right hand side is the splintering of blood vessels it's quite an extreme example here that of course makes oxygenation so difficult and lies at the heart of the problem if you pardon the pun if we also look at the image here of healthy lungs versus the lungs of a covid19 patient again a very stark and worrying difference the infection causes uh alveolar damage capillary congestion necrosis of pneumocytes interstitial and alveolar edema that is fluid in air spaces of course the lungs can't function as they should we can't breathe properly we can't absorb oxygen into the bloodstream we experience hypoxia and it leaves patients needing ventilators we saw this with our local mp of course the member for oxbridge and south reislip the right honourable boris johnson who was uh admitted to saint thomas's hospital and made many of these uh issues that the sort of mechanical issues um he served to make them very public so continuing with the background to the present study sedentary sedentary behavior is associated as we've learned with greater risk for cause mortality that is death from any cause cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes diabetes which is a combination of type 2 diabetes and obesity and of course some cancers and early covet findings that i was seeing in may june showed sharp reductions in physical activity even among people who were habitually active increases incidentally behavior particularly sitting and screen time decrements in mental health and the effects of the pandemic on mental health were particularly acute among women so this is a theme that will pick up again later now such changes in key health outcomes are probably not evenly distributed within populations and across nations and this provided a rationale for the purpose of the study you can see here the sort of public messaging this is an exercises medicine infographic that were common in the uk encouraging people to move more and we'll pick up this theme again in a short while i just want to touch on some international data um from tyson itself that's not iron mike by the way on daily step counts across the world on the left hand side we can see american cities uh and on the right hand side we can see international cities uh and what is stark within these data is a very sharp decrement when regional orders were placed such as lockdowns in terms of daily step count there were decrements in the order of two thousand to two and a half thousand steps per day in cities if you look on the right hand side top right such as seoul tokyo stockholm where there were not such strict restrictions or no restrictions at all um you can see people's physical activity levels in terms of daily step count being well maintained so this is the backdrop against which we were working the primary aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects although we did have some objective data as well in the form of step counts of the initial covert 19 lockdowns across four western nations the nations i mentioned earlier the uk usa australia france with a specific focus on physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health we've already had an excellent introduction to these from mark a secondary aid aim was to look at some key moderators such as age which was the main moderator that we looked at in terms of age groups but also we looked at sex as a moderator with a specific focus on mental health so we collected a lot of data in this study and i just want to be very clear i'm going to present just a portion of the data today but there are other studies nation-specific that have emanated from the data collection that took place during the spring and summer of 2020 across the four nations so first hypothesis we expected reductions in planned and unplanned dimensions of physical activity and steps per day from pre to during lockdown and we thought at the time that this decrement in physical activity would not be moderated by age we also expected increases in sedentary behavior from preeta during lockdown again with no age moderation um and we expected a decline across the board from preeta during lockdown in mental health but a greater decline among women predicated on data that we were looking at a year ago or just under a year ago so that means a significant lockdown by sex interaction now we did include nation in our analysis this was uh a descriptive study that looked across four nations but that was purely explored and we didn't have any our priory hypotheses in relation to nation so in terms of methods our study was approved by the brunel research ethics committee but also by each of the individual local ethics committees in each nation um we made some sort of cultural tweaks we ensured that each of the surveys was culturally specific using a lexicon that was specific to each nation and using demographic factors such as socio-economic status specific to each nation so i want to make it clear that we cannot infer causation from the findings i'm going to present today this is a cross-sectional study and in terms of perceptions of behaviors of mental state pre-lockdown we employed a retrospective frame so many of the researchers listening in will be aware of the error variance that is germane to the use of retrospective frames in research of this nature in terms of eligibility criteria we only sampled from adults residing in the four target nations and they needed to speak the main language of their country of residence we translated the suite of instruments into french for the french study in total uh we managed to get around two and a half thousand responses which we thought was pretty good um this is in the strict period of lockdown and you can see the nation breakdown a limitation which i'll touch on again later you get this self-selection bias when you conduct survey type research and we had many more women respond to our call thank you women relative to men so around 2 000 women responded and around 600 men and you can see at the bottom of the slide there some of the e-leaflets that we put out on a variety of social media channels in order to recruit okay so in terms of the measures um i want to highlight that we did think about exercise motives as a relevant predictor in the data i'm going to present today i'm not going to mention exercise motives which we measured uh using marklond and tobin's behavioral regulations in exercise questionnaire 3 which many of you will know is predicated on self-determination theory um we did use an instrument predicated on the theory of planned behavior by uh ajahn an instrument we developed here at brunel 16 years ago we published it in the british journal of sports medicine the brunel lifestyle physical activity questionnaire which taps planned and unplanned dimensions of physical activity so you know we were we were interested in this distinction um we were mindful of the fact that many people's planned schedules of physical activity would be interrupted by lockdown but we wondered what the ramifications would be for unplanned or lifestyle physical activity measures of sedentary behavior i'd say were fairly crude in this study we actually pulled the study together and got ethical clearance very very quickly in the matter of two or three weeks so we got um estimates of daily sitting and screen screen time in hours and as i mentioned earlier we assess general health using the general health questionnaire 12. those of you who are familiar with this instrument uh it's a four point scale uh i like her type skull and it taps depression anxiety and social dysfunction in terms of data analysis we did a very thorough screening of universe multivariate outliers we examine the various assumptions that underlie mixed model manova which was our test of choice and we used a two by four by four series of anovas and man overs but with the general health questionnaire data we used a two by four by two anova lockdown by nation by sex so looking at the results now i said that we were very thorough in terms of data screening and diagnostics in our screening we identified 200 univera outliers which we modified slightly to bring them in the range of minus 3.29 to plus 3.29 in terms of standardized or z scores we also identified 44 multivariate outliers so these are cases with an unusual pattern of scores so in this instance we took care to only screen out those multivariate outliers in the multivariate analysis to which they pertained so they were not deleted altogether they were only screened out in the analysis to which they pertained except for three cells that exhibited moderate negative skewness and 13 that exhibited moderate positive skewness we were fortunate in that we found normal distributions in the remaining 160 cells of the analysis so more than 90 cells in the analysis exhibited a normal or napoleon's hat type distribution you can see a normal distribution at the bottom of this slide there also as part of our screening we looked at boxes m test for equality of multiple variants covariance matrices all right so it's time now to have a look at some of the data so this is a stacked dot plot if you're not familiar with this uh type of data visualization it's fantastic in so far it allows us to present a large amount of information that the reader can pick up at a glance um you can see all three factors of our analysis in terms of uh preeta during lockdown the nations and the various age groups um you can see where differences lie they're marked by brackets you can see 95 intervals so with 95 intervals that doesn't mean that they cover 95 of the data but we're 95 certain that the mean of the distribution is contained within those um so what we've done here is for each age group the darker plot is the during lockdown and the lighter plot is the pre lockdown you can see quite marked changes to begin with just across nations there was in fact a main effect of nation and we did relatively well in the uk in terms of maintaining our planned levels of physical activity um also you will see that the planned physical activity levels of older adults above 60 years of age was fairly stable other than in the usa but the thing that is slightly concerning about these data if you look at the blue plots on the extreme left and the extreme right in the usa and australia you see a very sharp decrement in planned physical activity among young adults and this is a theme that we will pick up again later um we conducted a very similar analysis uh for unplanned physical activity so this is activity that isn't scheduled and there's an even more dramatic drop that is evident across nations in terms of decrements in unplanned unscheduled physical activity for young adults if you have a look at the blue plots to the left hand side of each nation that comes across quite starkly again relative stability for the older adults this is a little bit of a recurring theme in these data so now we move to a rain cloud type plot this allows us to look at the 95 percent confidence intervals to gauge differences and we set those in opposition to histograms what we've done is we've set the pre-lockdown distributions in pink and the during lockdown in in green you can see there that in terms of the interaction that is plotted it's a two-way interaction of locked down by nation for uh steps um that we get a significant lock down by nation uh interaction because it's driven by a very sharp decrement in steps per day in france note that there was a main effect of lockdown in terms of steps so across the board there was a decline in steps similar to the international data that i showed you earlier and if we switch to the rain cloud plot for lockdown by age group we see a sort of convergence as we go down the age groups there's a very stark difference in the steps per day from preeta during lockdown for young adults the difference is less marked as we progress through the age groups so the older adults above the age of 60 years were better able to maintain their physical activity in terms of steps per day this more objective marker here we move on to sedentary behavior this is a lockdown by nation a two-way significant interaction now you can see that across the board in terms of sitting and screen time there were marked rises in sedentary behavior but in some nations such as the usa for example if you have a look at sitting time in the usa you get a very very sharp increase in sitting time in the usa versus for example in the uk or if we compare screen time between the usa and the uk we can see again that there is a marked difference let's now move on to the two-way interaction of lockdown by age group for sedentary behavior we can see that pattern of sort of convergence as we come up in the age groups there is a very stark difference in the young adults age group huge difference from preeta during lockdown in both sitting and screen time but if we look at the older adults again although there is a significant difference when we look at the confidence intervals we can see that it is a less stark difference and here we look at a two-way interaction of lockdown by nation for the mental health scores now i just want to make it clear that higher scores on this particular instrument are indicative of compromised mental health so there's a significant lockdown by nation interaction it's a relatively small effect but it's significant and what we can see is that there is a very sharp decrement in perceived mental health from pre to during lockdown in the usa the difference was least marked in france these particular data reveal least marked in france um and now we look at the interaction of lockdown by sex for ghq 12 scores and what this is showing is there was a main effect uh there was of course um a decrement in mental health across the board but the way that women are perceiving lockdown seems to be causing a greater decrement in their mental health when compared to men it may be having to work at home having to homeschool caring responsibilities taking maybe a larger proportion of domestic responsibilities is having a detrimental effect on women's mental health and this is something that we need to pay very careful attention to this is a little brucy bonus this is not part of the data the international data that i've been presenting today but just to finish this highlights and and shines the spotlight on uk data this is using the exercise motives as a covariate and we see sharp decrements in planned and unplanned physical activity from preeta during lockdown top left we see a decrement in steps per day of around 2000 and if we look at the bottom there we can see increases in sedentary behavior sitting in screen time with these being most marked among young adults so this is an important and recurring theme in these data so moving on to our discussion um what is clear is that planned and unplanned uh physical activity as well as steps per day declines significantly um but there was an age moderation actually so h1 is only partially accepted um the um locked down by age interaction that emerged for unplanned is attributed to a steep decline among young adults as i mentioned earlier interestingly the decline is least pronounced in the uk so we did relatively well with our messaging in the uk across all nations there was decline in step counts of around 2000 so in calorific terms that's around 100 kilocalories or around the equivalence of maybe walking a mile a day there was an increase in sedentary behavior um and a lock down by age group interaction for sitting and screen time so given the um moderation of age group the second hypothesis was not accepted there was a strong moderation of age group as we saw in particular with the younger and older participants and we did encounter this lockdown by sex interaction so we accept the third hypothesis the largest decline in mental health was in the u.s sample and the smallest was in the french sample as we saw in the visualization and lockdown was particularly deleterious particularly harmful for women's mental health this is something that we might pick up in our discussion so in terms of strengths and limitations we've got strengths at the top here and um and limitations at the bottom we did make cultural adjustments for each sample and we were quite nimble we moved quickly to capture the data during the initial period of strict lockdown across the four nations given that our survey took around 20 minutes maybe 25 minutes for some to complete and that we didn't offer any incentive for completion the sample size was relatively good now the limitations i mentioned about the self-selection bias that pervades cross-sectional work of this nature we clearly had an over-representation of women um you know perhaps if we had in-person administration of surveys we would we'd been able to recruit more men but that wasn't possible under the restrictions we had a severe under-representation of ethnic minorities fewer than 10 percent of our respondents represented ethnic minorities people of color and also lower socioeconomic groups were highly unrepresented in our data particularly in the french data remember the problems of retrospective recall for all of you young researchers you're going to to get a greater error variance with retrospective recall of things like physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health but um interestingly the pandemic created conditions for what we call a a natural experiment and in our group we had to abandon existing research we had ongoing and take advantage of that natural experiment but i want to make it very clear that we cannot infer causality from the present design we can talk about associations but we cannot be sure about causality i think that needs to be made very clear so in conclusion lockdowns are associated with very negative consequences for physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health the world over it might also be that decrements in mental health prevent people from being physically active that might be a topic for discussion later the present findings provide particular concern in terms of the physical activity and sedentary behavior of young adults hopefully i've illustrated today what sharp decrements there were in physical activity and what shop increases there were incidentary behavior in this group relatively stable for older adults but marked increases in young adults and women's mental health was harmed more than men's by lockdown we might seize out the reasons for that later so what should future studies do they might provide incentives for hard-to-reach populations we just didn't have time to apply for funding and to provide incentives to our participants so that is something we might do in the future simply encouraging people to walk an extra mile a day would overcome those decrements in steps per day that we saw so 2 000 steps are roughly equivalent to walking a mile so that very simple messaging to the public could have a significant effect i think that intervention should be targeted specifically at young adults and using media that are popular with young adults such as tick tock and instagram um i'm going to stick my neck out here we heard japan mentioned earlier i think it was ruth who mentioned the lower levels of mortality in japan during this crisis well what do they do in japan they have designated time slots for physical activity so in many large companies people down tools at a certain time in the day and they all engage in physical activity just like the chap i've got in the image here during times of lockdown and national crisis should we consider a national time slot for physical activity when i was a a young boy mid-morning every day at school we'd have this movement for music and music piped over the speakers from bbc radio and we'd all move in time to the music we'd all be physically active do we need something similar at population level so that is my parting thought thank you very much for listening thank you very much costas for a really really interesting unique and really comprehensive study there of those four countries in particular and i'd like to start with some comments and questions that have just come in on the chat and just to make sure we don't miss those and ruth has asked um a really important question which she did the lockdown rules very much between countries that might have made it harder to make comparisons in the study and she also reflects that walking in in the usa is much harder than in other countries um so we have questions what is thoughts on that yes i have a couple of thoughts on that indeed there's less of a culture of walking in the usa um i studied in the usa for a while and there was a culture of going to the y that is how people generally got their physical activity it was very institution based at least at that time that was many years ago and we had certain phenomena in some of the countries so for example many of the french participants were recruited in paris where a very strict lockdown was imposed and people couldn't even go out for a walk so they there were indeed differences across nations and as i've mentioned again and again during the course of today's presentation this is cross-sectional cross-sectional data it's descriptive it shines a light on some of the differences across nations you saw from some of the earlier data that um some of the nations in the far east were hardly afflicted by this crisis but it had quite deleterious effects um on some of the western nations such as france such as the usa and this is borne out not only in the data that i presented today but across hundreds of studies that i have read in recent months including work that's been done by mark and his group at university college london thanks costas and some other comments and and kind of questions in the chat as well mostly relating to demographics of the sample which is kind of what you're alluding to as well that we would definitely want to pick up now so particularly so ruth's comment about you know be interesting to see women by age group for example so what are your kind of thoughts and reflections i guess on the gender composition of your sample and the findings that you've got specifically around gender i think to start with that would be really useful to discuss because i'm also thinking why in the first place you receive more female responders is that something that you might have reflected on and thought about um and your thoughts was also on the findings for gender yeah um so the the issues around gender are something that mark and i and our colleagues around the world have been reflecting upon a great deal um women generally were incredibly helpful and forthcoming uh in terms of responding to our questionnaire um women in general seem to be very um generous with their interactions on social media and picking up the sort of messaging that we were putting out in relation to the study men less so it seems that men sometimes require more badgering to participate in a study of this nature so just to make it clear that women were incredibly generous in giving up their time to participate in the study now from a statistical standpoint once you start looking at interaction effects and you have such a gender imbalance as we did with the recruitments in this international study it makes it very difficult um to look at for example lockdown by gender interactions okay it creates imbalances in the cells of the analysis and also in the way that data are distributed within cells of each analysis so from a a purely statistical perspective that is problematic in terms of generalization so if i were to do the study again and just remember this thing happened suddenly i had to abandon experiments and try and find a an outlet for my um desire to conduct research if i were to do it again i would get funding um and i would ensure that there was some stratification in the sampling so that i would have equal numbers of women and men but even more importantly still personally i was very interested in how the lockdown afflicted different sections of our community i grew up in a very poor but colorful enclave of south london and among the people that i knew from my childhood i noticed that the lockdown wreaked devastation in terms of people being hospitalized and unfortunately even losing their lives so i had an intrinsic interest in teasing out what those differences were across socioeconomic groups but in this type of sampling and doing it quickly and without resource i could not tap those groups and i'm deeply frustrated about that thankfully other groups with funding have been able to and their findings really bear out what i've had what i suspected from the outset which is that in terms of physical activity sedentary behavior and mental health this pandemic has had a sharply disproportionate effect on people from ethnic minorities and people in the lowest echelons of society so many of our interventions going forward should be targeted at those groups yeah i think and there's lots of kind of congratulations in the chat as well for for pulling something so comprehensive together in it with limited resources so i think you know other researchers etc appreciate it i can't see the chat but um oh yeah but thank you thank you for any any comments thank you um and there's there's been a few more kind of additional questions around uh well women specifically so i'll go to one first from maria um women's mental health and physical activity declined due to covic-19 compared to men can this be explained by hormonal changes more prominent in female physiology compared to male physiology an idea for a future study perhaps um in the in the present data the data that i presented the declines that were evident were more in the realm of mental health not so much in the realm of physical activity in fact in some instances and i've looked at some swiss and french data women from quite an affluent background a middle class background saw their physical activity levels even rise slightly because they had more time available not having to make the daily commute and with us able to to exercise so hormonal issues which was the thrust of the question um what we noticed in women in particular was this decline in mental health um and there could be this reverse causality wherein declines in mental health and the increase increases in responsibility in the inhibitions that are perceived by women are perhaps impacting on their physical activity levels i want to go back to what i said earlier about women from deprived backgrounds women from certain ethnic minorities maybe in patriarchal societies um in some religious groups it may be very difficult for some of those women to be seen to be physically active in the home and so i think beyond the hormonal and the mental health there are certain cultural barriers that i know some of my colleagues professor louise mansfield for example have been very active in investigating and so i've been sensitized to these barriers these data do not tease out these barriers but i'm nonetheless very mindful of the memo thanks costas and i think what you've just said picks up on christine's question already so i think rather than going back to that we'll skip to a slightly different question at the moment ten minutes left from shah um did this study account for physical activity in regards to season so during winters in france and uk i'm guessing there's a reduction in steps per day whereas in australia it would be the opposite that is an excellent incisive and insightful question thank you very much indeed given where we were with this study and the haste with which we had to bring it together we didn't have an opportunity to account for season and you're quite right to raise that as a potential limitation um i've done other research for example um i've done research on music interventions with older adults in physiotherapy rehabilitation and i know from that body of work that rehabilitation programs that are set during the summer month have higher attendance and adherence than those set in the winter months so this is a salient factor um and i thank you very much for bringing it to the fore i think at this point mark would you be happy to rejoin and we'll do some more kind of collective questions just to close and one question that i'd observed earlier that i thought would be good to get both of your um thoughts on was from siana and did your studies look at the effects of physical activity on long coverage and and if not just your general reflections on on the effects of um physical activity on like lancome would be good here um we we did assess covert status in our series of studies both within each nation and across nation at the time that we conducted our research long covered was not a phenomenon that we were aware of um and this is a term that has only recently entered the public lexicon um so i wonder whether from his more epidemiological perspective mark has some data upon which to draw and with which he can comment yeah unfortunately as you said costa says it's quite a new thing that's cropped up and um you know a large amount of funding has literally just been released to um to start to look at long covered so i don't think we actually have any particularly good data even at the moment on it um i just from a perspective of uclh i have colleagues at uclh with long covered patients um really struggling to know how what is the best intervention with some of these patients because even thinking about physical activity many of these patients are literally struggling to get out of their house and you know physically get out of their house and walk um you know 500 meters um so i think it's very early days for long covered and i don't think we do have very much data at all uh another question so describes a bit more of a general question for you guys so what are your thoughts on ways to improve representation in cohorts yeah i can speak to that briefly to begin with emma as i mentioned earlier we didn't have an opportunity to win funding to do the research relating to this international perspective during the strict lockdown but had we known how long the crisis would actually last for and the fact that there would be a second and third lockdown we would have applied for funding in order to incentivize the participation of those hard-to-reach groups in fact we would have been able to incentivize all participants the way that we approached it i realize now was not optimal in terms of democratizing the process and that is something i would seek to do in future and i just comment on how we deal with this in a very large scale cohort studies um the bottom line is it's it's a massive problem we know that the people that don't take part or you know decline our invitation to take part are um always from lower socioeconomic groups um they they also are less healthy they they're more likely to existing disease um obviously you you can't force people to to participate um what you can do to do though is to use certain statistical techniques to get around that so you can use not wanting to go into too much complexity you can use things such as weightings you can use imputation techniques and these techniques although not perfect they are designed to try to get around these sorts of uh selection biases thank you both and just for the final question um chairs honor i'd like to ask you both it's basically just to give your final takeaway thought i guess or take away comment that all of our attendees can can take with them and share to their friends and family about you know the the kind of overall relationship between physical activity and covid from your perspectives and your research from the full breadth of work that we've done it would suggest that physical activity has a role to play as a prophylactic in this pandemic it prevents the onset of obesity sedentariness inactivity diabetes it also serves to prevent the onset of uh depression and anxiety even if we can exercise impairs at a social distance it might counter to some degree social dysfunction so my message would be that any type of habitual physical activity during this pandemic is positive and as uh exercise and physical activity professionals we should be keeping our messaging as simple as possible so my message is walk a mile a day yeah and i absolutely agree with costas i think uh the clear message here is is anything is better than nothing um our data certainly support that and i just one final point for me is that um you know thinking ahead in future years it's very likely we're going to have further pandemics and i think as a in terms of prevention and public health policies we have to think very carefully about the the health of our population in in the uk um you know if if we'd have had a more physically active um less with lower prevalence of obesity uh who knows we we may have fared uh much better so i think there needs to be a a real push on that thank you both for those concluding comments so just like to thank you again both so much for your presentations today and there's lots of thank yous in the chat as well so thank you all so much for joining and thank you very much again to costas and mark for their time today and we hope to see you again soon ,True,False,True,False

livelihoods of our people during this temporary period of heightened ...,"[Music] UND's on 26 March 11 days ago the panda being has exploded as of 5th April 2020 Kobe 19 has spread to more than 200 countries and territories infecting over 1 million people and taken more than 60,000 lives today to control the spread of the virus more than 3.9 million people or half of humanity are on lockdown in Singapore where progressively ratcheted up our measures as the situation develops and the medical evidence comes in to minimize the risks of import of cases we are severely restricted incoming flights and Singapore Airlines motor dedicated flights to bring back Singaporeans who are overseas the limit loca transmission with implemented comprehensive and complementary measures safe distancing early identification and isolation of cases and quarantine of close contacts this have kept the number of infections manageable but in recent days the numbers have been rising local transmission has increased and continues to grow as of yesterday we have a total of 1309 infection cases six have succumbed to the virus this individuals mostly became infected when they were in close contact with infected persons at the socha workplace and family settings some clusters have emerged in our foreign worker dormitories to stay on top of the situation the government has taken a decisive step to preempt escalating infections it is critical that every one of us keeps physical contact with others do a minimum p.m. address the nation last Friday the multi ministry task force announced an elevated set of safe distancing measures immediately after day this circuit breaker measures begin tomorrow and will last for four weeks the circuit breaker is essential but we are acutely aware that it will be painful you're disrupting assess an impact workers severely will miss face-to-face interactions with our friends and family firmly familiar routines will be put on hold many will be anxious about their jobs and families as a pandemic sweeps through the world restrictions put in place in our trading partners will reduce demand for exports even more we must expect our overall GDP growth to take a further hit but we must take this hard decisions make the difficult adjustments and do all that we can in the next few months to protect the lives of our people otherwise if the outbreaks escalates the impact on lives and livelihoods will be even worse we must take short-term pains to avoid even sharper pain later let us bear this immediate pains with fortitude and stay strong in the resilience budget the government committed 48 billion dollars to support workers protect livelihoods and help enterprises overcome immediate challenges we obtain the president's imprint spur support for drove up to 17 billion dollars from our past results towards this to further support our people and businesses during this extraordinary four weeks when the circuit breaker measures are in place I will bolster the resilience budgets with a supplementary solidarity budgets the unity resilience and solidarity budgets all built upon and reinforce each other together they represent strong and decisive response to the economy and social consequences of the Kovach 19 crisis I thank the labor movement the Singapore business federation aspire citizens from all walks of life for your valuable feedback your inputs matter they have helped us better understand the situation and quickly shape the supports we now need the primary aim of this solidarity budget is to take further steps to save jobs and protect the livelihoods of our people during this temporary period of heightened measures we also have businesses preserve their capacity and capabilities to resume activities when a circuit breaker is lifted I will also provide direct cash in hand for households to help tie families through this difficult period all of us will be affected by this necessary circuit breaker measures some more than others to reach as many as we can as fast as possible the enhanced measures in the Solidarity budget are broad-based first well support our businesses to retain their workers and to stay number in my ministerial statement on 26 March in this house I mentioned the three C's of support for firms immediate needs cash costs and credit I was a increased support in all three areas many firms cannot operate at all or can only operate at a much reduced level in the coming weeks but they should still retain and Paylor workers our enhanced the jobs Support Scheme to support them in doing so this will help our workers keep their jobs and enabled businesses to resume operations quickly when a circuit breaker is lifted animals earlier in the resilience budget that our jobs Support Scheme will subsidize 25 percent or the first $4,600 of cross monthly wages for all local employees I provide a higher levels of which subsidy for sectors there are more directly hit by the outbreak 50% for firms in a food services sector and 75% for the aviation and tourism sectors with the latest development almost every business and every worker will be directly affected in a coming weeks our word therefore enhanced the jobs Support Scheme for the month of April in this solidarity budget I will raise the wage subsidy for all firms to 75 percent of gross monthly wages for the first $4,600 of wages paid in April 2024 each local employee the details are in the NX let me take this opportunity to clarify that for this and for the earlier resilience budget the wage cap of $4,600 does not mean that workers earning more than $4,600 do not qualify rather it means that this switch subsidy applies to every one of our over for 1.9 million local employees but regardless of how much they earn the maximum subsidy to the firms will be 75% of four thousand six hundred dollars per person which is three thousand four hundred fifty dollars the salary limits of $4,600 is based on our median which level of full-time employed residents I understand the cash needs of businesses are very pressing in this difficult period hence our agencies have been working very hard to bring forward the first job Support Scheme payouts from me - April 2020 the enhance payout for April wages will be paid in this tranche firms on gyro and P now will start receiving the first job Support Scheme payout next week firms which are not on gyro appear now will receive the pls by cheque starting about a week later the aim of this strong support is to directly reduce firms which to help them retain their workers I expect firms to make use of this job Support Scheme to continue paying your workers and refrain from putting workers or no pay leave during this period or was retrenching them we will monitor the situation carefully together with our tripartite partners and take action where needed many employers also hire foreign workers on work permits and s passes in the same spirit and flourish to take care of this workers who were also faced difficulties during the circuit breaker period by taking care of their workers our firms can resume operations quickly once the heightened measures are lifted to ease the labour cost of such firms during these four weeks I will waive the monthly foreign worker Levy deal in April this will reduce the cost and relieve the pressures on their cash flow to help them preserve their business structure and quickly resume operations we also provide employers with a foreign worker Levy rebates of $750 for each work permits or S pass holder based on previous levies paid in 2020 this will help employers pay and take care of the upkeep of their workers and prepare your workforce to restart when the circuit breaker is lifted employers will receive the rebates as early as 21st April 2020 the government recognizes that firms have been paying foreign workers levy in normal times so in these exceptional times we are temporarily redirecting resources back to the firm's to enables them to provide support for the foreign workers the Minister for manpower will share more details to further support businesses with costs we are taking additional steps to make sure that our measures flow down to businesses our earlier an announced a property tax rebates of up to 100 cents for non-residential properties for the tax payable in 2020 this rebate is to help businesses deal with the impacts of Kobe 19 for most properties the 100 percent property tax rebates works out slightly more than one month of rent the Minister for law will introduce a bill tomorrow to allow businesses and individuals to defer certain contractual obligations such as paying rents repaying loans or completing work for a period the bill also ensure the property owners pass on the property tax rebates in food to tenants as p.m. mentioned in his address the government will also continue to lead by example in supporting tenants I will increase the rental waiver for industrial office and agriculture attendance of government agencies to one month up from 0.5 month's rental waiver I announced at the resilience budget stall holders in Hawker centers managed by NEA or NEA appointed operators will continue enjoy three months of rental waivers what commercial tenants will continue to receive two months of rental waivers I've touched on the first two ceased costs and cash flow the third C is credit to provide additional support and credit I will further enhance financing support for enterprises so they're viable businesses can continue to have access to credits despite the uncertainty I will increase government's risk share of loans made under the temporary bridging loan program enterprise financing scheme SME working capital loan and Enterprise financing scheme trade loan from 80 to 90 percent for loans initiated from F April 20 20 and you 31st March 2021 last week meas together with the financial institutions also introduced a package of measures to help SMEs and with temporary cash flow difficulties for example SMEs can now opt to defer principle payments on their security term loans to the end of the year more than forty billion dollars of SMEs existing loans are likely to qualify for this relief banks and finance companies may also apply for low-cost funding through a new mes Singapore dollar facility for new loans granted under the Enterprise financing scheme SME working capital loan and temporary bridging loan program if they do so they must commit to pass on the savings to their borrowers the economy needs support and intervention in many different forms to go through this rough patch I urge all businesses landlords financial institutions and industry players to do your part in channeling the government's support measures to firms workers and house hosts the enhancements I have just announced how to help workers were employed by businesses to stay employed for self-employed persons we are put in place the self-employed person income relief scheme or sirs to provide direct cash assistance this is the first time that we are providing direct cash support to self-employed persons on such a large scale there are a very diverse group with different working hours and work arrangements some do this as full-time jobs while others do this as part-time to supplement their income some have been contributing CPF were others have not since announcements on 26 March the Minister for manpower and UC secretary general as well as our governments agencies have received feedback from various self-employed persons whose livelihoods have been affected during the circuit breaker periods more we'll see a further drop in income for instance there are self-employed persons who are engaged in some employment work to supplement their incomes another group of self-employed persons brought an executive condominium some years ago their income is now severely affected by the pandemic and you still have to support multiple family members daily needs or medical bills after considering the appeals we were broaden the support for self-employed persons I will make two enhancements first our x10 sirs to automatically include self-employed persons who also earn a small income from employment work second I will raise the current annual value threshold up from $13,000 to up to $21,000 to include those who live in some condominiums and other private properties the other criteria remain unchanged with these enhancements a total of about 100,000 self-employed persons will automatically be eligible for the scheme I will receive three payments of three thousand dollars each starting from me 2020 on the other hand many have shared their views the SERS is overly generous some of us why do we allow self-employed persons with annual net trade income of what up to $100,000 to qualify as I explained earlier self-employed persons are a very diverse group some our own account workers like taxi drivers who engage in a trade or business but do not employ any paid workers others are so proprietors who own small businesses that have employees and a network of business relations in this extraordinary times many such self-employed persons are hard-hit I hope that by our helping them they too can help others in our networks and our workers and we keep the spirit of enterprise alive in the spirit of tripart ISM and UC secretary-general and Zhi Ming has also agreed to step up and help administer application and appeals for sirs and support self-employed persons in need our approach now is to build up a net worth of support for as many as possible as quickly as possible let me reiterate that those who do not need this and do not qualify should not come forward to appeal for and abuse of supports otherwise you undermine public confidence and take up unnecessary resources but done right together we can help many self-employed persons who are hot hit M or M will work closely with ntuc to start processing Appeals for sirs as soon as possible I was poking about our support for firms and workers I also provide timely support for households to ensure that no household stands alone during this difficult period all adult Singaporeans will receive a one of solidarity payments of $600 in cash I will bring forward $300 from the can support cash payouts that are announced earlier on top of this I will provide the additional $300 bringing the total to $600 for every adult Singaporean aged 21 and above for the majority of Singaporeans who have provided a bank account details to the governments the Solidarity payments will be credited directly into your bank accounts by 14 April 2020 the res will receive the payment by cheque to be issued in stages later starting from 30th April 2025 other cash payouts under the cane support package which were earlier announced will be brought forward to June 2020 instead of August 2020 this include the remaining $300 or $600 from the higher tiers of the can support cash payouts the additional $300 payouts for each parents with at least one child age twenty years and below and the $100 PA passion car top hops which will be given in cash for Singaporeans aged 50 and above details I in the annex not everyone will need these cash pay offs I'm very encouraged that many have written to me my ministerial colleagues and MPs that they do not need a cash payout and suggest that we give this to those who need the cash more I thanked fellow Singaporeans for your thoughtfulness I urge those who can to donate to charities under giving dot SG website or the Community Chest courage fund or to directly share it with others for those who still need more support please approach our social service officers and community centres to apply for new schemes such as the temporary relief fund and upcoming kovat 19 support grants which is available from May 20-22 as existing Comcare assistance some Singaporeans will also be emotionally affected or distress in the spirit so besides financial support let us provide emotional and mental health support to our people our community mental health support services will continue to provide cane support for clients through phone consultations or home visits for those who may need more support over the weekend MSF announced that we will set up a 24/7 national care hotline in this time of need I'm glad that mental health professionals and trained volunteers have stepped forward to offer their help in setting up the new hotline thank you this additional measures will cost 5.1 billion dollars with four billion dollars for the additional support for businesses and workers and 1.1 billion dollars for the Solidarity payment the president has earlier given her in principle support for the government to draw up to 17 billion dollars from past reserves to fund some of the measures in the resilience budgets to save jobs and businesses I also told members that when then that I was prepared to propose to the president further draws on past reserves should he be necessary with the significantly stricter pre-emptive measures needed to protect Singaporeans and our families it is now necessary for us to propose a further draw on past reserves this measures will impact our workers and businesses severely additional support will be required to save jobs preserve capabilities and provide immediate direct assistance to Singaporeans to help them fight through this exceptional and difficult period therefore I've sought and obtained the president's in principle support to draw on an additional four billion dollars from past reserves specifically this will be used to fund the enhanced job Support Scheme the temporary bridging loan program and enterprise financing schemes and the solidarity payments to Singaporeans details are in the Annex the remaining 1.1 billion dollars will be funded from the fiscal space of this term of governments to effect the additional spending for the measures that I've announced today I intend to seek Parliament's approval at a committee of supply to increase the supplementary estimates that were presented to Parliament on 26 March this year on the certificates of urgency I was subsequently SiC Parliament's approval to introduce a revised supplementary supply bill Decatur's for the additional required taken together the government's response to covert 19 rota fifty nine point nine billion dollars or about twelve percent of GDP the overall budget deficit for financial 2020 will increase to forty four point three billion dollars or eight point nine percent of GDP details in the annex this is an unprecedented budget for extraordinary times the situation remains highly fluid and uncertain the government stands ready to provide further support should it become necessary mr. speaker sir before I conclude allow me to say a few words in Mandarin way to Thanh Binh do that Ron Paul Owens IPS a later occasion a TR

mountain national efforts for workers businesses and families to protect both lives and livelihoods we have the plans and the financial resources to carry out this plans without burdening future generations with the bill we are great food are funding generations for their foresight and discipline the key now is how we can pull together in solidarity as a nation to implement these plans and make adjustment as a situation continues to evolve copy 19 is testing nations worldwide and revealing more about governments about each Society of identity and the values that hold us together though the pandemic is global the impacts on each country depends greatly on the different actions and responses of each governments and their people trust and confidence of our people in the government are critical our people must understand that we are facing what we are facing and support what we are doing this is why we have been forthcoming and transparent with Singaporeans we are honest about the uncertainties and challenges ahead and honest about the price we need to pay for what we need to do we have been able to make bow and swift actions because we have the trust of Singaporeans painstakingly built up over the years by delivering for Singaporeans with the circuit breaker in place for the next one month everyone will have to adjust and adapt not just our fiscal routines but our mindsets and habits as Minister Lawrence Wong said every person is in fact on the front lines every Singaporean can make a difference in slowing down the spread of the virus today to keep out the virus every one of us must play our parts be socially responsible by staying home staying safe staying healthy each and every one of us must do our best to stand the escalating infections to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed as we do so we must keep up keep our spirits up and look out for each other especially our seniors and more vulnerable our government agencies as well as many volunteers are contributing their best to care for our vulnerable groups we may not be able to physically visit our extended families and close friends but we can stay in touch and connects through phone or video I'm confident that we can and will who close together as a nation even as we physically distance ourselves to save lives let us unite demonstrate our resilience stay united and press on in solidarity together we will emerge stronger from this ",False,False,False,False
wNXvJ1v1_CU,UI COVID-19 webinar: 1. A systems-level approach to COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore,UCGVAiVgdKxgavnivI162CzA,Usher Institute,2020-03-27T10:45:02Z,"One of a series of webinars focussing on COVID-19 from the Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh. More details of further webinars available: ...",and Susan can get started looks like people with very susan can we start I don't seem to have control of these slides there's a delay okay okay um it's 9 o'clock UK time so let's make a start and my name is Aviv shake I'm director of the usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh and I would like to welcome you to this webinar today that were holding on covert 19 this is the first of our webinars and we hope to continue to run these for as long as it's going to be useful to two colleagues it's a very warm welcome to everybody who's joining us on the Zune platform because we've been overwhelmed with interest in this seminar webinar we've also opened it up and our live streaming on YouTube and we've got colleagues joining us from across the UK but also for a much further afield so we've got colleagues from Colombia Greece Isle of Man Italy Lithuania and Nepal Pakistan Peru Saudi Arabia Singapore Thailand of the US and possibly also many other countries so very warm welcome to all of you and before we get stuck in and I'm gonna I mean I want to ensure that we give maximum time to the presenter I just want to say a couple of words a thing so first of all and thanks to Linda bald and Susan Buckingham and the comms team from the University of Edinburgh who really worked incredibly hard to put this event on in in record time most importantly I'd like to thank professor why way to you who's joining us from Singapore why why we realized is towards the end of the day for you and that you're staying on and we're incredibly grateful for you making the time our rationale for putting on these webinars is really very simple is to try and drive there actionable insights that we can hope save lives from this evolving pandemic that's saving lives directly as a result of people being infected with covert 19 in these complications but also as a result of the crippling economic effect this is happening across the globe and so that's our rationale and and our reason for drawing on expertise from Singapore in the first instance well I hope become evident early in the course of and this webinar and Susan can you move to the next slide please this seems to be freezing you know this isn't proceeding right so you'll have to be aware those is the first time we're doing this and we're getting use this new way of working maybe Susan if you can just take back control of a slide because I can't seem to get this to progress okay and so just while we're waiting for that let me give you a brief bio of ÿÿ - ÿÿ strained as a mathematician at Imperial and then read statistical genetics at Oxford he had a spell as a lecturer Oxford and was also working at the Wellcome Trust Center for human genetics he then returned to Singapore and was involved in setting up the Center for Health Services and policy research and was also the director of it was also the director of the Centre for infectious disease epidemiology and research it's a very very impertinent skillset and why currently serves as a Dean of the South Sea Hawk School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore and if you could just proceed to the next slide please Susan hmm seems to be freezing okay so this is my last slide that I wanted to share and I hope the slide bit runs better for you why why but these are data that John Hopkins are putting off pulling off regularly summarized in the Financial Times it's their trajectory of various countries in the course of this pandemic as you can see the UK is on a very steep rise at the moment we're projected to peak in terms of both new cases and and also in mortality over the course of the next few weeks and so we're really in still bracing ourselves for the worst of this but as you can see Singapore is an outlier in this respect and we're very keen to try and learn from colleagues in Singapore what they've done in any transferable lessons that we might be able to derive for the UK and beyond and so why over to you thanks so much for joining you really appreciate this right thank you very much so I'm sharing my screen right now and I hope everyone can see this so before I start thank you very much for people who have joined from different parts of the world I hope they're in my sharing of what I think done it will provide a guide in terms of helping different countries decide on different measures that will be appropriate one of the things that our emphasized is that during the talk please do spend some time to think about some of the measures that I talked about and whether they are relevant in your own country's context particularly taking into account of the socio-economic development the cultural context and also the availability of Technology and others so it is very important right now that we have a very appropriate evaluation of what are the individuals country's capability and capacity to adopt certain measures and if we are unable to what are the other methods and measures that we should be adopting quick mentioned that that what I'm presenting it's actually from a public health perspective and I do not represent a Singapore government nor the Singapore Ministry of Health in any way in any way and this is not meant to give a comprehensive review of all Singapore has done but some of the key pertinent aspects that I feel from a public health perspective it is it has been most relevant and most effective now I think it's important to start off by saying that Singapore we had our dry run of managing pandemics from what happened in 2003 with SARS and Singapore was hit quite badly by sauce back then and we very quickly realized what are the gaps in our health system what are the gaps in the societal responses that we need to put in place and that's where we have a phase of learning and we are starting to see perhaps some of the learning the lessons that we have taken on board to be proving effective at the moment so it's important to start up by reflecting what is the current situation of kovat in Singapore this is a graph looking at the the epidemiological curves since the start on the 20 the of January and if I could just draw attention to the left panel the the highlighted part in blue you would see that in the parts of January and February the red line and the blue line pretty much tracked each other very well they were almost parallel to each other the red line indicates the number of new cases that the number of cases cumulative cases that Singapore had at that particular point in time the blue line indicate the cumulative number of discharged or recover cases that we have and this is these two lines are particularly important for national responses because if you see that the red line is very much parallel to the blue line as what is seen in January and February this is saying that your health system is able to cope very well the number of people coming in every day is pretty much the same as the number of people being discharged in that sense there is an equilibrium state most health system will be able to cook well but if you know you look at what is happening what has happened in the past three weeks in March that is where it gets worrying because the red line has escalated very significantly with a steep gradient but the blue line is still maintaining a steady increase it isn't increasing as quickly as the red line it means that we are starting to see a lot more cases in Singapore but the hospitals are not able to discharge them quick quickly enough it is not a problem at the moment the Singapore's hospital has the such capacity so at the moment we're still able to deal with it but this is a sign that we should all be concerned with and that it's why I mentioned issues around fatality rates those are of academic interest for an operational perspective what there's two lines that we are saying the red line and the blue line that we're tracking are absolutely critical because no matter which health systems they were talking about no country currently has the search Basti to do with the load that we are seeing happening in different parts of the world so this is where we need to be very practical about the our capability to handle this disease talking about case fatality rates when how systems are stretch when hospitals are stretched this is where fatality will increase when there is insufficient in ICU beds insufficient ventilators for people who who genuinely need it that means care will be compromised and that's where fatality rates increase so that's where I want to highlight the bits about there's a lot of interest around fatality rates in the world but given what we are seeing globally what is important right now is really to focus on understanding what is the capacity within individual health systems to cope with this now the next slide actually shows the linkages in Singapore we spent our people spend a lot of effort immense effort to try and identify where each individual case is coming from is it coming from overseas is it coming from being a community transmission on the ground in Singapore the case linkages the contact tracing efforts that Singapore has put in as in phenomenal I will talk about that separately but you could see of this plot this graph that I've shown you it looks like a very simple graph but there are thousands of hours of of efforts being put in to really trace and this is that this is very important for countries that are still in the initial parts of the epidemic spread in their country because if there are sporadic cases there are local clusters it is still possible to try and trace and isolate people that are in contact with the confirmed cases this may not be relevant anymore in countries like Italy like the UK where there is widespread community transmission and then it's where different methods may have to come in and we can talk about that in a bit I wanted to talk about the situation early in early March because as of early much you could see that the import the cases pretty much came from China and that is very reflective of the global situation early on but you could see the case numbers from case 113 onwards we start to see importations coming from different parts of the world no longer from China and that is a very important aspect for countries that are managing the the current situation nationally and if I move on to the others plot this is the current situation as of last week you could see right now the importation from other parts of the world way surpass the importation from China and that is the trend that countries will have to bear in mind as they start to think about what are the travel advisories what are the measures that need to be put in place to guard against further importation from different parts of the world so given the situation that are highlighted what has Singapore actually done and I think it's it starts from the very beginning I talked about the 23rd of January as that at the point in time where we saw the first case early in January they were already in the plans to set up a mountain ministry task force to signal that this goes beyond a health crisis this is a national crisis it is a global crisis as such the response must be beyond a health sector response it must include manpower it must include national development and and very crucially include elements of trade as well as communication and that's why the task force that was set up there was governing the response in Singapore was actually a whole-of-government response and one of the things that we did early on in January was that when we saw that there were signals indications of an suspicious infection that has emerged because the world first heard about the first case on the 31st of December from the 2nd of January onwards we started screening temperatures from on four flights from who haunt this escalate that subsequently to all flights coming into Singapore and the of January temperatures squeak we again can talk about whether it is sensitive enough there have been studies from the UK that's suggested that temperature screening is at best 50 percent sensitive meaning it will only pick up about half of the people with the disease but this is a measure that can be implemented at a large enough scale that is sets of sufficiently sensitive if we now look at the left panel talking about the limitation of entry for visitors and this is where we started to restrict in influx of people or visitors from different parts of the world depending on the spread in their country so we have not taken a measure that says from the very beginning we stopped all travelers but we took a measure that is appropriate given the situation in the respective countries such as in South Korea subsequently in Iran in parts of Italy and then subsequently to France right now just a couple of days ago Singapore actually closed the borders to all short-term visitors this means that anyone that is not a Singaporean not a permanent resident or a holder of a long term work pass will not be a lot to come into Singapore auto transit in Singapore and I think this measure reflects the cut the current global situation in terms of the spread of coronavirus why is this necessary because Singapore actually has always been a major international hub for flights and aviation we see on average about 1 million travelers coming into Singapore every month and especially during the early months in January and March we had do restrict travelers coming in from China given that a coin sight with the national holiday season in China for the Chinese New Year or spring festival so there will be a lot of travelers coming from China into Singapore so there is the necessary response that Singapore puts in to restrict people coming into Singapore some of them will bear the risk of being infected when they are coming in in Singapore we have a a response that was set up as part of our pandemic preparedness plan which we call the dose call it signals to the public what is the level of preparation and what is the degree of spread that is currently that the country is currently facing and in peacetime it is in green and currently the situation is in orange so we we move from a state of yellow to orange slightly more than a month ago and this actually signaled to the public very clearly what it means and what are their personal responsibilities as well as corporate responsibility that needs to be taken when we escalate the dose con level to the appropriate colors at the moment Singapore is not in the DOS core level of rate yet where there are school closures there's closures or workplace and but we are currently in the orange status we also put in place mint data resocialize dancing and this is aligned with our efforts to really try and detect cases early contact trace who are the people that have been in touch with people there are confirmed cases and to isolate them quickly so people who are in contact and suspected to be carriers they are issued with the strictest order very on early on since 28th of January with the quarantine order what we put in place then is what about people who return from hot zones in the world we started off with a leave of absence which is to get people to stay at home not to go to work if they return from specific countries with transit widespread community transmission but we realized very quickly quickly that we need to enforced we need to enhance the strictness of this and we move to of what we call a stay home notice the stable notice is mandatory but it is slightly weaker than a quarantine order that means individuals have to be completely isolated whether it is in specific government facilities or whether in their home if isolation is possible if not possible they will be moved to government facilities state home notice is weaker they can stay with their home family members but they must remain at home they cannot go to work they cannot go out so they cannot go exercise and I so those are the mandatory social distancing or physical distancing effort next is I talked about the contact tracing and that is really due to the immense efforts from teams of 10 people each team working every day every week to really look into how people are moving moving and this are people who have been confirmed to be infected the the contact tracing team would actually look interview each infected cases each infected case ask them where they've been in the past 14 days who would have been in contact with sometimes there will be gaps in the recall this is where there is in collaboration with even the police with the detective and this art negation Department very used to solving crimes but now they read that they've been read averted to look into how do they use the that's a skill set and the technology to look at footages from CCTV cameras to really learn about how people are moving which taxi which camp that that an individual has gone into what is the cap taxi number the carpet number identify who are the possible people who have been sitting in the same taxi during that period of time so this is really a cross ministry effort not just from the health sector but also involving the police department to come in in about last week the government actually introduced a new technology for contact tracing it is called trace together and we the government has strongly encouraged citizens to download this trace together technology onto mobile phones what it does it uses a Bluetooth method there individuals who have been in close proximity for an extended period of time they will automatically record that this individuals have been in contact it preserves anonymity anonymity by recognizing only mobile phone numbers only in a situation of contact tracing wouldn't they require that the law will be enacted to pull up data otherwise confidentiality is always maintained and this is true the use of technology to really try and enhance contact tracing beyond individual recalling now I talked about having a whole-of-government approach and one aspect that Singapore has always focused on is how do we communicate the situation very clearly to the public and there are three layers of communication that are necessary one it's really about communicating the current state of the disease in the country the second its communicating what are the new rules regulation new and possible measures that should be put in place and it's really talking about what are the personal safety measures personal useful information for individuals and community to know about things like hand-washing hygiene and even information from the royal health organization there is a government channel that is exclusively dedicated to this it relies on the what act technology pretty much anyone in Singapore with a mobile phone will be using whatsapp and that's where you can sign up and receive daily updates sometimes even free updates per day to learn about the current situation and government measures this has actually helped to clarify a lot of fake news and mistaken beliefs around the coronavirus one aspect that is very important to talk about must be the clinical preparedness and clinical responses because we we had SARS in 2003 the country realized that there is a need for a dedicated hospital that is specific for managing outbreaks and that's where we have a national center for infectious diseases it was rather timely introduced since August 2018 in addition to that all hospitals actually under those specific drills which we call exercise Sparrowhawk very similar to a military drill which is meant to simulate an outbreak situation and how with hospitals especially the frontline workers cope with personal protection and minimizing risk to other community and others patients in the hospital as well as looking into how what is the protocol to gradually free up it intensive care units as well as isolation wards to start receiving cases those drills have been very important in Singapore's pandemic preparedness plan so what key element of an outbreak of this nature is that people typically were presenting themselves firstly to the GP the general practitioner through the primary care networks and this is where Singapore activated the public health preparedness clinics firstly to reduce the cost of consultation secondly having a mandated medical certificate to encourage people with certain symptoms to stay at home rather than to go to work through this approach it is a much clearer signaling to the public where to go when you have certain symptoms this has been very important in preparing the clinic the clinicians and our health care workers to respond to the current pandemic crisis for the financing sight we started off clearly saying that we will pay for the medical bills and testing for everyone that has been infected but last about two weeks ago Singapore change it stands to only include people who are working in Singapore that includes the migrant workers and also desserts and permanent residents this has happened because there were visitors that took advantage of Singapore's health care comprehensive health care financing to actually come into Singapore even when they know that they already have been infected so that firstly they can receive completely subsidized health care and then secondly to to take advantage of the healthcare services that are available in Singapore that is why the country very rapidly change its its approach towards healthcare financing to look after only people to have con generally have contributed to Singapore and that includes the migrant workers I think this bit on healthcare financing is absolutely critical citizens and people the logos in Singapore must be assured that they will not bear catastrophic poverty if they present themselves for treatment otherwise there will be a situation that people do not seek help seek professional medical treatment but remain in the community even when they're infected and then go on to spread any onward transmission in the community this is very crucial countries like Japan like Thailand like China they have very quickly issued statements to say that treatment will be covered by their universal health care schemes or other form of national financing schemes to relieve any concerns and worries around health care cost I talked about the cost and I also talked about the leave of absence and stay at home notices for people we the country realized earlier on that there will be people who worry about their livelihood if in the event that they are exposed and if they come forward to say that I've been exposed I should be on a leave of absence or just to stay at home they worry about their likelihood so the government in very early on they actually put in place and you could see this happens in the late January they put in place a financing scheme to help people who have to stay at home because they have been exposed they receive a hundred dollars a day for every day of the two weeks that they have to stay at home and there are certain additional schemes for certain people including cab drivers that they do get once-off allowance as well as well as rental waivers this really helps the individuals with their livelihood and maintaining in terms of providing for the family but equally it encourages people to come forward to say that I have been exposed I ought to be isolated from the public and not to be working very important measures that has been put in place I think right now when we talk about multi sectoral cooperation this is quite clear that we do see globally that the military has been deployed to help in controlling as well as to manage the crisis situation in terms of diversion of cross and so on Singapore we did that as well we brought in the military to help repair masks that are subsequently distributed to members in the community we also talked about the use of the police the detectives to really use the skill set that they have to investigate people movement and the people here are the in fact the cases the movement or factory cases so we can appropriately identify who happy I exposed and who ought to be isolated appropriately now one of the issue that I think globally we are facing is this problem of fake news there are a lot of fake news in terms of government rules regulations there are equally fake news about what one ought to be doing to recycle masks recycle PPEs or even what kind of treatments are effective i see that all these fake news actually harm people it harm lives and it actually can result in deaths so what singapore has done again is to put in place the necessary regulations very early on to say if you are spreading fake news we will send you a warning to let you take down the post or to correct the post if one doesn't obey there will be certain laws that are thrown at these people who persist in spreading fake news i in some self i talked about using laws to put them do actually control the spread of fake news this is where we have instances that the country is not afraid to actually use legal measures to enforce because what is the point of asking people to to stay mandated stay at home or in quarantine when there are no enforcement of that so you could see here that there are people who have been charged under the infectious disease act for breaking the law in terms of not staying at home and they have to or when they are effectively breaching the entry requirements and a provost that they need to come into the country some of the things that i will talk about in over the next few slides are things that are increasingly put in place because of the different the evolution of the situation in singapore so we saw that there were clusters earlier on in February that will link to community gatherings of people who are coming together for karaoke which is a very popular activity in Asia and so that was a pain point for the country and we quickly regulated that to avoid gatherings large gatherings or people that are coming together in to participate in activities that have a high risk of transmission so you could see that we start to suspend lessons and classes for community centers and these are places where the public tend to come together for for activities for recreational activities and we also start to put in place physical distancing measure if you look at the picture on the right panel there is a sign of one restaurant on the right side is a restaurant that has a really put in place physical distancing measures by by physically barring people from sitting at certain tables on the left side you could see that that is before a restaurant that has yet to adopt that measure even our ministers in terms of they are giving their daily briefing they themselves follow the rules of physical distancing and I see that equally as happening in the daily briefings that the UK government is giving to the journalists and to the public in addition to the community restrictions in yesterday taking effect yesterday midnight or rather this morning midnight there is a widespread closures of entertainment outlets and again this are clubs bars cinemas theaters places where people will congregate and in a large crowd in an environment which is rather conducive for the disease to spread this measures are put in place onto the end of April so you can see that we gradually move up that the level of stringent stringency and in terms of the measures that the country is adopting responding to the situation that we are facing this is something that happened in the news and Reuters BBC has picked up on this as well that right now evylyn for individuals to be in public spaces they should be sitting at least one meter apart or standing one meter apart and this is really focusing on non-transient settings such as shopping malls and restaurants this is again to try and encourage people to maintain the necessary physical distance to minimize personal risk this is an approach that the country adopts to avoid having a lock down mechanism because the option is if individuals if communities do not follow this rules the country may actually move into a lockdown approach but if individuals are able to follow some of this rules this allows the country to continue functioning with the necessary movement people whooping and goods and services movement without requiring a lockdown approach in terms of the physical measures to try and manage the situation the fiscal measures announced there were additional budget there was announced yesterday to help individuals to help households and to help businesses maintain their resilience during this very difficult time I won't go through the following four slides and I know that because this is recorded I will just very quickly flesh the four slides so people can go back and look at them but it's really aiming at helping individuals by minimizing unemployment trying to increase liquidity cash payments for individuals to take them through this difficult time helping the stabilize businesses by deferring cost minimizing any additional payment ensuring liquidity in the system as well as supporting household particularly the least fortunate and the community trying to encourage the community to help others as well so I want to quickly move on to the next part which is really around how academia and research have been coming in place to guide the National response and this is where more dollars including people that are in the UK in Hong Kong there have been put working very hard to come up with models look at how the disease will spread equally Singapore has relied on a very strong modelling team to really guide the response in the country where there are specific developments including technological developments that are made available to the Ministry of Health for them to guide you chart their response in terms of whether school holidays should be extended schools should be closed transportation networks should be closed and what is the impact to the spread of the disease in the country by using this measures it by using an evidence guided approach it actually helped the policymakers to decide are certain measures too extreme and unnecessary at this point or are suits at the measures to legs and ought to be ramped up so that has been pretty much the hallmark of the response in a country thus far at the same time the government has actually very quickly activated a team to synthesize evidence globally on aspects that are related to clinical characteristics of the disease diagnostic vaccine therapeutics related to the disease and what are the global culture around containment measures perhaps for other outbreaks that have worked or that have not worked in the past some of this evidence synthesis are now being publicly available and not just restricted to the government the link is what I've shown on the web but I will want to move on do next about what the community the enterprise have taken on board one of the features that Singapore has has been able to execute is really debt of a national campaign and the national campaign is something that Singapore for the past 30 40 years we have had national campaigns on different aspects so when we roll out a national campaign saying that it is the individual that is most responsible to contain this outbreak people do respond appropriately to it and this is where or the furthest right panel is a copy of the newspaper every single day the front page has a panel that is like it reminds individuals that what to do if you have certain symptoms these days the front page actually talks about what to do when you are in public spaces and what are the new rules around not congregating in public places very similar to some of the rules that have been announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson a couple of days ago trying to get encourage people to stay at home but in Singapore we rely on national can base to really tell people and people do respond very actively on it when I talk about national campaigns we also talked about the use of celebrities songs to really up live to bring community people together we make use of advertisement timing you can imagine there is a there is a program of a cooking show by Jamie Oliver the moment that the effort is becomes the first advert is an advert reminding people about their personal responsibility on what they should be doing and what they should not be doing with respect to containing coronavirus and that is a very important way to increase health literacy in the community within a very short span of time and you could see we also rely on comics there are comics that have been produced to really correct some of the myths including the use of surgical masks and so on and this are spread in the in public we also have business continuity plans which we call BCP that has been established as a framework for crisis management not specifically to Cove it but prior to Cove it we already have business continuity continuity plans they have been established in industry in education sector including even in my ministry my university in my faculty we have BCPs that are put in place what do we do if we now have to shift or learning to ela online learning formats and this is where having the preparation has allowed the country to continue quite a significant part of our function since the start of the crisis there's a lot of corporate and social solidarity in terms of the politicians the policymakers senior management's of different companies willingly step stepping forward to say we will take pay cuts to help to keep businesses in place to help to keep liquidity in place to help preserve jobs and I think that has been very important one of the issues that I highlighted earlier on was really around migrant workers and you could now see that internet in times like this the migrant workers in many societies many countries will tend to be the one the health of the micro workers will be will be compromised they will be the ones that are secondary to the health of the citizens in Singapore we have volunteers we have schemes that are put in place including the healthcare financing that I talked about that really looked after the migrant workers as well because that's what Professor Jeremy Lin has said in this quote that the chain is really as strong as the weakest link and if we do not look after the migrant workers if they are infected they become thus the vectors that will continue the transmission in the country so this is a call to all the people who are listening as well please do remind your governments that equally they need to start thinking about the the vulnerable parts communities in in your country as well as the health of the migrant workers absolutely important otherwise we will not be able to manage this whether as as a country or whether internationally as a as a globe at this point I want to spend a bit of time talking about what factors have a low this measures to work and this is the context that I highlighted at the very beginning Singapore has been very small and what I've done here is to map the size of Singapore around London and you can see that Singapore actually is much smaller than the circumference that is met by the m25 Ring Road we also have only a limited number of entry points into the country and that makes it a lot easier to regulate the entry into some of into the country if now you compare this situation with many countries in Europe where because of the agreements that have put in place people movement tend to be a lot fear this has become a problem in terms of trying to manage the importation risk for countries and the size of the country is a clear benefit at the moment in terms of the edge are responses that we can put in place secondly I talked about the national campaigns and you can see from the very beginning in Singapore's development we have relied on national campaigns to really move the country's people to really understand that there will be instances where the collective group does surpass the individual good and and Singaporeans it generally respond very well to national campaigns and I see this to be one of the reasons why the people is able to take to the coal to be personally responsible to be socially responsible whether it is in terms of personal hygiene habits or in terms of the responsibility to be practicing physical distancing the third it's really in terms of the trust that people have with the ruling government what I've done here is actually on the leftmost panel it is a measurement by elderman in terms of trust is a trust index and very broadly you can see that we have we are very fortunate to have a population that do have a higher degree of trust with the ruling government and in time in crisis movements like this it is absolutely important for the people to trust that the government has the right measures that are put in place to protect them but at the same time the government needs to earn that trust as well and I would say as a Singaporean and as a Singaporean who has spent many years overseas during my professional career I have not seen many other countries that spend so much effort the governments of the other countries spend so much effort trying to maintain and retain the trust of the population and and that is where the trust has come in very important when the citizens of Singapore is able to follow the advice and to trust that the government has implemented certain advice for the collective good and lastly it's also some of the measures that are talked about including the fiscal measures really comes because Singapore we have been very fortunate in terms of our general country's wealth to put in place certain responses I must come up front to say that the response that we put in place some of it will not be replicated replicable in other country simply because of the the well status of the country so this are some of the measures that we have to bear in mind that the measures we put in place must be dependent on the context depending on the current epidemiological situation of the disease in the country in terms of what ought to be done and what ought to be scaled up so in summary the ability and the inability for a country to respond during a crisis like this really depends on the decisions that have been taken in the past whether it is to earn trust whether it is to prepare the hospital facilities whether it is in stockpiling of essential goods and weeks service goods and resources medical resources those are absolutely essential right now Singapore we are continuing with our containment strategies that includes detecting cases early through contact tracing isolating them trying to find place ways to reduce imitations but at the same time the country is preparing for mitigation measures that we take a very much context-dependent success of implementation is also context dependent right now there is I think we still have some time before very widespread community transmission in the country equally there are many countries out there which are seeing limited community transmission you are the countries that you still have the time to prepare do not squander this time and when I say don't squander this is a checklist that I've put together in terms of what I mean by not squandering use this time prepare your your health care workers well in terms of training in terms of equipment seek help from countries like China or from the World Health Organization you need be there there's a checklist and we'll go through all of them but equally I would highlight that there is a link that I also put forward whu-oh has put forward a checklist for countries on how they should be preparing to respond at different phases of their epi curve so with that I think I will end and I'm very happy to take questions right now thank you very much so why I mean I'm sure and had we been in person there will be an enormous applause for you both thank you so much for such a wonderful summary of the range of work that's going on so we have about 15 minutes left and we're going to try and be respectful of time so I'm going to try and rush through some of these questions that come in there are a number of these and so why why they're the first there's a series of questions around case definition so as you're talking about cases has case definition changed over time are these cases only those admitted to hospital or they also those with less severe or asymptomatic individuals and then there's a question about what happened on the 6th of March because there's a move from a kind of linear to an exponential trend and so anything on any of those questions that you can share right so on the case definition early on the case definition actually relied on people with previous travel history to the hot zones and that means in parts of January and February hot zones include China parts of South Korea parts of Italy and Iran but gradually the case definition expanded to include people with in influenza-like infections particularly with new mode with a confirmed pneumonia infection and this are the people that we identify for for testing and you mentioned what happened on the six of March actually on the 6th of March this is where a large community cluster were identified and that those who are groups of people that came together for karaoke sessions in February and sufficient time has passed that they an entire cluster of em emerge and that suddenly showed a significant jump in the number of cases that were reported although back to you brilliant thanks Sam my way so there's a question from Kemal and it says in the UK we're only encouraging those who are severely ill to see their doctor and get tested it seems to be a very very different approach in Singapore so a can you confirm that and B what do you think this will have on our estimates in the UK of the number of cases in transmission related issues I think in Singapore right now we have a very clear communication to the public if people are ill we're following with specific symptoms that there are indicative of a corona virus infection they are firstly directed to one of the public health preparedness clinics which the GP clinic it's specific GP clinics managing this or equally they could call a hotline to activate ambulances to come and pick them up it is important for people who are feeling unwell with sim with suspicious symptoms to seek medical help and that it's where the the doctors will ascertain whether to follow up with additional testing or to send them home with a 5-day medical leave that and with the clear reminder that they have to stay at home and I should actually touch on this point that over the past day or two Singapore actually change its infectious disease Act to say that people who have been given a 5-day medical leave must stay at home they will be breaking the law if they actually venture out of their home as well so those are actually indications firstly to identify people who are ill and to try and minimize any onward transmission by by letting them seek care and seek the necessary testing as early as possible the second is also to remind people who are who are ill but not with coronavirus symptoms to really respect the need to stay away from the public even do try to minimize any other transmission of any form of infection Oh what do you my thank you said the next questions from Bernard from Kenya and he's asking about what are you doing to sustain your health force at this incredibly difficult time so that is a very good question because at this very difficult time it is actually the health force that will be overwhelmed by the load as well as the need to maintain a certain degree of protection and against any hospital infections so what the country has put in place is that they have actually worked with the private hospitals as well to really end and roll and list their assistant to help look after milder cases so the most severe cases at the moment are still managed in most most most of the moon most of the severe cases are still managed in the public hospitals at the moment we have yet to see a situation that our health system is overwhelmed what that means is that we still have such capacity for intensive care units we still have capacity for ventilators so there is a degree of rotation among our health care workers that is aiming to preserve and preserve their energy and attention for any subsequent big waves that the country will be facing but in terms of protecting our health forces we have made it very clear that we will prioritize the distribution or personal protective equipment do our frontline workers so our hospitals including the doctors and nurses in the 900 public health preparedness clinics our primary care clinics they have the necessary PPE to protect themselves from infections in the health care setting over to you great so can I just ask colleagues who are listening in so we've got around 30 questions and there's only a few minutes left of your blood particular life question answered can you up vote it appears higher up on my screen why why and they traced together technology is it available for use in other countries or is em confined to Singapore no not at all in fact the team that has developed is a government team and they are very happy to make this available to countries that are that are interested to use it and my understanding is that the trace together team has actually actively been approaching other countries as well to share the technology and it will share this technology freely without any IP rights to it because at this point in time I think it is due the collective good that every country is able to manage this well and I'm personally I'm very proud that the trace together team is able to say this one will be a public good any country that wants to use it get in touch with us we will share it specifically people online people who are online who wants to learn more about race together once again it in touch with the team that are developing trace together please reach out to me through the email address that I flashed on the screen now brilliant thank you why why so the next question is around policing and military levels so challenges around importing distancing measures so you know the UK world I mean do you know what you're sort of policing a military ratio is in Singapore compared with the UK any sense of that issue I'm afraid this question so I is around mental well-being any signs of sort of severe anxiety in the population depression kicking in so anecdotally we do not have official statistics yet but anecdotally we are starting to see an increase in reports on domestic violence's on also anxiety and people not coping very well particularly among some of the more vulnerable communities such as the elderly as well because when we start to put in place physical distancing measure whether it is in Singapore or other countries the vulnerable communities will be the ones that are at highest risk and because this is where volunteers who use who usually volunteer in health health elderly homes or health care homes if they stopped coming because of certain restriction that is where it will impact so at the moment I do not have the numbers for a evidence-based discussion but I do see anecdotally we are starting to see increasing reports of mental distress in the society Oh what do you okay so I want to get this question from Dennis from Uganda a really important question so what can low resource countries do in this context and because you've already mentioned that this is some of what you're doing is even challenging for the UK board about low resource environment right so this is a very important question and I would like to emphasize that you have to look at what is the current situation in your country i I follow the epidemiological situation in the across different countries in the world quite a number of countries in know in low resource countries currently we report fewer numbers of infections now there are a few reason that could be the case a clear reason is that if they are not if they do not have sufficient testing capacity clearly they are not able to report confirmed case as well so it could be a situation that countries are really we see are suffering from widespread community transmission but they just don't have the capacity to test that that's one possibility the second possibility is that because of limit that travels to some of this countries they have been very fortunate not to see widespread community transmission yet so I'm going to break up my response in different parts the first part is really in terms of if the country genuinely have yet to see widespread community transmission they are seeks for any cases they are seeing small-scale clusters this is really where the countries must try their very best effort to do contact tracing as best as they can and to isolate this people the contact of confirmed cases as well as they can now in the absence of the use of the availability of test phone for sufficient testing so it is the best approach to treat every suspected case as a confirmed case isolate them isolate them well and quickly trace the context well in terms of contact tracing in in countries that have much less dense environment there may actually be easier approaches to perform the contact tracing rather than to have to rely on complex methods such as the use of CCTV to really pinpoint in a densely populated environment so coming back countries right now facing small-scale spread please continue to think about how do we identify suspected cases treat them as confirmed cases isolate them first and isolate their context well this would be very crucial in minimizing further onward transmission in the population these are public health fundamentals now in resetting it in resource-poor setting where there's widespread community transmission I move to the second part of the equation and that is where the government's may need to think about different varying degrees of lockdown mechanism but lockdown is easy for us to say in words but the country have to think about how do they manage people who are in different communities particularly needy communities vulnerable communities people that may be living in slums that may not have the the capacity to actually cope with a lockdown for two weeks or four weeks in terms of food in terms of essential services or essential supplies well what do you learn okay so we're at 10 o'clock so Susan can I just ask you to put them the slide up over the forthcoming seminars so first of all I mean why why incredibly grateful for you making the time and working through these questions whether we've advertised this for at 1:00 hours we're going to be respectful of that so for those of you who need to leave now please do so we will lots of people with pressing commitments but these are details of the next two seminars that we've lined up so I mean the first hand will come Tobit has just been published from China and we'll be having the widget editor-in-chief of that timbo Liang speaking next Thursday and then we're also lining up a presentation from Canada so please put these in your Diaries and we'll and if you have any suggestions of other people that you'd like to hear for you to get in touch and through the Asha communications channel I mean everybody should have an email address from us we'll be delighted to try and set that up and what why why has kindly agreed to do it for those who've you can stay on and would like to it just worked through a few more questions and so what we'll do is we'll carry on for another 15 minutes for those of you who can stay on and would like to answer why why there's I mean two more questions around case definition so is this by symptoms or is it confirmed and it confirmed is this by PC RSA and can you also take the question about why do you have I mean you've got a very low mortality rate thankfully but why do you think that's the case right so two questions yes we I mentioned that all suspected cases are sought and then tested tested in terms of testing we used rt-pcr to confirm and we always confirm with two tests so someone who is proven to be negative they have to be negative for both tests before they are clear ascending at discharge otherwise they will always be isolated until we are able to run two tests in terms of mortality I think there are a few reasons that Singapore we have had lower mortality at the moment the first I have to pay tribute to our very accident medical teams there are staffing the hospitals at the moment they have put in a lot of effort to really manage patients coming in and secondly it's really right now we have the capacity to really identify people earlier on because of the contact rate and I think that the evidence is very clear for the corona virus infection if you are able to pick people up at the early parts of the infection a change in infection cycle then it's where the prognosis is much much better and because of the intense contact tracing and testing this is where we are able to identify people early on in the early stages of infection and the last reason has to be that at the moment we our health system is not yet at a situation of being overwhelmed like what we're seeing in some European countries in the early parts of in hubei and also in the United States our hospitals we still have the availability of resources such as intensive care units such as ventilators to take care of the very sick the sickest patient that meets this resources equally if Singapore knows have a massive surge in the number of infections particularly people that requires intensive care I would think that our ability to reduce to keep this mortality low will be severely compromised if we are unable to give the necessary ventilators to patients that need it all back to you and thanks why so this question about the disturbing rise in the number of cases over the last few days and does this mean that the measures that you've put in place are failing good question but my because we have tracked very carefully where the people where the cases are coming from we we at the moment I'm concerned but I'm not overly worried that there will be a significant community transmission that is happening the reason is simple because right now the majority of cases that we are seeing in Singapore are all are mostly importation if we look at the case numbers that are coming in the past week about 80% of them are imported important cases this are returning Singaporeans or permanent residents from other parts of the world coming back to Singapore and we know why that is happening because with the global lock down that is happening in different parts of the world there are many Singaporeans although those that want to come back to Singapore during this period and that it's when if now we have a lot more Singaporeans coming in from hot zones we naturally will anticipate that there will be increasing numbers of people who are coming back and have already been infected in their countries actually to be absolutely honest I expect the numbers to continue rising over the next two to three weeks because of the returning Singapore Singaporeans and permanent residents but I hope that the trend continues that it is importation that we are seeing and very little domestic transmission at the moment back to you thanks very much so Susan can you just dismiss the questions that have been answered please so otherwise it's quite confusing at this mber so from the modeling why what's the worst case scenario that you're working with and from your modelling how long do you anticipate before things return to any semblance of normality so our world modelers have looked at the data and have modeled what is happening in Singapore I would defer to the very strong teams of modulus in the UK in Hong Kong and in other parts of the world that have been looking at the global situation presently so our modulus in Singapore have basically it showed that our current measures without importation would be able to contain the transmission to a very much manageable level now what would that issue be is that even if Singapore is able to contain this there will be the economic aspects of the coronavirus endemic their countries will need to think about because at some point countries will need to start unlocking their national lock downs and that is when globally we will start to see second ways third waves and so on in Singapore we are very pragmatic we know there will be second waves we know there will be third waves and the question is how do we function as a society at the moment to allow life to go to resume as much as normal as possible so that we the core functions including schooling including working and trade and commerce can continue while managing the risk so you could say that we are moving to a we are in putting in measures to mitigate both the health impact as well as the economic impact but very clearly the models suggest that unless the world globally we are able to contain the situation otherwise all we need is just to have a handful of countries not being able to contain as well and the world will continue to see the re-emergence of a coronavirus over and over again although back to you okay so why way maybe this is the last question and nothing will let you go then but just on a slightly lot nicely hearted term there's a question about what a Singaporean is doing to cope with that karaoke all right well I one of the things that I like to talk about is that I do I do regret not investing in Netflix and clearly this is a time that we are encouraging Singaporeans and equally people in different parts of the world stay at home minimize your risk but please maintain your mental wellness as well continue your daily exercises continue eating healthy food that's necessary minimize your intake of alcohol but watch Netflix if you want watch TV this is a time that families actually get the opportunity to come together and bond so don't don't don't squander this time this opportunity I'll go back to you okay so why way and we're so very grateful for you making the time and giving us a chair in a timely and important talk they're also very grateful that you've agreed to I mean take emails and answer any residual questions that are left and really from all of us very best of luck to you and colleagues in Singapore we're dealing with this pandemic so thank you very much indeed thanks everybody for joining and well and the webinar here thanks so much good bye thank you very much thank you everyone ,True,True,False,False

meet that find out i do youtube for a living you know they end up asking me this question it's quite common and i don't think it's rude at all because you know i was once really curious about how people make money online and youtube and how much youtube pays and all this stuff so i totally get it by the way guys in case you hear like kids playing in the background uh it's just my neighbors and stuff so excuse them now unlike other careers where you can kind of just search online and know what sort of salary bracket you can expect from different career paths youtube's very different because there's lots of barrels that come into play when it comes to how much adsense money you're making for example if you're considering maybe becoming a teacher your starting salary might be like 45k to 50k a year whereas doctors they'll earn more so something around 150k to 200k a year something along those lines but when it comes to youtube it's very very different a lot of variables come into play on how much you can earn such as what type of topics you're gonna cover um where your audience is watching from how long they're watching what your views are like so there's just like a lot of variables that come into play when it comes to making money on youtube okay i feel like the easiest way for me to explain is just to show you guys the back end of youtube and show you guys my analytics by the way by me showing you this information i'm not showing off or bragging by any means i'm just showing you this because i know a lot of you guys are curious and this is going to help someone out there because you know maybe you've been considering starting a channel for a while but you kind of don't know and don't know what to expect the pay to be like so i'm going to show you these but keep in mind it's very different for everyone okay so here i have the analytics showing me what my estimated revenue is for the week so here it says 894 dollars and five cents that's based on about 400 000 views this number definitely fluctuates it really depends on how often i'm uploading that week and obviously how those videos are performing here's my monthly revenue so it's about ten thousand two hundred and ten dollars this month estimated for the last 28 days to be exact and on the far right here you can see the play back base cpm and it's 7.57 which means that's how much i get paid per thousand views so i know sometimes people think that the more subscribers you have the more you make but actually it's the views that that actually pay you because the more time people view your videos the more ads they view and that sort of goes up and now this cpm is set by youtube it goes up and down and depends on where your audience is watching from so for example if you have a lot of people watching from the us and there's lots of advertisers from there advertising on youtube and google then your cpm is going to be higher for those countries as opposed to say somewhere like india where people might not be spending that much on youtube so it changes all the time here you can see the monthly estimated revenue for my channel from the last six months and so the best month that i had was in may where i made 15 255 dollars and 55 cents and then it kind of drops a little bit in june july august and then like it just kind of goes up and down but to give you an average sort of view it's probably around 10 to 15 000 that i make on adsense um a month from my channel on the right here you can see that which video performed the best during the last 28 days and it's my blackhead vacuum suction video that made about a thousand dollars for me so this number is purely off just adsense revenue i also make money from brand sponsorships affiliate links selling my own products such as my lashes from petit cosmetics or bags and jewelry cases from mark and scribe also in the future i'm opening up a makeup and nail studio and i'll be running some workshops so that will be another stream of revenue for me now let me know if you want to see a more in-depth video on my different streams of revenue because i really like to diversify i think it's really important so if you're interested in knowing a little bit more about the other things i do you can like let me know below and then i'll be sure to create like a more in-depth dedicated video for that because that in itself is a whole other topic oh another thing i want to mention is that i have been on youtube since 2013 so like seven years on the platform and the first like year or two i guess i didn't make money it was just like a hobby for me and you know slowly but surely my channel picked up and grew and i think like you know a big factor was me being consistent with my content uploading weekly and also having like a niche my channel was mainly like beauty and makeup especially when i first started right and it also helped that i started a series so tina tries it and you know you guys know what to expect when you watch that there's like a like a bit of a format there and i feel like having something like that really helped drive the growth on my channel so if you're thinking of starting a channel please just know that it does take time to earn money it definitely doesn't happen overnight if it does for you you're super super lucky but i think nowadays it's a lot harder as well um youtube has changed a lot and it continues to change and so i guess like you have to be really passionate about the topics or the type of videos you're making to be able to to maintain longevity and just to kind of keep you going and keep you motivated do you and alfred have a shared account how do you split your expenses so in case you guys didn't know alfred and i we work together he does most of like the finance side of my businesses he also manages my schedules and brand deals so he's like the guy that does all the stuff that i don't want to do or i'm not really good at and i'm more of the creative and i focus on content and doing things that i like and so i feel like we're this like working team so when it comes to our expenses actually we don't have a shared account but we own our company and business together but in saying that when it comes to expenses we kind of just split it you know i actually don't really calculate who pays for what because at the end of the day i feel like it's our money you know it's our business and so that's how we kind of you know manage our finances well actually alfred really manages everything i'm just like the person that comes up with all these ideas and kind of just goes with the flow creates content creates these all these like business ideas and ventures and he just makes the finance side happen and he manages all of that in the beginning though obviously before we started working together we had separate accounts and we kind of just split the bill here and there you know if we went out to dinner he would you know get the bill one time and then i would kind of take turns and that's how we kind of worked what do you spend your money on mainly i spend my money on rent that is like a huge chunk of my income and then food clothes um paying my editor like other business expenses and like i said i'm going to be opening up a makeup and nail studio so a lot of my savings have been going to you know fitting out that place the renting and the bond and everything so a lot of my money is going to that what else um car repayments every month utilities and biscuits i spent a lot of money on biscuit actually but you know what overall i am probably a big saver if you speak to alfred he'll he'll tell you that i'm a serial saver it's really hard for me to part with my money and i'm really conscious of like what i'm spending on um i don't really splurge on luxury things i think the only thing that we really spend on is travel but obviously now we can't travel so that's just going to our savings what do you invest in so when it comes to investments i feel like i mainly like to invest in myself my education and like upskilling and like i love doing courses i recently did a nail course so i like to invest my money in education as well as my businesses a lot of the time the profits all go back into the business so i don't really draw an income from those like my brands just yet i just kind of put it all back to help grow that brand i also invest my money in property alfred and i we bought an apartment in sydney as an investment property together alfred actively invests in like these stock markets and i guess private equity i'm not like well versed in that i just kind of like leave that up to him that's his forte what was your view on money when you were younger versus now so growing up i did not come from a willow family in fact you know my parents were both immigrants from vietnam and like many immigrants you know they fleed their country to seek better life elsewhere and they ended up in australia so they literally had to start from the ground up they didn't speak english they did they didn't have any like particular set of skills that they could easily go get a job in and so they had to resort to working long hours in like factories and labor jobs to you know look after my two brothers and i so growing up money was really scarce and we lived in like the cheaper neighborhoods which meant there was like more crime i remember our house would get broke into quite often it was just very unsafe growing up and also like we would wait until council days where people would throw out their old furniture and those were the days that we would get our new furniture you know my dad would actually drive his like car out and try to pick up all these i guess people's old furniture and that would be like how we furnished our house also growing up i did see my parents fight a lot over money i guess it was just like such a hard time for both of them you know they're trying to feed three kids they're in this new country and so they would actually have a lot of like quarrels when it comes to like you know their relationship and unfortunately as a kid i saw that a lot growing up and so my view on money was that i knew we didn't have much of it and i knew it was really hard to get because i hardly saw my parents they worked really long hours and i just knew that if i wanted a better life for my family and i or my future we needed money to get there so when i did get a little bit older and i was old enough to work i just pretty much did anything they could that you know would earn me money even if i hated those jobs you know what i mean i would kind of like stick it out and just do it for the money i didn't think that you could have a job that you liked and still earn money that was that was pretty much my view now that i'm older i still view money as important because after all we needed to you know all survive and so money is still important but now i also really value my time because at the end of the day no matter how much money you make you can never buy time back so i felt like you know if i was stuck in a job that i hated but it did earn me like a good salary maybe that's not worth it because i would like work all these long hours be miserable just to get this paycheck and what can i do with that paycheck you know i can't magically buy that time back and so i really valued like how i spent my time and i tried to make my passions or turn my passions into income and like you know i'm glad that youtube happened and i was able to do that but i didn't think that was possible when i was younger at what age did you start saving i started saving as soon as i started working so in australia you can start working at 14 and 9 months and my first job was at payless shoes in retail and that's when i started saving because my parents stopped giving me allowance so if i wanted something i needed to save up for it and that was really good because that kind of instilled in me and it made me realize the value of money so i was really careful with how i spent it were you ever afraid of not finding your dream job or being stuck in a boring job yes a hundred percent i've worked in jobs that i absolutely hated or i found boring and just so mundane or just like i just was not feeling any passion you know when you wake up and you just dread going to work and you're like should i call in sick and then your head is like full of like excuses that you can make up and then you end up going to work miserable anyway that was me and for the longest time i didn't know what my dream job would be like i didn't know what my passion was i was kind of just like bouncing around doing all these like odd random jobs and never really like sticking with one my biggest fear was not being able to find that one thing that i was supposed to stick with for like 10 20 years because that's what i saw around me people they studied and then stuck with their job for a majority of their lives and i just felt like i i couldn't find that thing you know and i was so frustrated with myself because i kept doing all these different courses and then i didn't really stick with the the career path that i thought would you know be appealing to me and for the longest time i just thought oh my god i felt like a failure but thankfully you know things all worked out and it's funny because all the things that i studied i didn't stick with just those one job but i kind of combined all of them and my skills that i learned over the years to to what i have today so you know if you ever feel a little bit lost or you know you've finished studying a course and you're like actually maybe i don't want to pursue a career in this don't feel like you failed because at least you're still trying to find it like keep moving to the next thing you know keep trying different things because if i just stopped there i you know i don't think i would have found you know youtube and have started all these businesses and have the lifestyle that i have today how do i figure out what career path to take this is a super tough question because it's definitely different for everyone you know some people when they're younger they just know what they want to be when they grow up and then there's others who was like me like that had no idea and kind of fell into it so i feel like my biggest tip would be to make a list of things that you actually enjoy or you're good at and kind of rank them from highest to lowest and then kind of go through that list and figure out like how you can get a taste of that career or be in that industry whether it be like work experience talking to someone watching like videos online do as much research as you can and it's best to be hands-on with it and try to get some experience so you can try it out before you actually commit years and years of like study to it and if that thing on your list doesn't work out move on to the next one and the next one like i said don't give up just keep trying different things and you know nowadays it's very very different to you know 10 years ago nowadays there's so many other ways you can make money you can monetize off your passions if you're an artist maybe back then you'd have to like go through a different path whereas now there's social media and you can actually market yourself and it's completely free should i go for interest or higher income when it comes to career choice again this one's really difficult because it's kind of like up to you what do you value more i can't give you like a a definite answer to this because everyone is different you know younger me i would have definitely chosen the high paying job because growing up i just really thought that money money money was really important and it's okay if you hate each job you stick it out because you have money uh whereas as i got older i realized that you know it wasn't worth the emotional and mental drain and the toll it took my body you know i ended up being like really miserable and i kind of really dreaded going to work i kind of hated life and at the end of the day what for for a paycheck but then you know what are you gonna do with that i feel like the old me i was just living for the weekends whereas now like my job has become my lifestyle and i love it i'm living the dream because i can do what i want and still make a living and i didn't think that was possible so i feel like it's kind of up to you but know that you can kind of have both like don't think that it's one or the other that you have to choose it just might take a little bit longer to get both you know so if you have any interest in something that you feel like oh generally people don't make a lot of money in that but you know i really like it should i pursue it or pick this higher paying job that i don't really like if it was up to me i would definitely choose the thing that i'm interested in and then figure out ways to make money after i get good at it so make sure you don't feel like you have to choose one or the other these days it's possible to have both how do you manage so many businesses i'm really lucky that i have the people around me that i can rely on that i can trust so alfred he does the back end work for a lot of the businesses and then i've got family in australia that help me with like sending out orders and petite cosmetics like my parents my brothers helped me so i'm really lucky and thankful that i have a supportive like team around me without them i honestly wouldn't be able to juggle so many things also i feel like because i have an amazing editor now i'm able to have more time to work on other passion projects like opening my makeup and nail studio were you ever close to quitting youtube i would be lying if i said no i feel like it's quite common for people that have been on this platform for so long to question and kind of think about you know is it time to leave youtube if you guys remember i did have a mental breakdown on my channel a few years back i was just in a bad place then where i was getting all this anxiety suffering from like depression and youtube was no longer a platform that i used for like ex for escaping my everyday troubles that's how it kind of started for me like youtube was this passion thing that i can just pour my energy into and not think about what's happening in the outside world and it would be like my passion project which turned into a career and i really enjoyed it for a while but then i got into this dark space where it kind of consumed my life and i was chasing the numbers and views so much and i don't know i guess like i kind of burnt out to be honest and at that point was when i was like considering should i leave youtube thank god i didn't i felt like i just needed to reset i needed to take a break and diversify my content i really wanted to start doing other types of videos which you guys probably would notice now like i'm doing more crafty videos i'm doing videos like this i'm not just focused on makeup and beauty purely whereas before i felt like i started as a makeup channel a beauty channel if i make other content people won't watch and it was just a narrative that i told myself and it consumed me and i felt really restricted but honestly it was just my thoughts you know and because i took a break and i was able to kind of just focus on my mental health and start doing the things that i loved it kind of put me back on track but yeah to answer that question i did think about it i'm not going to be quitting youtube anytime in the future i feel like i'm in a really good place at the moment so i hope that my channel will be able to grow with me especially later on when i have a family you know i hope you guys will stick around to watch did you have any friends or family who didn't agree with your career choice my family they were completely like okay with it if anything my parents just didn't really understand how anyone could make money online it obviously wasn't like a normal career choice especially when you're looking at it as an asian parent you know you think you know being a lawyer an accountant that's the stable job and that's a normal job whereas nowadays it's very different so i feel like they just didn't understand but they weren't against it the only person that didn't really agree or kind of like doubt my decision was my ex-husband he didn't really think that i could have a successful high-paying job or career doing makeup and youtube and so you know obviously it wouldn't work out but you know i'm kind of thankful that he felt that way and that helped fuel my like my passion even more my want and desire to really make it and be successful just to kind of like prove him wrong you know what i mean so i kind of turned that negativity into something positive that can fuel and keep me going especially when you know i felt like giving up so if you guys are going through something like that where a family member doesn't agree or you know your friends don't understand don't give up you know re-package that negativity and use it as fuel to to keep you going because you're gonna need to dig deep and find out why how you're gonna do it you know just don't give up and don't let other people's views and doubts affect you because as long as you believe in yourself you can literally accomplish anything do you see yourself working a nine to five job i feel like i work more than nine to five i think that's the thing like i own my own business or businesses and so i'm always thinking about work even if i'm not like filming or answering emails or doing physical work i'm thinking about work so i don't think i would ever go back to like a nine-to-five job i guess like maybe you guys mean like go work for someone like an office job i don't think i could do that just because i've had a taste of this entrepreneur life and i just know it's a lifestyle for me i like dictating my schedule i like making decisions based on you know the things that i like and i love creating content for you guys and it's something that i enjoy i don't want to give that up so yeah i don't really see myself working a nine-to-five job for someone else because you know i'm happy where i am did you take out loans to start your businesses pt cosmetics or mark and scribe no i didn't take out any loans so these two businesses are self-funded and that's why i started off small i didn't want to you know take out a hefty loan to start this huge brand and then be in debt and kind of feel like i'm in this vicious cycle where i really need to push sales and make money i just knew i didn't want to be in that position i felt like for me i just needed to start small i needed to do most of it myself i need to just learn the ropes and i didn't want to be in debt at all also with pt cosmetics it's pretty much like a family business because it helps pay my my family and it all goes back in and so i really love that i was able to create like jobs and my parents are able to help me out because you know they don't have a specific skill set and it's really hard for them to find work out outside and they are getting older now so you know i really appreciate whenever you guys buy from my brand for t cosmetics you know you guys actually you know helping my family out now with mark and scribe it's a joint partnership with a friend of mine and so again we just put our money in and started the brand we took no loans out and it's just purely like a self startup business what are you currently saving for so alfred and i have a big goal of owning our own home in australia and we want to be mortgage free and so we're working really hard we're saving for that as well as i'm saving for a lifestyle where i can just do the things that i love and not be worried about just making money from it for example you know i love doing like nail art so i want to be able to do the hobbies that i like but still you know have a roof over my head i don't want to sort of have that worry in the back of my mind about always making money and so i'm saving for that my goal in life is to just do what i love for as long as i can and you know have money just stem from that but not be so focused on just earning money i feel like what i do with my time is super important so i just want to do the things that i enjoy in life okay for this next question i'm going to be choosing it for the giveaway so make sure you answer this what did you want to be when you were younger versus what did you end up doing now when i was younger i wanted to be an art teacher or a comedian i don't know where the comedian side came from i feel like you know when i was younger i loved making my friends laugh so i really enjoyed that and i just thought you know it'd be so good if i had a job that really entertained and just made people laugh all day i also really enjoyed art and i thought that you know i loved doing art i'd love to be an art teacher i could do that all the time and i feel like i kind of do that today with makeup and you know beauty and stuff i'm i'm teaching you guys doing tutorials and it's you know makeup is art as well as nails now i love nail art and obviously you guys knew where i ended up today so let me know guys answer the question what did you want to be when you were younger versus what did you end up doing now i'd be really interested to see how many of you guys actually became what you wanted when you were younger what are some of your best money saving tips okay i feel like one tip that has really helped me a lot and sort of changed my view on how i spend my money is that before i make a purchase especially like a large ticket item instead of just looking at how much it costs i try to calculate how long i have to work to buy that thing so for example say you want to buy the latest iphone and it's two thousand dollars instead of just saying okay well it's two thousand dollars work out how long it takes you to earn two thousand dollars say it takes you a whole month and then ask yourself is this new iphone worth me working one whole month to earn a lot of the times when i do that i feel like it's probably not worth it because you know i especially value my time i feel like you know maybe i can spend it on something else that maybe will help me make more money in the future instead of just splurging and so that really helped me and it's kind of you know stopped me from impulse buying also another great tip is i always think about it's not how much money you make it's how much you save and what you do with that saving for the longest time i was the biggest saver like like i said alfred will tell you i'm a serial saver before i met him i was just used to saving my money i wasn't investing i wasn't making my money work for me and you know it was obviously better than not saving but when you consider inflation in you know in the future i was actually at a loss because my money wasn't growing it was just sitting there and so when alpha came on board you know he really um taught me the importance of investing and so i feel like that was really important that's a really good tip because if you want to build wealth it's very long term and you want to be smart with your money saving it alone in your account is probably not enough and for me because i didn't know any better i just thought that was the best thing which leads me to my next tip i think it's really important for us to just like educate ourselves when it comes to finance i know finance can kind of be like really boring and dry but i feel like if you take the time to learn a little bit and kind of plan maybe visualize what you want in the future what that's going to look like how much is that going to cost and sort of work backwards and figure out okay you know when do i want to retire how much do i want saved up um what sort of investments can i look at or am i comfortable i'm investing or looking at i think it's really important for you guys to just invest in yourself as well as just learning about finance even just the basic stuff is going to help you and there's so much resources online you know i feel like there's so many channels out there as well patricia bright is really good she's got her own channel she makes it really easy to understand so you guys can check out her channel okay i think that's all i'm going to answer for today i hope that i was able to you know shed some more light when it comes to like youtube and money and finances in my experience and how i spend my money if you guys have more questions or if you have requests for topics to cover in this girl talk series

N91gAxQoK2M,Tips to Extending Your Longevity and Your Family&#39;s | Dr Naras Lapsys,UC1hp0pDwWzZPeKqq4K0LoeQ,Brahm Centre,2021-02-08T04:26:05Z,"Dr Naras has a PhD in molecular genetics. His career began as a research scientist investigating obesity and diabetes, at the prestigious Garvan Institute of ...",today let me just uh explain the title a little bit i was listening to a seminar a few months ago with a very prominent longevity medicine doctor and he was talking about these people in the world that live uh much longer than than most and these are the clusters of people in the world that can live to a hundred or more and you may have heard of them these are the people that live in the blue zones and i was really quite surprised to hear that these people actually are not saints they uh they do live and there's things that we can learn from them that help might help might help them live a longer life but they're not perfect and so what the speaker was saying is that they somehow have managed to dodge bullets and what ends up happening is they still succumb to the health conditions that ultimately take our lives uh but they somehow manage to waylay that for an additional 20 years and so this idea that we could actually dodge bullets i thought was fantastic and so that's what i want to talk to you about today how do we do this my my interests really do lie if i think about what i'm most interested and most passionate is i like to help people optimize their health and if they can if their health can be optimized then there's a good chance that their lifespan could also be extended i have been interested in research and science and have trained as a consultant dietitian but then in the last five or six years my interests have really moved into this applied science of longevity medicine and that encompa encompasses so much more than just nutrition and i'll talk about that later on today but i'm interested in helping people improve and change their body composition and their weight because there's health benefits to losing body fat and gaining lean muscle and in some circumstances to lose weight or gain weight i mean very very interested in how we preserve the health of our brain and our cognition and also physically what our bodies are like and then there is all these other things that a dietitian uh learns the psychology of food and how people approach food and the food addictions that people may have gastrointestinal health issues such as reflux and inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome ulcerative colitis there is a host of digestive diseases that somebody like myself can help people with and then the lovely part of actually helping people through conception and pregnancy and uh how they uh feed their child and nurture themselves after a pregnancy so the breadth of the of my interests uh are very wide but today i'll really be talking about this idea of of how do we negotiate our way to a healthier and longer life both for us and our families so in order to do that i do want to explain a topic that i think is very important and this is the this concept of health span and this graph uh this table actually shows it quite well what we can actually expect and singaporeans uh are very fortunate to actually live in a very clean healthy environment and uh actually live to a very very long age um singapore is one of the few countries that has a very uh good life expectancy but really how a life plays out is we are all quite bulletproof as we are young and then as time passes chronic health conditions slowly find their way in and so the period of our life where we are healthy can slowly start to erode and we start to move towards that period of of ill health and then obviously we then succumb to to these these conditions the idea of health span is how long can we extend that period of health in our life and how can we compress that end period where we are not so well and by doing that we can actually give ourselves an extra 10 or 15 or 20 years of very very high quality life and that is um immeasurable as far as i'm concerned and it's in its value and and what we can have from this but then there's this interesting uh thought is that if you're able to have a nice long health span will you also live a little bit longer and if we listen to what scientists are saying is our health expectancy at the moment is actually in in the mid-80s and i'll talk a little bit later as to what i believe is possible but they're already saying that there's this step up and that in the not-too-distant future we could all be thinking that our life expectancy is up to 115 years of age uh and that's a again another big jump but what would be disastrous is to live a longer unhealthier life and so we want to uh extend that period of our lives that is our our health span so let's think about this in a in a more global manner okay of of our own bodies what i what do i think is the fundamentals of of our health span and extending our health span so the the first one is as i was discussing uh with these people that live in the blue zones if you are fortunate enough to get through your 20s and survive the motorcycle accidents the car accidents the um avoiding work injuries and social or holiday injuries that that may take our lives too soon or being in a position where we have the the mental strength to to stay alive what is it that ultimately takes us well what actually it is is cardiovascular disease so stroke and hypertension it's diabetes it's neurodegenerative disease dementia and alzheimer's disease and cancer if we really want to abundance these are the four big players that will ultimately take our and erode our health and will take our lives so if we want to live a long healthy life we want to do what the people in the blue zones do and we want to delay the onset of chronic disease we also have been given one body to live in and for people who uh have owned a bicycle or a motorcycle or a car it doesn't matter how long you look after them for you trade them in and singapore makes you trade them in any way after 10 years so you turn them over but think of the things that you own that you've had since you were a child and you're going to keep um for your entire life very very difficult to think of a single thing maybe a watch so but we have to live in our bodies for this whole time and so again if we're thinking for the future your physical body and your physical capabilities have to be thought of in addition with the idea of uh delaying the onset of of our health conditions and then the last part is what do we do we carry our body and we carry our health but what is the central um controller it's our mind and so we want to be there for it uh and so we have our cognition preserving our beautiful brains looking after our bodies and waylaying the onset of chronic health they're the fundamentals so let's talk about them in in more detail so as i said we want to delay cardiovascular disease and diabetes and dementia alzheimer's disease cancer what do we know about that we have a huge amount of knowledge on this front with at least some of these health conditions so what we want is you want to know where your status is and the the older you become the more we want to know uh where am i at on the front on all of these conditions because what you know you can track and what you know you can do something about now maybe when you are 20 years old it might not be of interest to you but actually i would say that it should and i'll explain that in a moment and parents that i'm talking to grandparents that i'm talking to is to to use the wisdom that you have to perhaps talk to the younger generations and actually have them doing and thinking about the things that i'm about to say but let's talk with heart disease just as an example okay we know a lot about our hearts and we have a lot of blood tests that we can do in order to track what the health of your heart is and here in singapore there are standard blood tests but every year five years ten years research is actually nuancing the tests that we have and if you have somebody that's knowledgeable in this field we can actually learn more and more and more about our heart health more than just some of the standard tests that are out there and up until our age of about 40 or so that's probably adequate but then we can do more than that because with the heart we can look at it and you can have scans and you can do echo tests and stress tests and coronary artery um scores and scans and you can physically see the status and the health of your heart and so these are things that we have available to us with diabetes we also can look with careful blood testing and you can look and see whereabouts you are along the road towards diabetes through simple blood tests with respect to alzheimer's disease and cancer we don't know nearly as much but there are certainly some things that you know that we can do and i'll mention we know and can just physically look at our bodies because as i said we need to be thinking about our bodies as well and so with respect to our body composition we want to know how much body fat we have because the truth of the matter is is that heart disease diabetes dementia cancer all have a very very strong link to the amount of body fat that we carry so it is good to know where you are along that spectrum of body fat and it can be as advanced as getting scans to know the entire composition of your body and it can be right down to your body weight and taking a waste measure but knowing those numbers it's very important we can look at genetic screening you can get tests now and mouth swabs and you can look and see what uh what dna you have and with respect to chronic diseases there are some genes that we we know about that you may be interested in knowing whether you have or not there is an apo e gene that tells you your risk for alzheimer's disease there's a bracha gene that will tell us risks for breast cancer and there are a few others so we have access to this and then we also if you want to be knowledgeable which we want to be knowledgeable is to know risk factors we have risk factors for these health conditions some of which we can't modify there's higher risk of heart disease by being a male well i can't do anything about that but then there's all these modifiable risk factors for all of these health conditions and if we look at nothing other than cancer don't smoke because the risks for cancer and smoking are sky high but if we only use cancer the next one is carrying extra body fat and then there are so many others so again if you have a family history of heart disease if you have a family history of diabetes if you have a history of alzheimer's disease in your family know your status and know your risks because it's 2021 and there is a lot of information that we have so that's that first second is as i said we need to preserve our physical health what i mean by that is how do you get through your life so that uh your body can hold you up to take you through all of these different um years that we have how do we make sure that we avoid injury minimize injury manage the injuries that we already have if i could go back in time my daughters keep asking me that question i would go back to the times where i did some terrible things to my shoulder and i wish i had changed that circumstance but now i have to look after my shoulder and make sure that i can carry this shoulder with me for the remainder of my life we have these highlighted times in our life where we need to be even more careful if you're a male and you're 50 years of age or over we start to lose muscle mass and we need our muscle mass for a whole host of reasons with women but also with men the risks for osteoporosis really start to increase from 50 years onwards i don't need to say so much to explain how important it is that we need to preserve our physical health but a really interesting way to think about this and it's the way i've been thinking now for quite some years is this idea of the centenarian olympics what would you like to be doing when you're 100 years old or 90 years old or 80 years old what do you physically want and so i'll use myself as an example at 80 years old i love would love the idea that i can still go ocean swimming i like the idea that my grandchildren will be i will be able to go down onto the floor and pick my grandchildren up and to live life down on their level so in order to do that i'm going to have to be able to get up off the floor i'm going to have to be able to um you know position myself in and around i want to be able to travel when i'm in my 80s and if that means having to hop on a shinkansen in japan i might need to get to that train quite fast and pick my bags up and be able to move quite quickly i would like to be able to do that so in order for me to compete in the centenarian olympics i now have to think about the things that i need to be doing and so going forward and then working backwards is a really interesting way to start thinking about your body and then as i said uh we need to protect our mental health and our well-being we need to have the tools to be able to manage stress and de-stress we to live as we get older in despair or uncontrolled depression or anxiety or extreme loneliness if you've got the physical capabilities and your your health is good but your mental health is um really compromised it's going to be a very very unhappy existence and we need these tools i think as we get older uh to be able to be in a place where we are able to accept change and to have a an open curiosity and an engagement for what is about to come and what is our world like is really important and then something that i've been reading about and very interesting is what place do we take as we get older in i think singaporean culture as we get older i think is actually quite wonderful is that the older generations are actually considered to be wise uh and uh in my culture that's not necessarily the case but to be this concept of becoming a modern elder and that we have wisdom and that people are interested in this wisdom i think this is something very interesting and to have good mental well-being on that front uh i think is something that we need to consider so what tools do we have to play with so as uh in my profession and what i do this is my this is my my toolkit so if you want to live extend your health span and live a longer healthier life these are the tools that we all have at our disposal our nutrition our sleep our mental health there's a mistake there um exercise and our physical capabilities our hormones change as we get older we need to understand our whole hormones and in fact there are things that we can do with all of the points above to actually manipulate our hormones in order to preserve our health we can't change our genes but we can know what our disposition is but we can actually influence our genes with this new world of something called epigenetics and the more we understand about epigenetics and aging i think this is where researchers will actually be able to slow down our aging process and treat aging as even like a disease and work out how to slow it down so epigenetics is something that is a new burdening a new field that's emerging in this world of longevity research and then of course we have medications and tcm and supplementation and these do have a significant impact on our health conditions and we know that statins save lives for example medications are extremely important but these are the levers that we have so let's talk about some of these levers in a little more detail so first nutrition and in fact i've got to say i always try to think which which one should i be talking about first is sleep more important is exercise more important is nutrition more important well i've spent 20 years talking about nutrition let me talk about it but they are all intricately interwoven with one another i could pick any one of those top three and i think anyone could be justified as being one of the most important but let's think talk about nutrition first in and remember thinking in the lens of what can nutrition do to help me delay chronic health conditions what can nutrition do to ensure that my mind is preserved what can nutrition do to help me preserve my my physical capabilities and my function so at some point it's a it is really interesting and probably important to actually think about what it is that you're eating and start to tailor your diet according to your health and lifestyle requirements if you have started to develop symptoms of heart disease you want to eat in a heart-healthy manner if your blood sugar levels are higher and you're now taking metformin do you just take metformin or do you start to look at your eating patterns how can you eat to preserve your brain what should you be eating in order to be able to do the physical exercise that you've now committed to doing we need to tailor our diet according to our health there are 101 different health gurus every single type of eating pattern there's going to be somebody that is going to tell you that you should be on a carnivore diet it should be plant-based no it should be you should be a pescetarian actually i've got this fantastic juice detox and for five hundred dollars i've got some fantastic pills that you should be having our nutrition is extremely important and so my advice follow the science don't follow the fads be savvy and think uh before jumping in to just any old type of eating okay again looking at that idea of health conditions and physical capabilities and mental health how you choose to eat can have an incredible impact on your body composition yes i know you need to exercise but if you're over consuming under consuming eating the wrong things you might be not feeling yourself for the exercise that you should be doing you might be putting on unnecessary amounts of body fat and of all of the things that we can do to manipulate our weight and our body fat exercise will take us only so far how you choose to eat will take you most of the way and as i said how we eat helps us fuel our body and food is fuel and there is such an emerging world of how should i be eating in order to maximize my my physical capabilities and then we all know how food can have an impact on how we feel there are emotional eaters there's stress eaters there's anxiety not eaters how we choose to eat has an incredible impact on on how we think and how we feel so under those three fundamentals nutrition you can see here is an absolute pillar so let's dig in a little bit further on with respect to nutrition you need to know what to eat you need to know how much to eat and in fact now we need to know when to eat okay so with the what to eat it goes back to what i've just said we need to pick an appropriate eating style and the ones that i'm finding let me just talk about new new research one of the healthiest eating patterns that has come to date in 2020 was a predominantly plant-based eating style with some fish and seafood that is done in a manner that is time restricted that seems to be the the gold standard um but then i'm i'm being constantly bombarded with people saying is keto actually the most fantastic eating pattern and if you have a risk factor towards brain and cognition and dementia it may well be the case so as i said you need to pick an appropriate eating style and like i said also prior how much to eat knowing what food has a certain amount of calorie and what type of food can you over consume and uh you over consume it but you actually keep on eating the food marketeers are very very good at that at being able to target the exact kind of food that you're going to be able to eat plenty of and come back for more you need to know these things and then five years ago nobody was talking about how we time our food but now we're understanding so much about the best time of the day to eat and whether you start to use time restricted eating to regulate the number of calories that you have or how you choose to eat and the timing of how you eat might actually help you if you've got symptoms of reflux so many different things so within the banner of nutrition you now have these other three levers that you can pull how much when and what very very important so if we move down to sleep and we look at it again thinking about sleep with respect to delaying those health conditions and our mood and physical capabilities we know that if you are sleep deprived your risks of heart heart disease go up significantly shift workers have a much higher risk of heart disease and heart attack than non-shift workers that we know that when you sleep our blood pressure actually resets we also know that just two or three nights of poor sleep can raise your blood sugar levels to that of somebody who has insulin resistance there's uh the link between sleep and brain health is just growing we now know and i've talked about this in other seminars that you're when you sleep and the longer you sleep our brains actually shrink a little bit and this fluid cerebral spinal fluid bathes all through the brain and clears a whole lot of metabolic waste that has occurred through the course of the day and that what's called lymphatic draining might be linked with preserving our our brain from alzheimer's disease so sleep and brain is so important if you are sleep deprived your immune system is compromised if you wanted to have the best kind of drug to give yourself an advantage on the playing field it's sleep and we know that when we are tired we can be drawn to the wrong kinds of food and you only need to have one or two nights where you don't sleep well and you know that you're gonna get a little bit snappy right so uh sleep and mood are so so intricately linked and if we look at the science uh the shorter you sleep the shorter your life so you want to live a longer healthy life think very very carefully about your sleep and your sleep patterns so what are some of the fundamentals it's good to know your chronotype you need to know um what is your natural rhythm of sleep and if you're in a fortunate enough position to be able to have some control over the time you go to bed and the time you wake up at least with respect to work and your family to know whether or not you're naturally a night owl naturally somebody who could go to bed between 10 11 12 o'clock at night somebody who needs to go to bed early but actually knowing whether what type you are will help you start to think about how you should be choosing to sleep and then within that is starting to really bed down um what time do i go to bed what time do i wake up and if we look at sleep research your bedtime and your wake up time really shouldn't be much more than about a 30 to 45 minute difference so seven o'clock to 7 45 a.m 10 p.m to 7 4 10 45 p.m seven days a week we need to lock those points in and then within that time you want to be getting at least seven hours of sleep that is as uninterrupted as possible so what things do you need to do to reduce the number of interruptions in a night and so as time passes you need to fine tune not time tune sorry slide your sleeping habits and in fact it starts from the minute that you wake up in the day what time did i wake up today and in fact your sleep sequence starts at that point so having some idea of what your sleep cycle should be and what your sleep sequence should be is very very important and then exercise we the breadth and depth of the things that we can start to do with respect to exercise is just baffling me at the moment but simple things when you exercise your cardiovascular fitness improves and if your cardiovascular fitness improves and heart health is the is our most important disease that we want to oh heart disease is the most important disease that we want to prevent having some measure of cardiovascular fitness is extremely important but we also want blood flow to the brain it's very very important and so if we want to preserve our brains we need to exercise and we need cardiovascular fitness if again going back to those health conditions as we have the development of diabetes and higher blood sugar levels if you can have more muscle bulk as you get older that muscle bulk is a one-way ticket for blood sugar and so you can regulate your blood sugar levels better by the body composition that you have when we exercise we put ourselves under some stress but actually the the type of stress and the long-term impact of that stress is actually good for our body and is good for our mood and improves our immune function and then with respect to the bodies that we carry the exercise helps us maintain or improve our bone mineral density as i said osteoporosis is something that we need to be thinking about muscle mass sarcopenia in the over 50s and that stability in the posture and how we move and the flexibility these things as i said think about the centenarian olympics what is it that you need to be doing to be able to get up off the floor when you are 85 years old and the research in longevity medicine would suggest that the most potent drug that we have today to live longer is our exercise so lots of things you can be extremely fit and not healthy there are many many people that push themselves on that exercise front and they are not in the least bit healthy they're fit but they're not healthy so the difference between being fit and healthy are actually quite different when you're younger for example or not even that young you might be wanting to exercise in order to achieve something i want to do a marathon i want to be able to um you know walk this particular route or do some sort of 140 kilograms squat or something like that so there's a point often in our lives where we might be exercising for performance but i'm not now interested in the idea of how do you exercise for life how do you exercise for longevity and so there are frameworks for that type of exercise and it comes down to again these four sub-pillars or four sub-levers that you have access to and the time that you devote towards exercise we need to think about number one what kind of exercise am i doing to promote stability in order to be able to not have debilitating back pain and hip and knee and ankle issues and to actually have a measure of stability with our body you need to be doing the types of exercise that allows us to work that stability function and then becoming frail uh falling down and not being able to and just kind of collapsing under the weight of a fall is unfortunately a very very strong link to a considerable shortening of your life as we get older we don't want to lose too much strength and so the amount of lean muscle mass that we have on our body is an extremely important feature that we need to preserve and as we get older we need to preserve it even more so so we need strength we need stability and we need the kinds of exercise to promote that and then there is this type of exercise called aerobic efficiency and this one is so so important and again it comes down actually one way to look at it it comes down to what new research is telling us about uh longevity we have these uh in all our cells the power powerhouse of our souls are these things called mitochondria our mitochondria takes our fat and our carbohydrates and the oxygen that we take in to produce fuel and our health conditions like diabetes and heart disease are actually embedded in all of this they are diseases of altered metabolism and so if we want to correct or again delay the onset of these diseases and delay the onset of aging our mitochondria we actually want them to function well and so aerobic efficiency in a type of exercise that develops aerobic efficiency is something that becomes part of the suite of things that you do to exercise for life and then there's this final type which is this anaerobic peak and as i said let's say you are 80 years old and you've what want to make that sprint to the the bus stop that ability to move nice and quickly the ability to pick up two heavy bags and to go up three flights of stairs and get to the top that type of sprint type of exercise at 20 years old it might be how fast can i run 100 meters but at 75 or 85 years old or 90 years old it's how do i take those four very fast steps so that i step back and not get hit by that bus so these are the framework for longevity exercise and these are the ones that um i'm very interested in and then i'm not going to uh even begin to suggest that i am a uh master of this field but with respect to mental health the it's an interesting way to of to look at it but um i read this very recently the voice in our head our inner voice our inner dialogue is our most influential coach on how we choose to to live our lives than any other and so in order uh to be able to live in a manner that allows us uh to get older uh and to embrace uh the changes that that we have as we get older we need to know that voice and as i said that voice can be both positive and negative so we have a mental toolkit and part of the reason why i am involved with the brahm center is because of the understanding of the power of mindfulness-based thinking in having an examined mind if you know the way your mind works and there are profound lessons to be learned through meditation and mindfulness for example so as in the toolkit and if we talk from a brown perspective it's actually one of the prime reasons why i'm here talking to you today because from a personal perspective the the lessons that i have learned through understanding and practicing mindfulness have been profound i also believe that having grit and resilience is very important with respect to our mental health from all ages and as a parent i'm trying to breed two children that have resilience and grit and are not children that are just treated in kid gloves and i need to do that for myself as well there are people that believe that if you have a purpose in life uh then you're you're going to be strong and you're going to find a way to negotiate that path and that's very true um for for many people and is something worth uh following there are these concepts and philosophies of stoicism and again there are many uh religious uh teachings that also teach grit and resilience and stoicism and then something which i i really like that i've been listening to lately is again part of that the inner dialogue and the inner score card that we might keep is making sure or thinking about uh what's something called our personal credo our core beliefs and the guiding principles that um we can apply and the intentions that we have to integrate them into our everyday life so actually living in a particular way is going to help us as we get older and to negotiate a longer healthier life so what can we think of uh the longest living woman uh was a french woman as you can see she lived longer than the man longest living man died only in 2013. the people who live in the blue zones as i said no doubt have some very good health habits and dietary approaches and engaged lifestyle and exercise the things that i've talked about but they also have probably some very favorable genes that is also helping them along the way as i said they're not saints yet they somehow managed to delay the onset of chronic disease for most of us we probably could live into our mid-90s in a very very healthy manner and be and have that health span up until that point and so that is achievable for most of us and that scientists are suggesting that there really is something coming soon where our life expectancy may well be 115 years but then we're also moving towards a time now where we have an aging population and that's changing things the idea of being uh retired at 60 or retired at 65 is a thing of the past okay and back in australia people would retire at 55 and 60 at 55 years old now you're you're pushing at 60 you're still you're still going and i know here in singapore uh you also need to keep on staying up and working and doing things the way we are aging is transforming and changing so it is uh it is here and it's upon us so the directions as i've spoken to you about we have a number of levers that we have i truly believe that the earlier we all start to think about this the better heart disease starts to show itself in our twenties diabetes shows itself in children now and early teenagers and that was a health condition that used to be only seen in the 50s and above and dementia starts and alzheimer's disease starts to develop and this before 30 years before the symptoms first start to show so we need to act early we need to influence our children we want to make sure our children are living in a manner that is going to help them dodge these bullets and we need to dodge these bullets and so thank you very much for listening to me today ,False,False,False,False

rotary eradicating polio from the world except two countries left which is pakistan and afghanistan the district our district has launched a step up and polio campaign and call upon rotarian adnan ansari to give you the information about this type of campaign for and polio adnan uh president just a quick one uh our speaker cinder is with us okay i admit her now yeah yeah she's she's coming in now perfect yeah just to let you know thank you thank you president dinesh can you hear me yes okay that's great good evening everybody respected honorary members past presidents and rotarians and

um can i share my skin screen or yes okay i think that way it will be easier for me to explain can you see my screen yes yes yes yes okay so basically it's the end polio event this year usually it's on 24th of october but as you know this year during coffee 19 lockup most of us now restricted to our own residences and workplaces so we cannot have a joint event as such uh like other years in uh mass scale so basically this year they have started their the district has arranged for a step up and weight loss challenge you can see on the screen uh the leaflet from the district 3310 and uh for this district each club has been allocated a target for rotary club of singapore uh since we have about 150 members our target is to have at least 150 participations participants but the good good thing is not necessarily all 150 has to be a rotarian we can also invite our family members friends of rotarians or any other friends family members everybody's most welcome to register the link is given on the screen right now and i will also share it later in the chat box you can have a quick view as soon as you click the link to register you will find a google form if you give your personal

segment is our kaifa know your fellow rotarian and today we have uh jessica lim she joined our club in 2016. she is one of the very very active literarian and rest i'll leave it to her to tell us about herself and about her vocation and how she contributes to rotary i give you jessica okay thanks president dinesh let me share my slides okay rotary connects the wall rotary brings hope rotary opens opportunities through rotary i've met incredibly humble and kind people who am i i'm a singaporean christian i've lived my whole life in singapore except when i did my degree in san francisco like everyone in this club i have a great passion to help those in need and like most people i enjoy traveling because it changes my perspective here you can see my picture taken in prague last year before attending the rotary convention and on a separate trip i felt incredibly blessed to be able to travel and visit milan in doha because not many people have the money or ability to travel my life's philosophy is to live life without regrets and when in doubt wait it out what's important to me is to that i meet and know people who are genuine honest humble positive and willing to try out things so i'm currently working as an administrator at the institute of technical education ite in the last 20 years i've worked in admissions then employee innovation working in different areas has taught me to organize meetings and events which in turn i'm able to contribute here in the rotary club ite is a post-secondary institution that focuses primarily on career and technical education ite offers 98 courses in 12 sectors with close to 30 000 students across three campuses and 26 staff most of our students are kinesthetic learners so our courses are designed to be 70 percent hands-on traits-based learning and 30 theoretical learning my volunteer journey started in 2009 after i lost my late husband to cancer i figured now i have time i can do some volunteer work since i've always wanted to volunteer but was always caught up in some family commitment so i decided to try going on a medical mission trip to nepal and after that first trip i was hooked and the rest is history i went on to do more medical mission trips with the church until 2015 when pp eugene lim from reference rc refer city invited me to become the secretary and i learned how to organize trips so i really enjoy i really enjoy planning and organizing mission trips connecting with local partners recruiting troopers planning the program thinking of ways to help the community enhancing triples experience and on the ground i love showing love and care to the people we help smiling and to show smiling to show that we care genuinely guiding them speaking in a caring tone so for my rotary journey i knew uh pp gary so i've been seeing his uh facebook post on some volunteer events and that got me curious so one day i asked gary what's that about so he invited me to the meetings and after attending some i decided that i want to join i like how rotary helps the community i love the meetings the fellowship because i've been helping the international community through rotary i began to learn about the needs from the local community so since i've joined i've been involved in secretary work i've helped ysc from 2016 to 2020 and this year i'm helping isc and i've been a csc member since i've joined except for last year so this year i'm also helping csc so besides work i've always enjoyed attending conventions and seminars so the first was the rotary conference in bhutan here you can see the group of us all dressed up in the local attire i've also attended the rotary convention in toronto hamburg and the district training assembly so if not for the covet 19 situation i would have attended the convention in hawaii and taipei so i'm definitely but i'm definitely planning to attend the rotary convention in houston 2022 so when we i look forward um when we meet in person i look forward to reconnecting with everyone in person and working together on various projects and events thank you thank you jessica for the wonderful work that you have been you have done and you are so active in various committees and i think you are it's you are you are an example and i'm sure all our members have heard what uh what you have been engaged in dear members and guests month of august is a membership month this is a month which reminds us the importance of membership development so i'll take just brief briefly i'll inform you that what are membership committee is involved in what we have been uh doing in in last four to five weeks and uh what has what what the results are although it's a very uh only few weeks but i think we have done uh quite a significant work and progress here uh membership is the is the is is the bedrock of our club and is the most important to the running and renewal of our club membership growth in our district i'm told is less than two percent net and even in our club we had number of new members last year but the net growth was negative it is a challenge how we can grow organically retain existing members and attract new ones our membership committee with pb suresh kirthi as the chair is working hard to attract new members and find new ways to engage our members although we have completed little less than one and a half months of new rotary year we are in advanced stage of getting seven new members and we are likely to have 15 members joining by end of september and how we are going to we are engaging the existing members most of the new members who have joined from the year 2018 till now will be in subcommittees of membership public image crfc and other contributing with their ideas this is how we will engage the members who are two to three years in our club we have successfully started uh kai for program you just heard uh jessica under kaifer kaifer means know your fellow rotarian and this is uh the feedback is quite good and we'll continue this program right up to the end of the year or maybe future rotary education is under planning and especially for new members we will start this activity next month rotary image and publicity committee is very active on social media right from installation we started live streaming successfully on youtube and we had extremely good attendance of the rotarians outside our districts we have we are having well-known speakers and i'm sure today we have another speaker uh who is uh very well been known and i hope we you will all enjoy and this this will continue we have been pipeline many uh good speakers world-class speakers in coming coming weeks and months we have we are getting attention on rotary international group which has got 700 000 members and we are also on rotary vr rotary with 40 000 members will continue in our efforts to membership development collectively and august month happens to be a reminder just to give you one example the the publicity which we did or the live streaming on youtube we had two members proposed uh from their parent from their club in australia melbourne and also leon in france so the respective presidents of this club informed us about two prospective members who are living and working in singapore and we find both of them are attending our meetings so this is already giving us results and this was just in brief to inform you uh what we have been uh working uh our own membership development and i once again thank our vice presidents rache kiersi and the all the members on his team uh working working to develop our membership in addition as you all know we have the membership classification development committee where all our past presidents are members and this committee is is events and endorses all the new members which are presented to them and works very independently so with that we we are we are sure the quality of our members and i think these two committees will work will complement each other and we will have good membership development in a holistic way this year thank you and that was in brief and as i said last week we are going to start a new segment we couldn't do it this the this week it is under progress and uh which is uh will start next week and that would be what's happening so what's happening in behind the scene even as all our service committee what work they are doing you are not the members not everybody is member of all service committees but not only service committees we will talk about uh all what we are doing in in in membership committee or uh the club administration and all these information in a proactive way will keep you informed so thank you very much for your attention and i'll move to the next and next i think is the guest speaker and before i hand over to uh for her introduction and i would like to just mention today we have a very overwhelming response from our charming spouses we already have meera kirsi here and our first lady reika has also joined in but i am told that other spouses may not log in or maybe maybe listening uh together with their uh rotarian husbands so i would like to to just welcome a and all these spouses and i will take their names which i have the information and i want warmly welcome uh kavita vaswani mira kirthi rachel yaplinki prabarao smitha gadgil tracy mark uh anita hati ramani bhiyanka nagarani and of course first lady rekha very warm welcome to them it looks like the topic of our today's speaker has attracted them but they have some of them have been in in our past meetings also so warm welcome to everyone dinesh lakshmi is in also listening okay thank you thank you uttam welcome uh lakshmi thank you so nice to see you and uh good you are here so that means it's a record number of our charming spouses attending today so you and yes lakshmi you are saying something thank you my wife is also online who said that um keith keith okay harrison thank you so we have another i think uh it's uh it's it's really fantastic attendance of spouses and i hope they will continue and this is really the flexibility of zoom then they they can they can they have selected to to come in just before our speaker starts so yes uh there are a lot of advantages and we see online meeting and flexibility is really great all right so next i would like to now uh ask our vice president chris kinsey to introduce our speaker suresh yep thank you president it's my pleasure to welcome and introduce to you our speaker may sindhu shri bhavan who is going to talk about how to make our children future ready in uncertain times a very topical talk today on the international youth day which is 12th of august sindhu happens to be a founder and a best-selling author for a book called infinite possibilities for super achievers she's a speaker design thinker innovation educationist and a reformer sindhu sribawan is a ceo of as many minds and the founder of chairman of international youth and leadership innovation forum called i y lif and the co-founder of her own voice she is a speaker entrepreneur author coach and is passionate about women empowerment education and youth development sindhu's passion is in coaching people educational institutions and organization with personal mastery growth mindset and innovation so that they can uncover their infinite possibilities and discover their breakthroughs with iylif she brings youth leaders from around the world to share the table with teachers industry experts and thought leaders to reimagine youth leadership and education as i said she has a she's a graduate from nus mba she's got a second mba from ucla anderson and she's done woman leadership and empower and and empowerment in state business school in university of oxford i welcome sindhu sriban to take the flow thank you hi good evening have a very good international youth day and thank you mr suresh tiati for the warm welcome and thank you mr dinesharma it's wonderful to be here and thank you for the invite as well now um [Music] it's it's wonderful to be speaking about a group that i'm really passionate about working with and developing that is the youth i work with youth i work with teachers i work with executives as well but the demographic i am really interested inspired and passionate about working with is the youth here is the reason number one you can see them transforming right in front of your eyes number two you can be inspired with their ideas and all that wishes and aspirations and visions they have for the future so youth is our current and our future so now this year we are celebrating international youth day in a very very different from we have ever celebrated before and if you look at this year the um the challenges faced by the youth are different and our aspirations for the youth are also different think about this last year we were worried about how to take our youth out from their devices and this year we are telling them and we are pushing them towards their devices and asking them so that they can complete their school work so the world has changed dramatically um in the last six months so that is the uh premise for today's talk as part of the initiatives by as many minds we do have programs for um youth teachers and so on and basically our aim is to reform education re-imagine education so that we can make our children future ready we also organize the international youth leadership and innovation forum i live and i at ireland we bring all stakeholders of education together that is students uh teachers industry experts and parents from around the world so we can have a dialogue between all these parties and re-imagine education and youth development and we also train teachers we train students in public speaking in growth mindset in innovation skills and study skills and so on now let's step a little away from the youth and look at the current global situation if you look at corvette it has completely changed the world completely in the sense that we can't ever go back um so here is the thing uh think about this last year you used to operate your businesses and your work is it the same today last year you used to network with other people is it the same today and look at the events like look at your meeting it is entirely different the way the education is conducted and taken has also changed dramatically within the last six months and many people say that we can go back after a vaccine or a medicine is developed do you think it's possible think about this we have um we need these pharmaceutical firms to develop that we have to give them time for that and secondly think about the time it takes to administer this medicine or this vaccine to 7 billion people around the world it takes some time so what it means is that during that time the world is not going to stay and wait for it it will catch up with the current and and it will have more innovations to go with the comment you might have seen that a lot of tech companies tech giants have told their employees that they don't need to come to the office anymore for the next many months they can work from home and so what it means is that and another interesting fact is that if you just do a google search for job opportunities you can see that many opportunities that come with the location as anywhere in the world so what does it mean it means that you can you can work for a company in this in singapore you will get paid there you will get um you might pay the tax there but you will be staying in your home maybe in south america and working from there so what it means is that covert has brought a lot of challenges and it has also opened up a lot of possibilities we have no although we think that there is social distancing measures and so on the world has suddenly become narrower uh or suddenly become isolated each country has become isolated actually in a different way it has united so now let's go back to our children okay so our children who are in the school who um and before that okay just to establish my credibility i have i have been working in management consulting for many years and then i had this strong urge to reform education i sat on that idea for many years like three four years and finally i felt that nobody else is solving the problems that i have identified and i was waiting for that and then why don't i start it that's how i started about seven years ago and now i have written many books um and i started with innovation and then i realized that innovation can't happen without the right mindset and then i jumped into the mindset area and so i have written uh many books and i have also written many resources um so um and i have worked with uh in the education space um developing youth developing teachers developing curriculums and so on so and i have some of my books are here and if you would like to take a look you can just go to this um web page and take a look and these are some of the resources that i have made over the years for children now here is what i would like you to do i would like whenever you see or you hear something that is an aha moment for you something that is new for you but something or something that you knew but you can't see it from a different perspective please note it down if you would like to share it with others you can use the chat box here or you can keep it for your own benefit okay now the current generation that is in the school is called gen zees as in jen is it and they are the they are the true digital natives so who are these denzis the oldest of the genzis they are 24 years old and the youngest of them are five years old they are they are actually born with a device in their hand their parents have been um taking note of their daily developments in an electronic form so about some people say that this is these are the spoils generation or these kids are slave to the virtual world so now let's take a look at them and see some what they do um about how they are and what they do you see i boast about having an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering but then when it comes to new technology when it comes to new apps it's my children the gensies who just come just look at it and they teach me how to go about that technology you see the thing is they they intuitively know how to work around technology so technology is not something of a burden to them they use technology as a tool so that they can contact their daily business however the nature is very different okay uh you can take note of the four points that i make and if you have a gen z child or if you have uh if you know uh genesis child closely you can observe these things for them so number one is that they genuinely care about the world remember those projects that they were doing in kindergarten like um you know pollution the recycling and the greenhouse effect and so on they did really impact them so they truly care about the world and also they truly care about courses so let's look at the way they look at uh prospective employers they look at prospective employees in such a way that they want to choose an employer who is able to who is standing for a course and they want to align with that course and that employer truly does it and then the second thing is they can contribute something to the organization and the third thing is they will also get remunerated for that so these are not the kids who would say i don't care about money i care only about world peace so here you see that they are close they have they are a lot similar to millennials but at the same time they are a lot different from the millennials and although they are digital natives they would like to have human interactions that means if there is a conflict they would like to have that communication between the parties and solve the problems so this is a extremely special generation and people have been researchers have been studying this generation and what we can see from this generation is that these are people who are pragmatic uh they are they are a mix of gen x and millennials and plus some x factor but because they are genesis let's say some z factor in them so these kids however they are also going through some of the challenges for example agencies have reported the highest rate of mental health problems reported ever compared to other in terms of the rates compared to other generations their stress their stress due to several reasons they are depressed they have peer pressure they have you know there is a high rate of kids using um abusing substances like drugs and alcohol and so on they also have social pressure uh online and offline that means um one example is 16 and many studies have shown that sex some kids start sexting because of peer pressure everyone in their circle is doing so i also want to do because i want to be part of that i want to fit in right so they are all they are going through uh several different challenges but what keep them moving on what or what kept them moving on was their affinity towards a brighter future to change things but at the same time being real and getting remunerated and having a good life but now the education world has changed everything has changed think about it when you were of their age below 20 have you ever gone through such a situation in your life a global catastrophe and that is affecting everything in many cases like war and so on it affected in certain cases but there are not many people around us who have gone through that experience of going through such a catastrophe that in a global level so these kids now it's in our hand being pragmatic they can take both routes they can take their choice they can say that okay i'll be remaining pragmatic i will go to take a conventional route and then i will do whatever i'm supposed to do and that was shared by my parents uh but it doesn't look like that's going to help them here is um some of the reasons why it wouldn't happen or it may happen but there's highly high likelihood that there will be a different scenario if you look at the kids today especially those kids who are of the college going eight and now many of them have lost scholarship because of comet you might have read in the news that united states is not issuing student visas to overseas students if those courses are available online you see many students many kids were planning for these college days having this dream for joining this particular college or university and then it's not just about learning it's also about the experience even in in singapore we have many students who go out to us uk australia and other place other countries to get educated and that's the case with a lot of students from the asia pacific asia asia region as well so for them the life has changed all of a sudden and then the next thing is that because of this imminent innovation that is coming in the education space i can actually boldly say that in a short span of time the um the recruitment is going to be based on skill sets rather than qualifications so what does it mean it means that the kids need to pick up those skill sets so if you are just focused on getting a good academic degree it may not be viable it may not be the right i mean it may not be sufficient for getting a job of your choice so these are some of the challenges or some of the things that we should be looking out into while mentoring supporting and helping our children um in this new world of postcovid world or new normal now so um what you can do with your kids is that number one thing you know when you talk when you talk about academics the learning is going to be a lifelong process now more than academics what these kids need now is to be able to know how to embrace the current challenges and how to look forward to the future and if you can do that as a parent or as a youth developer or as a teacher you that would be a tremendous help that you can give to those children so embrace the challenges and find a way to charter through the muddy bottles so how can we do that so here are six skills that i would like to share with you number one the ability to learn and learn and relearn innovation is going at a very fast pace so now we can't think about you know like the time that we were studying we studied something we got the job and it since innovation was going at this lower pace many of the things that we learned we used but we know that whatever we learned that was not sufficient our employers first employers had to train us in many different ways to equip us to do our job so but in the new world learning and and learning unlearning is also important and relearning so they need to do all this very fast they have to learn something new they have to apply that they have to demonstrate that and then after that data they need to relearn something and relearn and then go so what they need is the ability to learn what are the quick ways to learn so some of the things that comes as part of this memory skin is focus skills um and in terms of other skills like time management skills prioritization skills um and so on so and and in singapore these are all of those go under uh learning skills or or study skills now number two is emotional intelligence and mental health we know the importance of mental health in these kids um and uh being able to understand their own emotions that is important and especially when in today's world when they are not in much interaction uh with other kids even if they go to school and in the schools also there are some policies about um interacting with other kids so their interactions uh human interactions is limited so we need so they need to identify oh why am i stressed for example or why am i feeling sad or i am feeling sad i am feeling happy i am feeling stressed but why what is the reason so thinking about their thoughts that is important so and then empathy what others are feeling all these are important for them to pick up because to to help their mental health remain agile now there is also another reason you might have read in the news that um emotions are the final frontier for artificial intelligence so everything that we can say this is this this is the um standard operating procedure sop for something that can be replicated as uh as a program as a technology as an artificial intelligence program so what is but about emotions about our response to emotions that is not at concord as humans we haven't been although we know a lot of theories we don't know how to predict and those are the places where in the future we will have more of human interactions uh of human involvement so i have read somewhere that in the future the ceo is going to be an artificial intelligence program or a robot but that ceo will be enhanced with human intelligence because uh the you know as a decision maker has to make decisions based on emotional factors so that is where the human involvement comes now with core the technology and the possibilities are going up because we have seen that the possibilities are more we have seen that yeah we have to implement technology our resistance towards technology has almost become nerve so now a lot of people are half the time have the idea as well as getting investment to invest in technology so it means that our kids should be able to one of the areas where our kids can help and support his emotions so this is this is for their own mental health as well as for future career needs now the next is communication skills and expressing ourselves that is very important and expressing not just expressing expressing ourselves effectively that is important isn't it think about this our attention span is according to new studies it is lower than even that of the goldfish and so we and people don't have time for everything everybody is busy so if we have to get anything done we have to convince someone within a very short frame of time whether it is for interviews whether it is for selling a product uh as part of the proposal anything so communicating effectively is extremely important and that effectiveness also comes with the confidence i have the confidence about this idea so i communicating it and that communication could be verbal communication or communicating in any other mode that is suitable for that particular context so it's interesting we have say we have public speaking programs and for children so we have seen that after attending a public speaking program after delivering their graduation speech many kids do other things that are outside the public speaking for example timid kids they go ahead and they become and we have seen them becoming student leaders and we have also seen average performer i can average academic performers going and becoming um top scorers in the class and when the parents told us this we asked them why are you telling us you know saying thanks to us for that and they say that it's because it's from that confidence that they gained from that public speaking skills that and the ability that they were able to understand that they can learn something they can blow some and they can grow so communication skills is essential because otherwise they are going to feel that i have all this idea and nobody is listening to me and that might put them into depression as well now creativity and problem solving so um here is the thing um now in the new world in the new normal everything is going to be innovation because these kids jealousies are going to solve everything every big problems that we have we are facing whether it is covered whether it is global warming or whether it is pollution population or anything because they need to do that otherwise their survival or their children surviving is the problem and also think about this they are people with a good sense of ownership for their course so they will make sure that they will uh you know that that they need to innovate now for that creativity and problem solving skills are essential so here's the thing um when uh we started we we have innovation programs uh we use design thinking which is an innovation methodology from stanford university we started doing that here in 2012 13 2013 and we have collaborated with many people like science center organization science center singapore the commander of the international space station the healing geologist behind jurassic park and so on so during um and but it was everybody was extremely excited about it but the parents and as well as even you know to a certain extent schools also didn't think that it was that was important but we've we have that faith um that this is essential we kept on working on that and five years later in 2017 moe ministry of education announces that okay creative problem solving and innovation skills are essential for children we need to include that as part of our curriculum and then our program became a hot item it's a hot cake the straight times game featured us for a contribution in the field and so on but thing is that we were ahead of our times but it was good because we were able to test out things we were able to understand things we were able to polish things and so on so if you are teaching any of these skills to your your your children or students and if you feel that it's not needed now have confidence that this is what will enable them to be future to be ready for their own future so now the last one is having a growth mindset i don't know how many of you know or whether you know or heard about growth mindset many of you might have seen this two categories categorization of this is what people with a growth mindset do and this is what people with their fixed mindset do so basically people with a growth mindset they believe that i can change myself i can change the way i am i can create my own possibilities but the people with a fixed mindset they think that this is the way i am born i don't have much influence in in in my intelligence or in my talents or in the way i behave um or my habits and so on so um people with a growth mindset by the thing they know that i have got billions of neurons in my brain neurons are the cells in our brain i have got billions of neurons in my brain and it is up to me to enable the connection between those neurons basically it's a connection between the neurons that is called the wiring the neural wiring or we say brain wiring wiring in our brain basically that actually happens physically happens and there is no limit for us to make as many number of connections and as many number of neural networks you know that we need so what um so they have that belief that okay i am just like anybody else i am not lower than anyone else i am not bigger than anyone else it is up to me how i want to make those neural connections and make myself a better human being or more intelligent person or more talented person so but brain is also like like mass muscle think about it um if you need to strengthen your core muscles you need to work out it's not just about any workout you need to do the right workout the right way the right exercise the right way and that doesn't mean that if you have if you give that um you do that exercise those core muscles will will suddenly pop up you have to give it time so that is the case with our brain as well we have to help our brain to establish those connections by doing the right things at the right time in the right frequency again and again so i mentioned about the paleontologist earlier his name is jack horner jack corner is probably one of the most celebrated paleontologists in the world his contribution to paleontology is amazing and many of the things that we know about paleontology is because of his findings um so but the thing is and he's also the advisor to all the jurassic park movies and you can see glimpses of him in altitude or in many of those movies as well now here's the thing he does not have a degree he is severely dyslexic so he did not get a pass mark in his undergraduation he doesn't have a phd and he faced um a lot of problems with the academic world because of the lack of all these things so i have actually featured him in my book um infinite possibilities when i interviewed him i asked him how did you come this far and his answer was stop reading the whole thing frozen sindhu i think your thing is frozen in terms of connectivity i think she got disconnected i think her in tenet must have died yeah she just dropped out she's trying to reconnect let's see oh i don't know yeah she's trying to reconnect okay hello oh you're back oh yeah uh i'm so i'm sorry i don't know what happened um but my computer is still not able to connect so um sorry about that to learn and relearn yes oh you went at learn and relearn that is where you were no uh i just wanted to know because i am i'm calling from my my my phone so i don't know i mean i can't project it anymore um but um i um i would like to know until where you heard well what was the last thing you heard that was about your book where you had this wonderful man who learned john oh yeah yeah okay so jack horner is a person who um yeah he was severely dyslexic and but he had achieved all those accolades anyone could get in the paleontology world although he didn't have a degree or a phd and he faced severe discrimination from his um you know from the academic community because of the lack of his degrees and he says that don't stop um reading um but but start doing and because that is his way he can't read so he come up with a new strategy to learn to he came up with a new strategy and that helped him to uh be on that uh to be on the top of his game so this is all about the neurons we have in our brain so if our children know that we i am able to create trillions of connection in my brain um they will get the idea that okay i am shy no problem i can come out of it i'm um i i need to brush up my math skills yes i can do that i need to brush up my communication skills some people say i can't be a salesperson or i can't speak in front of an audience so give a public speaking and so on but the the thing is that all of us can do anything i'm not saying we can all become the best in the world but we can think about joseph schooling joseph schooling he was not get selected he didn't get selected in the first try for the national team and then he could have just said they didn't select me let me just sit down and cry over it but he's realized that i need to change my strategy i need to be you know i need to uh do more of of of training i need to pick up my mental strength and so on and so that helped him to be placed in the national team again and be a vinnada to bring a a gold medal to our country so the the kids what they need is the mindset so i have shared five skills here the first one was about learn and learn and relearn the second one was the emotional intelligence and mental mental health the third one was creativity and problem solving skills fourth was communication skills effective communication skills and the fifth is the mindset the grow having a growth mindset if you choose one among all these five skills for your child that should be the growth mindset because if your child can pick up the growth mindset and practice a growth mindset in his or her life everything else will follow so um having that perseverance having belief in their abilities doing the right work and smart work and so on which is which will help uh them and when we do teach children um and when we teach children we can see their eyes pop up right when they realize oh i have got this potential i can't do this i used to have this dream but i still think i am not good at this and that but i will so i won't be able to uh reach there but now they know that it is unlimited it's infinite possibilities that are waiting for them so they are able to um come to that realization that i am not a limited being i am an unlimited being with unlimited um possibilities and we teach some teachers in implementing growth mindset in the classroom we consult with schools to implement have a you know creating a growth mindset culture i also consult with corporates on that and here is the thing we started that practice in 2014 um but the thing became hot only in 2017 and i used to wonder why you know this is essential why nobody is interested in this but again you know you have to go back to that thing that we were ahead of our time so if you are ahead of anything um if you have a strong belief in something or if your child has a strong belief in something or if you are trying to help your child to pick up something um that that is ahead of the time don't worry about it you're using that time to polish and perfect it to and today we have one of the best if not the best in teaching teachers growth mindset um here so there are a lot of tools techniques um and framework in all of these five um things that i shared but here is the thing we don't have much time this is a short session so i can't give you a lot of information on that in this session but we have another session coming up which is also a free session but it's a longer session um let me see whether i can share the link with you for that so you can go and just uh sign up for that for your child or if you think this will be used for any other child you can actually share it with them but we have only 30 seats and we already have 18 people and it's on the 22nd of august it's a saturday so um let me sorry let me check the link for that fy yes so i have sent the link to uh in the chat so if you are interested you can take a look at that and you can register for it it's a free program and the only thing is that both child and the parent should be there because it's a section for both children as well as for parents okay so your child deserves a future of infinite possibilities and there are ways to make that possible to get their real to unlock their real potential make them realize their real potential and they themselves taking the responsibility of paving the way towards their own infinite possibilities discovering their infinite possibilities and achieving their unlimited potential and i wish you all the best for that to su for supporting us your children as well as supporting the youth again wish you a very happy international youth day i would be happy if you have any questions i'd be happy to answer that president dinesh are you on do we still have we are running way out of time so we lost a bit of the audience unfortunately do we still have time for um a few questions what's the mood anyone saying anything i think then i decide we just go we have a few questions here in the chat so i think let me just go up and ask we have a few questions from rotarian irina irina can you just sort of unmute yourself please and ask because you ask about what is unlearned and why is it important and so on and so forth because it's all about getting that into a practical type of environment yes thank you yeah i would like to i have questions about this theoretical questions like learning and learning and learning i know yes 10 grandchildren i know what does it mean and about what what actually the practical part of understanding and learning what it is how you actually implemented that theory into practice if people who are really in this part of education thinking about it it's maybe some kind of um important part which we have to learn you learn to me it really has some sense but on learning it's a little bit you know something difficult yes yeah i understand are you are you an educator irina yeah yeah yeah i was a teacher at university for many years yeah okay so that's a good question so here's the thing about unlearning um as i mentioned technology innovations and disruptions are changing um on a very fast face paced um manner so what is so and according to some researchers a university a university student who is in the a student who is in the universities today at the end of the fourth year they would have i and whatever they have learned a a high percentage of that would become obsolete yeah so the thing is that now they need to have that mindset that yes i learned this but there's a new way to do this and so i have to adapt myself to learning new and i can't just say that oh i learned it this way at school but i learned it this way in level in year one and so on one example is i mentioned about neuroplasticity um uh earlier i didn't use the word word neuroplasticity the word neuroplasticity means um brain is like a plastic that means we can mold it the way that we want like a plastic and that's the term neurologists have given to brain but here is the thing until like uh 20 30 decade uh sorry um years ago even the neuroscientists used to think that our intelligence and our talents are limited we don't have much leeway with influencing it and now they're saying that we have unlimited um possibilities when it comes to neural virus and there's another thing another study that is coming up is 97 percentage of our brain is uh is junk oh sorry dna is junk and some scientists are claiming that we can actually program our dna that 97 percent can't be junk without a reason so they're saying probably that's for us to program it so these are things that that means science is evolving and we are discovering more and more things technology is evolving we are innovating more things so we should have that mindset to unlearn what we learned or understand that what we learned earlier um is not um exactly the right thing now we need to learn new things so it's about the mindset having that mindset to see things from a different perspective um and learn things from and keeping you on learning so how creating that attitude of life-long learning that's what it means actually i think there's another question from jp jp you have a question about at which sort of age one would apply which kind of uh thinking are you still there yes i'm there um good evening i was wondering what age your your program starts and how do you adapt according to the age the edge obviously the neuroplasticity is changing over time you get less you can mold less as you grow older so how do you adapt let's say from a young age to maybe teenage years and so on um are you asking that whether how as a parent you can help your child as a parent or your in your in your programs or in your school you call it right okay uh number one as a parent you can start it as early as you can in fact from the time they are able to pick up things in fact from the time they are able to hold um a milk bottle that you know letting them um grab it by themselves when they try to walk if they fall down encouraging them giving them the right place words you know say seeing them praising them with the process um and then so that they know that oh it's not the outcome it's not that i'm a superhuman who is able to walk but it's that i tried so i could i was able to walk and for one of the things that we always um always uh in fact advise parents is that you know a lot of parents when teeth when the kids come back from school they ask the kids what you know did you eat how was the school and so on but one of one question that you can ask the kids is what did you ask today in the class see that changes the whole perspective that gives the that message subtle message to the to your child that asking questions is important and it is allowed and then later in their life they know that okay you know asking questions there they don't need to force themselves and so on and there are so many interesting tactics that we can use on a day-to-day basis when it comes to developing neuroplasticity in our children so have doing the right phrase that is excellent another thing is for example when you say some many kids and adults have this habit of saying i cannot i'm not able to i don't know and so on but instead of you you can actually use a very simple word a three-letter word it is y-e-t yet that changes the whole perspective i don't know it yet that means you are not closing the door to the possibilities you are keeping that old door open so that means i can learn it later and the how do kids learn it they learn it from their parents then they learn it from their environment so if you practice that your child will get it when it comes to our programs we do the our programs start at the age of seven and we say that we teach everyone from seven to hundred and seven um so uh yes uh that is where we start and we um tweak it based on the age group based on you know we have many activities and so on so based on that we do that so if you can attend that session on the 22nd you will get to know more about uh thank you thank you i think due to the time constraint we cannot take more questions uh may i ask rotarian vinith to give word of thanks sure thank you president deepak uh uh sorry uh president dinesh my mistake is okay i'm too excited uh yeah so first and foremost i must say your talk couldn't have come at a better time for me personally because i'm a father of z children i'm sure all the listeners today could feel your passion and care about the youth and also the expertise in the area of coaching children or youth you said we can be inspired by the youth and your talk stored why and how we can be inspired by them the five skills uh which you mentioned are indeed a great summary and i feel very excited and motivated to engage with not only with my children but youth in general to help them develop these skills and to maximize their potential all in all um that was a fantastic and engaging session on behalf of rotary club of singapore i wish you all the best to carry out the fantastic work you are doing as an author coach consultant and so much more i would like to thank you for your presence at the meeting and for sharing your valuable insights with us a very relevant topic and so dear members and guests let us all give sindhu a very big round of applause you can understand thank you thank you yeah back to you i think the uh our next week's speaker is professor sattar bhavani and he will speak on leadership on in disruptive time so i think i before i close the meeting i would say that we used to have a few minutes of fellowship after this but today time is uh i think running out so i would say if those if ,False,True,False,False

let's hear from our guests about erickson's efforts to create connection in response to the disruption caused by covet 19. sorry so i'd like to turn over now to owal the head of people for singapore brunei philippines and pacific islands a wall thank you very much tyler can you hear me yes very good thank you very much tyler and gbw team uh for inviting ericsson to join this session and we are very much proud today to share our practices with the rest of the industries it's a huge opportunity for us so that that's the way we can move forward we can share our knowledge with other industry and of course it's not about sharing our knowledge and that will give us an opportunity to learn from other industry as well through your participation in this session so before i go into the detail part of it that okay what are the things that we are doing during this scope with pandemic so i want to introduce the company that i have been working with for last 14 years and i feel really proud today that i'm representing a company that helped us grow in our own domain and i'm representing that company today in front of all of you so when i joined ericsson most of the people used to tell me that okay joining sony ericsson probably that was the practicality 14 years back but you're no longer sony ericsson we're just addiction at this point in time so if i look into our company as a whole it's a global company first of all and what we do if you if you look into the all the service provider in our part of the world in our geography especially philippines and singapore we're namely working with all the renowned telecom operator if i give an example of smart or can be singtel in singapore we work with them and to also we ensure that we have a connectivity through mobile broadband fixed broadband wireless or wireless connection that we should also ensure that and at the same time what our service provider they are using at this point in time our global skill and scale which is the most important element and of course the product solution that we provide our technology leadership across the globe that really helps our service provider to shine in their respective countries at this point in time as i mentioned it's a truly global company operating 180 countries across the globe we have got employees 595 000 employees across the globe and if you look in the patent part of it we've got 54 000 patent in ericsson obviously that testifies that whatever smartphone we are talking about these days it comes through ericsson equipment whatever addicts and devices that you will find in each and every smartphone that you're talking about so if you look into the number 54 000 patent is a lot of lot of lot of patent that we are currently managing at the same time ericsson operates globally and obviously everything cannot come from the uh your headquarter we also work work in market area wide so currently the market area that singapore and philippines part of it we said market area southeast asia virginia and india basically that market area starts from if i put together geography wise it starts from india then you can put southeast asia and australia and new zealand and of course bangladesh and sri lanka are part of it so these are the countries that you are covering almost 13 countries i will talk about it a bit about our market area in my next slide and obviously you can also see all this net sales number where net sales is around 227 billion across the globe uh in 2019 obviously that is in swedish corner and that also shows that we are a swedish company and our headquarter is in sweden and the market area that i was referring to about around 23 000 employees who are sitting in this diverse market area if you go to go to the next slides okay thank you very much tyler and if i look into that market area that i was referring to from india up to new zealand and that's what we have got 30 countries but at least we have got 13 market that we are currently focusing on that means those are the key market that we have out of that of course the countries that we are representing me and my team today on the call like singapore philippines and brunei you are proud to support this uh part of the geography and it's it's a quite diverse geography honestly speaking if you look into singapore and brunei they're the top countries in terms of gdp if you look into philippines they are slightly lagging behind in the gdp but if you look in other angle that okay number of population that you have in philippines they are one of the top 15 countries in the world so it's a diverse country that we are managing when it comes to service provider we i have mentioned about our telecom operator namely singtel maybe dst in brunei unin in brunei and smart and globe in philippines so whenever we talk about those operators of course the people who are very much a familiar telecom industry where you talk about everest revenue per unit and you can see that rivers revenue per unit in these three countries varies between two dollars up to 30 so can easily understand how diverse the market that you're dealing at this point in time in this market if i look into these three countries obviously i've got around 1 000 employee and you're proud to host a shared service center in philippines who supports the global ericsson all this all through this 180 countries if you go to the next slide thanks tyler this quite uh this slide coin is interesting to me interesting in the sense that that talks about us that what we are doing currently see if you look into this three hours everest time that you spend mobile devices we all are doing it nowadays mobile devices that become our part of our life honestly speaking you want to buy a ticket you want to book a flight ticket of course you're not booking flight ticket nowadays but any kind of support that you need on the ground be it grab with any kind of service provider ordering food food panda you're using your mobile phone so you're spending a lot of time in that particular mode in our handset and obviously if you that will give us a give you an understanding that which industry we're in we're talking about ict industry that's why we're ordering food to mobile phone as i mentioned in my previous slide the number of patent that you have every smartphone has the presence of ericsson devices in their smartphone so you can easily understand how important we are in this total uh total ecosystem if you look another number of it the fifty percent of uh growth that you're foreseeing right we have got around nine billion subscription by the way it's up when it's a subscription maybe people one people can have two different subscription of course the number is more than the global population that's why we're saying that we are taming around 9 billion subscription at this point in time and of course it's a digitalized industry you can get to see so many digital and of course in going forward probably whenever we are sharing our best practice in the industry definitely i'm going to talk about how digitalized our people function uh system in ericsson at this point in time i go into the don't go into the number if you see on the right hand side how big this industry is it's a lot of money and this is the potential of this industry that we are in and honestly as an individual of being part of ericsson we are really really proud uh to be part of this industry and we would like to continue contribute in this particular industry obviously uh in terms of that now if i go to the next slide so we're talking about industry so now the most important element comes in okay we understand that we are supporting our service provider right but how do we collect the society are you doing something for the society of course i've given the example of mobile phone on an average we are spending almost three hours a day in a mobile phone for our daily needs but if you think about what we are doing for the society of course there are so many thing has been done through ericsson if i give the example of our market area that market area is from india up to new zealand diverse market diverse challenges so if you think about the challenges that cities like manila indonesia jakarta or bank of their facing we are part of how to solve the transport situation how to help with the pollution system how to help utilities so you can this is one kind of uh cities that you're talking about in your market area if i look another set of segment here of course it goes to singapore and vietnam where we can be part of transport system we can be part of shipment uh industries of these two countries that is which is very very helpful for those two countries if i go to malaysia and australia of course the amount of impact you're going to make in the energy cultural sector then definitely that will help those countries so in a nutshell we are playing a bigger role if i think about device business individual and the country level we are making tremendous impact in the economy of those countries next slide mr okay this is one of the favorite slide i always talk about since my joining in ericsson so if you look into this slide we are talking about uh three things one is our core values i think when you are in your in childhood right we are being taught what the vowels are a e i o e we can remember that so when a joint direction these three core values were embedded on us that okay professionalism respect perseverance that we carry in our day-to-day activities whatever we do today so when i'm focusing on these three core values again i have to repeat that professionalism respect and perseverance and this respect part especially i want to focus on that that help us moving in the industry that's what we see that many of our colleagues when i joined for erickson personally i felt that people are working for this company 10 years 15 years i was saying that 10 years 15 years is quite a long journey how come right now if i look back my career i have already spent 14 years in our exam if if i think about what are the things is a pooling factor for me that okay i want to stay in ericsson and continue and contribute to this industry of course our life here at direction respectful we respect our colleague and i think tremendously that is more of the value the feedback of our calling that is more important that's what we always look forward to as a human being now another angle that i can share of course probably i'm from bangladesh i'm currently based in philippines supporting these countries you can easily understand that we encourage mobility in our call three of us in our team we are from three different nationalities prudence will be students from malaysia rich is from philippines and from bangladesh so that's the beauty of ericsson that we have the values we have the feedback from all these different nationalities and we know how to respect those nationalities and take a decision which is very very helpful for our industry if i give another example if i focus on these three countries or prudence myself and rich are supporting where we have got 30 nationalities you can easily understand that how many diverse our organization is 30 nationalities among these three countries another example diversity i have already covered we are very much diverse in terms of culture given the example of internal mobility and last part i think that i want to really focus on the learning and development piece we invest heavily i can give you one example when kovit started hitting us right in that point in time many of the companies sometimes i hear from my industry colleague that okay we may need to put on hold our learning and development plan probably we used to we used to with all this classroom training program maybe you think twice how do we contact those training program in ericsson we took only two weeks to convert all the classroom training to the online platforms it's a huge achievement for us none of the learning and development program are halted due to this kovit 19 uh pandemic that were all impacted in this call so it's a very much advantage if i give an example that in my previous times talking about digitalization probably that's the advantage of a digital company that okay we can easily move all our classroom training program in the online platform and that really helped our colleague even though we have pandemic in one hand but at the same time we continue to support our service provider and the organization at the same time next slide please okay now i was taking you through all the business that we do because probably i was trying to take you through that okay when i joined erickson people say sony addicts are no it's not a sony ericsson it's ericsson so our business dynamics our supports process service providers they are different but when the kovit 19 in hit us then obviously i'll give one example one example that is a global company if you think about whoever in the call right you have seen that the kovit didn't hit us straight away it gradually came to our countries if you think about the total geography it didn't hit south america straight out it goes from asia europe then south america so that's the way it shifted so we had an advantage of learn the countries which are heavily hit initially so that really helped us because that's the beauty of being a part of a global company now if i look into the initiative i will put the initiative in three or four different bucket in our company we have a task force called concrete crisis management task force it's a task force which are combines of business leader people function ohs and security they take all the decision in that point in time whenever any crisis moment happens if my colleagues are on the call for philippines you remember that we have got volcano situation beginning of the year so in that point also crisis man tax force come into the picture so that really helped us to take a decision for us so that particular committee that decide on the business how do we continue with our business that means our deliverables to our service provider that should not get impacted at the same time we need to prioritize people's safety second thing all the local government regulation that we need to abide by that we can't violate any local regulation and we are respectful to the local regulation so that we need to establish in that point so cmtf decide how the business should operate last but not the least people part of it how do we engage them honestly cmtf shows us that okay our people leader they can put their self in people's shoes they can visualize what is people's requirement is so that we can chalk down all the requirement beat internet support beat ergonomic support so that you can chop down and support our colleagues on face by phase basis or gradual basis now i sub i covered the cmtf part business part and the last part i always praise our leaders leaders who can visualize that people's need leaders who are day-to-day basis they are interrupting the people and as a people function we are just facilitating the whole process so that our leaders can act on it we also announced a coaching session for our leaders during this fandomy around 200 plus leaders they're being taught the practical example that how to handle this kind of situation they're also doing various stand-up in between with their team every single day every door every alternate that really helps to connect to them before i hand over to my colleague prudence i would cover one more element that another committee that really helps to keep our organization going we call rc committee that means recreation committee so every country they are doing some other part of elementary yoga zumba training quiz show quiz competition this training is running all those things in parallel so that our people can get engaged sometimes when you work from home i'm sitting at home now three of us all are sitting at home now we are not going to office but sometimes your life become monotonous so that really helps to chill a bit of course talking to people relax a bit and you can take it from there onwards in terms of people initiative if i go to the last part of it many of my colleagues probably are keen to hear i will cover that in the later part of my presentation only i think there are a few things that we did we followed the local regulation that i've emphasized earlier second thing we also looked into how people can be supported by external experts so that we also looked at it we have got eap program we have got kindness commitment program so this is the unique free program that we did so without further due i should not talk about it i should pass on the floor to my colleague prudence to talk about those particular aspects students over to you hi thanks a while hi everyone i hope that you can hear me find so um i'm prudence people business partner in ericsson singapore and honestly i'm very glad to be here today you know given the opportunity by a great place to work you know to share some of the great initiative that we have done in ericsson you know especially during this pandemic time as well and you know if i could ask the audience here for today i think um one of the things that we all agree to it this is that you know there is indeed a shift in the focus due to this pandemic on you know how some of our priorities are changing you know compared to the previous year that we have you know nowadays um organization is putting much more importance um you know emphasis on the topic of you know mental wellness on the physical health of their workforce and they consider you know this topic far more seriously than ever before that we have seen in the past so previously you know some of this topic might be a huge topic or some organization might view this as a good to have but i think health and wellness has become you know a great importance to us to focus on and that he has now become a need for us due to the changing circumstances that we are in today so as you know awal has highlighted some of the key initiative earlier on so i would like to you know add on some of the flavor that you know he had briefly mentioned on to share more in-depth on the initiative that we have done um internally in ericsson itself so tyler if you could move on to the next slide so here um you know i would like to you know talk spend more a little bit more time you know talking about erickson care because this uh you know core insight that we just celebrated our ericsson care week in this month in october so what is you know ericsson care so erickson care is actually on our holistic approach to health and safety wellness well-being for us um as an erickson employee and everyone working on our behalf as well you know we are talking about like our customers our business partner as well as our vendor as well at ericsson we believe that we are well when you know we felt physically healthy emotionally balanced and resilience you know and financially in control and socially connected with our communities so the erickson care programs highlights you know the importance of health safety and well-being you know through this three priority as you see here that we echo so we care we stay safe and we are well so they are also full well-being framework that forms part of this ericsson care as well which is the first one that i would like to touch on is on the you know physical well-being so physical well-being what does it means it actually means you know being healthy balanced and preventing what's preventable you know it's about us being conscious of our posture you know how we exercise what we eat which healthy or unhealthy habits you know that we adopt and we can seize the opportunity to follow some of our aspirations in life whether you know it's inside or outside of our world you know to support this framework we have actually recently launched our home office furniture program that allows our employee to purchase you know desks chair and land now this gives our employees the right economic setup while working from home and on top of this program also we have the you know it support program where we allows our employee to actually loan the office monitor or some of the small office equipment for example like you know keyboards you know to bring back um to home for while working from home and the second uh well-being framework is on the emotional well-being so emotional well-being means you know maintaining a good mental health and work-life balance while building a resilient you know through our awareness of our emotion to be able to how to deal with stress and adapt to changes as well you know to support with this you know framework we have actually launched the employee assistant program where i will share a little bit more in my subsequent slide and um to also to add on to this also you know we host a couple of webinar where we actually invite some of the speaker externally from international sos you know to provide for webinar on topics like resilience change and the effects of the emotional well-being to um our everyday life here and the third component is on the financial well-being framework so financial well-being is really talking about you know how we take control of our finances and us being aware of our options and confidence while making some of the financial decision to meet our goals and plan and the last bit of it is on the uh social health well-being so social health well-being is about us being you know connected with the people we want you know having that sense of belonging and no feel supported that you know we inspire to work towards our purpose in career and in life as well you know to support this framework like awa has mentioned we have the you know recreational club that helped us to organize some of the plan you know fun activities for our colleague like you know virtual workout sessions and while we speak also we are actually in the midst of planning our virtual dinner and dance as well so this is the first time that you know we are doing this virtually so you know we need to come up with a great or creative ideas to run through our session for that dinner and dance and also you know we thinking of sending care package to our colleagues as well so all these four framework you know actually can impact one another you know for example you know if you keep checking email late at night you know maybe we forget how to relax and i mean and then we find it hard to sleep at night then we woke up the next day with less energy so because we you know we are tired we skip our exercise and then we feel tired and then we crave for you know sugary drinks snack you know drink more caffeine so this cycle keeps on continuing itself so that's where we aim to create a culture where employees prioritize themselves and we wanted to also create a culture where being well is accessible to all our people across the team so talking about accessibility we have the more well-being sharepoint and as well as we even have a well-being app developed in ericsson so we're using this platform our employee actually can find vast you know information on tips on how to take care of themselves you know down from fitness tips economic teams you know mental health podcasts articles you know videos and all are accessible with just a click only um next tyler if you could move on yeah so i've touched on um you know our has also mentioned about the employee assistant program so with the current global situation brought by kobe 19 i think our personal and professional lives have merged to an extent you know that there is no clear demarcations of working space you know as part of our commitment to our employee well-being um you know the mo the my people team you know we have launched the latest initiative on the employee assistant program or eap in short so previously actually uh eap is only available for our colleagues in india and anza but we see that you know there is a much need for us to extend this program to the rest of our employee across the moai as well or we call it in a southeast asia region so these eap services offer professional counselling to help our colleagues and as well as their family member as well you know to deal with any professional and or personal challenges you know the service uh it could include like you know improving relationship you know parenting issue couple support working from home challenges financial challenges and etc so we have actually partnered with eap providers like you know benestar you know workplace option one-to-one help where they have highly trained and qualified specialists to help our employees see through such issues you know while maintaining full confidentiality of it so all these services provided under our eap are at 24 times 7 and absolute no cost to our employee as well and there are also actually multiple ways that you know our employee can reach out to the counselor you know either via telephone you know with just a call or you know why an online chat where uh face-to-face or even the e-workshop can be arranged as well so from what i have shared right i think some of you you know within your current organization might have rolled out you know similar initiative as well but there are also some very specific um initiative that we have designed based on our ericsson culture transformation and the new ways of working where now i would actually like to invite my colleague rachel to share this with you over to you rich thank you very much prudence um i'm happy to be here to share with you all a little bit more of what we do in ericsson in addition to what abal and prudence has mentioned earlier um before i start maybe i can share to everyone that i have been in ericsson for um less than 10 months actually and seeing how ericsson management has handled the school with 19 crisis has made me feel that i really am where i need to be because i feel that the management genuinely cares about the well-being of its people and i'm also happy to say that this efforts do not go unnoticed by our employees because um in the recent provide 19 surveys that we had last april and september the area of well-being which states that employ the ericsson takes a genuine interest in employees well-being has been consistent as one of the top scorers across ericsson globally all right so moving on uh i will be sharing with you all two specific programs that we have launched in ericsson under the diversity and inclusion umbrella which focuses on kindness um inclusion empathy and humanness four very beautiful words that are very timely and very much needed during these times so um for our kindness commitment uh we have formulated a set of guiding principles which will support us in creating a sense of community at work and most importantly how we can demonstrate empathy and kindness to each other and to ourselves i hope you can see the background that i have here uh you can just read on while i continue these are the kindest principles that we have in ericsson so um why did we launch our kindness commitment program well we believe in the power of kindness especially during this times and how it can play our role in our health and well-being and ultimately drive superior performance also foster innovation and create greater business value you know make it has really shown a light on this whole link between kindness empathy inclusion and our overall physical and mental health and well-being uh what with the lockdowns in community quarantines and having to work from home where there's no more distinction between home and work it it's really posed a challenge on all those on all of us uh we're feeling more stressed and more fatigued by the ongoing uncertainty of it and its risk on ourselves and our loved ones and also while working from home we have to take on multiple roles at the same time you know we have to be productive employee home of home office manager school teacher chef house cleaner you know you name it so confidence really really increased risk factors for mental health challenges um so what what can we do about it well uh it's very important first and foremost that we be kind to ourselves and we be kind to each other you know simple actions uh such as keeping ourselves physically active which um personally for me is so hard to do now and also switching off after office hours taking breaks spending quality time with loved ones also checking in with colleagues encouraging them to reach out for help if they need it and also doing the same for ourselves because you see while working from home we we don't really get a visual understanding of how people are are doing since we don't see each other face to face so um it's extra important to look after our teams and colleagues during this time because uh i believe that when we're kind to ourselves and to each other we're able to minimize the impact of our on our physical and mental health we're able to manage better those boundaries of work and home and even though we're working remotely we're also able to contribute more to the company and most importantly it contributes to this culture of inclusion that we're trying to create in ericsson you know when we show kindness we're really showing respect and empathy to our colleagues and their individual situations so you may ask how did we activate our kindness commitment program in ericsson well first we shared with employees a downloadable desktop wallpaper and poster which will help them remember the kindness commitment to themselves and to others and this is actually the background that i have with me now and on the team level uh we provided a conversation guide to assist the managers in having meaningful conversations with their team so basically they discuss what they could do better as individuals and as a team to support each kindness principle and what action they can commit to undertake to make a difference for their team they then record their agreed action and take a team commitment photograph with the kindness commitment photo frame that we have also provided to them this is the this is then shared to all employees to our internal web page and lastly tied to our kindness commitment and to grow our inclusive culture we have introduced the inclusion empathy and humanness award so tyler if you could uh move on to the next slide please so that they can see they are thank you so this is basically a non-monetary award it's meant to recognize and celebrate our colleagues who consistently demonstrate inclusion compassion empathy caring and kindness to others to their everyday behavior or a specific action taken but who also does this without any agenda other than to support their colleagues uh the recognition can be managed to team member recognition as well as peer-to-peer recognition so how the employees recognize their colleagues through this program or through this award all they have to do is go through our encore rewards and recognition platform uh they just search the name of their colleague and right why they are recognizing the person this is then posted and seen by all employees across the region so across muawai and um since it was launched uh in q2 this year we have received we received good feedback we have received more than 200 recognitions i've personally seen some of the recognitions and i'm really touched because you know these recognitions were not about grand gestures most of them were about simple everyday acts of kindness caring and empathy that has really resonated with the employee giving the recognition so um just to wrap it up to conclude uh we at ericsson believe that our kindness commitment and our inclusion empathy and humanness award can really strengthen our culture of inclusion in ericsson we believe that inclusion is very important because we want to have uh we want people to have a strong sense of belonging and to form deeper connections because when you feel that you belong and that you can be your authentic self you know you can contribute more you can collaborate more you can really be at your best so um it's important now more than ever that we look out for each other we may be physically working apart but we must come together in our support for each other you know committing to acting with kindness and empathy and engaging as an inclusive community will help us all feel supported and bring out the best in in us so um we plan to continue these programs and build on it beyond covet uh because we see the positive impact that it has on our people and ultimately the business so uh with that uh i thank you all and i turn you over to tyler thank you thank you rachel um and i really want to recognize erickson for your strong commitment to creating a caring and inclusive workplace culture that's clearly helped your employees to feel safe and stay connected during these challenging times so i have a few questions and i want to encourage those in the audience to chat in any questions you may have as well we'll begin with a couple that we've prepared in advance and the first one um for a wall well how did the strengths of the erickson workplace culture help in your response to covid so one of the things that i notice is that these are not things that you went out and just started in the in the in the response to the challenging situation but it sounds like these are things that you've built on over time yup thank you taylor i think i'll go back to when i when i press start presenting right i was when i joined a reason three things that we have been taught respect professionals and perseverance right so we are being taught like that and that values that we are inheriting more than 140 years now so i think this and handling situation like co-feet is already in our dna because in this kind of situation the culture that you have respecting people be professional and perseverant right that really helped us to take a decision as i was giving the example of country crisis from dark souls where people the leader they put themselves in the shoes of the employees that okay what are the things my team member is needed my colleagues are needed i think since we show genuine care for our colleague so that's what really helped us that particular culture really helped us to manage kovid's situation great and um now perhaps a question for uh for prudence in your response uh to covid um were there any notable challenges or differences that you found for employees across southeast asia whether compared with other regions or within particular countries within the southeast asia region um and so were there any that you that stood out for you in response to covid but also as you think about the future you know the new normal are there any significant differences or considerations that you have okay thanks tyler i think um within uh the moai region itself when when we speak right it's already a very diverse workforce you know like i want to mention we have colleagues down from india australia new zealand and obviously the southeast asia country as well so um obviously that you know give us you know a lot of differences when we're managing you know koi situation in each of that countries so and we also have to take note if you know you look at the you know global news some of the countries in our moi region are actually sitting at the top 20 list of the highest cases in the world so like you know for example india itself you know when we speak here so undeniably you know these challenges and differences in each of the country um that we how we respond to that is um very much highly driven or influenced by the local practices itself you know the government guidelines on on how we develop develop some of the processes so we um have stress you know a couple of time earlier on we really have to respect and adapt to the local guidelines to ensure that we comply and act accordingly set up by the government it's a respective government you know for instance you know if i to take it back locally in singapore when the singapore government has announced the circuit breaker in april so we have to get you know all our employees to work from home no one is supposed to be in the office unless you know they are given an approval to carry essential tasks to support our customer but you know as we speak during that time our colleague in anza has actually already started working from home much earlier because of the situation of their country itself and as we speak as well during that time when i converse with my colleagues in vietnam they are actually having that conversation on how to get back to office you know that's you know show how various the situations you know differs from each of the country depending on how that you know pending pandemic hits the country itself and in terms of you know how the challenge that we anticipate um you know working in the new normal i think definitely one of the things that i would um think a biggest challenge for us will be on the employees mobility itself you know with you know most of our country where the borders are still closed i think that's a challenge for us and that we have to recognize the fact it's you know keeping us very difficult to get the right talents and also resources to support our customers so you know to our in order to support our customer actually um in the past we um relied on our short-term assignment you know our engineers to fly from other countries you know to support some of our project at a short time period but because of this you know travel restriction obviously this forces you know to think and look at other order alternative to manage this as well so i would also you know like to um you know invite my colleague rich if you know she has anything particular that she would like to chip in on this point as well yet rich anything that you would like to add on uh yeah thank you prudence um like prudence has mentioned our market area consists of different countries with varying economies and different local regulations that pose unique challenges i'd like to focus uh for the philippines in particular although uh we all we are all advised to work from home at least until the end of the year um employees are actually facing difficulties with uh our erratic internet connection there's also limited mobility like prudence suspension since uh right now we are all still under gcq until the end of october there there is also a sense of dread whenever field employees need to visit our sites for fear that they would get infected even though the company has provided them a care kit including uh you know uh ppe's i foresee personally that this will be the same challenge as we will be facing until the quarantine is lifted or probably evacted introduced and made available to the general public thank you rachel um so shifting now a bit um the organization-wide efforts that you described across erickson are significant and um and you also mentioned in a couple of your comments um that the kind of preparation that you provided to your managers and your teams to work effectively remotely but i also heard examples of guides that you provided things like that can you tell us a bit more about how you prepared managers to lead teams um as they were working remotely rachel is perhaps you or or prudence yeah thanks tyler maybe i'll take this and note rage can chip in if she has anything you know to cover uh specifically um as well um i think prior you know prior to kuwait actually we you know do have the flexibility to work from home in ericsson right but it's just that you know with this current situation our colleague um you know working from home full-time most you know most of the day as well so i think that's where we need to really think about the effectiveness of that remote working especially for our manager when you know some manager may be new on how they could lead a virtual team during this time so in order to help prepare our manager for this um within the more people team actually we have provided a virtual leadership and a coaching program for our managers so this program is actually in partnership with our external lee hedge and harrison so under this program there are actually three modules that's being introduced where the first model is you know really talking about engaging the remote teams you know how manager could have an active listening you know how they could lead remote team at this time around and the second module is on the reframe to picture the picture where you know they're trying to get how the team member getting unstuck with the current situation and see things from a multiple perspective and the last module is on the power of conversation and to see like how managers can you know really give spontaneous feedback on having an honest uh conversation during this time around and taking into an expat and creating all this opportunity for a change during this time so um like i mentioned earlier on also you know the the webinar that we have organized there is actually a multiple webinar that we actually have already organized for our people either the manager or the employee itself not to um help them prepared and also how giving them the tips on how to work effectively remotely and also i think um we also have this bi-weekly uh where we call it a newsletter be val on tips for managing health and wellness so actually um this just keep keep getting as a reminder for people you know sometimes people need that permission you know to you know have a stop have a break and prioritize themselves because you know sometimes right now when we are working from home right now you know maybe we are having that sense you know as an employee is it okay to take a break right now is it all right because you know when we are at working from home that's where the consciousness of you know being on top of everything just kicks in so that's where i think um this allows us you know to give that permission and help people to remind them that it is okay to take a break it is okay you know to have a walk and then come back and take meetings or call there later and also on top of this i think locally um we actually had a one-on-one conversation with our line managers um you know to talk about how they manage the team is there any challenges that they are facing and similar session is also hosted for our employees where actually we have a one-to-one conversation with all our employees where we you know dedicated this full active hour online chat with them via microsoft team or skype you know they can you know ask us questions or any concern that they want and we are actually actively addressing their concern during that time and surprisingly when we first roll out we really get a good response for our employee on this initiative so rich which i'm not sure if you would like to add anything from your site as well yeah actually through this you've covered basically most of it but maybe i can just add on um i think the regular voice and covet 19 employee pulse surveys that we that we do has encouraged our employees to you know speak up and this has made the management aware of the burning issues that they are faced with and in turn um the training and coaching programs for managers uh that students mentioned earlier uh they incorporate this each these issues and guide the managers on how to address them thanks rachel so what i hear is really a multi-prong approach that's both conveying information as well as asking for information from the employees um and so i appreciate that that that it takes kind of a multi-pronged approach like that for folks to be able to feel comfortable both managing as well as providing and asking for information um i'll ask one more question and this one's for uh for a while um well as you think about your hr and senior leadership people priorities looking forward what are the things what are a couple of things that stand out for you most significantly i think i will give that answer in two-fold right of course one part is senior leader and of course the people function on hr that we're referring here so if i think about senior leader of course we want to continue to support our uh customers that is the most important customer is the forefront that okay they should get what support whatever support they need and whatever support that we are committed to that is number one so that will continue now if i go back to the people function part of it uh this kovit 19 pandemic is a journey that that taken us through and so learning as well i think it's not a no company will sell that we are totally prepared because it took us by surprise that okay how the the thing have to do one of the areas that you're focusing on reskilling and upskilling that should be one of the focus areas re-screen upskilling if i give that example it's very simple that when you talk about telecommunication everybody on the call they'll talk about 3g 4g 5g if you look at the number 345 that means technology is advancing and you prepare the organization for this advanced technology and the most the the way we manage we use our global skill and skill right and you need people to fly over or support remotely and that's why you have another challenge that you need to also build local talent because god forbid that if we struggle bringing our foreign expertise back into the country and that's where the challenge comes in i need to focus on localization how can we build the talent how can he create a proper succession plan that okay if my 5g expert leaves tomorrow who can take over in a nutshell if i look into the two key areas that you should focus on of course supporting the customer that will continue i'll not go into the numbers that how our numbers will look like but if i think of people functional standpoint i think it's most important is killing enough killing of the people localization and succession these are the key important priorities that we have on the table but another important point we have to stand beside our colleague that's what we are doing talking to the line managers one to one talking to people who want one these are the two key important element that will continue in parallel wonderful thank you and i'm aware that we've had about five minutes remaining in the session and so let me um we uh we did not have any additional comments or questions from uh from participants um and so i uh would like to then say thank you to awhile rachel and prudence for joining us today we uh we really appreciate your hr teams notable efforts to keep your employees connected in response to covid and the next normal we congratulate you again on your certifications as a great place to work in both singapore and the philippines and we really want to recognize the critical work of erickson employees to keep all of us connected with our family members our friends and colleagues across the globe during these very challenging times you know i know that uh that for me um the the ability to be able to pick up and have my uh my elderly parents pick up the telephone and uh and have connectivity uh be able to share has really been um important as i'm sure it has been for uh for so many around the world so uh thank you and and thank ericsson for for that thank you very much tyler for inviting us in this session so in closing i want to invite any of you who have joined today to please contact us at a great place to work if you're interested in learning more about our survey certification and consulting services cyrus will uh has included links in the uh in the chat box if that's of interest and um yeah uh uh well anything else uh before we conclude and i think as i said that it's a great opportunity for us it's a two-way journey between the industry now you know us we are from ericsson we are not behind the curtain anymore because uh we want to be part of the journey honestly speaking and whatever industry practices that we are doing in our organization we are feel free to share with organ uh rest of the industries and we are keen to learn from you that is one of the important elements that we are here not to say that what ericsson does but also we are here to keen to learn from the industry that so that as the industry we can go further and support our colleagues and their families well thank you and i appreciate you sharing the examples today i think that uh one of the things that we've observed that great place to work is that companies that had a strong culture and strong foundation going into covid are much better prepared and to to be able to respond um and so i encourage all of you who are are on the call today on the webinar today to think about how you can strengthen and continue to build the cultures that make yours a great place to work recognizing that your challenges are very different recognizing your industries are very different and that the solution probably has there are probably a number of themes that cut across but that the actual solutions are are probably quite unique to to your own needs and so with that um that'll conclude our our webinar for the day and i wish you all a great afternoon [Music] bye now ,False,False,True,False
EYHw-lOjuYs,Sajid Javid makes a statement on Covid-19,UC3EmxrWVl7K8xBH_UVIWY4Q,dailymirror,2021-07-05T17:40:58Z,Sajid Javid presents the Government's end of lockdown plans to the House of Commons.,i'm extremely grateful for you accommodating the timing of this statement today i'd like to update the house on the pandemic and our road map to freedom mr speaker this morning i joined some of the remarkable people who have been at the heart of the pandemic response at a service to mark the nhs's 73rd birthday at st paul's cathedral together we were reflected on a year like no other for the nhs and for our country i know that honourable members on all sides of this house would join me in celebrating the decision by her majesty the queen to award the nhs the george cross i can think of no more fitting tribute to the nhs i know that everyone in this house indeed everyone in this country will celebrate this award mr speaker there's no greater demonstration of our higher regard for the nhs than the manner in which we all stepped up to protect it now it is thanks to the nhs and many others that we are vaccinating our way out of this pandemic and out of these restrictions 86 percent of uk adults have had at least one jab and 64 have had two we're reinforcing our vaccine wall of defense further still i can tell the house that we are reducing the dose interval for under 40s from 12 weeks to 8 which will mean that every adult should have had the chance to be double jabbed by mid-september and those vaccines mr speaker they're working the latest data from the ons suggests or shows that eight in ten adults have the covered 19 antibodies that are so important in helping our body to fight this disease when we look at people aged over 50 the people who got the job earlier in the program that figure rises to over nine in ten now mr speaker allow me to set out why all of this is so important before we start putting jabs into arms whenever we saw a rise in cases it would inevitably be followed by a rise in hospitalizations and tragically a rise in deaths too yet today even though cases are heading upwards in line with what we expected hospitalizations are increasing at a much lower rate and deaths are at just one percent of the figure we saw at the peak our vaccines are building a wall of protection against hospitalization and jab by jab brick by brick that wall is getting higher and for those people who sadly do find themselves having to go to hospital we have better treatments than ever before last week on my visit to st thomas's hospital clinicians were telling me just how transformative dexmetham has been in the effort to save lives and taken together the link between cases hospitalizations and deaths is being severely weakened and this means we can start to learn to live with coded now as we do that mr speaker it's important that we're straight with the british people cases of covid19 are rising and they will continue to rise significantly we can reasonably expect that by the 19th of july the number of daily cases will be far higher than today against this backdrop i know that many people will be understandably cautious about easing restrictions after many months of uncertainty this is entirely natural but we can now protect the nhs without having to go to extraordinary lengths that we've had to do so in the past that's not to say that this is going to be easy mr speaker of course the pandemic is not over the virus is still with us it hasn't gone away and the risk of a dangerous new variant that evades vaccines remains real we know that we covered 19 the situation can change and it can change quickly but we cannot put our lives on hold forever my responsibility as secretary of state for health and social care includes helping us to turn and face the other challenges that we know that we must also address from mental health to social care to the challenges of long covered i am determined to get to work on busting the backlog too the backlog that has been caused by this pandemic about clog that we know will get a lot worse before it gets better now as i said to this house as i set out mr speaker last week i remain confident that we can move to step four in england on the 19th of july and that the government will make its final decision on this on the 12th of july so today mr speaker i wish to set out further details of what step four will look like in essence our national response to covid will change for one of rules and regulations to one of guidance and good sense we will revoke all social distancing guidance including the two-meter rule hallelujah except some specific settings such as ports of entry and medical settings where of course it would continue to make sense it will no longer be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in any setting including public transport although we will advise this as a voluntary measure for crowded and enclosed spaces it will no longer be necessary to work from home there will be no limits on the number of people you can meet there will be no limits on the number of people who can attend life events like weddings and funerals and there will be no restrictions on communal worship or singing we will remove legal requirements on how businesses operate capacity caps will all be lifted and there will be no longer be any requirement to offer table service all businesses that were forced to close their doors will be able to open them once again and we will lift the cap on named care home visitors so that families can come together in the ways they choose to do so mr speaker ministers will provide further statements this week on self-isolation for fully vaccinated people including for international travel and on restrictions in education settings including the removal of bubbles and contact isolation in schools today i can also confirm to the house that we have completed our review of certification while already a feature of international travel we have concluded that we do not think using certification as a condition of entry is a way to go for people who haven't been offered a full course of vaccination and for businesses we felt that the impact outweighed the public health benefits of course mr speaker businesses can use covid's certified as covent status certification at their own discretion and from step four onwards the nhs covert pass will be accessible through the nhs app and other digital routes this will be the main way that people can provide their covered status a status that will achieve once they have a completed a full vaccine course a recent negative test or some other proof of natural immunity now mr speaker taken together step four is the biggest step of all a restoration of so many of the freedoms that make this country great we know that as a consequence cases will rise just as they have done at every step on our roadmap but this time our wall of protection will help us while step four will be the moment to let go for of many restrictions we must hold on to those everyday sensible decisions that can help make us all safe the responsibility to combat kobit 19 lies with each and every one of us that means staying at home when you're asked to self-isolate it means considering the guidance that we're setting out and it means getting the job both doses when you're offered it that you please please take the jabs and something that this is something that everyone can do to make a contribution towards this national effort and it may even mean for some people that they will get three jabs in a single year last week the jcvi provided interim advice on who to prioritize for a third dose and our most vulnerable will be offered booster covert 19 jabs from september in time for the winter and preparing for the winter ahead is not just about covid but flu as well because of the measures in place this winter almost nobody in the uk had flu for 18 months now that's obviously a good thing but it does mean that immunity from flu is down this winter's flu campaign will be more important than ever and we're currently looking at whether we can give people the covert 19 booster shot and the flu jab at the same time mr speaker step four is the next step in our country's journey out of this pandemic i know that after so many difficult months is a step that many of us will look upon with a great deal of caution but it is one that we will all take together with a growing wall of defense against this virus a wall that each and every one of us can help build higher it's vital that each of us plays our part to protect ourselves and to protect others into better days ahead a commend commended statement to the house secretary of state jonathan ashworth great grateful uh mr speaker can i uh start by paying tribute to uh uh to our nhs on its 73rd anniversary and thank again our extraordinary health and care workforce the best birthday present they could have of course is a fair pay rise not the proposed real terms pay cut that is currently on offer now we all mr speaker want to see these restrictions end lockdowns are a sign of policy failure and i hope that when he makes the final decision next week it will be based on the data the modeling and the sage advice but let's be absolutely clear about what he's talking about today when only 50 of the total population across england are fully vaccinated and another 17 percent partially his strategy as he indeed was gracious enough to concede accepts that infections will surge further and continue to rise steeply except that hospitalizations will continue to rise until they reach a peak later this summer presumably some of those hospitalized will sadly die mr speaker and thousands upon thousands mostly children and younger people but others as well will be left exposed to a virus mainly because they have no vaccination protection but we also know even when double jabbed you can catch and transmit the virus and many of them will be at risk of serious long-term chronic illness the personal impact of which may be felt for years to come so even though the vaccination may have broken the link with mortality there are still questions uh about the link between morbidity so as part of his strategy of learning to live with kovid can he spell out today for the british public what that actually means in his view learning to live with covid how many deaths does he consider it is acceptable when we're living with covered how many cases of long covid does he consider acceptable when we are living with covid and given that we know that when the covid rates uh circulate at high rates that virus can escape and evolve uh what risk assessment has he done of the possibility of a new variant emerging and will he publish publish it now the secretary of state says that every date for unlocking carries risk and that's why we need to learn to live with covid but we shouldn't have to take a high risk approach we should be pushing down risk indeed we mitigate against risk across society all the time we just don't accept other diseases we take interventions to try and prevent other diseases so why is he collapsing all mitigations completely when he knows that the kovid rates will continue to rise he'll be aware that israel has reintroduced its mass mandate because of the delta variant so why is he planning to bin hours masks don't restrict freedoms in a pandemic when so much fire risk is circulating they ensure that everyone who goes to the shops or who takes public transport can do so safely because wearing a mask protects others if nobody is masked covered risk increases and we're all less safe he must understand that those in the shielding community are particularly anxious why should they feel shut out of public transport and shops because he's abandoned the mass mandate that's no definition of freedom i recognise and who else suffers when masks are removed it's those working in shops it's those who drive the buses it's those who drive taxes it's those who work in hospitality it's the low paid workers who also have been without access to decent sick pay many of whom live in overcrowded uh accommodation those have been savagely disproportionately impacted by this virus from day one and now he's asking them to bear the brunt of the increased risk again so again will they explain to us why he thinks abandoning masks is a sensible proposal to follow given that people will still need to isolate as he recognized intestine trace will still be operate in operation will he accept that living with the virus will mean more so than ever that those who are sick will need to isolate themselves from the rest of society so will he ensure that they are paid proper sick pay and isolation support to do it has he agreed with me it's been a monstrous failure of these past 15 months that isolation support has not been in place now masks are effective because we know the virus is airborne so he could put he could further mitigate covert risks by insisting on ventilation standards in premises and crowded buildings he could offer grants for air filtration systems instead all we get is more government advice ventilation in buildings and grants to support air filtration systems doesn't restrict anyone's freedoms mr speaker and indeed it would probably help us get some of those 400 000 children back into school who have been off school because of because of covid yesterday mr speaker he said he believes the best way to protect the nation's health is to lift all restrictions now i know he boasts of his student years at harvard studying pandemics but i think he may well have missed the tutorial on infectious disease control because widespread transmission will not make us healthier we're not out of the woods yet but we do want to see lockdown end but we need those life-saving mitigations in place we need sick pay local contact racing continued mass wearing on public transport and ventilation in built in in buildings and schools to prevent further illness i hope when he returns next week he has put those measures in place thank you mr speaker can i thank the right one gentleman for his uh comments and and just turn into those uh first of all that uh the decision i think he started by saying can he get reassurance that the final decision uh on uh go or no go on july the 19th for july the 19th which we will make on july the 12th uh will it be informed by uh the the very best expert data i mean of course it will be just as every decision has been informed in that way and i must say i've only been about a week into the job mr speaker but i'm incredibly impressed uh by our scientists and medical advisors and public health england and uh take this opportunity to pay tribute to all that they have been doing and mr speaker turning to his second point about the cases and the link between cases and hospitalization and death i mean this is absolutely central to this next step that we're taking so case numbers are high and as i've said they will go higher and they'll go significantly higher and we need to be ready for that but what is far more important is how many people are ending up in hospital and how many sadly are dying and that is where the vaccines have worked alongside the treatments that the that we now have that we didn't have a year or so ago and it has meant uh the the the link between cases and deaths has been severely weakened the last time we had 25 000 new cases a day we had around 500 deaths a day the level now is um that is 1 30th of of that and uh and i know that right oral gentleman would welcome that and and understand that as we move forward there is no risk-free absolutely risk-free way to move forward uh but we do need to start returning things back towards normal and learning to live with coving his question around masks again we've taken the best public health advice and uh and he would know from what i've said that although we will remove all legal requirements for anyone to wear a mask in any setting we expect people to behave sensibly and and think about others around them so for example uh that the guidance will be there so if you're on public transport let's say in a very crowded tube i think it would be sensible to wear a mask not least for respect for others uh but if you're the only person in the carriage late at night on the east coast main line then you can choose uh much more easily not to wear mask certainly this because there's hardly anyone else around so we expect people we trust people uh to make uh sensible decisions and i think that's the way uh we should move ahead he's also asked about uh compensation uh sick pay and uh and he knows that many measures are in place and we will continue to keep those under review the slight committee jeremy thank you mr speaker i support the approach the secretary of state is taking for the simple reason that two vote doses of the vaccine work against the delta bearing but with 350 000 new cases daily across the world the battle against this pandemic is far from over does he agree that if we want to prevent another lockdown in the run-up to winter apart from the booster jab program the most important thing we can do is to improve the way test and trace works in korea they managed to use it to stop any lockdowns here it failed to stop three lockdowns and the head of test and trace told my committee that between 20 and 40 percent of people were not isolating when they were asked to so with his fresh eyes in the job will he ask officials for new advice as to what we can do to improve test and trace to stop further lockdowns first of all mr speaker may i thank my right older friend for his uh support these measures i know he speaks with the greatest being experience in a uh and i want to thank him for that uh regarding a test trace and isolate uh he's right there are many successes over the last year that we can be proud of but there are also many improvements i think that can be made as well and uh i want to tell him that i have already asked for such advice and i look forward to talking to him about it in the future let's go to snp spokesperson dr philippa whitford philippa thank you very much mr speaker this pandemic is very far from over so with cases soaring across the uk i'm surprised the health secretary is planning to end all coveted measures the delta variant which was allowed into the uk due to the failure of border quarantine is twice as infectious as the original and is infecting younger age groups including children it also shows significant vaccine escape with only 33 protection against infection from the first dose while receiving two doses of either vaccine dramatically reduces hospitalization the numbers are rising and only half the population are fully vaccinated that means the other half are not and many won't have that opportunity until near the end of september the secretary of state talks about the percentage of adults that are fully vaccinated but he must know that isn't how herd immunity works it's achieved by reducing the number of susceptible people in the whole population to stop onward spread of the virus the uk government's failure to lock down last september allowed the alpha variant to emerge in the south east of england and spread across the uk and indeed the rest of the world so if the health secretary is going to just let it rip how does he plan to avoid generating yet another uk variant with even greater vaccine resistance with over a hundred and fifty thousand people dead why is he returned to the false narrative that covet is just like flu is it just wishful thinking and why is he planning to end even simple measures like mask wearing he has suggested people need to just learn to live with it but appears to be completely ignoring the risk of long covert which is already affecting over a million people including children so how does he plan to avoid soaring cases of long covert in unvaccinated young adults and children does he consider them to be collateral damage or just a price worth paying brewster mr speaker i have to say the honorable lady she started off well but her points that she made just completely degenerated into political point scoring and she she should know much better than to engage in scaremongering of the scottish people of the british people and she has no respect for what is happening and trying to treat this whole issue uh with with a degree of respect and seriousness i mean it's using phrases like let it rip if anything mr speaker the only part of the uk where cases could be described as ripping would be in scotland where the case rate is higher than any other part of the uk in fact i think they have the seven of the 10 highest hot spots in terms of number of cases throughout europe and the honorable lady should reflect on that and then she claimed that so that's that i i suggested that somehow that covid is like flu i've never said that it would be complete nonsense for anyone to suggest that cobit is like flu she should think about the millions of people across the world the thousands that have died in the uk i think how dare she suggest it's like flu in even raising that uh the issue when it comes to flu mr speakers to say just as we have had to learn to live with flu when in some years we've had 20 000 deaths sadly from flu we have to learn to live with clothing the honourable lady should reflect on what she said and stop playing political football with this serious issue and the house vigil bottom there mr speaker can i welcome the secretary of state in this role and say to him in public but i hope i've said to him private that when he was secretary for housing he's one of the few ministers to actually understand the plight of residential leaseholds and i thank him for that and i hope you'll do as well in this job as well can i put to him as well as the recognition of the national health service it'd be a good idea if you can find some way of recognizing the role of teachers and their assistants in schools you've done as much to keep the young people this country up to their education and occupied even though remotely many people contributed and i finally put to him that i hope that despite the occasional political remarks that any of us may make but he'll work with the other nations of the united kingdom and with other nations around the world so we can defeat this the impact of this condition together mr speaker can i thank the father of the house for his uh kind comments and uh and he may have heard me say earlier that the education secretary will say much more tomorrow about the action we will be taking around schools and educational settings including the removal of bubbles the bubbles requirement uh from july the 19th uh as well and uh and he's made an excellent point about working not just across the united kingdom which i would tell him despite what we just heard from the other the the the previous honourable speaker just a moment ago there's great cooperation and uh and that will of course continue but also international cooperation both through our leadership of the g7 and the kovacs alliance let's go to manira wilson thank you very much mr speaker the secretary of state will be aware that for clinically extremely vulnerable people with compromised immune systems double vaccination provides a much reduced level of protection compared to the rest of the population he'll also be aware that pregnant women in their third trimester are considered clinically vulnerable and many people in these groups are anxious about what today's announcements mean for them so could he confirm what advice is being published for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and specifically will he consider allowing pregnant women to have their second jab after 21 days madam deputy speaker um in terms of course there will be people that are that are more vulnerable sadly to this virus that will be uh concerned about step four i entirely understand that and understand the the the caution and uh how they can be anxious we will be publishing uh further guidance along the lines that the honourable lady uh has mentioned uh with regards to her uh question uh on the second dose for uh pregnant women uh i will have to take advice on that uh just to warn colleagues that this this statement will finish at six o'clock because of the need to go back to the debate on the uh bill so i would urge colleagues to be brief martin vickers thank you dr speaker um the majority of my constituents will certainly welcome the secretary of state's statement but in in that council area the nhs digital rate at the moment is 591 100 000 which is considerably ahead of the national average and that inevitably causes concern particularly amongst the yellow linear and vulnerable groups i've got full full confidence in the local nhs and council and other officials who are dealing with it but it may if it continues to worsen uh will the my iphone boyfriend meet with me and my honorable friend from grimsby to discuss whether additional support and resources is required madam different speaker of course understand the the importance of the question for my honourable friend and and i have to tell him as i've said uh in my statement i do believe the case rate nationally and including in his own constituency it will uh worsen but what it what is uh far more important is the hospitalization rate and uh and the death rate and he would have heard what i've said earlier uh but i would be more than happy to meet with him on any occasion to discuss these issues further jim shannon and i'm david speaker can i thank the southern states for the health statement after the approach by government centrally here uh to drive the vaccine rolling across across all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland that are together as always the approaches outline the government seems to be a sensible approach can the second state outline what discussions have taken place with this health counterpart in northern ireland to ensure that northern ireland cautiously and carefully moves forward at a similar pace as they hear bearing in mind our level of transmission and them of the need to be wise and wary can i thank the honourable gentleman for his remarks about the the vaccine as and as he has said it is a very successful uk why program the the take-up of vaccinations in northern ireland is is just as high as any other part of the uk uh i'm working closely uh with my counterpart in northern ireland we've already had uh two discussions in one week and we will be speaking on a regular basis and coordinating and it's working very well andrew james mr speaker can i welcome a right honorable friend's statement i think he will be greeted by a sense of relief across the country the challenges that people have faced during its lockdowns have been so profound this success of course is only possible because of the vaccine rollout so will my right honourable friend keep the pressure up to ensure as many people as possible are vaccinated but whilst doing that also really put focus upon the significant catch-up required on dealing with other health conditions and particularly thinking about mental health and cancer my honourable friend is right to raise this and what he points out and sometimes i think it's uh missed by certain members of this house is that the the pandemic uh has caused many other non-covered health problems and uh he's he's mentioned two of the most important uh which uh the the increased uh problems with mental health uh that we are seeing plenty of evidence of and then also uh with cancer and thinking cancer referrals in fact uh that i've been told that the the departmental officials think there's at least some 40 000 people that or in a normal year would have come forward for cancer referrals that did not come forward and uh and this is just a reminder of why it's important for us to move back towards freedom and learning to live with covert we now go to ben lake yes the welsh government has suggested that an easing of wealth restrictions is unlikely before the july 19th and any divergence of the rules applicable on either side of the border will raise questions of enforcement now the responsibility for enforcing social distancing rules on trains is the responsibility of the british transport police and so what discussions has the health secretary had with the secretary of state for transport and indeed the welsh government regarding the status of restrictions and cross-border real trouble hey madam deputy speaker the honourable general know already that there's and this is understandable there's been a difference in approach uh between wales and uh england and clearly there will continue uh to be and we will continue to coordinate i know that my predecessor coordinated uh on a very regular basis with his welsh counterpart and also when it comes to transport uh we the three of us my welsh counterpart myself will work carefully with the secretary of state for transport thank you madam deputy speaker um the it's hugely significant and welcome that the link between uh cases and hospitalization does seem to be broken by the vaccines i'd like to echo what my honourable friend from nesborough has just said harabra and can my right honourable friend assure me that notwithstanding the risks he's pointed out such as potential variants and increased cases that that focus that the nhs will have the focus and the resources to continue to on that backlog to bear down on the backlog as my right honourable as my honourable friend said when cases like cancer which is scaring my constituents and and everyone yeah yes madam speaker i can give my honorable friend that assurance and the the the backlog already at five million and as i've said today it's unfortunately uh going to get a lot worse than that before it gets better i think we can all understand why uh but today's announcement i think would have certainly have helped her in in our march to clear that uh backlog uh my old friend will know that the government has given significant additional funding in the billions to help with that but there will be a lot more to come in dealing with the priorities especially cancer neil handy speaker all of the warm words from the secretary of state towards the nhs at the top of his statement have been completely demolished by his attitude towards breast cancer surgeon but he says that she should know better when the reality is that she does know better and he should apologize to the all right honourable member from central air shire front doors absolutely outrageous comments and to use the escalation of cases in scotland as a political tool is absolutely disgraceful i want to talk about this madam deputy speaker i do not agree with the honourable gentleman we now go to mark harper thank you very much madam deputy speaker and i apologize for any uh discourtesy to the house in not being able to be here in person um the prime minister has confirmed that there will be contingency measures in place uh for winter and even if they're not legal restrictions they will have that effect on business can the secretary of state confirm what they are and publish the detail so members can scrutinize them at the earliest opportunity man and deputy speaker i can tell my wife or friend the i i believe what her he's referring to is that we will be keeping in place uh contingency measures uh and particularly for local authorities the so-called number three regulations at least until the end of september in case those powers are needed uh in the case of a a local uh breakout and uh of course there's there's no intention at this point that those powers will be used but we believe that it is necessary uh to have powers in place uh uh just in case he would have heard me earlier uh talk about the risk that still exists uh from uh new variants and and that is the plan but i'll be happy to discuss with him further we now go to caroline lucas thank you madam deputy speaker can the secretary of state explain why when other public health and safety measures aren't left up to individuals to decide he thinks that's an appropriate approach to covid failing to mandate mask wearing and stuffy crowded places like public transport where people are often pressed together for much longer than 15 minutes risks high costs allowing people to choose whether or not with others at risk is both reckless and unfair if the freedom to pelt down the motorway at 100 miles an hour is restricted because it poses risks to others why with millions still unvaccinated with some immune is suppressed and with the risks of long covets rising why does the health secretary not apply the same logic secretary of state madam deputy speaker can i say to the honorable lady i do understand where she's coming from but the important thing is we do have to learn to live with covid and that does mean that these restrictions that have been necessary up until now that we have to at some point confront them and start removing them and now is the best time to do that because of the defense that is being built by the vaccine sir desmond sway we will never again sacrifice free enterprise freedom of association and indeed freedom of worship in order to manage hospital admissions ever again will we madam deputy speaker i i take it from that that my one honorable friend is pleased with today's announcements speaker some have suggested that removing all restrictions in the way that the secretary of state has announced we'll create factories for new variants in parts of our communities so what advice has the secretary of state received from experts about the potential for new variants and what contingencies has he planned for containing such an outbreak if one were to occur madame deputies week the honourable gentleman would have heard in my uh statement earlier that that no course of action that we take now is without risk i think the honourable gentleman uh understands that and uh it is because there is still a pandemic as i said the pandemic is not over uh that we of course will continue to first monitor for new variants we will continue to have border restrictions uh in place we will continue to have uh some test trace and isolate procedures in place and and i think these measures taken together with the success of the vaccine program uh is the is the best answer to his question uh we now go to david simmons who i think is going to be audio only madam deputy speaker one head teacher in my constituency tells the tale of losing more than 2 700 days of education 390 children sent home and zero transmission amongst pupils in school so can i write an honourable friend assure me that swift action will be taken to ensure that children can get back to school head teachers can get back to teaching as soon as possible without the damage the current situation is creating yes madam deputy speaker i can give my honorable friend uh that assurance and the education secretary will be saying more uh later this week but i can uh confirm to my honorable friend that uh on july the 19th it is our plan to remove bubbles and to end the requirement for early years setting schools or colleges to routinely carry out contact tracing and we i will have more to say on how we intend to exempt under 18s who are close contacts from the requirement to self-isolate gravy deputy speaker given that masks help reduce the spread not just of covert but all kinds of respiratory diseases isn't it important to avoid mixed messages and actually encourage everyone to continue that kind of practice and the likes of good hand hygiene as a relatively routine part of a new normal to stop coughs and sneezes from spreading diseases deep state mana devastating i think uh what the honourable gentleman is suggesting is that people should have the freedom to wear a mask if they wish but it should not be mandatory it should not be mandated uh by law and there are countries yeah i lived in singapore for three years where uh people uh would wear masks if they were feeling unwell out of respect for others and if people choose to do that here that that'll be a good thing but it won't be a requirement uh from the government and uh and as i said earlier that in in certain settings in a crowded place let's say on the tube in london i think many people despite not being a legal required would choose to wear masks uh we now go to caroline noakes thank you madam deputy speaker the immunosuppressed want to know what the plan is for them will they be allowed tests for spike antibody levels on the nhs and will they be able to get a booster before september if their antibody tests show they have no protection despite being vaccinated speaker it's an important question for my right honourable friend and we are still uh considering uh what more we can do to to to give more confidence to the immune suppressed and we will be saying more on this shortly we now go to paul blonfield thank you madam deputy speaker um until recently ministers were saying decisions would be would be based on the link between infection and hospitalization below the link has been weakened it's not being broken hospitalizations are up 20 in the last week they've doubled in a month we all want here to unlock the economy but surely we should maintain barriers to infection where we can the secretary of state has said that wearing masks would be a good thing so will he accept that requiring them on public transport in essential shops and in similar locations would make sense and would reassure people madam deputy speaker no one is suggesting that the link between cases and hospitalization uh because of the vaccines has been completely broken uh what what i've said and this is the the fact based on the evidence that we are seeing is that it has been significantly weakened and that is uh clear uh from the data we're getting on a daily basis if you look in england the case rate of 25 000 i think less than 2 000 people uh currently with kobe in hospital which is far far lower than what we've seen before when we had such a high case rate mary robinson thank you deputy speaker i'm grateful to the secretary of state for his uh his statement today setting out the the way forward in 150 years since the foundation of cheatles together trust is championed and cared for people from 18 to 30 years old with disabilities meeting with their dedicated team last week it was clear that having navigated the challenges of kobe they're preparing for the future as a government looks to set out a new vision for the health and social care for health and social care can the secretary of state reassure auntie and third sector bodies like together trust that they will have their invaluable contribution recognized and be included as equal partners in its design madam deputy speaker i'm very happy to give my honourable friend that assurance the cheadle together trust and many other uh third party and voluntary organizations across the country really stepped up during the pandemic when the country most needed it and uh we will continue to work with them and i think at the at a suitable moment we should give them the recognition that they deserve thank you speaker it's a dereliction of duty by the secretary of state for health to tell people to live with the virus whilst denying people the basic financial and other support they need in two weeks time with restrictions lifted there could be over 60 000 cases per day the government says it will surge further huge numbers are denied the self-isolation payments tens of thousands of people each day will be forced to isolate on statutory sick pay of just 96 pounds per week so i ask the secretary of state for health could he live on 96 pounds per week today van der plee speaking it's right that we provide support including financial uh support uh for those that that are isolating and finding things difficult and uh we will continue to to do so and we will keep that under review dr luke evans madam deputy speaker i'd like to draw the house's attention to a story over the weekend of three batches of astrazeneca vaccines affecting five million people and the prospects of traveling to the eu i must declare an interest i've vaccinated many people with this uh batch and indeed had the batch myself so can he confirm that this is purely a bureaucratic issue that the vaccines are exactly the same and update the house over what talks he's had with the eu to resolve this problem first can i thank my animal friend for the work that he's personally been doing during the pandemic and and what i can tell not all doses that are used in the uk have been subject to very rigorous safety and quality checks including individual batch testing and physical site inspections and this is all done by the medical regulator mhra we now go to ben bradshaw given americans and other europeans have already been free to travel again for some time and given we were promised a vaccine dividend when can the millions of british families separated from loved ones abroad or simply who want a foreign holiday expect to receive the same freedoms back that other europeans and americans already enjoy madam deputy speaker i can tell the honorable gentleman very very soon and the secretary of state for uh transport will have more to say on this very shortly steve brown thank you last week i said i wanted to see a change of policy as well as tone from the new secretary of state and we have that today or at least an indication of such for next monday and i'm grateful for it can i ask my writer friend to give us some insight into his thinking about the future of test and trace surely it can't continue as now with context of contacts even if double vaccinated forced into isolation for 10 days at a time with all the knock-on effects that that has for society and economy madam deputy speaker i will be making a statement to parliament on just that issue and i think i will probably make it tomorrow we now go to debbie abrahams madam deputy speaker last december professor sir michael marmut revealed that the high and unequal covert death toll across england was down to historic structural inequalities that successive conservative governments have allowed to go uncheck and last week he quantified this and showed that greater manchester had a 25 percent higher covered death toll because of these structural socioeconomic inequalities so when will the health secretary deliver on the prime minister's promise to me in january in terms of implementing sir michael's recommendations to address these inequalities in my constituency and others and will ensure that we bill back fairer secretary of state mandate it's an important issue that the honourable lady has raised and we have seen sadly through this pandemic because of various inequalities up and down the country uh some people have uh suffered a lot more than others so it is an important point we do need to do more we do need to all collectively uh learn from this and i want to give the assurance that i know the public health england and the and the cmo the chief medical officer uh are looking into this and we'll be reporting to ministers shortly final question hugh merriman thank you very much madam deputy speaker i welcome this statement from the secretary of state can i just ask for clarity um the legal requirement to wear face coverings including on public transport it states we advise this as a voluntary measure for crowded and enclosed spaces should that be crowded in closed spaces and does he intend to put out guidance and what will he do to ensure that private operators can't mandate it um outside of that guidance thank you madam definitely speak i can tell my original friend it's the the guidance is is really asking people to use their common sense that if there are many other people around them uh particularly if the if the people around there might be more vulnerable let's say older people uh or for some reason people that may be as a group and vaccinated then we're just really saying use your common sense i think everyone is in britain uh will will do uh just that in terms of uh private settings it will be up to private businesses your shops for example to decide what they wish to do i thank the secretary of state for his statement and will suspend the house for one minute to make arrangements for the next business ,True,False,False,False
ieneqNmJZFg,"Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of Health care workers, CMAAO",UCHWnpY2uT74IsabuzuMJ7xQ,K K AGGARWAL,2021-06-12T05:38:57Z,,uh good morning everyone um good evening for a lot of people good afternoon for a lot of people which are joining from various countries uh we are on 62nd session of international speaker forum in association with uh simao uh we have been bringing a lot of various topics uh which are relevant during this pandemic time uh today we have another topic from uh again usa uh the impact of kovate 19 on mental health of healthcare workers during this covet and to present this topic we have dr avinash osnagar who has completed his psychiatric training from all india institute of medical sciences new delhi and western psychiatric institute in clinic from university of pittsburgh he's currently an assistant professor of department of psychiatric university of michigan usa he manages patients with severe depression ptsd and substance use disorder dr avinash welcome to the show this is our 62nd session we will introduce you with a lot of uh representative of various countries after the presentation when they are talking about their question answers and giving their update on their particular country over to you dr avinash for the presentation you can share the screen is everybody able to see the screen thank you yes yeah great uh first of all uh thank you mr alverwell and thank you all of you for having me present at your distinguished meeting i'm honored to be able to present this um this these are unprecedented times and uh and all of us are facing very unique challenges i think um over over the course of this pandemic you've heard of a lot of um medical challenges medical issues that people have faced with system issues that you've uh you've had all had to deal with i'm going to focus specifically on the mental health aspect of healthcare workers here there's a broader mental health challenge of dealing with a pandemic over such a long period of time that that also needs to be discussed but i'm going to be specific uh talking about mental health of healthcare workers which i think is really important being you all being being leaders uh among um your own medical associations in your respective countries so i do think that you have a unique role uh in in trying to promote mental health of health healthcare workers in in in your own respective countries so uh i don't have any specific uh conflicts um let me just is this full screen version visible to everybody yes better thank you okay great uh so uh so the objectives of the today's talk from my point for the next half an hour is kind of review prevalence of mental health issues among health care workers during the covet 19 pandemic a review factors affecting healthcare worker mental health in general and review strategies for leaders to adapt to help reduce the burden of mental health issues in healthcare worker healthcare workers so prevalence uh you know in a sample of about 256 healthcare workers from a university hospital in central italy this is from the early days of the pandemic uh when the rates of um were going up pretty high in italy they found that females stored a greater sense of us a degree of sense secondary traumatization females were more sensitive uh to the eye to the news to the idea of something bad happening and we're traumatized from from from the idea of getting covert or the impacts of covered a study coming out of china found that the psychological distress was seen in nearly 72 percent of patient of the healthcare workers uh depression was prevalent in nearly 50 of them anxiety was prevalent in about 44 of them and anxiety i'm sorry insomnia in about 34 percent uh lou at all from a study in china also found that uh healthcare workers who feared infections in their closed family relatives reported higher level of stress anxiety and depression uh magnavita at all who specifically looked at what is known as a burnout syndrome which is characterized by emotional exhaustion depersonal uh you're not able to hear me yeah yeah thank you so much is this better yeah yes better okay great uh so uh the burnout syndrome which is characterized by emotional exhaustion deep personal a sense of depersonalization a sense of low personal achievement uh which is measured during actually doing the previous uh epidemics slash pandemics of sars mers and stars kobe 2 found that a third of healthcare workers experience the syndrome of a of burnout which is basically has been shown to result in low productivity uh people not being able to function as well and people not reporting to work because of a sense of burnout uh partha sarthi at all from a study in india found that of in a study of survey of 3083 healthcare workers found that anxiety and depression was highest among those with frontline covet responsibilities it was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities so anxiety disorder over prevalence was about 23 in those with clinical versus 15 in those with non-clinical depression being about 20 versus 14.2 in in the in those who have non-clinical which is much higher than in the normal period of periods of time when there's no pandemic going on the rates of depression and anxiety is high among healthcare workers especially among those who have intensive work but this is much much higher and studies have shown this to be about nearly twice that of the normal rates in in in among this group uh singh at all in from a study in 2021 again i showed the depression anxiety and somatic symptoms which is basically reporting multiple aches and pains gi symptoms other neurological symptoms were present in about uh 50 depression being about 54 anxiety about 44.3 percent and somatic symptoms of about 54.6 percent in healthcare workers and especially those uh it was much higher in those working in covet 19 areas uh nurses and female healthcare girls are again this is a trend that you'll see commonly that nurse female healthcare workers tend to have more significant moderate to severe somatic symptoms and this is of particular concern because female healthcare workers provide a lot of essential frontline healthcare services nurses are seeing the most number of patients and to understand and to kind of respect that it's going to be important because if you don't take care of their mental health needs a lot of our patients health care mental health care needs will not be taken care of these healthcare workers use both maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies uh tan at all from a study in singapore formed among you know this was a study done among nearly 11 200 healthcare workers found that um burnout thresholds in the areas of disengagement and exhaustions were met by nearly 80 percent and 75 of the respondents that's a very very very high number of healthcare workers in even places like in in singapore in those who had high depression anxiety scores it was found that shifts lasting more than eight hours being redeployed were significantly associated with higher mean depression and anxiety scores uh in a study for nepal which found that 41 nearly 40 percent of healthcare workers had symptoms of anxiety 38 have symptoms of depression and about 40 35 had symptoms of insomnia so what you'll see is this is and i'm i've kind of focused on studies coming out from asia uh to show that this is a common issue for patients uh sorry healthcare workers in asia this is a common problem this is seen in nearly 40 40 to 50 depending on the study rates that you will see depression you will see a lot of anxiety and you will see a lot of insomnia so your healthcare workers are experiencing this and this is something that you leaders need to be mindful of so that it can be adequately addressed uh a systematic review which is the which is the largest kind of study in the field right now they found that you know that prevalence rate was about 23 and anxiety was about 22 again this is just from across all different uh studies from the studies from 13 studies that they looked at majority of these studies were coming out from china because they were earlier to report but there are newer studies coming out from a lot of other asian countries including vietnam thailand malaysia and so we will have more data in the future but i suspect the trend is going to be not very different from what we're seeing right now so what are the mental health factors what are the things that we need to think about in terms of psychological responses during a disaster during a pandemic and these kind of hold true and so some of these models are based on disaster psychiatry uh and so in you know in the early phase of um during the period when the cases are going up there is a fear for basic needs this is true for everybody and this is especially true for healthcare workers as we plan to there's uncertainty of how things will evolve and then when things coming start coming down we feel better but there's a whole lot of processing that needs to happen off that traumatic experience that people have experienced during during the period of stress during this acute rise in numbers sorry people go through these emotional highs and lows during the early period this is a johns hopkins model which talks about this early period when there is the impact and there is a lot of heroism people step up there's a resilience people there's a honeymoon period community comes together but as the pandemic goes on as it stretches on and on a period of disillusionment comes in this is when the emotional laws happen you know there are ups and downs and and then people get to this period of restoration which is very gradual and slow where they have to work through their grief they have to adjust to this new lifestyle new situation and rebuild and get to get back towards that normalcy so there is this period of you know initial period of strengthening uh of psychological and behavioral immunity which is followed by helping with the rebound process and supporting recovering and moving on during this process another way of also looking at is that when do during this dissolution disillusionment period is when people experience a lot of negative symptoms so there are a lot of trigger events that happen and there are a lot of anniversary reactions that happen and that itself can begin bring about a lot of trauma uh bring in a psychological trauma and begin uh symptoms of anxiety and depression which may not have manifested during this heroic uh and the honeymoon period so one needs to be mindful of that especially during this period so during big disasters you'll see broadly you'll see these big areas one is of distress reactions in the in the form of sleep difficulties anxiety somatic symptoms irritability anger distraction and isolation also during this period we will see some health risk behaviors people will start engaging in behaviors that are risky which is people who are starting will start using more substances so there's a greater alcohol consumption to cope with the stress to cope with anxiety they'll start smoking more there's a greater family distance distress that you might see you might see interpersonal conflicts and violence and there's a big disruption in the work life balance especially in the context of restricted activities and travel there is a smaller number of these patients as of these people will who will experience some kind of psychiatric disorders in in terms of depression anxiety complex belief and ptsd but it's also important to remember that this is a big resilience piece that happens too people find their own inner strength and community comes together and we get the best out of people during trying times and this is what helps people cope and so this is an important factor too that we need to be thinking about as we deal with a pandemic like this so kobe 19 has brought about unprecedented challenges so there's a high demand for medical services not just acutely but over a long period of time which puts a significant amount of stress on the healthcare resources and the setting and the staff itself so we've been in the midst of pandemics since at least the official declaration since the february march of last year so it's been over 13 months that this has been going on people healthcare workers have been forced to step up into roles outside of their own expertise this includes not just the clinicians but non-clinicians as well but people who have uh no experience or expertise in managing certain disorders i've been forced to do that for i can talk about i know of cases of across in different countries where uh you know psychiatrists dermatologists people who do not have necessarily the medical kind of experience have been managing patients with covert patients are medical general medical family medicine kind of practitioners being forced to manage patients with covet because there are no resources available so people being forced to step up into these roles outside of the expertise is an important consideration there are uncertain and evolving protocols for managing program 19 at one point a specific protocol a specific treatment treatment strategy is said to be the gold standard a few weeks later a different strategy becomes the gold standard and it's constantly evolving the evidence seems to be coming from so many different resources so many different places and news media that we we kind of lose track of what is the best way to manage patients we healthcare workers have a very high fear of contracting kobit 19 because of the degree of exposure and more importantly many of them carry the fear of spreading it to family members co-workers and their patients and many of in many countries so healthcare workers have had to live a life of isolation away from their own family members so this normally their family members would be sources of their strength sources of support for many of those healthcare workers that has been taken away so that's an important consideration that we need to be thinking about as healthcare workers get infected get sick themselves or experience high degree of burnout because of the volume and the degree of work that they're involved in this can result in absenteeism and shock staff shortages because workers are staying home when healthcare workers have been surveyed on their sources of anxiety they identified these main sources of anxiety having access to the right kind of ppe that is personal protective equipment which may not be available all the time may not be most um asian countries are developing and so they maybe have limited resources to ppe and so that is a big issue for healthcare workers exposure to kobit 19 at work and taking this infection back to their home to their families last uh the lack of fast access to testing if they did develop covenanted symptoms and uncertainty whether sorry about that uncertainty whether their organization will support and take care of their their own needs and more importantly their family needs if they were to develop some kind of infection uh support for transportation food and other personal family needs as work hours and demands increase access to child care when extra working hours are involved having the right skill set to if sent to work in a new area such as a floor nurse who's sent to work in an intensive care unit and lack of access to up direct information on management of this illness and communication about it so the apa experts on the principles of disaster management has suggested which is the american psychological psychiatric association expert committee has suggested that it's important to recognize that exposure to death especially when it's in high volumes uh it's important to recognize that this is an extra extreme stressor for healthcare workers healthcare workers face challenges of workers with less experience in intensive settings in a inadequate base of treatment as we just talked about in insufficient resources including lack of optimal self-protection which you talked about obstacles to meaningful connections with patients where their interactions with patients become so brief the the the basic doctor-patient relationship may be lost uh and decreased access to the healthcare worker support system such as families so one of the things that is has been advised is to apply this principle of a psychological first aid among healthcare workers which is to promote a sense of safety as best as possible that making sure that healthcare workers feel safe um helping them use self-calming techniques and this we can get into a little bit more d in in during the discussion promote basic self-care like food hydration rest period sleep and exercise during the midst of a pandemic as we are seeing the high volume it's very easy to forget about our own self we all hear about this in the airplane that you know before you put on a mask for someone else if if there's a oxygen pressure drop you you need to put on oxygen mask for yourself first before you put it on for someone else this is very important for healthcare workers to realize that they need to take care of their own food hydration respiratory sleep proactively during this pandemic so that they can help not only themselves but others as well unfortunately during the midst of stress it's very easy to forget some of these basic things you know uh the other thing that's shown to be helpful is encourage use of prior helpful coping mechanisms so things that have helped you in the past thinking about them and utilizing them during these periods of stress access to stress reduction resources like online resources like yoga apps and other things can be helpful creating a sense of team and connection between team members there's a very high tendency to feel stress and not talk to others and feel overwhelmed but a team cohesion and talking to other team members actually helps bond and helps team members work better so encouraging some of that is something that leadership we should be leadership should be actively be involved in uh providing social supports helping support self-efficacy and and then identifying and monitoring monitoring those in high distressing in high distress to get appropriate additional mental health team support for these folks would be very very important so how do you how do you cope and manage we talked a little bit about that uh one of the things is important it's very important to acknowledge is that death are occurring and that depth and challenges associated management managing debt is is is is a big concern stress is heightened by heavy workload as we talked about inability to follow the usual routines that we are all used to and having resource supports from family members or others is going to be important and one needs to recognize that and help help we need to help healthcare workers to acknowledge the impact by talking about these stresses and recognize and honor the efforts of all the work that the healthcare workers are doing it's very important to recognize the healthcare efforts on a regular periodic basis this i i personally feel this could be in small teams on a daily basis in larger groups on a weekly basis and at an institutional level at least in a once in two weeks or a monthly level so that people feel a sense of achievement a sense of a belonging and a sense of you know a higher purpose that that can be achieved by some of this recognition one needs to also be mindful of individual differences in responses to death some healthcare workers will talk about it others will not they will will shut down and they will kind of internalize it and experience their own depression and anxiety without talking about it so understand the differences between these uh uh individual responses and suggest coping mechanisms to manage these individual responses so what can the leadership do so one of the things that leadership needs to do actively is to respond to the healthcare workers needs and these and their concerns so these concerns can look can include workers without needing without the needed personal protective equipment workers witnessing human suffering to the extent that they have not ever witnessed before making life-and-death decisions and making decisions on who should get that resource at any given point in time and who shouldn't and that is brings about such a significant moral dilemma that can be that can affect healthcare workers for the rest of their life so this is something that people need to recognize a fear of infecting family members separation from family and fear of getting sick and that and and the healthcare workers mental exhaustion how can you help them how leaders can help them with modeling behavior so if if wearing mass is an important piece then leaders should be doing that at all times so that the rest of the team can follow that and this is just an example there could be other behaviors that leaders should be doing to model behaviors that can help the rest of the team need to listen to healthcare workers we need to protect them we need to prepare them and some of this preparation can happen when the health the numbers are down some of you were talking about how the numbers in your own country are down this is the time to prepare this is a time not to be inactive but to be proactive this is the time to make sure that if that situation were to ever arise in your own country your staff is prepared and that will help reduce the mental health burden and in when the numbers actually grow up be quick to support them and be quick to care for them things that help healthcare workers is to talk directly with your staff and listen to them be a servant leader being being part of your staff being proactive with them you know walking the floors as a leader on a weekly basis to show you support for your staff is helpful model the right way to put on take on taking off personal protective equipment if sometimes there is some degree of um disagreement uh on when whether they should wear a ppe or not wear a vp you can be a good role model to that setting up a buddy system setting up a system where every healthcare workers has has two or three buddies who can take care of the healthcare workers so if someone sees someone else in distress they step up and support their own body so setting up that system in each hospital or a health system is very important the next thing is to post and share tools and resources that are available for different aspects whether it's the medical care or it's the mental health care kind of easy having an easy resource that everybody can access to in a timely manner is going to be critical giving support to healthcare workers and their families is very very important and this is something that leadership within health the health industry need to talk to leadership outside of health the industry to kind of advocate for that to make sure the healthcare workers get that kind of resource and the most important thing is to communicate clearly as often as possible and let teams know what is going on keeping them informed is very is critical without that people will feel left out and people will feel anxious because they will feel unaware so the more you talk to your team the more you make them aware the more you keep them informed the better prepared they will be to manage your uh patience with kobit 19 and other situations so these are my references i'm going to pause now i think we are okay in time in terms of time and we can start the discussion if that works for everybody sure um thank you dr avinash for a beautiful presentation uh listen to them protect them prepare them support them care for them is a very important uh message you have given for this i would like to now uh invite dr chong as a chair for this session and before that i would like to acknowledge the president of obviously dr chong from singapore medical association dr ravi kumar from malaysia medical association also the immediate past president of simao uh dr professor uh from pakistan medical association dr alvin from hong kong medical association dr pillai from world medical council dr angelika from south africa medical association dr jamal chaudhary from bangladesh medical association dr hussein again from south africa medical association dr sajid from pakistan medical association dr hussain from pakistan russell from dr russell from unesco dr monica vasudev from usa dr nidhi from usa dr sanchita from igcp group dr menakshi from heart care foundation of india uh dr shashank joshi endocrinologist india also a very important task for uh in mumbai over task force he was preparing uh regrets received from deborah uh from brazil and murray from japan uh over to dr elvin hello yeah hi everyone can you hear me yes yes thank you dr avinesh uh great uh presentation very close to our hearts because uh you know even i myself felt so much stress over the last year uh dealing with uh you know kovit and uh we had a similar experience in singapore with sars in o3 so it was a bit of like a ptsd if you know what i mean because we had to go to it again so perhaps i have never heard of this singapore study that you brought up but i think one of the reasons why the rates were so high is because we had a rerun a rehash of all three you know especially a lot of us in the senior leadership who had seen the all three of course we were better prepared this time but nevertheless it was it was quite traumatic for us because the first time around was terrible o3 was incredibly challenging and i'm i'm sure alvin will will tell you that as well what happened in hong kong and singapore was terrible and and we had uh healthcare workers perish on us you know a few doctors perished a number of nurses perished it was really really dark times and i remember we were scrambling for n95 mass we've never heard of n95 mars at the time so what you've said to us is actually very real to us out here in in singapore and in hong kong property brings back terrible memories so so today's topic is very important i feel and you know it is rightly a good topic so without much further ado let me open up the questions to the floor whether everybody has any questions for dr abanesh great presentation thank you um um dr chan i'd like to ask questions uh dr avinash thank you for that excellent uh presentation i'm uh russell de souza from melbourne and i'm from psychiatry myself work with university of western here regimenting from your kalamazoo it works with that one of the things that we've been talking about um all what he brought in was was absolutely what we've seen but one of the important things that have come out particularly from organizational psychological medicine is a new phenomena of distress and moral distress and moral injury okay now if you look at a couple of studies there's an italian study um again bringing this area then there was a chinese study uh july 20 uh i can give you that and then there is an indian study by gupta in august 20 all showing the high highest of this the pathology that we are talking about anxiety depression the usual insomnia which is which is what we usually see but all these three have shown a significantly moral distress and more distance then leading to moral injury okay now this is an important new area because moral injury for psychiatry has only been known in the past from the return from the military from army uh from a war return but this is the first time that we're going to see moral injury in health care staff and one can take that another important area that's come up from berlin from linden at all in berlin is the it's the papers when stress makes you bitter and vitamin disorder post-traumatic ambition disorder in healthcare workers this is again published in uh the psychosomatics in 2020 by linden from berlin so bitterness arises from situational life events that are perceived to be unjust threat to persons especially the reason i'm saying this is particularly from charmer dr chong and others um who face this issue in singapore certainly india we do we're doing that at the moment uh looking at model distance and model business model injury toxic stress is the yeah is the other part toxic stress then related to all the uh the the inflammatory processes and so forth so one of the new things that has come up uh that we have identified uh has been not me but everyone now we're doing one at manipal um [Music] looking at moral distress moral injury in the indian um scenario where the health workers so that's something new i think for all of us here uh to know that there is a thing called moral injury and moral distress a lot of it is there in the i start with studies with american nursing uh they talk a lot about the moral distress moral hazard and its implications on ultimately work life and ultimately function or really good outcome we're looking at their productivity that that's uh what i i just wanted to bring out here very important that we've only seen this now uh in other disasters certainly we do see what all those uh what we've what we've described but something new has come out here and this is this impact of moral distress moral injury toxic stress and lyndon's work in germany on on embitterment becoming bitter so the workplace workforce uh getting uh when they got post traumatic enbitement disorder um applies to a person experiencing witnessing or even being directly confronted with highly traumatic events major loss of significant others serious illness disability and so forth thank you i just wanted to add that to the wonderful presentation that you brought and this sort of brings in some of the uh areas that we are beginning to see and i'm sure many of us here who have been dealing with this disastrous pandemic will be able to identify this type of issues thank you thank you dr russell yeah thank you dr russell i think you bring up a very important issue i didn't get into very specifics of the psychological distress that patients experience but the moral injury and the moral distress uh and the post-traumatic betterment phenomena that you're talking about is very true because this this uh is like you said is often an ethical internal dilemma that one faces in certain um maybe life-threatening situation with which our service or army veterans experience when they are in war and they have to make certain decisions we we've we've as health care workers have for most part have had resources and have had decisions to make based on general principles of what we've been taught in medical schools and in our practice but this is the first time where we are forced to decide do i give this oxygen cylinder to uh a 45 year old man or should i uh who came later on but or should i give it to a 70 year old man who came here first right he came to the hospital first who gets this oxygen cylinder whose life do i save here and if i do do it or if i don't do it either way i'm wrong right i'm i'm damned one way or the other and so that brings about a significant moral injury to you when you make that decision and and that brings about the embitterment feeling that you talked about and and i think that is very uh a very powerful thing that all of us health care workers are experiencing we we've talked about that in in the past in psycho and psychoanalysis in the past but this is a phenomena that we are becoming more aware of as we are experiencing this and kind of it's a very important phenomenon that we need to understand that this moral distress we will carry over not just during this period but beyond this period as well and i think that's the important part that toxic stress is now related to inflammation and the issues about oxidative stress uh which which goes on to affect you know virtually all the all the corn just you what you said was beautiful just for all of you here just to have an idea and i think you can all relate to this imagine being a health care provider required to tranch as dr evan ashley said go with 19 patients you're inside a crowded emergency room deciding which of the two patients will get your emergency rooms only remaining later although you understand the situation requires you to give the mentally to the person with the highest odds of survival that is as you just described yet we were not trained to make this kind of decisions as you rightly said so what happens you have always had resources equal to treat patients but in this scenario both patients die despite you having put to put one person on the ventilator okay now you wonder whether you made the wrong decision could the other patient have survived with that ventilator you are wrecked to guilt replay replaying that scenario over and over again analyzing how different choices might have created different outcomes your distress becomes overwhelming so you bury yourself in work you put the pain just just but the pain follows you back home so now you take it back to your home you avoid genuine conversations with your family and peers you distract yourself at the expense of routines that were once meaningful and you tell yourself that you followed all the protocols did the best you could yet still you violated your moral values now this is precisely the context in which moral injury may develop now this is why this is unique because we are faced in this pandemic we put all our colleagues all of us have been put into this type of situation and that and as as we said literally is known about marlin in injury in non-military populations but this pandemic has made it clear that moral injury has relevance and extends beyond the battlefield and in fact all of us here on another battlefield that's it thank you i hope we've been able to um expose what moral injury and what how that works and this is something new only in the last two years that we've started to uh identify uh this outside the battlefield and in in the popular in the healthcare uh workforce around the world the studies are showing china india italy uk and we've got some work from uk too on this area thank you very much mr chairman yes alvin you have something to say yeah can i join the discussion it's a very meaningful discussion uh with russell and dr avinash in fact i really agree with what you have said and so that's why i'd like to ask dr ebeneze as well are there studies that has separated the objects as nurses and doctors what i mean is in fact from the um say moral injury of the things doctors are the ones who more often have to make the decisions we have to make the choice but the nurses will have to follow our instructions they might have less trauma in making their own decisions when it's a doctors who has to make the decisions very often the nurses have to ask the doctor what should i do and what should we make the decision and we have to give our advice so i think in my past days in hospitals working at the hospitals we often are looked upon by the other healthcare workers and then we have to really stand up lift our heads and say something but then we have to be responsible and i think we are vulnerable to the uh traffic effects of such moral you know stress and uh injury so i just wonder uh in that in in the presentation of devonage most of the studies seem to be studying on healthcare workers not really just doctors are there studies just focusing on the effects on doctors this first question and the second question is well uh in in your last second right is on coping with these situations okay can you please later on search on the slide again and you just flash it you know and i think in real life situation uh leadership uh how we should uh so those principles are very important and uh but facing the real life situation how are we going to make those choices and the decisions uh with the decision making what i mean is our personality difference different people have different personalities in the background and that would make us some people like surgeons they will make decisions much faster you know internal medicine uh be that we have to think over and over and make the decisions all right these are different personalities but in the real life situation like in those uh hazopista laws lack of oxygen mass and syndromes you have to make very brisk prompt and instantaneous positions so different personalities might give us uh different problems so other studies analyzing on our different uh you know personalities that would make us more vulnerable in what situations so uh these are my two questions thank you thank you of course uh russell is also a psychiatrist of course you you also have study on many of spiritual aspects of how to deal with these situations i don't know if there are also such uh the strategies as well when you look at what what's available uh i was looking at a couple of things here treatment programs promoting early intervention as i said uh developing tailored interventions but they've shown some work on acceptance and commitment therapy for moral injury birds in nineteen year twenty and studies spiritually augmented cognitive behavior therapy again shown some benefits adaptive disclosure gray at all again some benefits so these are some of the ones but it's very new so we haven't got to that extent but answering your question i don't know about dr avinash might know but i saw this one study on by gupta from india that actually looked looking at the symptom right i talked of the three italy china and india but in that study uh well of course health distress perceived distress burnout these were there post-traumatic stress anxiety depression insomnia perceived stigma was the only one in the indian study the other two studies didn't seem have stigma but the indian study of gupta study in august 2020 talked about stigma and in that study they showed nurses were the most common population of the study followed by doctors this is the indian study from gupta that's the only one i've seen but dr avinash might have other um to differentiate between the different uh uh disciplines of health care providers thank you dr dr avinesh maybe you want to answer alvin's questions yeah so so thank you dr alvin for your question so uh first of all most of these studies have been carried out in general healthcare workers they have done some subgroup analysis among doctors nurses and other ancillary support staff so while the data the the the most robust data is actually among the nursing group more than the doctors business nursing group the most of the data that we have is actually in that group um unfortunately we don't have that data based on specific uh specialties like you talked about surgeries versus internal medicine which is you're right in terms of our mindset a surgeon needs to make quick decision uh in in the icu uh intensivists will need to make quick decision versus someone else you know a nephrologist in a non-critical situation would make a more thoughtful decisions but i think the important thing to remember is no matter what we do we as healthcare workers especially physicians take on far greater responsibility or have a sense of far greater responsibility or feel that we have far greater control over situations than we actually have and so we take far greater ownership and therefore we bring on far greater moral injury so and this is the more decisions you make i think the more moral injury you are going to experience so you're right in the sense that a nurse may not have the same degree of moral injury kind of experiences that of an intensivist or a surgeon or anyone else might make but a nurse may have a different kind of anxiety being in the room with the patient more number of hours than a physician is physician is in and out of the room so they have greater exposure to the virus right and so the greater chances of getting infected so their fears are different and their anxieties are different than the moral injury kind of anxiety so all of us experience as healthcare workers experience that but in a different domain but it all adds up because a nurse's anxiety will lead to that burnout a physician's moral injury will also lead to that burnout ultimately all of that will result in poor productivity so in a sense we have to recognize this across the board yes as physicians we are faced with some unique challenges in terms of decision making because we are the team leaders people look up to us for decision making and and therefore that makes a big difference in terms of challenges so in terms of studies themselves uh there are very few studies which have identified specifically looking in physicians they generally talk about classifiers health workers in general there may be some subgroup analysis but i'm not aware of every subgroup analysis that has occurred to kind of answer your questions specifically in terms of numbers uh like i said before greater number of studies done with nurses and other healthcare workers just because it's easier when you survey out there far greater nurses than number of physicians available so then their number of responses is going to be much much greater right but there are unique challenges and unique things that happen to each subgroup but each subgroup suffers in their own way and we have to recognize their own suffering thank you thank you dr abinash that was uh that was very very um insightful um interestingly um we all must realize that medicine is an imprecise science with variable outcomes and so we think we're in control but actually we're not and uh you know that is a something we have to live with and i think um in battlefield probably there is a difference between the officer and for example the non-commissioned officer class you know so likewise perhaps there's a difference in in physicians and the doctors and the nurses roles in a health care system so perhaps different rules have resulted in different sort of stresses and and reactions and so on but certainly something interesting to study i mean you know the differences between physicians and let's say nurses because i can imagine on the battlefield it's also quite different and one important part here in terms of our own beliefs of what the extent of control and power we have as physicians we like to believe that we can impact and make a lot of changes which is true but we also need to recognize our limitations because a significant aspect of what we do it depends on the resources around us so it depends on the number of people who are vaccinated around us the ppe that is available the intensive care units that are available the oxygen supply that is available while we we think that we have control we don't have control over a lot of these these are beyond these are system issues that we are facing but we face the moral dilemma because we are ultimately at the end deciding making those decisions but these are far beyond our own control these are decided by countries nations based on their own uh economic status where they are at in terms of development their own access to resources and what is their own priority right so that makes a huge difference but we all like to take control we want to be in charge we want to take control at the same time we also take responsibility for things that are not necessarily our responsibility and so that's very important for us physicians to recognize as well yeah i i i i say what you're saying is absolutely true but one of the unique things in in this situation was that economically developed countries like uh usa or or italy or uk had to face this even though they had resources they had a shortage because of the pandemic and that's why many of them who were never used maybe someone in a rural place in india or somewhere might be able to have less because they're every day having to deal with less resources but we talked about it it happened even in australia where when you suddenly have to no beds you don't have ventilators you don't have oxygen where you're used to having everything that is one of the uniqueness of the and that's probably the reason we see saw this across so many countries particularly in the developed world where where this happened thank you thank you doctor can i say something off yes yeah thank you very much thank you very much uh thank you very much avinash for wonderful presentation i'm dr ashraf nizami from pakistan uh i would like to know and share my experience hence i have been honored to be working in a country where the chernobyl in 1985 a few people remember that was the disaster the first main disaster after the second world war and i have been also volunteered in pakistan in 2005 when there was the earthquake and 80 000 people they have the lost of their lives uh one thing which i uh understood i'm orthopedic surgeon by profession so you can understand that teamwork and the captain of the team can decide about all that and having the team from lahore to the places over there about 100 and plus health workers putting in the earthquake in 2005 what i got and understood and learned from all these health professionals stress syndrome that maximum threshold it is in between seven to ten days and we make a routine that the health workers who were serving at the earthquake place we used to change them shift them after seven days and so on here the same in covert 19 i believe it is more disastrous than the any war what we have faced over here and with all my respect to professor russell i believe it is not about the have and have nots it is about the question of the health system what my belief is that the covet 19 has not destroyed the health system i believe it has exposed the destroyed health system to my understanding did you find any impact of burnout syndrome on family or population if any study or your personal uh i mean experience about it thank you very much thanks prabhas and uh i think you made a very good point here prof is that um a moral injury is worsened when the healthcare system is overwhelmed so all the things that politicians and society had to do was to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed but once it was overwhelmed the moral injury was massive and that's why we we didn't have much control over the situation if you know what i mean um because it was the politicians and the leadership of the countries that usually uh decided and ended up with such a situation so unfortunately we were at the receiving end of the stick um i welcome any other questions for uh dr avinesh and dr de souza so dr nazami i just wanted to take a minute to kind of first of all acknowledge uh what you did in back then you know your efforts in 2005 uh you know that is something to be acknowledged in this group if not in india forum so thank you for what you did back then for for all the people you know it's it's it was it was it was a huge humanitarian crisis and thank you for stepping up and doing what you did uh so just going back to your uh specific questions can if you can just repeat that question again for me what what is that you asked uh thank you very much avinash i just asked about it that the impact of this uh burn out syndrome upon the family or the society yeah if you have any studies about that thank you yeah so unfortunately we have no specific studies that i am aware of that have looked at burnout syndrome and its impact on family members and the rest of the society but in terms of this corporate 19 specific situation but there is enough study about burnout syndrome and impact on work and productivity for hospital system and therefore its overall morbidity and impact the economic impact and general impact on the health system that we know very well so the burnout system results in a smaller workforce it results in people choosing careers that they may not have it results in people choosing uh other profession outside of medicine that they tend to value more than they would have otherwise and it leads to less of a less uh i'm trying to figure out that you know less productive productivity in the work on a day-to-day basis so all of these have impact in the number of patients we see the quality of healthcare we provide and the outcome on these patients so there's a huge economic impact of this burnout and this is where there are valium study there are a lot of studies on that there is impact of burnout on mental health of the individual that is well studied as well and it's immense what we don't have is a specific study looking at impact of burnout and family member impact with covet or in terms of overall productivity so just to give you a general sense of what on our field looks like thank you thank you can i ask the question yes dr bukhari oh thank you very much i am professor bihari in continuation of professor nizami uh he is our leader in pma no doubt uh the same experience that i expect last year when we started i am pathologists basically when we started the covet lab it was very difficult to take the sample and i myself was afraid that nobody was going to take i was the first person to take the uh sample from the nasopharyngeal swept and you cannot imagine what was my condition anyhow basically this mental health uh problem was created by the media and one thing second thing was the covet was just a new thing and we all were not prepared to how to faces like the professor nizami has told that the forever has exposed our health care system and the one of the difference that in pakistan i felt this mental health care panic was more present in the females as compared into the veil so mike this was my so my one suggestion and one question my one suggestion is that in the future we may face similar type of problems like in pakistan we faced in earthquakes and some other things i am there living there where the professor nizami suggestion is that we should have a as conferences we should have a just like a military trainings for our health care workers especially i see our doctors were more afraid more panic as compared to our nurses and other paramedical staff so this is one suggestion second suggestion is that my question is that is there any difference between this panic activity in gender or it is a just a country to country difference yeah yeah so so so i so the the the thing is it's it is not necessarily identified by female gender so it has been identified by different subgroups in different population now a majority of nurses tend to be women but it doesn't mean that this is a situation unique to women it is a situation that nurses experience and that may be because of their level of education and their knowledge of medicine compared to a physician's knowledge of medicine so i don't think it's necessarily a gender issue it is an issue of knowledge base based on where where one is at in terms of their training and what they understand how they process that uh i i i think that you're absolutely right that uh the media has a big role to play in terms of both uh you know being having a responsibility in terms of kind of directing our overall well-being unfortunately media will present what is what will mo what most people will read or most most people will kind of hear about right so they will sensationalize a lot of things even if it is of low incidence even if it has very low importance which many of times create spannings right we panic situation so that doesn't really help people so one of the things that i actually tell people is to shut down their time that they spend less on news media you you know to kind of restrict it to the to as few hours as possible during these times because that is not coming from experts if you want expertise if you want specific medical information i tell them talk to your doctors don't listen to the media because the media is giving you very sensory sensationalized news to a factor they might highlight a few important things but they are not telling you what is uh they do not have the medical sense or the knowledge to give you a a a a a nuanced understanding of what is going on which only a medical provider can give so which is what i say talk to your doctors and not to your news journalist for information your doctor will tell you exactly how to deal with that and i think all of you can relate to that you've all heard new situations which are completely out of order and make no sense to you and when you actually read the actual information you realize oh that's just ten or maybe even five percent of what the actual event was and we maybe need to calm the situation down so you're right i think there is a responsibility for the media to kind of reduce the panic help people cope there's a very so a lot of negative news gets information but the positive news the resilience news gets put in the background i think the media should be actually talking about the resilience talking about the good things that people are doing because that will help our people endure and manage these situations better so that's my you know that's that's generally what we see with media and how people process information and manage situations in the same continuation of my question my second question was how should we prepare our health care workers if such type of pandemic at such type of testosterone in the future [Music] hello i'm sorry there's some background noise i i hope people are able to hear me i think so so i think the what if if we don't learn from this pandemic i think we all would lose as humanity i think we owe it to our children to have learned from this pandemic and prepare the next generation for this i think we need to as every single society in this world kind of needs to take note of what happened what did we do wrong we talked about how it exposed our health systems now it is a responsibility to get a health system where it needs to be for a future situation and and not just the situation of an infectious disease like this but other situations too we have disasters happening all the time but we pay attention to that for a short period of time and then we move to the next disaster but yeah we don't work on things proactively so we owe it to ourselves to kind of get prepared being prepared educating kind of running drills mock drills to kind of deal with the situation so that when we we are here in the u.s at least uh run fire drills we when we have every hospital system runs fire drills because they prepare for fire i think every system needs to do that for eventualities like this at least once a year what we would what would we do how would systems respond to disasters how would what were the steps that we need to get in terms of disaster management resources that we need in place so this requires planning not just from physicians but physicians should be if there was ever an opportunity for physicians to take center stage and demand more it is now for us to ask more of our leaders to provide those resources so this this kind of thing never happens again i think leaders around the world know that a single virus shut the entire world down right and if if we don't act up now and get our act together to get the level of healthcare to the to the place that we need to they will never do and so we need to seize this moment get more education awareness among the people because only when they do something will our health leaders do something so that i think is an important piece i would say that we we should have learned from this situation that's my own personality i don't want to think say that say that it's from uh you know from anyone specific or any organization that's my personal view i want to make that very clear i think avinash thank you very much it is not only your personal view these are the normal standards these are very much normal standards and that we have to abide by and uh certainly we go on learning whatsoever that comes over and from the wars and the from the peace time we learn and it is never ever to prepare for the bad days but preparation needs to help community that is the best thing i believe and thank you very much avinash for wonderful your sharing i must appreciate your efforts thank you dr bukhari you know just because you spoke about media uh professor rizwan taj from your pims in islamabad has published something on your media um the uh he is here from doctor uh professor rizwan taj he is at pims in islamabad the dean and the head of uh psychiatry he has published um a paper on on media and its impact and things like that it's just for you to since you brought that up thank you thank you hello yes hello yeah thank you very much uh chairman mr chairman uh dr uh avinash it was very uh very informative uh presentation i must appreciate i just a second what you are talking about the media uh i'm totally agree with the uh the what about you said about the media but the problem is how can you guide the media particularly the electronic media and we cannot control the media because in pakistan and i saw in the different maybe other countries instead of doctors the other people are talking more about the coronavirus like the politicians like the other businessman the other people and they are horrifying these situations so these two these are to be controlled otherwise you know this is this is create a more uh mental problems to the health care worker as well as the general public and we are facing all these uh nowadays thank you very much sir thank you dr any response from you yeah so well so i i know there are there are political tones to this and you know i don't so i don't want to go towards in that direction but i all i want to say is this that i think along with our roles as physicians we also have a role uh in terms of being leaders in the society because of our knowledge base because of our experience and be based on our strengths i think the one thing i would say as a psychiatrist is to recognize that this is there will be a huge mental health impact not just for healthcare workers but beyond that for the whole population if there was ever a chance for for people to understand that they will recognize everybody will recognize and understand that so this is an opportunity for us to be more advocate uh you know to be advocates for ourselves spread the word people will listen to you this is uh this is a good moment for us in terms of getting some of this work done and advocating for resources that we need for medical care for mental health care i think that is important it can be done in so many different levels let us all be proactive within our own medical societies organizations to kind of get that message going towards that well-being a better place that we want the world to get right so all of us have to do a little bit and maybe step outside of our own comfort zone you know our own anxieties to get to help people in the best way possible so that that is the challenging part uh each of us has uh you know constraints understanding limitations circumstances but what we don't have we don't have control over everything but we do have control over some things let's absolutely do those things and let us work on things that we can control in our domains and you'll see that as you control these little things those little things become bigger and there are more things you can control and accept what you cannot control that will help you do better in things that you can control so i think those are the things that you want to be thinking about thank you very much mr chair can i share one thing yeah thank you very much uh thank you avinash thank you very much but i think the media has very much significantly important role in our societies wherever we are certainly ethics come over here and the training and the learning that comes here about the medical reporting what we have done over here in lahore pakistan we have a university of health sciences and we have started a diploma for journalism for journalists not for medical doctors but for the journalists and we have enrolled over them for the medical reporting without sensation mean by there is a protocol and all has been made there i'm sure university must be in united states or somewhere in the developed so-called countries you must have also over there for uh the person who are deal with the media and so on so this is what in pakistan learning from all the things what is we are experiencing what we have started in pakistan in lahore a diploma by the university of health sciences thank you the same uh mr chair same is here in karachi uh uh uh university uh they they are doing the same thing what the dr nizami said thank you thank you dr um sarah we don't have much time right the next meeting is coming in yeah i think the topics are going on and this is a very interesting topic for everyone yeah i was just thinking that you know we will take over the next session but they will kill us i would say uh so i don't know if you have enough sort of one thing of nine minutes uh actually in video like i could not uh just join it so so far i had actually this actually the anxiety and occupation and the mental disorders these have been compounded by the death of their colleagues also due to copy because you know in india and bangladesh also we have lost a lot of our colleagues actually the medical fraternity people so this is this also actually compounded their anxiety and depression so that they can affect it they will not get like this so i think this is this is actually actually compounding their that stress actually thank you thank you dr chadry and yes it's nothing like the fact that your comrades have around you that makes this grateful experience and it's like a war okay so um i think today in the interest of time we don't have time for the country update because our next group of people are coming into the meeting shortly but this has been such a fantastic uh spirited um discussion it's obviously a topic that's very close to our hearts and we never we never quite explored this topic before and even this is the first time in 60 weeks so you know um i i think there's a lot of trauma obviously and respon distress that we've seen all around us and experience ourselves and in particular i would say that in singapore we had this terribly in o3 with sas so this is like a flashback for us you know in singapore and but we made sure that we were prepared for this one so likewise for everybody else it's like a first time experience so we can imagine the trauma you're going through because we went to it ourselves so um alvin can vouch for that because hong kong and singapore went through a really tough time uh so i i hear you that we have as leaders of national medical associations we have to make sure that we are heard we have influence we have the capability to push the leaderships in our countries to make sure we're well prepared for the next uh whatever comes our way and uh not to have this uh you know this situation this untenable situation or moral injury happen again all right i think this is our responsibility as leaders of national medical associations so without much further ado thank you very much dr avinesh for this um for this wonderful uh presentation and you know all the feelings and and spirited discussion that came out of it so thank you please let us have your slides because we really want to have a good look at them and learn from them and and perhaps spread our own message in our own countries and uh thank you for bringing to my attention there was a singapore study i didn't even know about that um thank you all and uh we'll see you next saturday as always thank you so much session and uh we all look forward to next saturday to meeting everyone thank you very much okay thank you very much thank you pleasure so just to just to make an announcement before i think the la the next session we will try to bring on reinfection uh on on a microbiologist i'll we haven't got the confirmation date but i will announce in the group soon and uh it's love to see the presentations and the and the topic of the discussions are very meaningful everyone and uh see you next week i can i can talk on vaccine okay sure we will we will uh we will definitely uh add those points over here and uh uh mr chong i will discuss with you a lot of things offline i think these presentations are going very well thank you ,True,False,True,False

their communities, how to recognize signs of mental distress, and how to intervene for the ...",hello my name is caitlin and i'm here today representing the mental health association of east tennessee mhaet works across tennessee to bring awareness about mental health issues to decrease the stigma associated with these struggles so that more people can get help sooner today i'm going to be sharing about how mental health needs can present themselves in your neighbors and neighborhood and how you can intervene as an individual and things that can be done at the neighborhood level to improve mental health fall since this presentation is pre-recorded and you may not have the opportunity for questions please feel free to email me at info mhaet.com with any questions you have my hope is that after this presentation you will walk away knowing more about mental health how you can be a better neighbor and how we can all foster environments in our neighborhoods that are supportive which not only decreases someone's risk of experiencing mental distress or mental illness but can also assist them in their recovery finally i'll be speaking on how to respond in times of crisis to protect not only your safety but the safety of the person in crisis first and foremost something that is essential to speak on when we're talking about mental health is what mental health actually is for most there's a fundamental misunderstanding and even some tunnel vision about what mental health is most equate the term mental health with being mentally ill and they then assume that when someone has a mental illness or i prefer calling them mental health conditions that they're unstable and dangerous so in our minds we think of mental health as a bad thing or something to be afraid of but that's not what mental health is mental health is something we all have one of my favorite definitions of mental health comes straight from the world health organization and it defines mental health as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes their own potential is able to cope with the normal stresses of life can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to their community this puts the term mental health in terms of something we should always be working toward something we should always be attempting to achieve good mental health enables us to be the best versions of ourselves and the healthiest versions of ourselves our mental health is an important component of our overall health and greatly greatly impacts the well-being of the rest of our body when we look at how to measure our mental health picture a thermometer let's say at the very top of the thermometer is our optimal mental health we've reached our full potential know how to properly cope and manage our emotions and at the bottom of the thermometer we're in a mental health crisis where our mental health is at its lowest so in between the top and bottom we have all other varying degrees of mental health and most of us will likely fall somewhere between the two rising and falling along the continuum depending on what's happening in our life the traits we have in ourselves that promote resilience or the ability to bounce back and the resources and supports available are in our community it's important to know that there is no right or wrong place to be it's all a part of the journey and we have to respect where we are and give our feelings the respect and validation they deserve you should never feel ashamed for struggling with your mental health nor should you nor should someone else experience that shame even when they're in a crisis having optimal mental health doesn't always mean our life is perfect what it means is that when bad things happen we handle them in a way that's as healthy as possible so having optimal mental health also means having healthy social connections which are generally defined as relationships where there's trust and you have honest and open communication with the other person especially during this time of physical distancing it's important to remember that healthy social relationships don't have to be dependent on being physically near one another we can maintain healthy relationships over the phone video calls writing letters to one another or meeting in person but being safely socially distanced having a good social support network also decreases someone's risk of depression alcohol use health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and suicide and being optimally healthy doesn't mean you have to be happy all the time sadness and anger are both healthy and natural emotions and they're an essential part of the human experience to have this broad range of emotions and these negative emotions they still deserve our attention how we express them and manage them indicates how healthy our mental health is for example it's not a healthy expression of anger to break objects around us or scream at people we care about it's also not healthy for us to hide those feelings and shove them down instead there are healthier ways to channel that anger that don't hurt those around us things like exercise or even cleaning can be healthy ways to express those emotions lastly our mental health is also impacted by our physical health we cannot achieve optimal mental health if we're not also taking care of the physical systems in our body that are supporting our mind again there's no expectation for everything to be perfect and amazing it's more like working with what you have to the best of your ability so eat as healthy as you can get some physical activity and try to prioritize sleep and again perfection's not the point not everyone has access to the same resources so just try to do what you can with what you have and like i said previously most of us are somewhere in the middle of the scale of mental wellness we feel um pretty okay most of the time but maybe there are things we do that we know aren't healthy things like having a cigarette or a glass of wine after a stressful day but overall most days we feel like we're able to cope with day-to-day life tolerable mental distress is when we tolerate the change uncertainties or negative emotions that we experience but we don't always cope with them in healthy ways these day-to-day occurrences do not lead to any major interruptions in our life and for the most part we're able to overcome and get past them most individuals with untreated or poorly mental uh poorly treated mental health conditions also fall sort of in the category of tolerable or moderate distress however generally the longer someone remains untreated their symptoms increase in their severity and they're more likely to cause disruptions in day-to-day life so examples of these disruptions can include the inability to focus changes in sleep patterns and increasing levels of sadness or anxiety and when these things happen they cause problems across every domain of life individual social and professional and then crisis is on the lowest end of the mental health scale and even for those that are struggling with the serious mental health conditions or other things in life such as the death of a spouse or other major life occurrence rarely do people stay in crisis long crisis tends to be very short lasting a mental health crisis is a situation where a person's behavior puts them at risk of hurting others or themselves or prevents them from being able to care for themselves or function effectively in the community so common examples of mental health crisis include threats or actual harm to sell for others so suicide would fall in this category psychosis which is when someone loses touch with reality or delusion such as paranoia although mental health conditions can contribute to someone's risk of experiencing a crisis they're not the only reasons that someone experiences the crisis crises can also be triggered by life changes exposure to trauma natural disasters or even changes in medication experiencing mental distress is not the same thing as having a mental health condition although all of us will experience some level of distress that decreases our overall mental wellness statistically only about half of the population will meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness mental health conditions are longer lasting than the general sadness or distress caused by life events and can potentially lead to impairment in a multitude of life domains if someone has changes in thoughts emotions and behaviors that last almost every day for two weeks or more this can indicate a potential mental illness so signs that can indicate a mental health condition include changes in sleeping or eating sometimes that's more or less changes in physical appearance specifically changes in grooming practices that indicate someone's either obsessed with cleanliness or is becoming increasingly disheveled i mean for example if you think for someone who is hearing voices that are telling them to do things they may not necessarily be super focused on whether or not they take a shower that day um other signs of distress include changes and activities the person engages in specifically if someone stops engaging in something they enjoyed or they seem to no longer find enjoyment from the activity even if they're still doing it changes in levels of social engagement specifically someone who starts to avoid others and again this is a change not someone who's always been isolated new or increasing use of drugs or alcohol and even those that are legal or prescribed and lastly talking about death or suicide and i will say this list is not all-inclusive so if you're worried that someone may have a mental health condition i would definitely do a little more research and trust your gut and signs of psychosis include things like hearing or saying things that aren't there irrational responses to loved ones or other inappropriate or bizarre behavior and that is another sign of mental distress one of the most common myths about those who have mental illness or those are in crisis or those experiencing any kind of mental distress is that they're aggressive violent or dangerous and so i want to talk about that for a little bit although the majority of individuals who are in crisis are experiencing some kind of mental distress do not commit acts of violence highly publicized acts of violence that are committed by persons with mental health conditions such as the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in 2018 things like that reinforce not only individual but community beliefs that mental illness is something to be afraid of and the reality is there are some people with mental health conditions that commit violence but there are also people without diagnoses that commit similar acts violence is complicated and mental illness alone doesn't explain someone's risk for violence while some studies do show that persons with serious mental health conditions specifically bipolar disorder schizophrenia and other personality disorders are at increased risk of committing violent acts when compared to the general population the strongest predictor of future violence is actually past violence so other factors that can increase someone's risk for violence include substance use especially if they're currently under the influence age and gender and when i say this i mean statistically young men are more likely to act violently um social stress personal crises are lost is a predictor of violence and that includes recent unemployment divorce if even if you're the victim of violence that actually makes you more likely to commit violence and exposure to violence during formative childhood years people with mental health conditions also have higher rates of victimization than the general population and are often themselves actually the victims of violent crimes studies show that persons with mental illnesses are somewhere between two and a half to 11 times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes so it's important that we not continue to spread and perpetuate the idea that people with mental illnesses are dangerous because the vast majority of people with mental health conditions are never going to commit any sort of violent crime mental health conditions addiction or substance use issues and even homelessness are all things that have the belief attached to them that when someone has one of these traits that something is wrong with that person that they're violent or dangerous and deserving of fear and it's because of this negative and false belief that when it comes to actually addressing these issues people use the phrase not my neighborhood and try to actively expel people who have these traits or even whisper about it behind closed door about their neighbor you know who's dealing with these issues and no one does anything about it and these fears also arise when organizations are interested in building treatment facilities or recovery houses nearby neighborhoods remember these issues exist in your neighborhood whether you know about it or not you cannot get rid of them and it's important to remember that not only do these stigmas affect the culture of our neighborhood but they can also be damaging to individuals at the end of the day people real people are the ones who suffer so i want to share with you a video that i find really moving personally so i just want you to take some time to watch it and if you have the opportunity pause afterwards to reflect on what happens [Music] you can be born perfectly rich have a very good lifestyle have parents who care very well for you i don't think mental health issues discriminate against anyone of any race gender or social background all right my name is nicole i'll be your moderator for this discussion i'm nicholas today i'm going to ask you a few questions about mental health in singapore what do you know about mental illness i just know there's depression [Music] how do you say that biopolar disorder the wire is not so cute you know this guy's crazy sell this kind of words there's nothing wrong with me would you hire somebody with better health condition i'll probably you know make them work you know you know admin side super cleaner or some simple job project either they hurt themselves or they're going to hurt someone else then if your mental illness you apply for a job and who in the right sense will really want to take you would you date somebody who has a mental health condition some of them will get quite manipulative they see like um if you break up with me i'll i'll cut myself or kill myself and then sometimes they tend to pose unreasonable things such as like a small thing that happen and then they'll make a big fuss out of it i cannot handle i don't know how to handle how would you react to you know a friend or family member who's diagnosed with mental illness the bridging needs to be the family and not a stranger if possible i would just stay away as far as possible let's go sell it three hours [Music] i didn't introduce myself fully i suffer from clinical depression i was clinically diagnosed with depression i'm living in recovery and i overcame it i wrote a letter that i would like you to read out to me a lot [Music] 12 years is a long time to live with a mental health condition in the 12 years that have been diagnosed with depression this is what i've learned i've learned that the greatest battles we fight are the ones with ourselves i've learned that most conversations about employment and the moment i review my diagnosis i've learned that shame is something society teaches you i've learned how to say sorry for showing symptoms of my condition i've learned that friends can disappear and i will never hear from them again [Music] i've learned that family doesn't always know how to support you no matter how much you need them i've learned that hope is a little voice a whispers maybe [Music] i've learned that recovery is a process i've learned that one small crack doesn't mean i'm broken i've learned that i have an illness but this illness is not my identity so sorry that young is [Music] i'm sorry do you have any questions you want to ask me [Music] so like i said i encourage you to take a couple minutes to just process what happened in that video i know the first time i watched it i got emotional and i think too it's because i personally have had my own struggles and know people that have struggled with their mental health and there is a lot of stigma and deep shame associated with mental health conditions mental health having a mental health condition doesn't mean that something is wrong with someone it simply means that they're struggling and need help and so many times people are judged because of their mental health conditions and even though someone can have or may have a mental health condition their entire life with proper treatment or learning how to address their symptoms in healthier ways someone with a mental health condition can do everything they want to and lead a full and happy and fulfilling life but the first hurdle in addressing the general mental health in our neighborhoods is by first conquering that stigma in ourselves it's important to enter any situation with someone who's struggling without any assumptions about their thoughts behaviors or what they're experiencing although mental health conditions are very common every person who has one will experience it differently because we are all individual people with different traits and life experiences and the best way to intervene and improve our communities mental health is by actively being engaged in prevention efforts not only for ourselves and our families but in our broader neighborhoods so if we want to improve our neighborhoods mental health we have to start with ourselves and our families so first and foremost we can begin by normalizing conversations about mental health this means not only talking about when things are going well but also talking about our negative emotions our struggles and challenges emphasizing self-care is very important self-care is everything we do in a day to take care of our physical and mental health so physically making sure you have a good night's sleep eating as healthy as possible and exercising on a regular basis mentally it means finding time for yourself every day and this is something you should be doing regardless of anything else that's happening in our life you don't want to wait until things go wrong to prioritize self-care because then it's too late something i hear often is that quote i don't have time for that you know i don't have time for myself i promise you you do take that time that you would can normally considered to be wasted to do you know a 10-minute breathing activity take a 30-minute nap or do something else that you would enjoy even if you consider it to be frivolous self-care is not frivolous because it will help you function better in every other part of your life take a second and think about times in your life when you felt overwhelmed just feeling overwhelmed makes it harder to do your jobs so when you take that time and try to address those feelings before getting into the task it can make a difference an intentional time can even be incorporated into existing duties and things you already do so for example if you have a 30-minute commute to work find something to listen to that makes you feel happy and relaxed maybe it's a podcast maybe it's a radio station maybe it's the news just find something for you self-care also means setting boundaries in your life give yourself permission to set limits in your relationships and to say no not only at home but in your professional and social life and yes this includes setting boundaries with your neighbors even the ones that you may worry about you may worry that they're struggling it's your job to support and care for others whenever you're able but you can't make people get help and you shouldn't be sacrificing your own mental health for theirs second thing we can do to set ourselves up for success is learn to cope with our stressors in healthier ways this starts by recognizing what you're currently doing and actively working to correct those behaviors it will take time and practice give yourself grace don't beat yourself up instead take your missteps as learning opportunities and move forward always recognize when your healthy coping methods actually can drift into an unhealthy territory for example let's say you really enjoy gardening but you start to notice it isn't taking the edge off like it used to or that you're relying on it too much and you're relying on it so much that other responsibilities begin to be neglected it's a good idea to actually have a few go-to coping strategies so that when this is happening you can have a backup and ideally these ways of coping shouldn't cost a lot of money just in case that no longer becomes an option also seek outside help for yourself or family members as needed therapy can be an incredibly valuable way to address any disruptive thoughts or behaviors you're experiencing and don't have to have a mental illness to benefit from therapy at least 30 percent of americans have received mental health treatment at some point in their lives many times medication will also be suggested as part of the treatment process and most agree that mental illness is a rise from chemicals in our brain and medications can help balance these chemicals out and give therapy time to work but again decide what's best for you in consultation with your doctor and there are also other sources of outside help such as community support groups online forums and even call centers that can be helpful during this times of distress and i'll be sure to mention some later so while you're taking care of your own mental health needs you can support the mental health and wellness of those around you it starts with my first point previously which is by modeling and sharing about mental health your mental health in positive ways even in challenging times and this creates a space where those around you may feel comfortable doing the same so be sure to compliment those around you that can be helpful for their mental health and remind them that they're valued members of your family and lastly when they are struggling do what you can to make sure they get the help that they need and the skills that you build for yourself and your family can carry over and they should carry over into your neighborhood especially when you work to normalize those conversations on mental health this behavior is something you can continue to model to those around you speaking on your own emotional struggles sharing what you do to cope in healthy ways and even inviting others to join with you in certain activities for example let's say you go on a walk every morning invite your neighbor that seems to be struggling to join you say you really want to spend the time with them you're looking forward to it you can also take time to share your history of mental health treatments you don't have to share every nitty-gritty detail but leading by example can go a long way you never know when that story will show someone that not only is recovery possible but that they know someone who's been through it too you can be a resource when they struggle for example when the mental health association of east tennessee's ceo he moved into his neighborhood in 2000 you know the welcome wagon came and they found out what he did and immediately said something along the lines of you know we don't have any of those problems here well guess who was in the mha office the following month doing a depression screening the head of the neighborhood association so you never know how these things can come back around and actually help someone around you and when interacting with others in your neighborhood always start from a place of welcoming instead of judgment don't make assumptions based on someone's initial appearance or behavior instead take the time to get to know them and even if you know someone know that person has a mental health condition refuse to define them by their diagnosis or use labels like crazy crazy someone is a person first and a diagnosis second always be as respectful as possible especially be aware of the noise levels you're creating unexpected and loud noises can affect your neighbor's day-to-day life especially if they struggle with their mental health but regardless especially including their sleep and mental functioning so if you're planning a large project do your neighbors the courtesy of letting them know ahead of time respect also includes driving through your neighborhood at a reasonable speed all of these things decrease fear because they know what to expect and um they are not going to be afraid and this will help your neighbors feel safer and calmer and more secure it's also important to continue building a sense of community and connection the better we know our neighbors the more likely we'll we will be able to identify when someone begins to struggle and be able to step in with information and support and some ways that we can build community for those around us can be simple things like waving to our neighbors when we pass by or even setting up play dates for the kids also take the time to get to know your neighbors and introduce yourself hang out on your porch or in your front yard you can create a neighborhood directory like drop off a sign up sheet in everyone's mailbox and once they return it you can email the final version to everyone it can include information such as the names phone numbers and email addresses of everyone in the neighborhood and even include the names of children and pets this can be helpful when a dog is lost or if you're trying to find a neighborhood friend for your child and you can also include local resources in the neighborhood directory things like churches food pantries or other resource centers that can assist someone in need so they're not having to do those that research themselves when they start struggling and something we can do with the when the pandemic is sort of at its close is organizing a neighborhood get-together keep it simple if it's the first year doing it but a block party is a great place to start some other things that can be done to help build a sense of community to improve your neighborhoods mental health include building a free mailbox library building a community garden creating a formalized tool sharing program create a bicycle or even a car sharing program you can build a blessing box where you share a non-perishable food toiletries and other supplies that others in your community need you can establish a neighborhood watch program a create a skill sharing program for example maybe you're an accountant and you can offer neighbors your services for a discounted rate maybe you're good with cars or home repairs or even you're good at cooking crafting or sewing all of these skills can be beneficial to others lastly you can begin hosting a monthly meeting and if this isn't something you're doing already this meeting can be a wonderful opportunity to bring in speakers from outside organizations to better inform residents on important social issues for example maybe you have concern about your neighborhood's mental health or maybe it's starting to become an issue the mental health association of east tennessee is always available to speak to groups on mental health education maybe you have concerns about internet safety street hope tennessee is a great organization that conducts trainings on internet safety specifically with a goal of keeping children safe the metro drug coalition can speak with you about substance abuse and even trainees to use narcan and provide you with kits to save someone's life in case of an overdose you can even invite someone to talk to you about gardening and offering a cooking class beardsley farm and century harvest farms are both organizations that can do both of those things and they're wonderful organizations so if you could pause the video and i want to encourage you to take a moment and think about a problem that exists in your neighborhood brainstorm actions you can take to address that issue hopefully you've got some great ideas about things you can do in your neighborhood but you may be wondering you know what do these things how do community gardens how do having you know a free mailbox library how does having a postbox library help improve my neighborhoods mental health well for many that struggle with their mental health they don't become that way overnight for most it's an accumulation of circumstances that bring them to the point of distress or crisis even mental health conditions are often triggered by life circumstances especially those that result in chronic stress and one of the life circumstances that can significantly contribute to chronic stress as loss of income this one stressor trickles down into every part of someone's life they may no longer be able to afford nutritious meals for their family or make needed repairs on their home or even their cars which then would prevent them from getting a new job this is where a neighborhood can step in and create a bicycle sharing program a blessing box or a community garden the bicycle sharing program would enable someone to access community resources without needing a car a blessing box could fill the gaps when a family can't make it to a food bank or maybe they've run out of food stamps for that month or maybe they're not even aware of community resources so having something in the area would work a lot better and a skill sharing program can help teach a parent to cook who doesn't know how to make nutritious meals for their family and a mailbox library can give someone access to a book that could provide some stress relief during those times all of these things taken together can create an environment where our neighbors work together to help each other which in turn can decrease mental distress and improve our neighborhoods mental health however mental health is complicated even when we work up work to set systems that decrease risk and increase the support in our communities you can't control every single factor and circumstance therefore there will always be those around you that experience mental distress and crisis and it's your responsibility as someone who's a neighbor a friend family member to offer support and intervene in healthy and supportive ways it's not your job to get help for them it's your job to support them along the way during times of general mental health distress not crisis immediate intervention with services is not needed you definitely want to step in with intervention but it doesn't have to be as quick as calling mobile crisis or calling 9-1-1 so but when someone is in crisis they do need intervention as soon as possible and remember a quick reminder a mental health crisis is the situation where someone's behavior puts them at risk of hurting themselves or others or prevents them from being able to care for themselves or function effectively in the community if the person is not in crisis step in and offer information and support be careful with the words you use and be sure not to come across as accusatory or punishing instead approach the person from a place of caring and concern so instead of saying something like hey i noticed your yard's been a mess lately are you depressed or something instead say something like hey i notice you haven't been acting like yourself lately i care about you i'm concerned what's going on not too many difference in the actual words you use but the approach is so much different and use open-ended questions whenever possible the person may not ready to be talked to you but just by trying to start the conversation you've made it know to them that your resource when and if they're ready to talk you can also help this person by helping with things around the house things like mowing their lawn for them when they haven't had the energy to mode because of their depression or by doing research on different treatment providers in the area that they can go to when they're ready to seek help ultimately decision is in their hands on whether or not they access help but you can make the process easier when they do start to and when they do start treatment let them know they can talk to you about what's happening intervention during a crisis is a little more complicated and not only do you need to think about the safety of the other person but you need to think about your own safety as well and there are variety of different mental health crises that someone could experience well you'll want to intervene as soon as possible first if someone has threatened or is has attempted suicide if someone has overdosed um or ingested another toxic subject substance and lastly if someone is behaving in a highly agitated or threatening manner or even displaying other inappropriate behavior that would give you some indication that something is going on and regardless of the type of crisis it's always always be sure to take them as serious cries for help the first crisis i'll be talking about is when someone makes a suicide threat suicide threats are when someone makes direct or indirect that's that they will take their own life examples of direct statements include when someone says something like i've decided to kill myself or i'm going to end it all or if xyz doesn't happen i'll kill myself indirect statements can be things like my family would be better off without me or i can't do it anymore it's important to stress your gut however and if you believe someone is making some sort of a suicide threat or exhibiting suicidal behavior intervene accordingly begin by listening to the person or asking directly if they're suicidal it's okay to talk about suicide ask them how long they've been feeling that way and avoid saying things like you shouldn't feel that way avoid arguing or saying things like what would your family think also remove any access to lethal means in particular restricting access to firearms or certain medications um it's a temporary restriction until you and the person are confident that they're out of the crisis period so it's completely okay for your neighbor to give you their firearms temporarily if they are suicidal and if the person is agitated be sure to stay at a distance and be aware of your own movements as the person may fear sun movements or being cornered then help the person access help and ideally the person will receive services willingly i recommend you beginning by calling the local mobile mobile crisis number which i've listed on this slide it is through helen ross mcnabb it's a 24 7 number and they'll work with you to find the least restrictive placement for someone during this time someone can call for themselves or you can call for consultation to figure out what are the right steps for this person mobile crisis is the first number you should call to do an assessment and recommend treatment but there are a few circumstances where mobile crisis will not respond and instead recommend that you call other emergency services in particular law enforcement so some situations where you would want to do this is if you have a fear for your own safety in that event um you would get in touch with law enforcement and be sure to emphasize that it's a mental health crisis and that you would like to request a trained officer if possible there are what are known as cit officers and cit officers have 40 hours of training to better help people in psychiatric crises knox county also has a new program where a behavioral health specialist is paired with a kpd officer in order to divert those experiencing mental health crises from the criminal justice system and instead connect them with the help needed if someone in the case of suicide attempts especially when someone requires medical attention mobile crisis again will recommend that you instead reach out to emergency services or get the person medical attention immediately so this can mean calling 911 and when you do make that call again give them all the information you have if the person who attempted is unconscious or sorry if they're still conscious try to receive any information that they're willing to share about any substances that have been taken or if the person has any other medical problems because all that information can make a difference when emergency personnel are intervening also be sure to let the 911 operator know that it's a mental health call all of that information is very helpful and once the person has received medical intervention then they should be connected to services that help them after discharge if the situation involves a potential overdose again call 911 collect information on what was taken how much was taken what time it was taken and the dosage if it was a prescribed medication if you have received previous naloxone or narcan training and the person's experience in opioid overdose please administer this intervention before calling emergency services but regardless you want to call 9-1-1 and emergency services need to intervene then the last mental health crisis which i think can be the scariest for people so agitated threatening or other inappropriate behavior it can be difficult to find in a way that indicates the severity of the mental health crisis a lot of personal perspective comes into play in a big way and whether or not you feel personally safe in this situation and honestly it can be very frightening and traumatic to observe some of these behaviors especially if they're extreme and while it's important to respect and honor the feelings that we're having that fear it's also important to take a step back and think about the behaviors critically you know how dangerous is this situation actually because our gut reaction of fear can result in calls being made to police that don't need to be made and it can be uncomfortable to talk about but persons with untreated mental illnesses are 16 times more likely to be killed during police encounters than others without mental illnesses because of this try to exhaust all of their options before involving law enforcement the criminalization of mental health is a very real thing and many of those who deserve proper treatment instead find themselves in the back of a police car [Music] keep in mind most of those who experience mental health crises are not violent like i said previously and many only present sorry may only present dangerous behaviors under certain circumstances and conditions so if someone is exhibiting signs of agitation such as physical or mental unease tension restlessness irritability excitement uncooperativeness anxiety or motor activity that is excessive inappropriate or purposeless try to assess a key point a few key points that will help you determine if law enforcement needs to be contacted and again if you're having to make this decision a lot quicker you may not have time to go through this list you have to trust your gut and not only maintain your own safety while thinking about the other person's safety so think about the following questions does the person have available weapons is the person making threats of harm to self or others does the person have a history of violence what level of self-control is the person exhibiting if the person is behaving extremely unable to sit still or communicate effectively maybe they have wide eyes they're rambling clutching themselves or other objects to maintain control begging to be left alone or even offering frantic reassurances that they're okay then those things show that the person is close to losing control has the person used any substances if so alcohol and drugs lower a person's inhibition and also make it more difficult to de-escalate safe safely and if is the person showing aggressive behaviors such as advancing toward you refusing to respect your personal space or making threats toward you if you answered yes to any of those things then the chance of violence has increased and again you've got to make the decision that you think is best not only for the other person but for your own safety so don't be afraid to call 9-1-1 or law enforcement if needed if you think it is the best option for that person ultimately your safety and the safety of the others is a priority if someone is exhibiting any of these signs that indicate they could become aggressive however if a person does not have access to a weapon has no known history of violence and appears to be mostly in control of their behaviors then it's safe to begin intervening without the presence of law enforcement first and foremost do not attempt to reach out and physically touch the person only do something like that when the person has calmed down always ensure your own safety in the situation first this means being aware of others in the room objects such as chairs or tables and always be aware of where there are any exits or openings this is not only for your own safety but for the safety of the person in crisis you want to be sure you have access to the exit without blocking theirs so they don't feel trapped the perception of threat is the primary cause for escalation of conflict and so when someone is crisis they may not be paying attention to what you're saying but they'll instinctively pay attention to the tone of your voice and body language so with that being said be sure that you are calm that there is no anger or fear in your voice and that you're holding your body in a non-threatening way so clenching your fists or crossing your arms over your chest or being no nose however if someone is upset you don't also don't want to immediately step in by saying oh it's important to stay calm you know in a super calm and quiet voice because doing so invalidates the way that they're feeling making them feel that you're not truly listening and that you're patronizing them and there's an amazing technique um where you can it's a de-escalation technique where you can help decrease someone's intensity and the technique is called mirror and match and this is something i recommend doing if there aren't really any acute safety concerns with this technique you match someone's original intensity and tone and then shift it our brain is hardwired to mirror others behaviors so someone is big with you respond with your own bigness with our body or voice this validates their feelings and let them know you're taking them seriously but instead of yelling and screaming like they might be instead use calming words such as i can tell you're really upset and i want to understand that and then you gradually start to soften your body voice volume and pay attention if they begin to match your change in tone when they start matching you continue shifting down move things to a softer place and you can even eventually attempt to sit down and then see if they mirror that behavior as well when that happens you can even begin to ask questions that get to the root of the problems for example if the person is having delusions or hallucinations that are causing their agitation or did someone say or do something threatening and wasn't misinterpreted if the person begins to respond to your questions that means a different part of their brain is being engaged the front part of their brain and the front part of our brain the frontal lobe is the part of our brain that's involved in making good and long-term and thought out decisions and then once they start making that transition to the front part of their brain you can work with them to address the root cause of the problem and link them to supports if the person does not begin to calm down makes a legitimate threat against you or another person or is in possession of a weapon or another toxic substance the next step would be to notify law enforcement if the situation doesn't feel safe please don't attempt to ds don't attempt to continue to de-escalate leave the situation and call for help and remember in any situation you can absolutely make a difference people are like houses you know they have cracks in the foundation and some have bigger cracks because maybe they've had traumatic childhoods or if they have experienced trauma later in life or maybe they have a mental health condition but when someone steps in and provides a listening ear create some of those neighborhood supports that we talk about these cracks slowly start to get repaired they may not go away and it's not always going to fix things but the strength that we have as people is one hundred percent well not a hundred percent it's definitely influenced by the people and support we have around us and those are things you can work on so i'm entrusting you to our mission at the mental health association of making our communities more responsive to the mental health needs of its people bring some of these ideas back to your neighborhood and start working to make it happen and i and the mental health association love to help you along this journey so a few things that we offer that could be helpful mha offers free mental health screenings through our

the south tamil but i was born in delhi lived in gujarat but i've been here most of my life i came here with my parents in the 80s and i studied physiotherapy um and the past two decades have been in mental and physical well-being and injury management so that's sort of my you know area of work and expertise um i'm just really grateful and humbled um to be talking about mental health which is um quite close to my heart and to be able to share my journey and hopefully yeah inspire you all to live life um to its fullest so thank you thank you very do you want shall we much with your story first sure um so my husband um see krishna bulige um was no um less loved or no less known than the famous cricketer sachin tendulkar especially in the indian australian community um he started the melbourne uni indian club he was yeah really really well known let's just put it that way um but around 10 years ago he was um diagnosed with clinical depression he didn't know that he was actually unwell one of his friends said you don't seem like yourself so you went to the doctor and then when she spoke to him he realized that he was having experiencing suicidal ideations so she popped him on antidepressant medication and he also started psychotherapy for seeing a psychologist and he was really really diligent with all of that and i sort of felt that you know what was the root cause and what are some of the other things that can also help him and help myself to help him because um you know so i started off studying quite intensely a lot of spiritual texts yoga reiki chronic healing mindfulness you know acceptance and commitment therapy basically anything and everything to try and help myself and to offer him the tools as well to help himself um and he did try yoga he tried meditation um and a lot of various cleansing diets and you know things like that um but he was i suppose the most consistent with you know seeing the gp the psychologist and the medication so he was pretty you know diligent with that um life was a bit of a rollercoaster ride obviously um and you know that seed had been sewn in my mind of his suicidal ideation so if there were times that i couldn't reach him i would become really really anxious you know i'd be like oh my god you know what's happened or you know um and so that was always sort of quite a challenging piece i guess over the past decade um but generally he appeared to be very very highly functioning he would he was very active in the community very very heavily involved with community work always smiling always there helping people so very very high functioning so you know at least i had that sort of like oh no he's doing okay um and then um you know and i suppose just the support and the love that we had from family and community um and just our deep commitment to each other that no matter what life throws us at us you know that we will get through this um and we've got two beautiful daughters who are now 12 and 14. um they were sort of this silver lining in you know that dark cloud of his depression that sort of kept us both going anyway then in about july 19 2019 um i had to teach at a physio yoga conference um and so i said to him hey why don't we go away for our 15th belated 15th wedding anniversary um so we left both the girls back in melbourne and with that family support we were able to have the best time of our lives that we hadn't for you know over 15 years because we hadn't been away from our girls he hired a motorbike um and we just you know traveled the roads of bali exploring ancient temples um just magical waterfalls and just you know the winds blowing through our hair and i'm just holding on to him for dear life going we haven't updated our will with our second daughter you know please drive carefully um just absorbing all the smells and sounds of bali like this beautiful tropical country the wind blowing through our hair like you know we were just like pre-kids you know like you know when we were in our 20s when we got togethers it's like this amazing amazing journey and i just you know just stop on the road sip fresh coconut water go get these amazing massages for next to nothing uh if anyone's been to bali you probably know that you can have that so it was just the most magical blissful holiday and it really sort of helped to you know save our marriage or re-strengthen you know because it was getting strained over the years of this rollercoaster with his mental health anyway so we you know came back after all of that um and exactly about a month later so on 21st of uh july 2019 um it was just a normal chaotic family day for us normal sunday um you know he had was trying to get a lot of work done he was just typing in his laptop or that's what i thought um and i dropped the girls off at singing did the grocery shopping picked them up came home made lunch um and he owned a restaurant so i was sort of like asking them all what do you think of my babaji which is like an indian street food um he's like what do you think i'm like maybe some salt and some paneer powder and he's like yeah yeah and then he's like oh it's amazing look i've just had breakfast he just gave me a little serve so he had that the kids ate it and then we still and then as i was cleaning up the kitchen this sort of just thought just popped into my head and it just said you know don't get too excited you know in just this sheer joy and happiness i just felt like oh my god with this perfect blissful family um and it was just like change is the only constant you know don't get too carried away in these fleeting moments of pure bliss i was just like nah nah life is so good you know we're awesome perfect family anyway we still had a long uh afternoon ahead we had um you know a restaurant launch party for a friend afternoon tea and then his dad said let's all go to the temple and ramsay i said to him should we do all of this and he's like yeah yeah we'll go to all of it i'm like okay even though i was feeling quite tired and i started preparing for a mindfulness presentation um that i was due to conduct at mercedes in a couple of days so here he's just tapping away at his laptop and i'm just sitting here trying to you know work out committed mindful meditation and breath meditation um and then we started realizing that um he said oh i've just got to go to dandenong and i said okay cool i've said look but i don't want to go to the launch party by myself with the kids because you've missed the last few parties like you've not turned up so they're just like oh my god they're all going to go there's one there's ones where's bouncy and i was like i want to go as a family you know i'm going to wait for you and he was like okay okay and then we realized that time started slipping away and i said oh my god now we're running really late why don't i just okay fine i'll just meet you at the launch party and then maybe we can go to the temple together you know but that's fine you just go do your thing because you always had stuff to do with the restaurant going by meat or meeting supplies so i said okay that's fine anyway so i got to the launch party but there's only like 20 minutes left but they had just started taking food orders so i started saying so i just texted him and i was like hey you know the what do you want to eat um and he didn't reply so then i was like oh my god he's going to miss you know the order so then i rang him at like 3 40 i'm like ring ring and then there was just no answer and then i tried again five minutes later no answer 3 55 again rang and i'm like okay what's going on there's no answer then i rang again at 402 just you know there's just no answer so my anxiety obviously really started to take over um and i started to obviously start you know thinking the worst again as i used to you know spiral into this anxiety of oh my god why can't i reach him um then at about quarter past four and in between i'm just constantly trying to ring him and i went outside the restaurant because it was quite noisy and i was getting quite flustered and quite anxious at not being able to reach him the encounter rang and he said um and he was driving and i think he just briefly saw in his apple watch like deer something and then oh you can look after the family better than me or something like he sort of was like oh my god but obviously he couldn't you know pull over so he ended up bringing me and he's like i just saw this you know text and um and so straight away i just jumped on the phone to triple zero and i was like i think my husband's trying to take his life um you know he said he was heading towards dandenong and then i turned around and at that time she was 12 she was just standing there and she heard all of this and she just completely broke down and i was just obviously beside myself and so i sort of just pushed her back into the restaurant i was like someone can just you know deal with you and i think um friends later said she was sort of hyperventilating they didn't know um anyway so then in the meanwhile other people like his dad started trying to bring me all these people are trying to ring me in between and i'm just like get off the phone i'm trying to ring you know triple zero and i'm trying to bring him constantly every you know minute and then at 4 36 um someone picked up the phone and i was like oh hi i was just like oh my god hi bobby you know um and it's like oh hi it's you know the police like sergeant someone and i was just yeah like oh my god my heart sank and he said look um there was just you know this phone abandoned in a car on the freeway and just there was a bit of suspicious activity so um we've been called to the scene and we've been here for half an hour you know we'll let you know once we find something out anyway so then obviously the next you know few hours i was just spending going okay he's gone for a walk he's gone for a run you know his car broke down and he's forgotten to take his phone just trying to you know visualize and bless him and just that you know convince myself that everything's fine because it usually is i can get through to him at the end of it all and anyway so the next few hours were just i don't know felt like days um and then we got a call um at 7 30 and they said we found the body um and yeah my world just came crumbling down um and that whole night i think i don't know who was crying or louder his mum or me was just this waves of just grief and sobbing and primal howling like it was just inexplicable what you know we went through i had my best friend next to me she was just holding on to me for dear life and so you know one of us would stop crying and then the other would start um so that just went on all night long and then in the morning i um went downstairs and i opened our spare keys in the kitchen cupboard and the house key so i opened the cupboard and i saw his car keys and that just set me off i just curled into a ball and i was just bawling like i was like i can't do these um and then so i just lay there and then my i just felt a hand on my shoulder um and it was my mother-in-law and she sort of said look what's happens happened you're going to have to stay strong you've got your two girls you know you have to be strong for them you can't just lie here in a ball and so i just at that point decided you know what i'm gonna draw into every ounce into the core of my beam and i'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure that my girls and i get through this that we we can do it we've got support and i'll do anything in everything to make sure that they're protected and they're going to turn out okay we will be okay and then from there the next few months like he had a few businesses so it was just this daily cycle of sending them off to school crying doing some of the work which was very very complex and so my brain could barely process any of it so i could manage one or two hours and then crash into asleep cry then put on a brave face for the girls when they came home and this just cycle continued for many many months because it was a very very complex you know business structures that he had and that sort of you know in between my mental functioning um and then trying to just yet be present for the girls anyway i sort of think started getting under control around march um but then we all know that obviously the pandemic um hit the world and um so obviously both the girls were homeschooling um it was my daughter's last year's the second ones um she was in grade six the last year of schooling but just she became quite sort of disengaged um and didn't really cope you know that well with the schooling but you know um i just sort of said to them i completely avoided putting on the news watching and listening to anything briefly i got caught up in the conspiracy theories but mostly i made sure that you know they were really not exposed to any of that they had enough in their life to deal with so i've made them go for daily walks around the block no matter what happened we made sure that you know made sure that they ate healthy food and made sure that you know um we expressed gratitude for you know everything being able to step out of the house um i know we were in melbourne which had some of the harshest locks down in the world but hey we were still able to leave our house and go for a walk around the block be able to smell you know breathing the fresh air you know and so i sort of just made it a very big mission of mine to make sure that they don't suffer you know mentally as much as possible from the effects of this because it was quite quite it was very unnerving for the whole world and i don't need to go into that too much i'll get jay here at this point ali if you don't mind yeah um jay tell us about depression please and how does it affect men and women there are very few people like baesh ali you know who's going to talk coping strategies and what she's doing and another question is uh why do people commit suicide we do have a viewer question but uh maya we will answer your question after jazz uh answered mine thanks saleh uh especially i'm really sorry to hear of your loss and what you went through um it's always difficult when a loved one passes on it's even more challenging when they die through suicide um and the person the survivors left with the feeling did i do anything wrong could i have done something more what what else could i have done did i not be there for that person so that there there is not just sort of surviving uh as a grieving partner and spouse but also the guilt that overcomes someone and so it's a really hard period for people i think uh sally had to answer your question um we all experience a range of emotions in our everyday lives you know ranging from anxiety sadness joy fear panic um jealousy guilt you name it we all have it and you know it's normal to experience emotion but we also have the capacity to cope with those emotions when things are going well for us um depression um is something different qualitatively as well as quantitatively from normal sadness and that we all experience um and it differs in several ways but specifically in three three ways one it is excessive the sadness of the person feed is excessive to the circumstances and situations that he or she find themselves in often there is no reason for the person to feel depressed and that's why depression as a disorder as an illness is different from the sadness that we feel in our lives following losses and stresses so some people are genetically predisposed to suffer from depression without any reason and their depression is usually very intense very biological in nature and require significant amounts of treatment with medication as well as non-medical are you saying it's hereditary some depression depressive conditions are inherited yes there's a genetic familial link so we generally don't talk about our mental health problems um you know unlike physical health problems that you uh stated at the outset of this show but some of it is hereditary some others is due to vulnerability due to experiences in our growing up years so if there's a lot of demand placed on the child if there's a lot of criticism in the child's environment if the child experiences you know abuse of a physical or a sexual nature these uh reduce the person's self-esteem self-confidence their perception of themselves as someone who is autonomous and can overcome adversities so that's that's another factor which leads vulnerable people to react adversely to normal stresses that others may be able to overcome but then go down go under with depressive uh symptoms and then there's a third group um you know all of us currently during the pandemic where what we are experienced the kind of stress that we are experiencing is unusual it's never we've never had to live through walls we've never had to live through pandemics before and this is not the kind of stresses that any one of us have experienced in our lifetime before so during this pandemic um there is there is there is already an evolving surge of a mental health pandemic which will follow the the current physical health and demand so there are various reasons um for depression but what is it you know one it is it is excessive sadness um with or without any reason second it is pervasive nothing helps shift the mood so whilst normal sadness even when someone is grieving at the loss of a loved one the the sadness comes in waves and then it sort of goes away um so there are periods when people feel really low and wish they were dead as well and be able to join their loved ones but then the sort of next moment they're sort of thinking no i have to like where charlie did i have to live for my children i have to make sure that they you know i bring them up in a proper way so so the mood shifts from sadness to more positive state of mind but in clinical depression it doesn't shift it's pervasive and thirdly it's persistent it doesn't go away but day after day week after week the person feels sad now there are people who are able to smile through the depression which is unusual to know but there are people who we call sort of you know smiling depressed which is which makes it very tricky that they are able to sort of smile through their day so that others around them the loved ones can't actually make out whether they are genuinely depressed or not and it's possible that bamsi was one of um such a person and such individuals have the sort of very strong sense of duty duty to themselves the family the community so they can't however sad and upset and distressed they're feeling internally they can't give up they carry on with a smile on their face and it's possible sometimes they decide a lot earlier than the final event suicide what they want to do with their life but they go through the motions of life with a smile on their face which makes it really hard for people around them to know what really is going on so in terms of symptoms of depression and it is not just feeling sad that's just one part of it depression um as a disorder as an illness comes with a cluster of symptoms so you have emotional symptoms such as you know feeling sad feeling anxious lots of guilt um mood swings from anxiety to panic to fear to absolute suicidal feelings as well as anger men experience a lot more irritability and anger than women do women cry a lot men often don't cry because the way boys are raised you know you've got to sort of man up and you know head up you you shouldn't cry you're a  if you cry girls cry boys grow up with this kind of messaging from their family and community all along so they are less likely to reveal their depression as easily as women might so that's one set of symptoms the other set is you know our thinking changes when we are depressed clinically depressed mind you there is a lot more negativity about the self that you're no good you know there's there's an inner voice there's an inner critic that's sitting inside your head and constantly commenting on every little error failure mistakes that you made oh look you got out of the bed five minutes late something as innocuous as that um and that criticism is ongoing never ceasing um you know the winston churchill the british prime minister used to call depression he used to suffer from bipolar depression so he would have periods of highs and periods of flow he used to call it the black dog and it is something that's dark and gloomy and foreboding that kind of descends on you on your soul and your spirit uh so the thinking becomes very negative towards yourself the thinking becomes negative about others no matter how much you reassure them the depressed person feels that people are not going to be really interested in you they're not going to really be able to help me even if i tell them they won't understand what i'm going through because what i'm going to is so unusual you know there is no reason for me to feel so sad there is that feeling that you know i should be doing what others are doing so there is that negative view about others and there is a negative view about the future that the future looks really bleak no matter what i do this is not going to change this is what my life is going to be day after day here on in so there is no light at the end of the tunnel that the person can see then you have the physical symptoms you know the sleep can be really poor or it can be the opposite they sleep excessively not necessarily that they're sleeping but they're lying in bed for hours and hours the appetite can change it can increase they put on a lot of weight because of comfort eating you know just eating something to sort of lift their mood or they go off food and the significant loss of weight for men in particular sexual activity can go down remarkably because they're just not interested in it or conversely it can go up in an attempt to sort of you know find that spark and an attempt to feel better and good you know with their partners and their spouses and loved ones um there's a feeling of tiredness and fatigue all the time little things can tire you out very quickly uh you cannot concentrate for long periods of time your memory starts to rain you become very forgetful um and so this is all that the person who is suffering is going through but there are things that others observe as well you know the change in behavior and that's that's the first point that i say to people that you know you have someone depressed around your anxious notice what's different what has changed uh notice but don't judge you know if you because people are so defensive about mental health issues if you say oh i think you're you're a little bit depressed or a little bit anxious they'll say no i'm not and then you sort of blocked off there but if you notice what has changed and comment on this you know give them the facts they can't deny it you say hey mate you know i've been with you a very long time you're a really chirpy guy otherwise but afraid i found it to be a really grumpy bear you get irritable very very quickly is everything all right uh and the person may say oh yeah everything is fine but then don't stop there you can ask you know follow up ask the same question twice are you really sure that everything is all right and then sort of reassure them so the behavior changes um they cannot do the usual things that they do in their day-to-day life um they can't work very well if it's a school-going child the school performance drops if it's a housewife they can't attend to their day-to-day responsibilities at home so their work performance drops and this is what this calls sort of impairment in their functions uh the role function that we all have um they cannot derive any joy and pleasure from the pleasurable activities so they stop going out with friends they stop sports if that's what they did they stop everything that they really did to fill up their time outside of work to stop reduce socializing there is uh an increase in use of alcohol or drugs in a in an attempt or even prescription medication in order to treat themselves medicate themselves there may be some for men in particular there may be some in discrete sort of relationships that they sort of get into in order to sort of you know find that spark that is that is so missing from their lives um and there is sort of change in their personal appearance they stop looking after their personal sort of appearance grooming the standard of hygiene drops self-care drops so you have all of these things happening side by side and persisting for a very long period of time and that's what clinical depression is so as you can tell it's very different from the normal sadness that we feel we may feel sad but we still turn up to work you can still put on a mask get through the day come back and you know oh my god that's another day done um but the depressed person can't do it um you ask the question how is it different across the two genders yes i think yeah and i think um when boys and girls are young you know when they're 8 10 12 years old boys actually in surveys doesn't found boys report more sadness than girls do because boy yeah boys boys are out and about they get bullied a little bit more they get into fights with school kids they might be in trouble at school they're pulled up a little bit more girls because of the temperaments generally are much more quieter obedient compliant of course i'm sort of over generalizing that it's not always the case but generally speaking but something starts to change between the age of 15 and 18 in adolescent or middle middle as a lesson to all the adolescents where girls start to internalize their negative feelings so girls start to become more and more depressed or certainly they report more depressed whereas boys stop reporting it boys actually then start to engage in bad behaviors so they behave in school changes they may become a bit disruptive they get into fights they their school performances drop their performance instead of sporting activities social groups that kind of becomes a problematic they might be getting into fights they start to take experiment with drugs and alcohol there is indiscreet sexual activity unsafe activities risk-taking behaviors so um generally by the time you're in early adulthood uh boys have gone into a sort of very different trajectory or men young men now compared to young women young women the rates of depression are highest during the child bearing years from the age of about 18 to you know late 30s to 40 women will report and be diagnosed with depression far more than men would okay however if you look at suicide rates the highest peak suicide rates is between the age of 20 to 40 for men men commit suicide much more than women is that true for you yes yeah that's the peak that doesn't mean that people can't take their own lives uh after the age of 40 as well but um men tend to there's a if there is one thing uh to differentiate between the two genders women report how they feel if they're feeling sad they will tell you so everyone around them knows that creates a network of safety and support for them women communicate much better than men so they can derive support as well men do what they feel they don't say it they just act on what they're feeling so if they're feeling really sad and low they will act on it uh rather than tell you that i'm feeling really sad because they men men are you know as a gender they're focused on goals and and plans to achieve those goals and if they can't do that they will do something else women their identities often occur in a in a kind of a context of relationships women have far more relationship with acts of the network jay can i ask you a viewer question here i know we haven't spoken to munitas yet sorry munit we'll just come to you um i have a question from a viewer who wants to know she says i am very aggressive i become crazy when anything goes against my will i have isolated myself now i just want to hit my loved ones yeah um i'm not sure if the viewer is a man or a woman a lady a lady um that's all right i think i think um if the if she feels that she is feeling negative in herself you know without sort of labeling it as depression or anxiety or whatever if she what she's feeling uh is a negative emotion or negative sense of emotion and if she's experienced some of the other things that we have talked about uh change in her thinking patterns change in her sort of physical well-being sense of physical well-being and change in behavior she's obviously reporting the changes in her behavior that she gets angry very rapidly she feels like hitting others and there is a change i would suggest that she talk about it to a professional it doesn't necessarily have to be a psychiatrist i mean she can see her gp or she can see whoever she feels comfortable with because you have to feel comfortable but she needs to get help from outside something is growing and i think we need to address that she needs to address it but if i could just sort of finish very quickly i know we're sort of getting on with time is about the suicide the question you asked the uh earlier [Music] the ways in which the the highest risk factor for men in terms of committing suicide are those that are single or isolated will become socially very isolated they're very little network of support and even if there is they don't actually seek support from them because they feel no one will be able to help them um unemployment financial worries is another big factor as a risk factor physical illness particularly cardiac problems um and you know smoking and drugs substances alcohol those are some of the research findings of risk factors associated with men that go on to take their own lives thank you jay honey do you want to share your story it makes me so overwhelmed listening to everything over here now so it's like with me emotional stuff in my life especially with the last one and a half year a lot of it i just had a baby in september month who was a premature baby and we were already coping with stress and emotional struggles with that that she was a premature baby pre-term premature and underweight and she was in the incubator for like around six weeks and we were going through all that and then we got news that my mother-in-law in india had to undergo an eye surgery so she cannot travel to australia so we thought it's better that i go to australia so that she can see my both the daughters and it was almost like six years i never went to india so i wanted to go down to india so that my daughters can at least be in india for once while we traveled from this it was me my elder daughter or we were on one ticket my younger daughter and my father-in-law were the only another ticket and it was the same the same way it was the same system while coming back the only difference was that while coming we've lost of like around um 10 days different apart from each other yeah so it thought it's okay by the time i come back i can settle down for 10 days i can start my job i can gonna get settled down it would be easier for me but then the moment i came back here in the month of march in 2020 what happened was everything went into lockdown and my water got stuck there and the borders were closed the the daughter was stuck there she had no formula she was on a special formula because she was a premature baby so i took only that amount of formula that was required about the time i could stay there and nothing else was required so i didn't border i didn't buy any extra formula for at the moment i reached it was locked down flight got canceled my daughter's flights got cancelled and now it's been 14 months that we have been just waiting for her to be here the the story of those 14 months have been so harsh because we there was no formula there was no way to send formula to india the moment we realized that everything somebody could carry for us okay it was it was still difficult for them to be in in bombay to give it to them other than that we had another struggle in the month of september 2020 when my brother-in-law died in an accident in australia that was the most devastating point in our life and especially with my husband now i wanted to stay strong for my husband because that was the only brother he had and he was like around nine years younger to him like a baby to us so the the second moment you know in a fraction of a second the life changed he just went out for his job he was supposed to come home at 11 o'clock in the night my husband spoke to him like a couple of minutes back couple of minutes back day and he was like he's just coming home at 11 o'clock and usually he used to come home and sleep in his room so we used to meet in the morning and we never realized that he never came back actually home he died in an accident just after a couple of minutes that my husband spoke with him and we had no clue we got to know in the morning like around 7 30 when the police came and they told us we couldn't believe it we were like no that's not true we went to his room we saw his room searched everywhere we thought no that can cannot be true because he was a very very very safe driver having an accident with that kind of a guy was like not believable because in 80 zone also he used to drive at 75 and you always used to say i love my life and those six uh you know now since september 2020 till this time every day has been a struggling day every day has been spending like emotional we have been going ups and downs and there have been so much going around with tickets bringing them here you know doing the cremation here without without our parents to be here and you know still we don't want to touch anything in his room we we've just left the room like that his clothes his pictures his phone his you know his watch everything we have kept it like that because we don't want the memories to go we don't want i don't i'm not not about my husband but about me i don't want the smell to go from his room i just want that smell i want his bed sheets to smell like him because every morning he used to bring coffee for me every morning he used to you know waking up for my breakfast and he was there with me from last three years staying in the same house i don't want that smell of his clothes to go away from my house i just want him everywhere we're still struggling for my daughter to be here we are still struggling for our parents to be here though being a citizen okay she's still stuck in india and we have no clue when she's coming back it is so hard we have been requesting government we got flights but the moment we're gonna book the flights the website crashes there's there are no seats you know left because there are 9 000 people stuck in india everybody cannot get a flight it is so hard and we do understand but everybody is impo the only worry that we have right now is in case of this interior doing this over time in case something happens to my in-laws what's gonna happen with my daughter there because there's no one to take care of her other than my in-laws i don't know like the group of friends that i had they never they are not ready to understand what emotional stage i'm going through you know they are not ready to keep up with me they they don't want to listen to me what i'm going through the way they said everybody few people can have a smile and they can you know do i tried that i'm still trying that okay but it is hard what is going inside in my heart and in my brain no one knows no one knows that you know my this was my second mother's day that i missed you know i have not seen her last mother's day i missed this mother's day i missed okay and it was a very struggling moment in the morning when i have my elder one with me but i don't have my younger one so i could feel that pain my mother-in-law is going through that he has she has only one son left now the reason that i work for community services involuntary services my volunteer services my you know way too it's just that i want to keep my brain busy i don't want my brain to relax because the moment i relax i think of my brother-in-law i think of my daughter so i just don't want my brain to relax i just wanted to be keep on going on and on on and on same as with my husband he doesn't want to sit home he doesn't want to you know stay idle at home he just wants to keep on doing something something something because the moment we are free we just think of them there have been days when we don't talk with each other because i don't and sometimes it is hard for me to understand what is my husband going through and sometimes it is so hard for my husband to understand what i am going through because we don't have words to explain what what to tell each other like what is happening into our brains it is very hard and it is it is so hard to come and talk about it because like they said women have a group of social network and they can talk and you know yell and they can tell same thing that my husband cannot tell me my husband doesn't know the way to explain it to me and i know how hard it is for him to be going through this stage at this time i don't know what i do sometimes it is hard sometimes i want my friends to be with me but then they don't want to understand what's going on they are just thinking of oh it's so much of negativity there's so much of you know stress for us but they're not ready to understand me as a friend to help me out i don't know what to say i meant a lot of words so i don't know what to say what emotional impact has the pandemic had on people like money and i think no yeah there's no clue there's no brains to work out so yeah i really um feel for your ex what you've gone through money it's it's a enormous challenge and it must be so painful as a mother not to not broke not to be able to see one's daughter um just sort of go back to your question uh the pandemic i think the pandemic has affected all of us um in ways that we couldn't have imagined uh when it started um we didn't realize the impact it would have on our everyday lives the way it has had um you know all of us have had to struggle with losses if there's one thing that the pandemic has brought home to us is accentuate the sense of loss that um people like munit and vaishali and many others are feeling that not only have you sort of suffered a loss in your personal lives of a loved one but you also lost the the usual coping strategies that we had available to us before the lockdown i mean i know australia is sort of coming out of it we are coming out on the other side and not many things are available to us now and possible but i'm sort of thinking of our friends and colleagues and families back in india who are going through a real surge and a second wave that is so so horrible to see on television and the stories that we hear from our relatives um and friends back home almost every family is affected most of them have lost someone or the other some others are struggling in hospital but what the pandemic has does done is is to bring home to us an enormous amount of loss not just of loved ones to the illness but there is the fear of you know getting ill yourself and the losses that it will bring it has brought about financial loss for many people who have lost their jobs um there is sort of the social loss in terms of the lockdowns restriction lack of social events ability to see people there are so many uh here who are unable to visit munit as an example who can't um visit families and their families can't visit them there is interpersonal loss limited contact with relatives think that we look forward to going on holidays going for movies going for a meal i'm talking of india now that that's not available so loss is is a really significant issue and alongside of that is intense fear fear that you will contract it you might become ill and you might die you may pass it to your loved ones and they might die especially elderly parents if they live with you or elderly relatives um so there is this enormous um emotional rollercoaster you know emotional storm that people are going through and there are sort of two broad kinds of emotional reactions one is people are are getting sort of supercharged with emotions of fear panic anxiety as well as anger because there is very little that you can do um you know short of keeping yourself safe by putting on a mask and washing your hands and you know social distancing there's very little that you can do and in places like india the system is such at the moment that people aren't finding the help in hospitals and in the community so fear and anger are sort of the emotions that are very intense and then so that's a lot of emotion and the flip side is there is no emotion that there are many who go into that denial mode that this can't happen to me it's happening to my neighbors and it's happening in the community but i won't get it and and so um there's they remain in denial and this emotional roller coaster they they they come in waves again it's cyclical it's not there all the time it's almost like a grief reaction it sort of comes and goes um and it goes in sort of phases so you have a phase of denial you know that it's not happening it can't affect me uh i heard uh from many of my indian friends and relatives that indians are hyper immune that it will not affect them that the hot temperature will kill the virus and its illness of europe and the united states the colder countries but you know we are having this big surge now in india during the summer months after denial comes when the when the penny drops that this is not going to go away many people get very angry they if they get affected if the family get affected they ask the question why me why did my loved ones get it um and why are people not wearing masks why don't we have the facilities why isn't the government provided there are lots of yyyy questions and there's a lot of blaming others blaming systems blaming relatives blaming friends blending yourself and even that you didn't take enough precautions to prevent prevent the infection and then comes the stage of bargaining uh we start to sort of bargain in in our own minds that okay i'll start wearing masks from now on but i'll make sure everyone else does so you get very cross with people who are not wearing masks or sort of you know exposing their nose or wearing the mask across their chin um people turn to gods and religion and praying you know if i pray this will go away so that's the bargain if i do this will the will the sickness and the illness pandemic go away i'll stop medicines if i have enough medicines if i have enough oxygen with me so the medication and oxygen cylinders in india disappearing off the shelves because individuals as well as organizations are stalking them at home in the hope that you know they will need it and finally they realize that nothing of this is actually going to work if people have to get infected they will get infected people will die and that's when this the same kind of grief reaction strikes them of sadness and and then finally comes the acceptance that you know this is not going to go away we are in for in this for the long haul so so those are some other emotional reactions that people experience are experienced in during the pandemic and munit you know with her child so far away losing her brother-in-law like a double whammy literally that must be so tough it is it is and and i can't even begin to imagine how monique is uh coping uh um uh i hope i haven't lost you no i try to keep my mind building no i'm just trying to keep myself busy everywhere like i don't want that my mind to relax to think about it what's been happening you know i look at her on the face them or maybe on the whatsapp videos and everywhere on the facetime but then she doesn't realize that i'm a mom she keeps on running she doesn't you know talk to me properly and i feel that pain inside of me that you know my daughter is not being with me i missed her first walk i missed her first time saying my me mum i missed that moment of hugging kissing you know being with the sleeping with them everybody has anything different way of copying up stuff yep um we are running out of time so i'm going to be like really really quick for this segment vaishali how what has been your coping strategies you're on mute you're on mute sorry i'll try and cram it into one minute that's okay um some of the strategies that i've used is as i've mentioned before trying to use mindfulness and meditation um exercise especially out in nature um a clean diet and i pretty much avoided alcohol during all of last year i'm like i'm not going to use that as a coping mechanism yeah have a drink with a friend socially but obviously we couldn't so i avoided it completely um and then in those moments where either my mind's drifting off into the past of that traumatic day or moving to the future you know i sort of would sometimes go now you know to myself pull myself into the now i'd sometimes use the breath even if you just breathe out you sort of can come into the now i try and sort of think about the things that i can sort of you know hear see and sort of um smell just to pull me back into the body into the here and now rather than sort of spiraling you know downwards um or backwards into the future or into the um you know and forwards um i studied a diploma in sound healing last year i'm also a yoga teacher so i found sound to be quite a phenomenal way of meditating because it just literally you know the singing bowl the gong just sort of shifts and stops and breaks those thought patterns um to just drop you into your stillness so then you can stop those racing thoughts so i found that to be really really amazing both for my children and myself and you know the others that have experienced it so um that's been a huge savior um and then at the end of the day gratitude has been a very very big part as well that we really if we can just focus on there is something to be grateful for looking for that consciously expressing it feeling it in our heart you know i've got amazing in-laws that never blame me for what's happened beautiful children you know like i am so blessed so i really consciously choose to look at the good in my life um i can choose to play victim i choose not to so that's sort of my you know um that we have a choice um to just look for the good in our lives no matter what's going on and if everything's falling apart just surrender go within and know that this too shall pass that we will get through it you will get through it um so yeah you are really brave joya anand thank you for watching virtually there's a comment for you from joyas which says you are an inspiration and jay in answer to anand commented saying the ps must intervene listening to munit's story munit how are you hoping i'm just trying to work be busy you know be uh spending that time with my elder daughter because i don't want my elder daughter to face that moment of where i am leaving her apart when i'm not taking care of her so at least i am being with every morning seeing her of course missing my younger one a lot but then i try to be more close with her spend more time with my elder one take care of her be you know spend time with my friends outside where i can you know get some air get some new people to you know talk to help others actually these days of trying to you know ask people if they need some help and i could be of help to them so that what i am going through they don't have to go through that same thank you that's what i'm doing thank you jay not everybody not everybody is as brave as vaishali and monet so what do you think people should do i think um during the the pandemic and i'm sort of focusing largely on sort of pandemic and the the reactions to it there are a few things that we can and should try and do and some of it has been articulated by munit and vaishali already i'll just sort of put a a formula to it what they're doing uh one of the first things to do in the pandemic is to accept that there are many things that are outside your control you cannot control things you cannot control the government you cannot control the virus you cannot control how it's unfolding you cannot control the movement of the chartered flights and things like that so if you cannot change things it's pointless spending a lot of emotional energy worrying about it and we need to sort of focus on the life that we have here and now and try and make the most of that because what we need to be mindful is that if we become emotionally weak and distressed and dysfunctional we won't be able to be there for not just ourselves but for the people around us yes you know when it's daughter and others that we have so can accept the uncontrollable and i've got a um a mnemonic an acronym you know called face um just face what's coming f stands for focus on what is under your control and what is in your control you know you control uh the fact that you keep yourself disinfected distance you can control the fact that if you're distressed you try and talk about it someone else and let that person know so that they can help you if that help is not coming you see a professional in in our culture in south asian cultures there's a lot of shame associated with acknowledging that you are psychologically somehow incompetent that you are someone with sort of low willpower if you cannot resolve your own problems now imagine if you change the scenario if you had a tummy ache if you had a headache you'll be the first one to sort of you know if you clutch your tummy 10 persons will ask you what's wrong and you won't hold back taking a medication going to your gp and talking about it why is it different when it's your mind is your mind a rubbish bin that you throw everything in and expect it to function regardless i think we need to sort of come around to the fact that if you are in distress just see it as like you see your physical health and report it and seek help then comes you know the a and the c you know acknowledge your thoughts and feelings that we've said you know acknowledge it what's except what's going on inside and as vaishali said come back into the body come back into the body to ground yourself and you can ground yourself by focusing on your breathing you can push your feet hard on the floor um you can you know hold your fingertips and just push and feel the muscle stretch um you can you know just stretch your body all of these things stop the the constant chatter the autopilot in your head the constant thinking and the worries and the feelings and grounds you into the body and then go back engaging in what you're supposed to do and as monique said that you know by keeping munita and her husband by keeping themselves busy and active they can distance themselves from the emotional pain that comes in each time they stop stop working so sometimes focusing on what to do next so rather than ask why me why me why did it happen to me why did i lose my partner why i know it's very painful but if you can't find answers you need to change the question from why me to what next what can i do next what can i expect he's done yesterday yes and which which is why they they are they are examples of people who are resilient uh they have tapped into their inner strength and vishali has gone and trained herself in various other modalities to equip herself to deal with this those who can't will have to rely on others to provide these kind of inputs and although i'm a psychiatrist i wouldn't say that you should rush and start taking medications but there is a legitimate role for medications in in the management of it there are times when non-medication therapies and approaches will not work and if you find that you fulfill all the criteria for depression and no matter what you do your mood doesn't lift you should go and see your gp and he or she may refer you to a psychiatrist so medication is really key to it i'll probably stop because i'm mindful of the time saleh yeah um thank you everyone for joining me today uh important discussion and uh versailles more power to you very very very brave of you to come and talk about it and jay thank you so much for sharing your expertise good night everyone stay safe stay well and if you're not feeling well as jay said please go and see your gp ,False,False,True,False
76rVrYe81Gw,I Try a K-pop Idol&#39;s Extreme Diet (The IU Diet) - No Sweat: EP37,UC1SvRq3YzZACheYynsDrXmw,Clicknetwork,2020-04-09T06:11:01Z,Tyen tries out an extreme weight loss diet by K-pop idol IU and struggles to make it through the week. Download the No Sweat app!,"Hey guys, it's Tyen. So all of you know that I have this morbid curiosity for diet fads and I'm down to try almost anything. And for today's episode, I'm gonna be trying something a bit more extreme than usual and that is the k-pop idol diet. So I went online to see what the k-pop diet
entails and I realise there's just so many different types of diets according
to the different celebrities. But something I realise about all of them is
that they seem pretty extreme! So out of all the different k-pop idol diets I
found out there, there was one that really caught my attention and that was IU's diet. Her diet is pretty much 1 apple for breakfast, 1 sweet potato for lunch and 1 protein shake for dinner. And I'm looking at the diet and thinking
how does one sustain on this diet especially her because she's a k-pop idol,
she probably has dance rehearsals, singing rehearsals and has to go for all these
concerts, how does she sustain with this kind of diet? And for myself I'm
thinking you know I'll lead a pretty active lifestyle, can I possibly sustain
with the same amount of calories and eat so little? That's why I decided to try it
for myself so I'm gonna vlog and bring you guys along my crash diet. It is day 1 of the k-pop diet and I am on my way to work. I have not eaten anything but I
want to make sure that when I have that apple, that sweet potato and that protein
shake, it's gonna be a damn good one! After work I'm gonna pick up my apple and I'm gonna make it a really nice and juicy one. I try not to eat fruit in the morning, I don't know if you guys have experienced this before but when I eat a lot
of sugar in the morning and a lot of fruit in the morning, I actually get a
bit hungrier but this is a really yummy apple and I'm glad it's part of my
diet, I'm gonna finish eating this and then head out for my meeting. I'm on my way back home. I swear towards like the last 10 minutes of that meeting, I thought I was going to black out because I felt so hungry already so I'm on my way back to eat my second meal which is a sweet potato. I don't know how much that's going to satiate me, I'm looking forward to it because I love sweet potatoes but I really don't know how much that's gonna keep me full. I have made myself my lunch, this is my purple sweet potato. So I actually went online and went to go and see how other people do the IU diet and their sweet potatoes look significantly larger so I decided to make myself another sweet
potato even though it's just like a little tiny one. I'm gonna enjoy my sweet potato, get back to doing some work and then check in on a bit later in the
afternoon. I just felt this massive energy slum I was so tired and sleepy, I just decided to crash in bed and I only woke up another 2 hours later, so no, it's an unproductive day. And I'm glad that I'm not working out today, today is like a rest day for me so I'm just a bit worried to see how I would function given that I don't have a lot of energy from foods, hopefully I have enough energy reserved to push me through a workout when I have to tomorrow but as of now all I can say
is that I just feel very sleepy. The final meal of the day is going to be
a protein shake. I feel that you know with dieting, sometimes it's not so much of the food itself it's just like the social element of it. For example when I have date night, this person is going to bring me somewhere very nice, the last thing I want to do is to go, ""Oh sorry I'm only eating a sweet potatoes and apples for my diet."" but you know what, I am determined to see this diet through, I do crazy things for the love of my channel and my show. It is day 2 on the k-pop diet and I have not eaten anything today. Usually on my Saturday mornings, I pack my clients back-to-back so I was just training non-stop. I think because I also knew I was on this diet, I tried not to eat too
early in the day because I feel once you start eating your metabolism starts
going so I try not to eat so early today so I can spread out my calories when I'm
the most exhausting which is probably gonna be later today. I didn't feel super
hungry this morning. Honestly I was running on coffee the
entire time. This is my third cup this morning so I guess I'm just running on caffeine but I feel like the hunger pang might kick in a bit later on but I have
my apple with me, I'm gonna have this is my first meal of the day. So far how I feel in terms of how I look, I do feel thinner. I think just because I feel more hollow, I didn't eat much yesterday so I guess the initial feeling was just to feel thinner. Just in general, this diet doesn't even seem it fills anybody up. I mean I don't know how an apple and sweet potatoes and a protein shake is suppose to fill... I mean that's under 500 calories which is pretty much a starvation calorie diet if you ask me. I know that earlier today I was saying that I am unfettered by this diet but to be honest after you have eaten 1 apple, you've gotten your sugar in and your body starts to crave for more food and that's what I'm doing right now. This is what I have for lunch today, a sweet potato. I am done filming a little story time for my personal YouTube channel and I am feeling famished. I would say though that on day 2 of my
diet I have been getting very good bowel movements which is pretty strange because I'm thinking you know I'm not eating that much food, I'm only eating like an
apple and a sweet potato and a protein shake and I'm eliminating a lot of meat
in my diet. Meat perhaps could be the result of a lot of
constipation and bloating issues that I experience on a day-to-day. But overall
it's been okay I just have to deal with very serious hunger pangs. So it is the end of day 2 on the k-pop diet and I can say that I already feel skinnier so
I think there's a huge psychological effect of this diet whereby because
you're eating so little, you do feel a lot lighter, yeah you don't get the same
kind of bloating you would after you eat a huge meal and it's just been 2
days of eating less and you feel skinnier. And I can totally see why people
will be addicted to wanting to do it on a daily basis. So it is now day 3 on my k-pop diet. I just finished training my Sunday
morning clients and I'm now at my grandma's house, going to have my Sunday afternoon lunch, which I do every single Sunday when I visit them. Unfortunately I forgot to tell her that I'm on this crazy k-pop
diet. I am not feeling very tired or very lethargic but I would say that I could
use with a lot more calories because I just know that my body functions much
better when I have eaten enough food and I have the right amount calories in
order for me to expand my energy. Personal training is a very emotionally
and energetically expensive service so I want to be able to have the amount of
calories and energy so that I can give that to my clients and I feel it without
that energy, I'm unable to do so and I'm just running on a lot of caffeine. So I
would like to be able to eat more so that I can you know train them with even
more intensity and to also work out with even more and see for myself. I just completed a workout on my app and overall i feel very sweaty, very gas out and I am a bit dizzy and sleepy and tired because I hadn't had enough food just makes me understand how hard it must be to get up and actually do a
workout if you don't eat enough calories and I know I could have pushed a lot
harder had I eaten more calories. For dinner I have a protein shake. To be honest I'm getting really sick and tired of IU's diet, it's so boring and there's no variety and it's so minimal. I really don't like
feeling hungry, I don't like feeling weak and that was completely how I felt just now when I tried to work out at my grandmother's place. I honestly don't know how long more of this diet I can take. It is day 4 of the k-pop diet. Needless to say I feel like crap. I don't feel motivated to go to the gym
now, I know I do have to workout and I should work out so I'm gonna eat a
pre-workout snack, my apple and then go and train. So I'm done with my leg and abs workout and I definitely think that my diet has not served me well because I
feel very tired. I think also because psychologically I know that I haven't
eaten enough over the past few days and I just want to conserve my energy so
that is making me not want to push as hard but I'm still trying to like psych myself
into pushing and finishing out this workout so that's what I'm gonna do. So I'm halfway through day four on the k-pop diet and I've gotta say that this is definitely not working out for me because I've only had an apple today and
I've just been sitting here, trying to get some work done but been feeling very
distracted because my stomach is growling. So I went online to do a bit of
research about the k-pop diet and there are just a couple of guidelines that a
lot of Korean superstars follow when it comes to this k-pop diet. So one of them
is that it's lower fat. A lot of the Korean cuisine actually avoid fried and
heavy fat meals and they mainly steam their foods on this diet. There's also minimally processed foods in the kpop diet. No sugar. K-pop stars
stay away from high sugary beverages, sugary snacks and again it's very heavy
in vegetables. Things like bibimbap that has a lot of variety of vegetables. There's also an emphasis on more chicken and fish and less red meat. Soy-rich food
again like tofu, edamame. So in a nutshell the k-pop diet is pretty similar to how I
would normally eat already which is to have minimally processed foods, a lot of
lean meat, high amount of protein, vegetables and you know I think that if
you also just compare Korean diets to the let's say the Western diets, the
portion sizing is just a lot smaller for Korean diet so perhaps that could be a
reason why you can stay healthy and also portion control and lose
weight on a Korean diet. I think that all diets when taken to an extreme level is
unhealthy for you. Especially when these are diets promoted by your idols, you
want to look like that so you know you have this misconception that this diet
works long-term when as a matter of fact, it probably is only used for instances where they really need to lose a lot of weight for a role in a show or an
appearance or for a photo shoot so yeah, definitely, not a sustainable diet to be
eating so little. Today for lunch I actually got myself a healthy Korean
bowl. I'm just going to fill myself up because if not, I am going to faint and I
have driving after this. I'm not gonna take any risk. I am back from my driving class and that was a pretty intense driving session. I feel as though I
should have eaten a lot more before because I couldn't concentrate and
towards the end I remember feeling very agitated with my driving instructor, okay
granted he is a bit of an irritant. I just wanted to get out of the car so badly
that I left in a rush and I left my wallet in the car so I'm annoyed and a bit emotional and a bit frustrated at myself because I
shouldn't be leaving my stuff around and I was just a bit muddle-headed. Yeah
I'm actually slightly emotional right now, I don't know why. I want to scream, I'm so mad at myself
right now. I'm gonna go and get some food and eat proper food because I'm not just
gonna survive on a protein shake. I'm gonna eat proper food and I think I'm
gonna feel a lot better. So it is day 5 on my k-pop diet. I don't
particularly as energised as usual. I did have an apple for my breakfast because I just wanted to continue the diet so I can give even more feedback, maybe there's
something about eating an apple every morning that is good for overall health
and well-being but I would like to eat something more substantial for breakfast
than just an apple. So I have a driving test right after this. I know for a fact
that I'm not going to starve myself and go there without the clarity of mind so I'm
gonna be eating my egg, oats, all healthy and I think that this is the
correct fuel that I should be eating in order to power me through a very intense
driving test because I want to be sharp. Okay so I've come to the end of day 5 of the Korean diet. I essentially broke my diet today and I don't think that I can last another day
on IU's diet because I was feeling physically weak, really irritable and
kind of brain foggy so overall I think this just goes to show that what you eat
doesn't just affect your appearance and your energy levels, but it also affects
your mood and your mental clarity and I don't think I want to last another day
on this diet, I won't recommend it to anybody and I'm just really glad that is
over. So after trying out this diet, I can completely understand when people start going on these crash diets and they lose this significant amount of weight within
the first week or first few days even, I can imagine how addictive that must be
for them because you know when you start eating less calories, just generally your
body is gonna be purging itself of its water weight, you're gonna feel lighter
obviously, you feel skinnier on your face, you feel skinnier on your body, it's a very
like psychological thing. But at the same time I think that there's a lot of
danger in just following these diets, especially for younger people who are
looking up to these k-pop idols and thinking that you know this is a normal
diet and totally like normalises eating such low calories for all these celebrities
and that can lead to a slippery slope, it can result in many eating disorders and
health issues which I do not want for you. And I want to tell everybody who
looks up to their celebrities and their idols, to you know still practice wisdom
when it comes to dieting. Realise that we don't lead the same lifestyle and for
that reason, it's just not sustainable for you. And in general I'm just a huge
advocate for eating a healthy and balanced diet. We've
done a lot of videos on healthy diet tips and also healthy meals that you can

FdmXWtt1XGs,COVID 19 and Mental Health Responses in South Asia: Opportunities for Learning and Cooperation,UCcMU1Q-vZg0iib44S6ZGzDQ,Sangath India,2020-11-25T09:51:24Z,Webinar on 'COVID 19 and Mental Health Responses in South Asia: Opportunities for Learning and Cooperation' organised jointly by RIS and Sangath along ...,uh uh our friends from south asia would add uh a great value to this endeavor of how countries in the region are coping up with 19 crisis as you know right from march uh 25th onwards continuously ris has been coming out with a lot of literature a lot of seminars largely on economic and trade impact of 19 industrial production financial architecture supply of money and credit volatility the crisis of msmes and many issues we have covered including uh the impact of technology but today uh we have taken an issue which we have never taken before but i think is assuming great great uh importance uh in the larger canvas of health management of course at ris we have a very active program on on health again uh from the perspective of trade and uh and economic development so as a part of that rubric professor tc james and dr uh namrata patak have been leading that work program and i'm very thankful to both of them for supporting and taking it forward but today we have uh also partnered our uh uh today's endeavor with the uh uh sangat and and sangat is an important initiative and i must congratulate dr anand uh for uh having uh initiated this partnership with ris uh sangat as as ananth would inform later uh is a non-government organization not-for-profit organization which has been sort of trying to commit itself for improving health across the communities empowering them and and supporting their various initiatives and programs for the government for strengthening the larger community health initiatives ris has also been focusing on sustainable development goals and from that perspective uh sdg3 is of great significance where professor tc james has been leading our work program and we are also working very closely with ayush uh which is uh sort of bringing in the wholeness to our approach on on health sector in fact uh at the recently held brics meeting ris had proposed uh a wellness index and and those of you who are interested we would be very happy to share our report now where we have suggested to have an alternative after the human development index of wellness index and if wellness index comes in this dimension of holistic approach to our health crisis and health management comes in with some conservative estimates it's very clear that uh whose pandemic uh mental health impact on economies is going to be somewhere close to a one trillion economy and uh and as more and more studies are coming out uh the dimensions are unfolding and i think it requires uh uh greater efforts not only uh by the health professionals but by several of us who are engaged with society and are seeing the impact in terms of how industry is uh is responding how economies are responding and how developing countries can pool their resources expertise together for a comprehensive and very cogent and coherent response to this crisis friends today we are extremely privileged to have uh two very bright minds uh in this area uh professor sheena reddy requires no introduction in such platforms uh he has been a recipient of padma bhushan and has been a key advisor on health sector issues the public health uh foundation the phfi that he has established uh is one of the key actors not only uh in india but for whole of south asia i would say uh where they are bridging this huge gap between what the practitioners face and what policy makers consider and and it's very uh interesting to see the way he has shaped not only national policies and international policies with who but also at the sub-national level with the several states uh with which uh he has been working very closely be that andhra pradesh his own state or urisa uh and punjab delhi government where he is playing an extremely important role and and phfi has done remarkable work in bridging the gap uh not only in south asia but also with africa and his positions in who he has leveraged very well in terms of articulating that two years back we had a great privilege of working with him on food and nutritional dimension of food and it's connected with health so so he is also trying to uh revisit this question in a major way fortunately during the lockdown period uh and and as pandemic was engulfing many countries uh ris and phfi worked together on ras platform of global development center to organize capacity programs for several african countries and several countries participated there so so welcome dr reddy uh uh we are very keenly looking forward uh uh for your uh uh address today uh we are also privileged friends to have uh professor vikram patel uh uh who is a professor at the uh harvard medical school uh he has been one of the uh commentators uh who could connect not only with the academic work that he has been doing but with several organizations across the spectrum and uh and has been very well connected with the world health organizations uh uh he has been uh a co-founder of uh of sangat and and has been uh linked with several international institutions uh across the world uh be that in uk or or u.s or in other parts of the world uh he was listed in times magazine as uh most influential uh top hundred persons in 2015 so congratulations uh professor patel and welcome to this discussion today uh with our friends we have a very packed agenda today and so uh i would uh just request uh without further ado professor srinath for his comments uh and after that uh uh vikram patel the professor sheena d you have the flow sir thank you thank you very much professor chaturvedi it is a pleasure to be always part of the ris platform and we have had the privilege of working with you very closely and sanget also has been a close associate for several years particularly through dr vikram patel's association and i think this particular platform brings in many friends together uh not only from india but elsewhere too to consider one of the biggest public challenges that we will have for the 21st century which has been there but has been neglected in the past well uh in terms of mental health it's very clear that the though the context of this particular webinar is go with 19 and its impact on mental health the the whole area of mental health is a long-standing issue and the challenges have been there for quite some time and very inadequately addressed we do know that mental health disorders contribute to a very high component of the global burden of disease in terms of disability and even suicides add particularly to the deaths as well in very young ages we also know that there are huge economic losses as a result of mental health disorders because of loss of productivity the caretaker time being taken up and multiple other reasons and we do recognize that productivity is also greatly reduced and therefore the nation also tends to lose in terms of its economic growth however despite all this there's been many years of neglect and which has only recently begun to be redressed the health system had turned a blind eye to mental health whether it was millennium development goals or even other other major global declarations and sections of society viewed mental health disorders with deletion and deep stigma family members hate it and individuals did not seek care and suffered in silence and sorrow however in recent years we have seen mental health beginning to get belated attention long overdue and we have seen it initially positioned in the political declaration of non-communicable diseases in 2011 and the indian delegation did have a big role in ensuring that it got inserted along with four other ncds at least in the declaration but in terms of its very clear mention as a global health priority it has featured in the sustainable development goals of 2015 and then in our own national health policy of 2017 mental health has been finally accorded a place of prime importance but then when this was happening and finally we were beginning to get our act together to approach mental health with the seriousness it demands even though the preparations were still inadequate kowitt hijacked the entire health system and we see that many other priorities of health have now been sidelined and we see that mental health is not getting the kind of attention it really requires despite the fact that kovid itself contributes substantially to mental health disorders now we know that the overall determinants include social determinants like poverty and other inequalities though they may not be immediately redressed they have been accentuated by kovit 19 situation among the various stressors which actually contribute to mental health and are particularly evident during the covet 19 period are social isolation job loss income loss because of wage cuts uncertainty about the future about education about employment disruption of social connectivity from family friends colleagues at work and schools or colleges increased alcoholism dramatic rise in domestic violence fear stigma discrimination directed against people suspected as having coveted or their family members or even health care providers who are providing much needed service to people who are suffering with kobe dot are being investigated for it misinformation has been fueling anxiety and fear and we are now seeing that also is affecting the mental health of many people who are unsure as to what is the right information whether to believe the kind of rumors that are floating around or get their mental stability greatly unsettled then you have digital addiction coming up now because people are confined to home there is also online teaching but more than teaching people are now instead of socializing with friends and family are forced now to seek electronic media for their entertainment and that again is becoming a problem which calls for digital detoxification then other addictions are increasing even tobacco people who have given up smoking now under these stressful conditions are going back to taking up tobacco and this has been documented in many countries now but coming to the health system itself services have been interrupted and even the services that were available whether an institutional level or at the community level in particular are no longer dependable because of the kovid 19 taking the primacy of attention supply chain distribution disruptions have also taken place and we see that in terms of essential needs whether it is wood supplies or whether it is even in terms of medical supplies and the supply chain disruptions also add to a lot of anxiety and angst and all of these are certainly not conducive to good mental health so what we do require now is to provide both a very robust health system response as well as a social system response it can't be just on the basis of the health system the health is absolutely critical and the health system must rise to the occasion but the social system also has to be supportive we may not be able to alter all the conditions at once but whatever we can do to provide enough relief and redressal must be certainly addressed so we need to build resilience at the level of the society community family and at the level of the individuals themselves and what we need are systems that can provide strength and support all around to people who are likely to be in distress are likely to be unsettled and we need as i said resilient social systems which can provide that kind of social support to people who need it and certainly try and avoid or erase stigma and discrimination which is a major challenge at the same time we require resilient health systems which can provide efficient equitable and empathetic care and particularly the role of front-line health workers is absolutely important uh right now many of the frontline health workers are battling covert they may not have enough time to attend to some of these issues but if we can build community networks involving the frontline health workers but also getting extensive citizen participation what i would call people partnered public health then we can actually mobilize the community resources not only to aid in the health effort but also to provide the kind of health and social support services that are required for mental health which really do not require very fancy technologies so the importance of frontline health workers is something professor vikram patel has very clearly outlined in his own work but that needs to be reiterated the role of other community participants like self-help groups other opinion makers and local community leaders all of them is going to be absolutely important and since we are in the midst of webinar in this effort with the collaboration of ras which spells out research we must also talk about research there is a definite need for implementation and operational research during this phase to see how best we can mobilize all our resources whether it is the availability of certain degree of uh telecommunication and i.t technologies for providing counselling and care or particularly in terms of how we can actually utilize whatever resources are there in the frontline health workers and the citizenry to provide the kind of care that's required so that kind of an implementation research is also absolutely important and i believe that is an agenda that can be taken up but obviously a global threat like covet 19 calls for a global trust to counter it and that is why solidarity among countries and sharing of knowledge and expertise is absolutely important and having this south asia forum convened under the auspices of the ris is absolutely important and timely and i'm sure that this forum will continue to bring in a lot of experience and expertise and generate a lot of new ideas and new initiatives to address a challenge which is going to remain with us of course this particular initiative is not going to wilt away after kobit 19 fades away this is something that we must utilize to build a much more robust response afterwards where even when kobet goes away as they say building back better in every way our health systems as well as social systems so that mental health no longer remains such a major unaddressed challenge thank you very much thank you thanks a lot uh uh professor srinas reddy for capturing uh in a very insightful manner the various facets of this major challenge that uh societies after societies are are grappling with and i think given the limited public budget in this area you very rightly emphasized on community participation and the role that frontline health workers may play i think you have also very rightly emphasized on how the networks among the southern countries as part of the south south cooperation among the developing countries may strengthen and explore further uh the areas where uh the communities and and particularly the self-help groups that you alluded to but also the think tanks the research institutions those who are working closely with the government may play an important role now i have great pleasure and inviting our professor vikram patel uh for his keynote address professor patel you have the flow uh i don't see the mute sign on your machine but we are not able to hear you professor patel foreign any better we are not able to hear you yeah it's better now okay all right um so i can i share my screen yeah please go ahead uh no i think you'll have to let me you'll have to um give me yeah my webex uh yes yes we are we are doing that so first of all while you're letting me do that i wanted to just thank you uh and it's a real pleasure uh for uh to be actually speaking after professor reddy who i have great respect for and who has mentored me a great deal during my work i am actually going to take over uh take on from exactly where he has left off really talking about the role of frontline workers and that's really the substance of what i want to focus on in my 10 minutes really what is the learnings that we have about the use of frontline workers uh and what could be of great value to the whole region so i want to just start by reminding ourselves that uh professor reddy has spoken a great deal about the impact of kobit 19 on population mental health but the mental health crisis in india was clearly already very grave even before copic 19 in the 2016 government's national mental health survey you can see that whether it was mood and anxiety and trauma related disorders that you call common mental disorders or the psychosis that we call severe mental disorders only about 15 or so of individuals in the country who had a clinically significant condition at the time of the survey had actually sought or received any form of care for their problem and it isn't just the question of receiving care but also uh the questions about the quality of care this is a a very recently published uh uh a data from uh the world mental health surveys that included india that shows that only about six percent of people with depression which is of course the most common mental health condition only six percent of people had actually received uh quality care which means care that was in line with the evidence about what are effective interventions uh to enable people to recover from a particular mental health condition now we often think of supply side barriers as the most important ones in addressing all the different crises of access to good quality care in india and not enough skill human resources but also we should remember very very uh importantly in the case of mental health and also demand side barriers um indeed this was also true for many other health conditions but especially true for demand in the mental health sector because of stigma and i think it's important to locate and understand the nature of the stigma which is that for the vast majority of people in south asia the word mental health is typically seen as being equivalent to the hindi word is bhagal it's the person who is very seriously uh uh ill and is often behaving in a manner that is irrational and so the vast majority of mental health problems that do not in fact demonstrate behavioral changes are not seen as health problems we decide mental health problems and so there are big demand side issues that we should remember because of course across south asia the government's response to mental health problems has been identical to any other health problem very biomedically focused very focused on doctors diagnoses and drugs and this this 3d model is also a major barrier uh to uh improving the the access to quality care now this is not unique to india about 10 years ago the nih released the grand challenges in global mental health which was really a research priority setting exercise i co-chaired this initiative and what was interesting is that the question that was put forward to the world's global mental health practitioners is that what would be the leading research questions that if addressed could impact on reducing the global burden of suffering due to mental health problems and perhaps unsurprisingly the leading questions were the ones that dr professor reddy alluded to it wasn't about discovering a new gene or a new molecule or a new product but it was actually about doing better with the knowledge we already have it was really about implementation science uh to deliver interventions that we already knew worked in a real world setting over the last decade there has been an enormous body of science uh that has been generated from around the world uh which has clearly shown that we can now deliver clinical and preventative interventions in any resource setting it did not make any difference whether we had mental health specialists or not provided you were paying attention to a range of different aspects about the intervention and its delivery that i'll speak about in a moment in india sanghat has been pretty much the pioneer in this area and i'm sure dr bhan will speak a little bit more about sangha but importantly as you can see from this array of different randomized control trials all published in leading journals like the lancet and jama that essentially sanghat has been working across the full range of mental health problems from autism in childhood to the school-based mental health promotion adolescence and a range of mental health conditions all the way through into old age demonstrating that we can reimagine and redefine mental health care in four key ways first the composition of mental health care is being de-medicalized so that clinically effective interventions such as psychological and social interventions are presented in a manner that is acceptable to our communities these interventions can be delivered anywhere but in fact some of the most radical delivery settings have been in patients own homes which is of course also the place where many other chronic uh disease management programs like tb are also being delivered pretty much anyone can deliver mental health care especially our frontline workers and the key here is what i referred to earlier is having very careful design of how these interventions can be uh scaled up through competency-based training and great attention being paid then to supervision to a short quality this evidence is transforming uh mental health both globally and regionally the mental health action plan of the who and the disease control priorities program of the world bank has have embraced this idea of of employing community-based providers uh to deliver mental health care and importantly in india the national mental health policy and also the mental health care act now clearly speak uh to the scaling up of this very exciting implementation science knowledge to actually improve access to care across the region how do we actually do that so i want to end by telling you a little bit about uh what sanghat is doing in partnership with harvard medical school to transfer this this knowledge which is really largely based on randomized control trial so that we can empower as it were the entire workforce in india and across the region to rapidly be skilled up to deliver these interventions at scale and here we are deploying the power of the digital technology for learning mastering and delivering quality assured psychological treatments thanks to support from the welcome trust and we have already we had designed a number of different treatments which i've already referred to earlier importantly from a regional perspective some of these treatments have been trialled concurrently in other south asian countries for example this treatment which is uh on for the treatment of depression it's a six session treatment delivered in routine care settings has also been independently evaluated in a randomized control trial in nepal we also have a treatment for maternal depression called the thinking healthy program that was originally designed and tested in pakistan and now we've concurrently shown its effectiveness with peer supported delivery in india as well so there's already a lot of regional learning and sharing that is happening but for now in the empire program we have started with this depression treatment and thanks to the nih's support term with the essence program in madhya pradesh we have systematically transferred the entire curriculum and the learning tools from being a workshop based model which is a traditional model for training frontline workers into a fully digitized model with remote coaching and here you can see a screenshot of the app that some others develop has developed and currently we are doing a randomized control trial with the government of madhya pradesh where we are testing two different ways of delivering the digital training with and without coaching against the gold standard of the uh face-to-face workshop uh with ashraes and we've almost completed the recruitment of nearly 350 asha's who will take part in this trial we are now incredibly taking the same treatment and this is important to say about the innovations that are coming from our region this particular succession treatment which is the shortest psychological treatment for depression on record is now being adapted for delivery in the wealthiest country of the world which is the us and concurrently with the rollout in madhya pradesh we also have support from the tara trust to enable this to happen it is also being rolled out with support from philanthropists in the us so i think maybe for the first time uh an innovative new treatment program uh which was developed in south asia is now being delivered with adaptation uh in the us and indeed also in canada we're also as dr reddy rightly pointed out trying to develop new curricula for frontline workers who are engaged in the corporate 19 response uh to really empower them with the skills for basic psychosocial care in the communities that they are serving so in doing so what we're really doing with empower is moving from naive learners enabling naive learners like ashras to complete online learning to become competent learners then with case-based learning to master the deliver of the intervention so that they can ultimately become experts this i believe is the only way that the rising demand due to forward can actually be addressed the current system is not just a limited supply but also the demand side barriers will was already inadequate even before corvid it will be completely inadequate uh thanks to kobe what we really do need is an empire based model so that we can dramatically increase the numbers of people whom we can help this is my last slide i just wanted to say that i think kobit 19 is a real portal into the failures of our healthcare system i don't need to say much more about that we it is self-evident and it's a real historic opportunity for us to invest both in universal health coverage and within that uh in mental health as a core component of universal health coverage but it's important to also say that while we need more money and that's of course goes without saying we also need to spend it wisely we must be guided by the best science and that means embracing the diversity of experiences and strategies which were thank you thank you thanks a lot uh professor patel uh this was very insightful very i'm sure has set the context for our regional dialogue i would now request my colleague uh dr namita patak to take over introduce dr anand bhan and we move on with the panel discussion uh over to you now thank you sir and thank you professor patel for those insightful comments we'll move on to the panel discussion now and to be moderated by dr bhan who needs no introduction but let me just briefly introduce you to him he is a physician with masters in the university of toronto he is a researcher in global health bioethics and health policy he is also the adjunct professor yanipoya bangalore and agent faculty asturba medical college manipal anand is immediate past president international association of bioethics and his work is focused on ethics and equity in health mental health digital health public health ethics research ethics community engagement ethics training for professionals over to you uh dr anand let's begin thank you so much let me add my um you know words of welcome on behalf of sangat to all the participants of this webinar we are obviously delighted to be partnering with ris for today's webinar with the regional focus on south asia uh just very quickly sangat for those of you who might not know the organization is just entered its 25th year of existence it's an ngo a not-for-profit committed to improving health across the lifespan by empowering existing community resources to provide appropriate physical psychological and social therapies and our focus primarily is around child development adolescent and youth health as well as mental health and chronic disease specifically this webinar is also being conducted through our essence project which is funded by the us nimh as a component of which we do capacity building work and also partner with the organizations like ris to push the agenda for mental health in the region so thank you so much again uh for the plan for now now is actually to go through a panel as you'll see we have uh you know convened panelists from the south asian region who are a mix of academics researchers policy makers service users community based organization representatives as well as providers and what we are hoping they will do is provide unique perspectives based on their expertise um on this question of what are the challenges for mental health in the region which exists especially in the context of covert 19 what are some of the best practices they are seeing in their own context and what are the ways forward so what we have requested all our panelists to do is to take five minutes each as introductory remarks and highlight uh their unique perspective on this topic and then depending on the time remaining we might do a second round of directed questions at the panelists so uh rather than introduce everyone together what i'll do is i'll go sequentially introduce uh the speaker and then let the let him or her speak and then towards the end we will have a round of discussion as well as q a so our first speaker um is dr rahula amin dr ola is a medical doctor who's trained as a psychiatrist also as a psychologist he is based in afghanistan has taught in the american university of afghanistan and kabul university and serves as the country director for the american institute of afghanistan studies he has developed a guidebook for trauma counselors and civil society organizations and has been conducting field research on group psychology and social psychology of intractable conflict with primary focus on afghan diaspora in germany welcome dr rahula and look forward to your questions so and comments with regards to our topic five minutes please thank you over to you um thank you very much for this opportunity this is a really unique opportunity that i really appreciate and i am looking forward to learning from other colleagues as well uh what i can share from the afghanistan side is that um kobet 19 in afghanistan was like uh the best way to describe it is another version of suffering in addition to what going on in there so as you know security is something that captures everybody's attention much more than everything else uh in kabul and other provinces and cities uh in afghanistan and um the covet 19 uh pandemic uh if i may call it a pandemic what it did actually is that it added to the problems that already existed in the society in the system and and already exhausted uh uh system and public health system had to deal with something that uh it wasn't prepared for in any way shape or form and what they could do the uh first of all uh it wasn't easy to really um recognize what kobe 19 was because of a lot of other health uh conditions that due to pollution due to the uh the weather change and a lot of other circumstances a lot of people had the kind of complaints that were easily mistaken with what uh copit19 should present so uh i would say there was a sense of panic at the beginning uh but also a sense of despair that really was from the cases that at least i was working with and some of the ones that other colleagues all over the country uh psychosocial counselors and psychotherapists and medical doctors actually reported but what happened is that the first thing that the ministry of public health could do was uh to work on education on let's say psycho education or led and health education about covet 19 of what it looks like how it should feel like and what should be done and the public health system developed guidelines and instructions in several languages in audio form video but also text form due to the very low level of literacy a lot of the messages should have been prepared in terms of the audio and video format so a lot of the radio channels and tv channels and other mediums were used to to uh to communicate these messages to the public and one of the platforms that was supposed to be used for this education or health education of the public was mosques because everybody was gathering in the mosque the first priority was to prevent these big gatherings but also use mosques as a platform to inform people but uh there was one uh other issue added to the problem that a lot of the mosques and religious leaders um did not actually believe in in in the health crisis of covet 19 there was a lot of conspiracy theories going around and those conspiracy theories uh were kind of um i would say expanding on different levels particularly among those who were more closer to some of the religious circles that would continue these friday prayers and gatherings and even expanded their gatherings to a very very interesting level and seeing uh the covet 19 uh what they call it propaganda as as a foreign stigmatized kind of uh another way of torturing and abusing the population and that did increase uh the number of the infections uh in the country but uh maybe a few things that i can report from the afghanistan side is that the number of the cases that were recorded as infections were really high so the number of infections were really high but the mortality mortality rate was really low and a lot of the public health professionals were asking why is that uh is it about the reporting uh is it that the data is not really accurate to the way it should be but we don't have these data doesn't match or is it some other way of understanding that is there some sort of resilience uh in the country that we don't know about uh a lot of speculations was made because that there was the bcg for example uh vaccine is something that is very uh much used in the country of course because um tuberculosis is not uh totally eradicated at least in some of our countries so some people thought that maybe it's bcg vaccination that creates some sort of defense for the corona virus and other speculations were going on as well on the other hand one other problem was the stigma of corona infection that a lot of the families and people did not actually want to report corona infections and it was seen as something that in the very early days or maybe several centuries ago like leprosy was seen as them as a very stigmatized uh health condition that the patients were supposed to be isolated and and treated a certain way like some of the mental health issues that are treated with the same uh kind of attitude uh and these uh the stigmatized notions actually forced people that even if there were deaths as a result of corona uh uh vaccination grown up virus they would not report it or they reported uh uh as another problem as a heart attack or someone died as a result of the heart attack because they didn't want the funerals to be empty or nobody would participate and burying a loved one and a lot of the ceremonies like eid and naurus and a lot of other happy holidays uh were uh really hindered but also there were families who really went on and celebrated as much as they could so and medical doctors started to uh not i can't say misdiagnosed but a lot of the medical doctors started to label uh coronavirus uh symptoms as uh something else so some give the broccolisis for example diagnosis for corona patients and some give other types of diagnosis for patients that maybe in one hand that stop people from panicking but on the other hand medical doctors did advise them to give them all the instructions that a corona patient should have uh but also in addition to some medications but uh in afghanistan at least the budget for the public health is is a very uh small portion of the overall uh annual budget of the government it's about five percent and the budget for the mental health services is even a much smaller portion of the public health uh budget so in terms of uh the capacity uh there wasn't a lot that uh could have been done but despite that fact there was a lot of hospitals activated a lot of the tests were delivered uh mostly by the public hospitals but later on the capability was transferred to the uh private hospitals and clinics to deliver the tests i would say what happened actually in afghanistan the way corona pandemic was was perceived was that there were hierarchies of pain and suffering that people would calculate every day that oh there were lots of ways of dying here bombs or one suicide bombers or another one rockets or another one and disease is another one and there were lots of people who whose lives and families lives depended on them getting out and doing something for work and getting back home with some income or food for their sustenance which was why a lot of people could not actually take corona pandemic seriously uh they were for for uh a month and a half uh there were restrictions on movement uh imposed but it didn't work that much because the government needed a lot of movements but also people move and then about two months later schools were opened again but um yes i would say there is there has been a lot of uh things that we learned in afghanistan that first the data collection system uh was not what we wanted it to be so our data collection that connect between all the uh essential and profession uh provincial uh uh health services uh uh needed to be uh improving and there was a lot of support coming from the outside from the national agencies but also about i think it was seventy thousand dollars uh what the government could afford to uh to allocate to uh fight coronavirus and help families uh with some food and other kind of immediate needs uh so that they will uh stay home yeah in the interest of time so that we can get through all the families i i'm done um yeah the main big picture is that uh there was uh this calculation maybe is an interesting thing that might be very different comparing to other countries in the south asia that the calculation of pain and the hierarchy of suffering was something that was unique in afghanistan at least that people were dealing with a lot of other uh types of issues uh despite the fact that uh corona was also one of the priorities that that was introduced to their lives um yeah that's it thank you thank you so much dr amin that was i mean obviously it's it's difficult as it is in in situations where there is conflict and you are a point about the hierarchy of pain and suffering obviously it drives through the importance of looking at these issues besides the issues of stigma and infertility that you talked about thank you so much for your comments our next speaker is mr mahathir mohammad khamruzman who is a senior research associate at the center for policy research at dhaka bangladesh and is also a global fellow at the watson institute for international and public affairs in brown university in the us um he also holds a master's degree in public policy from the national university of singapore and has been a policy analyst and economist who's been working with think tanks international governments and public health institutions um mr kamuru zaman over to you for your insights around how carbon 19 and mental health have been impacted in bangladesh specifically we're not able to hear you i think it's still muted can you try speaking now and see if it works unfortunately i don't think we can hear you still uh just in the interest of time maybe i'll just uh go to the next speaker and we can come back to you um and someone from the tech team at ris will reach out to you to try to figure out if we can do some problem solving there um sorry about this but you know these tech issues happen sometimes with webinars uh if i can request professor prashad the sharma from uh is the professor and head of the department of psychiatry at the kist medical college at lalitpur in nepal to kindly speak next professor sharma has done his md in psychiatry from the pgimr in chandigarh and he's uh being attached with various national and international psychiatric and social organizations and has published more than 30 research papers um in national and international journals professor sharma we look forward to hearing from you about how the situation is in nepal and its impact over to you sir thank you uh there is some problem with the internet we can hear you now sir please go ahead can you hear can you hear me yes we can hear you professor sharma please go ahead hello thank you ris and sangat for having this program organized also having me in your program like in most of the south is also fighting the pandemic and the impact you see a widespread disruption of the mental health network system that was so inadequate even before the pandemic that you know has put pressure on the different uh markets in the community and that we have to face a lot of time in mitigating this family like the response of the time from the beginning of the pandemic we plenty of anxiety symptoms plenty of depression and uh also there has there are some some uh data that maybe suggests that there's a suicide rate has also gone up but that is that data has to be analyzed adequately before we come to a conclusion i would like to write you know major problem in delivering uh mental health facilities in in nepal is that this mental health has never been a priority in in policy and that it always had a very poor resource allocation but this pandemic has sent a wake-up call to the policy makers and policymakers are now responding if not adequately but at least started responding that this mental health problem has to be addressed and if not then society has to pay heavily for this and that the burden of care will increase by many folds so government has taken some initiatives and also the other non-governmental organizations also have started taking initiatives the there are the problem rate in in delivering mental health services that first is of course i have mentioned about the poor resource allocation that i hope will increase in in in course of time that a policy maker will realize and that they will start allocating advocate budgets adequate resources to the mental health need one another point that has been mentioned by the previous speakers also about the stigma stigma not only has you know is a major barrier in delivering mental health in in nepal also to the realization of existing mental health services by and that we have to fight this major barrier in delivering uh mental health um mental health network with the mental system in nepal apart from these as you know nepal is a country which is relied only on the employments that the tourism has gone totally uh down for the last uh eight nine months when this pandemic started and there is a lot of unemployment you know due to this the problem in tourism you know so the hotels are closing restaurants are closing so the they don't need manpower so this unemployment is really really increasing the mental health problems of the community of the society and that that what we need to do that is that what uh still told that that only the biomedical but also to train make stable uh health workers adequately in giving psychological firsthand or mental health gap so that in even in a remote areas where we don't have adequate number of mental health workers they can give at least psychological first aid and do basic counseling so that i do and i think there are so many things that we can mention it's just a very little time um to to talk about all these mental health issues in in in this country and of course one more thing that has you know taught us um learned from the uh the big object and his material response of course it was in a very limited geographical area but that has really uh taught us how to you know address the uh the post-disaster mental health problem in the community so main area is that we have to teach the community how to cope and how to be resilient i think my time is over thank you very much thank you so much professor sharma for highlighting issues around shortage of budgets the fact that there is often a poor utilization linked to the fact that there is stigma especially around mental health access and the fact that while communities are often impacted negatively it can also be that we can work with communities for um enabling response and appreciate all of your comments if we can move on to uh now our panelists from sri lanka miss suny mali madhura who is a research economist at the institute of policy studies in colombo sri lanka suni mali holds a ba from the university of colombo sri lanka and has over 15 years of research in the year of economics gender and population studies and has been a consultant to multiple bilateral and multilateral agencies as well as private foundations over to you uh suny moly and we look forward to hearing from you on how the pandemic has been impacting sri lanka and the response uh good evening all of you and thank you dr anna can you hear me yes we are able to hear you please go ahead can you hear me yes we can hear you please go ahead first uh let me share my thoughts um on kobe 19 uh impact on mental health uh as highlight yeah okay let first first let me share my thoughts on copied 19 impact on mental health as highlighted by the other colleagues of the panel the pandemic has affected every aspect of our day-to-day life because of the quality 19 preventive and controlling measures such as social distancing lockdowns quarantine curfews and restrictions in mobility people are compelled to adjust their lifestyle according to the new normal economic activities social activities and religious activities are badly affected and they are restricted mostly and most importantly because of these conditions and restrictions mental health of the people is severely affected the scale of lockdowns and other controlling measures around the world is unprecedent that is why the issue of mental health is important people suffer immensely from the loss of employment the death of lots of family members and friends and other community members the physical effects of infection and the mental trauma and fear and accessing mental health services during pandemic situation and prevailing stigma on mental health issues in general and as well as stigma on infection of the virus are some of the major challenges related to mental health under this pandemic situation now let me give a brief introduction on mental health status in sri lanka sri lanka provides free health care through the government system to its entire population that is nearly uh 21.3 million so uh sri lanka has made a commendable progress in achieving most of the health indicators in recent past in fact sri lanka has been regarded as a model country for many decades in terms of high quality population health outcomes with relatively lower investment in health but despite these remarkable success successes in achieving general health indicators we could see that the attention to mental health of the population and the mental health system was not so impressive in the country it is said that the condition in the mental hospital in the country were among the worst in the world and there were virtually no community mental health services in most parts of the country and also mental health care in sri lanka was affected by lack of funding scarcity of trained mental health professionals over reliance of tertiary level hospitals and limited mental health resources outside of the urban areas uh because of this uh suicide depression substance abuse gender-based violence and the breakdown of social structures and family units continued recording as major mental health issues in the country and this status was uh worsened by two major incidences that is one is the 30 years of con conflict in the country that ended in 2009 which uh that had a significant impact on mental health of the people in sri lanka and also the country was also devastated with massive loss of life and population displacement by the indian ocean tsunami in 2004 however we can notice some progressive developments in the improving mental health of the country in recent years and uh some of those uh developments are like a high level of political commitments commitment towards improving mental health in the country which is uh especially after the tsunami that the country has experienced there was an increased political commitment to prior prioritize mental health services in sri lanka and also uh in 2005 uh the mental health policy of sri lanka was approved and the policy introduced a decentralized and community based system of mental health care and also the policy introduced major changes in the into the organization of mental health services by moving away from institutionalized mental health care towards ki at the community level and also in recent years we could see more allocation going for development of mental health infrastructure of the country and there are some programs going on like uh recruiting the community support officers mainly in the tsunami affected areas and also uh uh improving the uh quality of the healthcare workforce who are working on the mental health health those are some recent initiatives uh in improving mental health of the status of the country and uh with these changes i would say that the country is more focused on developing the mental health status of its population uh however the pandemic situation has definitely placed a huge burden on the mental health uh status and the system of the country and it would be really challenging uh for the system uh in like facing uh those issues thank you thank you uh so much uh miss sunimali um if i can now do that to a panelist from bangladesh uh mr mohammed khambooz i think his audio and video are working now uh so that he can make his comments so what do you mean i hope you can hear me yes we can hear you please thank you um so thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute in this discussion and thank you ris for organizing this important and much more discussion on mental health so i'll start by i'll start by uh sharing some country experience from bangladesh so um from a 2040 study uh there we see that there's a prevalence of mental illness in bangladesh uh among adults which is in the range six to six percent to 31 and among children it's around 13 to 23 percent um now because of the kovid 19 pandemic it has brought enormous psychological stress on people from all walks of life in that regard uh it is likely that it has uh worsened the situation for example an online survey in bangladesh has found that almost uh 84 of pregnant women and 74 percent of in mothers of infants respectively were found to be suffering from the severe psycho social impact of stress um in this regard like there have been steps taken by both the government and non-state actors but it has been on a limited scale for example the government of bangladesh has uh come up with a guideline for addressing mental health during the kofi 29 situation which uh it kind of recommends uh use of psychotropics uh for mental health for covid19 and also management of mental health issues in icing patients with covenanting and also online telepsychiatry and telecounseling survey from the mental health professionals to prevent and but out of burnout among healthcare providers in that figured uh healthcare providers around bangladesh have received uh mental support uh mental health support to cope with kobe 19 and it was uh uh in it was with support from unfpa several ngos and uh private institutions are also providing telecounseling uh a helpline in bangladesh but these remain in a very small scale now in terms of the regional experience uh uh yeah we can see that like the share of health expenditure in gdp in the south asian region has been around two percent on average in most countries in the uh and since like the health care services are provided in a very urban set in in the urban centers 80 to 90 percent of the population usually don't have access to treatment and lack of service skill service providers is also another issue as it was mentioned earlier so uh in this regard i want the need for integrating or using primary healthcare providers in providing treatment for mental health services now this kind of projects have been implemented in many countries including nigeria chile brazil iran and india as well uh and those have given some sort of uh they have given you know positive outcomes and under these projects general practitioner physicians of primary physicians trained medical officers nurses and the treatment and patients also receive uh support from their family as well so this is more of a community approach and they also received the service from primary health sector as well and as it was mentioned earlier as well lay health workers are community health workers important in this regard um like there has been one project in jammu kashmir in india where health workers were trying to identify critical mental disorders based on uh world organization identified criterias and they they were pretty much they did pretty well in communicating on a weekly basis with patients using uh cell phones as well as uh accessing them using uh digital technologies such as notebooks um in bangladesh as well there's a bragg the largest engine in the world is also running a humanitarian play lab in the rohingya refugee camps uh that you you're aware that almost a million rohingyas are being hosted in bangladesh so this human play labs actually provide learning and healing to play to the traumatized children and the mothers of infants as well receive some sort of psychosocial counseling as well so these are some some projects like which can be scaled up in some way through for furthering uh by you know more finances are with a little more evidence as well uh in terms of building awareness it is really important that uh mental health is kind of sensitized in the region now many speakers have previously identified that yeah there's a huge stigma around mental health in these issues uh so in that figure going to the communities and you know those and using the community leaders particularly the religious leaders uh or the particle leaders in those areas to sensitize people would be really important and most importantly it has you need a lot of social marketing in that regard for example uh there are many successful cases from western countries as well where it has worked so we can kind of like you know replicate those and tweak them uh uh by introducing or you know uh by integrating the local knowledge as well or what can work and how it can work so all those issues can be you know can work in the region um figured in conclusion i want to highlight that all this needs to be done by sharing the best practices across the region so i uh think tanks and other research organizations should come together and highlight like what has worked and how it can work most importantly one of the things that has been lack of finance now i think one area where we can work is like you know the climate fund that is lying there so in in this figure we have to be a bit more innovative while using the fund what the problem with that fund is that you can't get fund unless uh you can connect it with climate uh change now there are hundreds of research lying around which shows that um climate change actually causes certain sort of natural diseases and other issues are coming up for example flood or you know loss of field which causes a lot of mental stress now even if you are currently in the kovit 19 pandemic the next thing that we need to worry about as well which is kind of ongoing as well as the climate change issue and that thing also has a lot of consequences a lot of research shows that the potential for huge economic losses and this will have a lot of mental health impact as well so in that regard this region as a whole needs to come together to identify certain projects and connect them with the climate change issue so that those can be implemented implemented throughout the region and in that trigger consortiums can be built you know like uh let's say like uh uh ngos or other development firms from india bangladesh and pakistan works together to solve this issue or implement certain projects which can help in this regard the second thing is like you know use use of uh digital technologies particularly the use of phones and other digital technologies to provide some healthcare services to remote communities where where it is very difficult to send down doctors or other other other healthcare practitioners so this can be really useful most importantly we need to incentivize frugal innovations so that those remote communities and research constituent communities can be reached uh with the low amount of resources and with high impact projects and i will i would like to conclude uh by quoting one researcher who has mentioned that the major hurdle in providing mental health care to the community seems to lie not in the past but in the mind so we have to be very clever and very innovative in terms of you know coming up with projects so that we can cater to the needs of the mentally those who need a lot of mental support and mental health care thank you thank you so much uh muhammad and for highlighting the role of digital technologies but also the challenges around financing and where some of that innovation can lie and hopefully it's for emerging scholars and leaders young leaders like you and suny mali to hopefully bring about that change in the region by pushing our governments to spend more on health and specifically also on mental health uh thank you for your intervention uh we can we now move on to our next speaker professor surinder jaswal uh who is the deputy director at the data institute of social sciences in mumbai where she is also the professor at the center for health and mental health at the school of social work and the dean of uh research and development professor jeff holds a doctorate in public health from the london school of health and tropical medicine and has been for many years working across public health and mental health with a focus on health iniquity women's and disaster and social work education uh thank you so much for joining us professor jaswal and over to you yes we can hear you yes at the outset i would like to thank the organizers uh professor vedi particularly dr patrick for initiating this because i think it's really really needed it was very good to hear dr reddy and dr vikram patel lay out the landscape with regard to the mental health impact of 19 and i think my preceding speakers have also highlighted very well what has been the impact across the region and i would like to say that the impact has not been very different given that you know our region's our region is quite similar in the interest of time what i'm going to try and do instead of repeating things which have already been said uh i'm going to try and uh present a couple of brief not case studies but best practices which my university has initiated and through them highlight the gaps as well as the way forward um the tata institute of social sciences where i work is a research teaching research university which also believes in social change and we have a large number of field action projects and i'm going to share with you all uh two initiatives of which we call the field action projects one which is through this for women and girls which addresses domestic violence since 1984. these are situated in the police cell so that women can come and just come and report the violence that they have been facing over a period of time well when we looked at the data set in 2019 of women who were reporting domestic violence um in april may and june and we compared it to a similar uh period in 2020 when the pandemic and the lockdown was imposed when the pandemic happened in the lockdown was imposed we find that there was around 40 14 increase in the reporting of violence by women even though uh in 2019 face-to-face reporting took place and during 2020 it was uh online or helplines which were used but what is interesting here in something that we all need to note is that besides the 14 increase of were able to access some form of help in order to uh report through a helpline most of them spoke about the fact that please give me rash give me food tell me how do i step out what do i do in order to get some time and space for myself i'm not reporting only about violence but they were talking about various correlates of violence which were impacting their mental health as well as other structural issues which uh the family was facing and which in turn was cascading onto the women the second one i want to share is about a helpline that the institute runs the university runs called icon we have a helpline which was initiated a few years ago for young people particularly young people who needed information or who were calling in to report sent on in order to prevent the increasing suicides that one found in academics and related areas and we added to the helplines because we realized that the number of calls that were coming in on the regular helpline had increased to over 2 000 per month over 1500 emails and 500 chats were being reported uh by regular callers when we introduced a second forward-specific helpline we found that genuine poet-related calls were over 600 a month and here again we found that the people who called in according to report certain symptoms related to mental health but they brought other attention to the fact that they were facing a loss of livelihood they've had anxiety due to education being disrupted fragmented due to other medical and so on and ask for help in those areas and not necessarily the symptoms that they were facing this forced our team to look at not only the emotional ramifications which the clients or the people or the population that was using the helpline for calling in for which were resulting in the emotional ramifications during the pandemic we also realized that cold reference merely referring the person to another group which would provide the required service was not being was not proving to be useful and what was required was active follow-up a facilitative process by which people who were calling in for mental health needs also received services in the areas that they were calling him for the third helpline was initiated by the institute because we realized the need for a dedicated helpline for frontline workers and all of us know that the frontline workers lives were mirroring that of their clients their patients with regard to mental health issues large number of them talked about burnout issues stigma discrimination etc so if you uh see the uh increase in the kind of service that was provided which was in response to the gap that the health system was facing we had a regular helpline which was being over subscribed in a way a perfect specific one where people were calling in for structural uh help besides the mental health issues and a frontline workers dedicated helpline where which was also inundated with calls a fourth one which was uh initiated in response to a gap that was identified was for consultations and here it was felt that governments and other groups needed supporting starting services they identified gaps that were overwhelmed systems were overwhelmed with regular care as well as responding to the changing need during the different phases of the pandemic so providing consultation to the two systems as well as helping them to update data on websites for example of governance and so on became one of the key areas in which we integrate another one which i would like to talk about is the capacity enhancement where mental health professionals who have been working in peace time now needed to move to price's time and upscale their capabilities in order to be able to respond adequately so this capacity building or capacity enhancement helpline was initiated to train mental health professionals government professionals ngos non-governmental organizations who wanted help as well as private organizations on self-harm community care etc and upskilling so what we find is that in our own journey through this uh there are 33 field action projects that the institute intervenes with and we have uh you know kind of best practices from each of them but i've decided to stick to two for the moment in order to highlight some of the key issues that this throws up um what we do is that the concept of mental disorders mental illness moved from mental disorders to mental health to psychosocial care and support which recognized that in diver in countries like ours where you have a very diverse population many a time people face stigma and exclusion because of identity based exclusions so it's not just stigma and discrimination because the person is having mental health but also the the person per se who is that person where does that person live etcetera etcetera also colors the way we respond and whether the person can even access services so from psychosocial care and support to what professor chaturvedi said earlier i think we need to move to a more integrated intersectoral response which is well-being and wellness based where we recognize intersectionalities where we recognize structural inadequacies we recognize the cause of stigma discrimination etc a lot more that i want to say because this is one of my favorite subjects i can see looking give me half a minute only so i want to say that in 1992 when the world development report for the first time talked about the burden of disease and brought focus to mental health as against only physical health number of my colleagues from the field of psychiatry always complain that mental health has always been the other brother or sister or the step brother and sister i think this time during the pandemic during four week 19 unlike disasters and unlike early pandemic such as hiv aids and so on it is helping us to visibilize the core relates which are important for us to center stage mental health and to truly own what i call public mental health to remove mental health from facilities from only acute response to only chronic response to a far more ongoing response to the needs that people face and which is not related only to organic factors but to the way people live and how people are pushed to live there's a lot more that we need to talk about but i will stop here thank you on thank you uh so much professor jaspal for uh you know bringing focus to some of the data from all the work that the iss has been doing as well as your own perspectives around how we can enlarge some of these conversations and look forward in terms of you know reforming the way we address mental health and the development this course very much appreciated uh if i can now invite dr ishwar uh bhasava ready to go next uh doctor basi is the director of the muraji the science national institute of yoga in new delhi also masters degree in physics and a phd in yoga philosophy and has for many years been working in the area of yoga education training therapy and research and has also been working with ris and traditional medicine and the role of yoga um over to you uh professor dr richard please namaste namaste doctor anand and other my colleagues uh i'm very much delighted to know the uh different uh aspects and especially the inaugural address and uh professor vikram patel has come up with many wider dimensions uh his keynote address and i'm very much delighted to know the data is given by my colleagues from different countries just to inform uh i am the director of uh premier yoga institution of government of india and also the advisor naturopathy to and on that basis i would like to emphasize and initiate you taken by ministry of ish which is uh we have two systems in india one is uh health and family welfare uh where modern medical system is there in the place different parts of the country and we have eye system uh where more than eight lakh registered practitioners and yoga naturopathy uh practitioners are also there who are not registered yet so with this wide range of these things we have a well health care delivery system and now i'm particularly belong to minister of five which has taken several initiative just i will point out three four then i particularly i emphasize on what the initiative has taken by the ministry and my institution uh exclusively on yoga and uh in the present pandemic condition on mental health what was what is our in all seven system we have released a uh model uh protocols for the kovid conditions uh in yoga also we have a uh three types of protocols one for the entire population where for the wellness for the prevention and overcome the stress and anxiety and also to for the maintenance of mental health we have a 45 minutes of very designed established with premier institutions like demands and other institutions and on the basis of that we have come up with a 45 minutes uh yoga protocol for the federal population and uh with giving the whistleblower this is one is my institution particularly has taken up a research projects only healthcare workers who are coming in contact with the first-hand contact with the kuvit patients the doctors nursing staff and safai karmacharis and others who are coming in contact with the uh patients i will elaborate on that the third one is directly we are teaching to the kovit patients code page itself in delhi has got more than 8 000 code patients uh both at the kovitz centers and also home quarantine and in the beginning in the month of three months of lockdown we have trained online more than a 3.5 or 3.75 lakh people through online and this is one institution in india there are more than 25 30 many leading over institutions like yo peter art of living yes there are many leading organizations all the yoga institutions are conducting yogasana classes pranayama meditation relaxation etc and there are huge number of millions of people so uh we are collecting the data millions of people have been benefited and there was this is one of the important thing which will help us to develop the immunity the second most important thing i would like to tell you one pilot project now we are going for the multicentric studies that is on the studies uh on the type of effect of pranayama and positivity rate in people exposed to it patients and also effect mental health that is stress and quality of life we have come up with uh it is a 125 controlled and 125 experimental group for your information now this is a protocol of 45 30 minutes in the morning well designed five pranayama practices and meditation guided meditation and in the evening time we prefer some four breathing practices and also relaxation 15 minutes total 45 minutes in a day for 28 days and it's a very uh three months i personally practiced it experimented then we have advocated in the month of august september so very interestingly out of the uh control group to nine have got uh kovid positive and in the entire experimental group one person only has got a quit but uh that goal is also not practicing the yoga regularly uh that is one important thing i would like to emphasize that means particularly in my opinion the pranayama will regenerate and evening breathing and relaxation technique will reduce the carbon dioxide concentration and also help in a better sleep quality of sleep which will help to improve the immunity then most important uh quality of life uh the scores of if i pick a separate separated in all four dimensions physical psychological social and environment both in experiment experimental group and highly we got a very highly significant increase in the physical and psychological quality of life scores in the experimental group compared to the control group so elaborate to uh elaborated the number of individuals showed their antibody test was also i have vegas and most importantly the well-being index mental health well-being in the experimental and control groups before and after administration of the yoga model which showed small increase in the positive mental health scores in x-men compared to control so that means that means where we want to mental scores in experimental group so most importantly we are now in consultation with uh mental health experts so we are revising our protocol a little bit emphasizing on the some of the postures which will help for the better breathing and also help for the uh very good meditation for 10 minutes so with that one definitely we are going to have a better results on the mental health well-being index and also quality of index so what we'd like to say so yoga particularly the pranayama and that is also ratio based so the inhalation retention and exhalations and there is a particular ratio i will uh if uh member people want i will share the details suppose what we developed and for these things and thousands of people are now being practiced and they have been benefited we got very very encouraging words who are practicing this so as you know that whenever we do half an hour proper yoga practice it brings down the sympathetic activities and also stimulate the parasympathetic then this sympathetic and the sympathetic balance will helps in the many way of the health parameters so this is the another research we are doing it and definitely would like to share then third most important we are the who cc collaborative center uh in traditional medicine yoga and this is the second term and this is the only one yoga uh based cc and we have come up with six protocol and now we come up with a uh yoga for well being uh map map we have prepared and within two months uh a few weeks it's released by the who and a lot of work during last eight months we worked out then apart from this uh our ministry has done a lot of work with we have a move with the department of biotechnology and csir and uh a pre uh clinical studies has been on the covet interventions so four oral interventions has been developed by ministry of that means uh it's not only the yoga breathing pranayama and etc um ayurveda interventions and there is a high power committee uh headed by one of the chief scientists none other than the nithya yog sorry doctor park and he's also the one of the member my secretary is also a technical person is guiding from the front and lot many works are going on uh to integrate uh ish intervention with a modern medical which definitely help bringing the quality of you know change life and wellness index and mental health status is going to be changed so with this if my uh other panelists he is ready i am ready to share the protocol developed by our institute particularly on pranayama and relaxation techniques very high standard videos we have prepared and results also i have not put up in the presentation but i am ready to share my research papers which are going to be published and also i show interventions in the management of quit which are very cost different with these things uh in the days to come only one message i would like to say this is integrative medicine is the future therefore particularly yoga yoga means it's not only physical exercises it has majorly four component ones it detoxification practices so the second one is the body alignment to asana breathing mechanism management of breathing with pranayama and mind and emotional management through meditation and relaxation techniques so they are well defined and established there are more than 10 000 research papers published in peer-reviewed index journals during last more than three decades so with the online basis we have developed a very well developed protocols which are going to be published by w in the near future and we are ready to share it and yoga is going to play a private role in the management of mental illness or mental health and maintaining the mental health in the pandemic conditions thank you very much for the opportunities so i am open for it discussions at the end thank you very much thank you so much uh dr bhasava reddy uh you know very interesting to know about all of the initiatives which are happening from both head and look forward to seeing some of that evidence being published soon thank you for your input if i could now move to our next speaker is a unique panelist because she's not a policy maker as uh iris officer and indian revenue service officer you know she's also one of the directors but the mental health services thank you so much for joining a very good evening to all esteemed panelists and i hope i am clearly audible to everyone there so first of all thank you very much for having me on the panel today and after hearing uh the panelists who spoke before me who spoke so beautifully on all the aspects of data um as dr bhan said i am a survivor of depression and i have anxiety disorder i live with it i also have attention deficit disorder and i am that person with mental illness that person with psychosocial disability that we have been all talking about and hence what i would like to do is move a little down from the bird's eye view of policy making that we have been talking about so far and uh focus on the individual the person with mental illness the person with psychosocial disability who is at the very heart of it at the very focus of all the discussion that's happening now from my perspective as someone who has you know lives with psychosocial disability first just have this one life and for me i think i i it's my opinion and it's my belief that as an individual i have a basic human right to uh live a life which is as functional as possible and to it is to that um towards that end that i feel that uh whenever we are talking talking about policy making at a larger level we definitely need to look at things also from the individual's perspective because for me i am not just a statistic that we are talking about i'm not just a data set or a data point uh i am a living living breathing individual and i'm my life is not not just about uh my economic productivity of course i am a productive member of society i am um an officer i am doing my work i am contributing in in in the formal economy in the way possible but then again as i said i am also an individual i am i've given birth to and i'm you know bringing up two future citizens of the world i'm also taking care of three senior citizens and i i do a lot of mental health advocacy i write i'm trying to fight the stigma that exists around mental health and these are very important things to keep in mind to focus on when we are uh making or proposing any kind of policy which uh covers mental illness so people with mental illness now um as far as the treatment gap is concerned i think i say this for all of us here uh including um the esteemed panelists from other countries that we who live in south asia we all do live in uh let us say a low resource setting because we are not a very prosperous region there's there's no secret about it and um you know we do have experience a lot of issues with uh accessing mental health care uh mostly because uh on account of two three factors one of course is the the the high uh population that we have the very big large population and the resources that we have are very very little in comparison with the big population but another factor which is the unseen barrier is the stigma the stigma and the complete lack of understanding that exists in society as far as mental disorders or mental health itself is concerned and this barrier prevents people from accessing mental health care now i do a lot of informal um you know uh nudging or counseling to people in my immediate circles in fact because i have been one of the few people who've been very open and very um you know outspoken about my own experiences i have not kind of tried to hide it ever so i am one of the few people that you know people know they can talk to about um a certain crisis that may be going on with them or in their family and believe me it's it's so difficult to explain because there is very little understanding about what goes on inside the mind inside the brain of someone who has um let us say of a disorder like depression and you know people are more willing to go to a counsellor they want you to couch uh the reality in very rosy words then actually going to a psychiatrist whenever i suggest that you know maybe try going to a psychiatrist uh or if i try to label or you know of course not diagnosed because that's not my job but maybe try to suggest to them that okay why don't you go and see maybe this is depression maybe this is so and so and these these very words you know they really put people off and people sometimes just bold as if i'm talking about something which is unmentionable so this is one thing which i really believe needs to go and this can happen only if more and more of us talk about uh mental health and we normalize the conversations around mental health i've also seen that a lot of times when i try to speak about mental health you know people get very uncomfortable and you know they they'll be very embarrassed smiles and then somebody would try to talk change the topic so that uh is something that maybe with time the little more patience perseverance that that thing has to change because even if the resources are available whatever resources are available people are not really taking advantage of those and i will admit very freely that i am one of those people even with the certain amount of education and privilege that i had in my background for five years i was not even aware that i had what i had was major depressive disorder which had been um triggered post partum i first had postpartum depression which later on became major depression so if this happened to someone like me imagine someone who lives in a you know a much less privileged uh who lives a much less privileged life and that person probably would not even have the resources or even the language to express what they're feeling and we have to we have to bring down the level of conversation so that it's all persuasive and you know every everyone gets to know what is happening now the third thing that i would like to talk about here is well a covet has already been spoken about by so many people and incidentally i'm also on the intersection because i have psychosocial disability and then i also got coveted and i survived that and uh fortunately since my symptoms were very mild so surviving those 15 days of isolation was the most difficult part of me and there was uh there was threat to i i'm vulnerable because uh i already had existing uh pre-existing conditions of mental health mental disorders and i used to feel under pressure sometimes i was really afraid that i may just slip into depression again but thankfully that did not happen simply because i had the resources of everything that it helped me to recover in the very first place so uh covet has been a major disruption in um everyone's lives and people have had to worry about you know things like where is my next knee going to come from from their very livelihood to people who had more privilege but who kind of worried about their mortality that am i going to survive this if it comes to that or what about my loved ones so people have been um between all of this and uh if in in that case covet has been a trigger a very big trigger a significant trigger both in terms of magnitude as well as um its wavelength because it has hit so many people all around the world and uh at such times i would just like to say two more things that first of all let us acknowledge that there is a problem let us acknowledge that what we are feeling is distress what we are feeling is anxiety and also the fact that it is absolutely normal you know it's it's it's you're not feeling okay it is kind of okay because it's okay not to be okay you shouldn't have to feel ashamed of feeling anxious or sad or low and if you if you uh move on to the stage when you actually become dysfunctional you must access the treatment that is available and the second thing is for everyone who's listening anywhere please be a little kinder to everyone around you because uh covet has underlined and amplified the psycho biopsychosocial model of mental disorders more than anything else and that social part is something that maybe we can really make a difference by just being a little kinder to everyone around us so that's all i have to say for now uh thank you to uh dr bhan thank you to professor chuckleberry and a special greeting to dr patel because anyone who's a part of the mental health community for you for us you are a legend so it's been a really a privilege to have been on the same panel as you thank you very much thank you so much you know for i guess highlighting that it's okay not to be okay and also probably from a mental health advocate perspective the fact that nothing about us without us and i think those are really important messages for us to also convey through this panel to everyone who's watching our next panelist is susan thomas susan thomas is the national health coordinator at the self-employed women's association commonly known as seva she also manages the child care department at seva susan has been the part of a part of the health and development sector in india for many years decades actually and has worked with a variety of organizations and has served in various capacities and you know brings in a rich body of experience uh working in the health and development space and especially from a community based uh perspective so over to you susan for your thoughts around how to address this issue especially from an ngo and a community-based organization perspective so are you able to connect we can see you now but we are not able to hear you yet can you try unmuting yourself okay we can see you but i don't think we are able to hear you yet is it probably an issue with the microphone now still not yet susan so what i do is susan if i may just move on to professor chen and come back to you and in the meantime the tech team will try to reach out to you to try to address this issue uh our next panelist is going to be professor neera jen professor jain is the director at the national brain research center located at manasser in gurdwa india professor zhen holds a phd from iari new delhi and received his post doctoral training at vanderbilt university in the u.s has received an international senior research fellowship from the welcome trust is a fellow of insa as well as many other uh science academies and has been working extensively in the field of neurosciences uh welcome professor jen thank you for joining us and we look forward to hearing your perspectives on this map well thank you very much to dr bhan ris and sangas for organizing this and inviting me to speak in this i come from a slightly different kind of organization i belong to national brain research center which is about 40 kilometers from delhi on jaipur highway our mandate is to understand brain function in health and disease so we are essentially a research and teaching organization we are also a university and we look at the brain from various aspects as far as scientific techniques go peering deep down using modern tools of imaging and looking at animal model systems using molecular biological techniques but coming to theme of today's session we do have a few programs that i would like to highlight today one of them what we call as our flagship program which we have just kept going this is to understand what happens to the brain in common mental disorders for example ocd depression anxiety and we don't have such work in the field we are not a hospital but we collaborate with hospitals and our idea here is to essentially peer into the brain in collaboration with him new delhi right now and gurgaon civil hospital and try to understand what goes on inside the brain in terms of circuits that are there in various mental diseases which are affecting people at different ages they're not always the same as all of you would know and our goal here is to essentially provide tools to medical professionals to help in diagnosis and prognosis that's one of the programs that looks at mental diseases the second program that is more advanced is national level program already the flagship program which i talked about will be a national level program in the second phase but like many other activities in various organizations this covet pandemic had put a stop to our ambitions so the second program what we call as dementia science program is to try to understand what is the prevalence and incidence of dementia in the country as many of you would agree until recently we never paid attention to data in our country we have not really worried about trying to understand how many of our people have dementia or for that matter any of the other disease now there's a lot of stress on that we don't know how many people above the age of 60 that's what we are going to look at have dementia and for that we are partnering with four hospitals and we are developing three community cohorts uh in near delhi in panwal in bangalore which will be an urban site and all the way in magala which will be more of a tribal site the hospitals include sri chitta nimham's bangalore as well as in new delhi and there is a basic biology component to that and here our idea is to first look into the incidence of prevalence or dementia as i said and then try to find factors that can prevent i would put it give put it positively prevent conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia we know about in four years about 50 percent of patients with mci convert to dementia but not all convert to dementia and we want to understand by looking a variety of factors their lifestyle factor their family background their mem their medical background uh everything that under the sun that we could think of they are trying to understand what actually causes certain percentage of people including genetics to convert to dementia while others do not convert to dementia from mci and we hope to come out with some recommendations in next three years as to what lifestyle changes can be made to prevent this conversion so this is our second program within this program we will also have a genetics component trying to understand if we can find some genes but that's that's a long-term goal uh but immediate goal what i said was earlier so these are the kind of activities that go on at nbrc other than that we have many other research programs coming to the theme today which is kovid and the brain many speakers before me have highlighted just how pandemic is affecting mental health because of isolation because of tension because of fear because of not knowing how to deal with this pandemic how to save yourself from getting infected we don't have enough data even today when we are almost 11 months from the first incident which was reported in muhammad but there is another aspect to this covet pandemic that i would like to highlight and that's of our interest in nbrc for the kind of organization we are is that we know it as a respiratory virus and it causes lack of oxygen because it affects lungs but it has a lot of other issues with this infection one directly related to the lack of oxygen it leads to hypoxia in the brain and that affects brain function in the long run we know that hypoxia lack of oxygen has has very serious deleterious effects on the brain functioning the second way it affects is it cause hypercoagulation so it can cause stroke like symptoms in the brain by blocking blood flow that's another problem that covet causes another issue that covered infection causes because of high very high immune reaction that body has to this infection and because of that it leads to a lot of problems in the brain most of these problems we don't even understand one of the most common that is coming up is a variety of demyelinating diseases and recently a newspaper you must have read about that how hospitals in bombay want to understand nylon body syndrome which is a demyelinating disease of spinal cord which can lead to paralysis and if it is closer to the neck then even to death because of respiratory failure but it's also causing demyelinating diseases in the brain in the peripheral nerves leading to all kind of problems which is kind of an auto immune disease other than that what patients started reporting is this is about one third of patients who get hospitalized so the numbers uh one can work out from the total number of infection as we speak are about 9 million in india so these patients actually have a long-term cognitive deficit and that's we are very concerned about even if we get rid of spread of this contagion this is going to create a major major health problem for many many years to come the data for past eight nine months shows that these symptoms do not go away and if you read the description what patients give they forget what they just spoke about they forget where they work they can't familiar uh roads and paths where they used to walk or drive every day they can't remember how to go to their work how to go home these variety of cognitive deficits that these patients are showing up and like i said a study in france shows that about a third of the hospitalized patient have a long-term neurological symptoms and the back of the envelope calculation will show that kovid alone has added perhaps about 150 000 extra patients with mental diseases within india so this is something that we want to address at a variety of level by partnering with hospitals where they have already creating databases of patients with different level of effects due to covet and they are following a patients who have recovered from serious illnesses and we'll partner with them we will understand what are the underlying causes in the brain and if there's any kind of intervention that can help this patient which might be different from the traditional way we deal with this kind of problem so this is uh i can see dr bhan is telling me that five minutes are getting over so i'll just stop here but i would stop with something uh which i think is very appropriate in this forum that in dementia science program which is a community-based program to understand a variety of things as i pointed out in the long run we would like to have partners in our neighbor countries who would be interested in finding out these issues within their populations because we have developed a battery of tests which are standardized tests all seven sites will follow exactly the same protocol so that the results can be compared across the sites across the patients across the investigators and volunteers and we would have planned to share these protocols with whoever wants we are planning to publish them and we love to partner with our neighboring countries in south asia if they get interested in the long run to get a comprehensive view of dementia and later on as we progress in our other study on common mental disorder and i'll end there thank you very much again dr bhan for having me here thank you so much professor jane for speaking about all of the very interesting work which is happening at nbrc and also some of the biological aspects of the kind of impacts we are seeing due to carbon 19 on the brain and the kind of research questions it's throwing up very interesting indeed uh susan i just want to look back to you and see if you are able to speak now if we can try so that we can get your perspectives please so we can still see you but i'm not able to hear you susan or maybe it's an issue with the microphone can you try speaking and see if it works because we cannot hear you yet you hear me now yes we can hear you susan he's good uh sorry as you all know seva works with informal workers and formal women to speak about informal women workers uh the health of informal workers have always been a matter of concern and we have been working with them particularly women and we know the issues they face on a day-to-day basis what we have seen over the years is that the health services do not reach them and they do not reach the services so there's a huge gap there's always a gap and for the most part this gap is because of the lack of information they do not have enough uh adequate information about the services they do not have information about the health problems they are facing so we spend a lot of time trying to educate them trying to create awareness about different issues now when comet came the problem was the same and kovitt was new to all of us and we can imagine what the condition of informal workers the poor women what was their condition they were locked down they were in their homes they didn't know they had no clue what kobe really meant none of us either knew we'd vote we desperately wanted to reach them because we didn't know how to reach them but initial stages we were trying to work out a plan how to reach them and with the support of who we developed a program where we could reach them through the phones a phone based intervention was developed and we also trained community leaders so seva always works through community leaders through informal workers who become leaders and to take who become the face of seva in every community so we started developing community leaders trained them and during the months of march and april we reached out to several women across the country across different states and while we were interacting with them through the phones many issues started emerging and we realized that you know there were so many issues issues around because of loss of employment loss of wages the schools were closed the children were home day care centers were close small children were home the nutrition levels were going down because children were not getting the midday meals or the nutrition at the day care centers and the burden the burden of care had enhanced so much and the women were struggling they didn't know how to handle this domestic violence uh was another issue that they were facing uh issues around their own health sexual and reproductive health issues around sexual and reproductive health addiction alcoholism all these issues where uh you know we could see that they were struggling and they started sharing this with the women through the phone calls that's when when we realized the learning from this entire uh program that we had where we trained about 800 women across 11 states and we reached out to 300 000 women and their families during the last few months we learned that there is a need for someone to talk to these women there are issues that these women face mental health is not new to the informal sector or informal women but mental health issues increase during this period because of all these multiple things that were affecting their lives so there was a need there is a need for someone around them someone they could speak to and we realized that it performs it's not difficult we can reach women there is a possibility of having an online uh intervention online uh ways of reaching women and women can learn it's not that they cannot learn and this was very effective so that was the learning from this entire episode that we had the entire intervention that we had but yes there were challenges several challenges now these women that the community leaders that we're talking about or the frontline health workers of seva they were not trained for counseling counseling needs some additional training so it was we learned and realized that if we have to address mental health issues our women have to be trained to do some kind of basic counseling so that's the challenge so that was necessary and we also noticed the digital divide android phones and smartphones were only with men women did not have it women did not know how to use it so there's a need for digital literacy that was also a gap that we realized was happening also the stigma around it women needed this their space their own space they needed to talk to someone they need privacy they needed to you know needed somebody around their neighborhood a friend who they could talk to so these were some of the challenges we saw and finally after a lot of discussions and with discussions with uh sangat and other mental health professionals he realized and the need to develop a counseling program for informal workers women in the country and today we are going to in the next few months we're going to develop a program with sangat and others and we are planning to train these women on basic counseling and we are also trying to uh help them to also identify you know cases that needs to be further you know referred for further secondary and tertiary care and build a network of counselors and mental health professionals who could support these women and develop online counseling platforms so this is something that we are going to work around because we know that we can do this we've already experimented with that in the last few months and finally i would like to conclude here by saying that there is a need for increased investment in frontline workers the health budget should go up and we should have more and more health you know health workers and frontline workers who are trained on counseling and other health issues who can reach out to the women of our country who can reach out to the adolescents of our country and all these issues can be addressed thank you very much anand i tried to cut short a little bit thank you so much susan uh also for very quickly but um i think in quite detail talking about some of the issues as they impact communities and the fact that communities are resilient but they also need support and they need us to work with them uh through community frontline workers and being able to launch a response which is effective and is accessible to them now unfortunately we do we have run out of time you know it sometimes happens when you have these packed schedules but i think we had a very uh impactful and uh very very insightful discussion from all of our panelists and i think this is there is a lot for a lot of food for thought in terms of one understanding the challenges understanding some of the kind of work which has happened across the region as well as some future insights around both mental health community-based work advocacy the need for policies more funding as well as involvement of service users in the way we launch our response and hopefully all of these insights will be uh you know available for all of us certainly through this webinar recording but also will be communicated to policymakers as well as organizations working in the sector now in the interest of time i will now request professor james to kindly deliver the word of thanks on behalf of both ris and santa professor james is the president of nepo which is a non-profit intellectual property foundation as well as a visiting fellow at ris and he guides the research in health policy and pharmaceuticals at ris he's also a member secretary for the forum on indian traditional medicine set up by ministry of ayush ris and works on contributing to pragmatic policy making in the area of traditional medicine over to you professor james for the last words on this very moment thank you dr anand are you getting me please yes we can hear you please go ahead and practice please i have the responsibility of proposing a lot of thanks to the resource persons and the participants of this webinar on kobit 19 and mental health response in south asia opportunities for learning and cooperation we have had a very impactful webinar on a topic that is currently engaging the attention of policy makers in healthcare the last time perhaps we had such an effect on mental health where a particular disease was i remember rightly during the early years of hiv aids that however affected mostly the afflicted persons and their families but the coveted 19 effect has been on all population both infected and healthy this has been to some extent as many speakers pointed out because of the various preventive measures resulting in job loss compulsion to work from home and also study from home then the lack of social mobility which are not issues within the health care programs is also partly going to the fear of catching the disease without warning and almost certainly about passing the same to the dear and near ones the serious impact of the disease on those with co-morbidities apart from the high morbidity at the early stages of the spread of the disease is also a factor the eminent inaugural and keynote speakers and the erudite panelists have presented the issues goldenly and suggested ways to move forward dr reddy in his inaugural just captured the various facets of the problem the need for health system and social system responses and also mobilizing community resources he also mentioned about the need for implementation and operational research as well as sharing of experiences and expertise especially network among the south asian countries which is what this webinar is beginning with professor vikram patel spoke about the unmet needs of mental health care which is a very large area and also he mentioned the various barriers both on the supply side as well as demand side he also presented some experiences both in care and education some of the important observations made by the panelists are they following there was a unique perspectives based on their experience and also the best practices and some ways for which what has come out from the discussion in the panel is that mental health has not been a priority in healthcare budgeting in south asia across the countries we have listened to experiences from situations of conflict we also had perspectives based on personal experience we also had some experience from the researchers especially about the need for generating reliable data there were some presentation talking about the biological impact on the brain of mental disorder and there is uh what comes out if there's a definite need to fight the against the stigma society wrongly attached to the mental health disorders and the patients who suffer from them the use of technologies like digital technology definitely can go they love long way along with capacity and enhancement across the countries many mention about the need for psychosocial care and support and also about integrated wellness based response to the issue at all use of yoga for mental health was stressed and this one panelists mentioned about integrated medicine as the future dr susan but mentioned about the need for reaching to groups like women or vulnerable and particular importance is to reduce the digital divide as well as need for training and education in counseling and yes it is uh almost everyone felt that there is need for increase in the budgetary support for this mental health problems altogether it was a great experience to be part of this webinar as dr bhan said there was a lot of food for thoughts and we hope to bring out come out with a report for the policy makers on this issue i especially thank professor kasrinath reddy president public health foundation who delivered a very exciting inaugural address professor vikram patel of the department of global health and social medicine harvard medical school who presented a very erudite keynote speech or also process sachin chadrwadi who in his welcome address drew attention to the economic importance of the subject and the eminent panelist dr rahula amin from kabul mr muhammad kam suruman from dhaka prasad pushpa prasad jaiswal from from nepal dr suni mali madhuriwala from colombo surrender jaiswal from mumbai dr ishwar bhasavaradi the director of the murati dashai national institute president jain from the national brain research center miss subudra

bhan my old friend for excellently moderating this session i also thank the participants from different parts of the world who were listening to the discussions intensely but could not raise questions and they can reach to us later we sanger and ris hope to publish the report as i already mentioned i'll fail in my duties if i do not thank my colleague dr namradha patak dr rabi sreenivas and mr poor

qVoUQBuKcHU,In full: Sajid Javid unveils details of July 19 ‘Freedom Day’ in Commons,UCPgLNge0xqQHWM5B5EFH9Cg,The Telegraph,2021-07-05T16:57:58Z,"Sajid Javid sets out the full details of the next stage of England's road map, the so-called ""Freedom Day"" on July 19, to the Commons. Boris Johnson will also be ...",before i call the secretary of state i would like to point out that the british sign language interpretation of the statement will be available to watch on parliament live tv i now call the secretary of state study javid to make his team and welcome back to the front bench at the same time [Applause] thank you mr speaker and i'm extremely grateful for you accommodating the timing of this statement today i'd like to update the house on the pandemic and our road map to freedom mr speaker this morning i joined some of the remarkable people who have been at the heart of the pandemic response at a service to mark the nhs's 73rd birthday at saint paul's cathedral together we were reflected on a year like no other for the nhs and for our country i know that honourable members on all sides of this house would join me in celebrating the decision by her majesty the queen to award the nhs the george cross i can think of no more fitting tribute to the nhs i know that everyone in this house indeed everyone in this country will celebrate this award mr speaker there's no greater demonstration of our higher regard for the nhs than the manner in which we all stepped up to protect it now it is thanks to the nhs and many others that we are vaccinating our way out of this pandemic and out of these restrictions 86 percent of uk adults have had at least one jab and 64 have had two we're reinforcing our vaccine wall of defense further still i can tell the house that we are reducing the dose interval for under 40s from 12 weeks to eight which will mean that every adult should have had the chance to be double jabbed by mid-september and those vaccines mr speaker they're working the latest data from the ons suggests or shows that 8 in 10 adults have the covered 19 antibodies that are so important in helping our body to fight this disease when we look at people aged over 50 the people who got the job earlier in the program that figure rises to over 9 in 10. now mr speaker allow me to set out why all of this is so important before we start putting jabs into arms whenever we saw a rise in cases it would inevitably be followed by a rise in hospitalizations and tragically a rise in deaths too yet today even though cases are heading upwards in line with what we expected hospitalizations are increasing at a much lower rate and deaths are at just one percent of the figure we saw at the peak our vaccines are building a wall of protection against hospitalization and jab by jab brick by brick that wall is getting higher and for those people who sadly do find themselves having to go to hospital we have better treatments than ever before last week on my visit to saint thomas's hospital clinicians were telling me just how transformative dexmethatone has been in their effort to save lives and taken together the link between cases hospitalizations and deaths is being severely weakened and this means we can start to learn to live with coded now as we do that mr speaker it's important that we're straight with the british people cases of covet 19 are rising and they will continue to rise significantly we can reasonably expect that by the 19th of july the number of daily cases will be far higher than today against this backdrop i know that many people will be understandably cautious about easing restrictions after many months of uncertainty this is entirely natural but we can now protect the nhs without having to go to extraordinary lengths that we've had to do so in the past that's not to say that this is going to be easy mr speaker of course the pandemic is not over the virus is still with us it hasn't gone away and the risk of a dangerous new variant that evades vaccines remains real we know that with cobit 19 the situation can change and it can change quickly but we cannot put our lives on hold forever my responsibility as secretary of state for health and social care includes helping us to turn and face the other challenges that we know that we must also address from mental health to social care to the challenges of long covered i am determined to get to work on busting the backlog too the backlog that has been caused by this pandemic about clog that we know will get a lot worse before it gets better now as i said to this house as i set out mr speaker last week i remain confident that we can move to step four in england on the 19th of july and that the government will make its final decision on this on the 12th of july so today mr speaker i wish to set out further details of what step four will look like in essence our national response to covert will change from one of rules and regulations to one of guidance and good sense we will revoke all social distancing guidance including the two-meter rule hallelujah except for in some specific settings such as ports of entry and medical settings where of course it would continue to make sense it will no longer be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in any setting including public transport although we will advise this as a voluntary measure for crowded and enclosed spaces it will no longer be necessary to work from home there will be no limits on the number of people you can meet there will be no limits on the number of people who can attend life events like weddings and funerals and there will be no restrictions on communal worship or singing we will remove legal requirements on how businesses operate capacity caps will all be lifted and there will be no longer be any requirement to offer table service all businesses that were forced to close their doors will be able to open them once again and we will lift the cap on named care home visitors so that families can come together in the ways they choose to do so mr speaker ministers will provide further statements this week on self-isolation for fully vaccinated people including for international travel and on restrictions in education settings including the removal of bubbles and contact isolation in schools today i can also confirm to the house that we have completed our review of certification while already a feature of international travel we have concluded that we do not think using certification as a condition of entry is a way to go for people who haven't been offered a full course of vaccination and for businesses we felt that the impact outweighed the public health of course mr speaker businesses can use covid certif as covent status certification at their own discretion and from step four onwards the nhs covert pass will be accessible through the nhs app and other digital routes this will be the main way that people can provide their covered status a status that will achieve once they have completed a full vaccine course a recent negative test or some other proof of natural immunity now mr speaker taken together step four is the biggest step of all a restoration of so many of the freedoms that make this country great we know that as a consequence cases will rise just as they have done at every step on our roadmap but this time our wall of protection will help us while step four will be the moment to let go for of many restrictions we must hold on to those everyday sensible decisions that can help make us all safe the responsibility to combat kobit 19 lies with each and every one of us that means staying at home when you're asked to self-isolate it means considering the guidance that we're setting out and it means getting the job both doses when you're offered it that you please please take the jabs and something that this is something that everyone can do to make a contribution towards this national effort and it may even mean for some people that they will get three jabs in a single year last week the jcvi provided interim advice on who to prioritize for a third dose and our most vulnerable will be offered booster covert 19 jabs from september in time for the winter and preparing for the winter ahead is not just about covid but flu as well because of the measures in place this winter almost nobody in the uk had flu for 18 months now that's obviously a good thing but it does mean that immunity from flu is down this winter's flu campaign will be more important than ever and we're currently looking at whether we can give people the covert 19 booster shot and the flu jab at the same mr speaker step four is the next step in our country's journey out of this pandemic i know that after so many difficult months is a step that many of us will look upon with a great deal of caution but it is one that we will all take together with a growing wall of defense against this virus a wall that each and every one of us can help build higher it's vital that each of us plays our part to protect ourselves and to protect others into better days ahead a tremendous statement to the house secretary of state jonathan ashworth grateful uh mr speaker can i uh start by paying tribute to uh to our nhs on its 73rd anniversary and thank again our extraordinary health and care workforce the best birthday present they could have of course is a fair pay rise not the proposed real terms pay cut that is currently on offer now we all mr speaker want to see these restrictions end lockdowns are a sign of policy failure and i hope that when he makes the final decision next week it will be based on the data the modeling and the sage advice but let's be absolutely clear about what he's talking about today when only 50 of the total population across england are fully vaccinated and another 17 partially his strategy as he indeed was gracious enough to concede except that infections will surge further and continue to rise steeply except that hospitalizations will continue to rise until they reach a peak later this summer presumably some of those hospitalized will sadly die mr speaker and thousands upon thousands mostly children and younger people but others as well will be left exposed to a virus mainly because they have no vaccination protection but we also know even when double jabbed you can catch and transmit the virus and many of them will be at risk of serious long-term chronic illness the personal impact of which may be felt for years to come so even though the vaccination may have broken the link with mortality there are still questions uh about the link between morbidity so as part of his strategy of learning to live with covered can he spell out today for the british public what that actually means in his view learning to live with covid how many deaths does he consider it is acceptable when we're living with covered how many cases of long covid does he consider acceptable when we are living with covid and given that we know that when the covid rates uh circulate at high rates that the virus can escape and evolve what risk assessment has he done of the possibility of a new variant emerging and will he publish it now the secretary of state says that every date for unlocking carries risk and that's why we need to learn to live with covid but we shouldn't have to take a high risk approach we should be pushing down risk indeed we mitigate against risk across society all the time we just don't accept other diseases we take interventions to try and prevent other diseases so why is he collapsing all mitigations completely when he knows that the covered rates will continue to rise he'll be aware that israel has reintroduced its mass command date because of the delta variant so why is he planning to win ours masks don't restrict freedoms in a pandemic when so much virus is circulating they ensure that everyone who goes to the shops or who takes public transport can do so safely because wearing a mask protects others if nobody is masked covered risk increases and we're all less safe he must understand that those in the shielding community are particularly anxious why should they feel shut out of public transport and shops because he's abandoned the mask mandate that's no definition of freedom i recognise and who else suffers when masks are removed it's those working in shops it's those who drive the buses is those who drive taxes it's those who work in hospitality it's the low paid workers who also have been without access to decent sick pay many of whom live in overcrowded uh accommodation those have been savagely disproportionately impacted by this virus from day one and now he's asking them to bear the brunt of the increased risk again so again will he explain to us why he thinks abandoning masks is a sensible uh proposal to follow given that people will still need to isolate as he recognized intestine trace will still be operate in operation will he accept that living with the virus will mean more so than ever that those who are sick will need to isolate themselves from the rest of society so will he ensure that they have paid proper sick pay and isolation support to do it has he agreed with me it's been a monstrous failure of these past 15 months that isolation support has not been in place now masks are effective because we know the virus is airborne so he could put he could further mitigate covert risks by insisting on ventilation standards in premises and crowded buildings he could offer grants for air filtration systems instead all we get is more government advice ventilation in buildings and grants to support air filtration systems doesn't restrict anyone's freedoms mr speaker and indeed it would probably help us get some of those 400 000 children back into school who have been off school because of because of covid yesterday mr speaker he said he believes the best way to protect the nation's health is to lift all restrictions now i know he boasts of his student years at harvard studying pandemics but i think he may well have missed the tutorial on infectious disease control because wide spread transmission will not make us healthier we're not out of the woods yet but we do want to see lockdown end but we need those life-saving mitigations in place we need sick pay local contact racing continued mask wearing on public transport and ventilation inbuilt in in buildings and schools to prevent further illness i hope when he returns next week he has put those measures in place today thank you mr speaker can i thank the right one gentleman for his uh comments and and just turning to those uh first of all that uh the the decision i think he started by saying can he get reassurance that the final decision uh on uh go no go on july the 19th for july the 19th which we will make on july the 12th uh will it be informed by uh the the very best expert data i mean of course it will be just as every decision has been informed in that way and i must say i've only been about a week into the job mr speaker but i'm incredibly impressed by our scientists and medical advisors and public health england and uh take this opportunity to pay tribute to all that they have been doing and mr speaker turning to his second point about the cases and the link between cases and hospitalization and death i mean this is absolutely central to this next step that we're taking so case numbers are high and as i've said they will go higher and they will go significantly higher and we need to be ready for that but what is far more important is how many people are ending up in hospital and how many sadly are dying and that is where the vaccines have worked alongside the treatments that the that we now have that we didn't have a year or so ago and it has meant uh that the the link between cases and deaths has been severely weakened the last time we had 25 000 new cases a day we had around 500 deaths a day the level now is um that is one thirtieth of of that and uh and i know the right old gentleman would welcome that and understand that as we move forward there is no risk-free absolutely risk-free way to move forward but we do need to start returning things uh back towards normal and learning to live with covid his question around masks again we've taken the best public health advice and uh and he would know from what i've said that although we will remove all legal requirements for anyone to wear a mask in any setting we expect people to behave sensibly and and think about others around them so for example uh that the guidance will be there so if you're on public transport let's say in a very crowded tube i think it would be sensible to wear a mask not least for respect for others but if you're the only person in the carriage late at night on the east coast main line then you can choose uh much more easily not to wear mass certainly because there's hardly anyone else around so we expect people we trust people uh to make a sensible decisions and i think that's the way we should move ahead he's also asked about uh compensation uh sick pay and uh and he knows that many measures are in place and we will continue to keep those under review join the slate committee jeremy hamm thank you mr speaker i support the approach the secretary of state is taking for the simple reason that two vote doses of the vaccine work against the delta variant but with 350 000 new cases daily across the world the battle against this pandemic is far from over does he agree that if we want to prevent another lockdown in the run up to winter apart from the booster jab program the most important thing we can do is to improve the way test and trace works in korea they managed to use it to stop any lockdowns here it failed to stop three lockdowns and the head of test and trace told my committee that between 20 and 40 percent of people were not isolating when they were asked to so with his fresh eyes in the job will he ask officials for new advice as to what we can do to improve test and trace to stop further lockdowns of all mr speaker may i thank my right older friend for his uh support these measures i know he speaks with the greatest being experience and uh and i want to thank him for that uh regarding a test trace and isolate uh he's right there are many successes over the last year that we can be proud of but there are also many improvements i think that can be made as well and uh i want to tell him that i have already asked for such advice and i look forward to talking to him about it in the future let's go to snp spokesperson dr philippa whitford philippa thank you very much mr speaker this pandemic is very far from over so with cases soaring across the uk i'm surprised the health secretary is planning to end all coveted measures the delta variant which was allowed into the uk due to the failure of border quarantine is twice as infectious as the original and is infecting younger age groups including children it also shows significant vaccine escape with only 33 protection against infection from the first dose while receiving two doses of either vaccine dramatically reduces hospitalization the numbers are rising and only half the population are fully vaccinated that means the other half are not and many won't have that opportunity until near the end of september the secretary of state talks about the percentage of adults that are fully vaccinated but he must know that isn't how herd immunity works it's achieved by reducing the number of susceptible people in the whole population to stop onward spread of the virus the uk government's failure to lock down last september allowed the alpha variant to emerge in the south east of england and spread across the uk and indeed the rest of the world so if the health secretary is going to just let it rip how does he plan to avoid generating yet another uk variant with even greater vaccine resistance with over a hundred and fifty thousand people dead why is he returned to the false narrative that covet is just like flu is it just wishful thinking and why is he planning to end even simple measures like mask wearing he has suggested people need to just learn to live with it but appears to be completely ignoring the risk of long covert which is already affecting over a million people including children so how does he plan to avoid soaring cases of long covered in unvaccinated young adults and children does he consider them to be collateral damage or just a price worth paying brewster mr speaker i have to say the honorable lady she started off well but her points that she made just completely degenerated into political point scoring and she she should know much better than to engage in scaremongering of the scottish people of the british people and she has you know no respect for what is happening and trying to treat this whole issue uh with with a degree of respect and seriousness i mean it's using phrases like let it rip if anything mr speaker the only part of the uk where cases could be described as ripping would be in scotland where the case rate is higher than any other part of the uk in fact i think they have the seven of the 10 highest hot spots in terms of number of cases throughout europe and the honorable lady should reflect on that and then she claimed that so that's that i i suggested that somehow that covid is like flu i've never said that it would be complete nonsense for anyone to suggest that cobit is like flu she should think about the millions of people across the world the thousands that have died in the uk i think how dare she suggest it's like flu in even raising that the issue when it comes to flu mr speakers to say just as we have had to learn to live with flu when in some years we've had 20 000 deaths sadly from flu we have to learn to live with clovid the honourable lady should reflect on what she said and stop playing political football with this serious issue let the house be to bottom there mr speaker can i welcome the secretary of state in this role and say to him in public but i hope i've said to him private that when he was secretary for housing he's one of the few ministers to actually understand the plight of residential leaseholds and i thank him for that and i hope he'll do as well in this job as well can i put to him that as well as the recognition of the national health service it'd be a good idea if we could find somewhere recognizing the role of teachers and their assistants in schools we've done as much to keep the young people of this country up to their education and occupied even though remotely many people have contributed and can i finally put to him that i hope that despite the occasional political remarks that any of us may make that he'll work with the other nations of the united kingdom and with other nations around the world so we can defeat this the impact of this condition together mr speaker can i thank the father of the house for his kind comments and he may have heard me say earlier that the education secretary will say much more tomorrow about the action we will be taking around schools and educational settings including or at the removal of uh bubbles the bubbles requirement uh from july the 19th uh as well and uh and he's made an excellent point about working not just across the united kingdom uh which i would tell him despite what we just heard from the other the the previous honourable speaker just a moment ago there's great cooperation and uh and that will of course continue but also international cooperation both through our leadership of the g7 and the kovacs alliance let's go to manira wilson thank you very much mr speaker the secretary of state will be aware that for clinically extremely vulnerable people with compromised immune systems double vaccination provides a much reduced level of protection compared to the rest of the population you'll also be aware that pregnant women in their third trimester are considered clinically vulnerable and many people in these groups are anxious about what today's announcements mean for them so could he confirm what advice is being published for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and specifically will he consider allowing pregnant women to have their second jab after 21 days mr madam deputy speaker in terms of course there will be people that are that are more vulnerable sadly to this virus that will be uh concerned about step four i entirely understand that and understand the the the caution and uh how they can be anxious we will be publishing uh further guidance along the lines that the honourable lady has mentioned uh with regards to her question on the second dose for uh pregnant women uh i will have to take advice on that uh just to warn colleagues that this this statement will finish at six o'clock because of the need to go back to the debate on the uh bill so i would urge colleagues to be brief martin vickers thank you deputy speaker the majority of my constituents will certainly welcome the secretary of state's statement but in in that council area the nhs digital rate at the moment is 591 per 100 000 which is considerably ahead of the national average and that inevitably causes concern particularly amongst the elderly and vulnerable groups i've got full full confidence in the local nhs and council and other officials who are dealing with it but it may if it continues to worsen uh will the my my friend girlfriend meet with me and my honourable friend from grimsby to discuss whether additional support and resources is required madam deputy speaker of course understand the the importance of the question for my honorable friend and i have to tell him as i've said in my statement i do believe the case rate nationally and including in his own constituency it will uh worsen but what it what is uh far more important is the hospitalization rate and uh and the death rate and he would have heard what i've said earlier uh but i would be more than happy to meet with him on any occasion to discuss these issues further jim shannon i'm davey speaker can i thank the city of state for the health statement and for the approach by government centrally here to drive the vaccine world across across all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland better together as always the approaches outline where government seems to be a sensible approach can the second state outline what discussions have taken place with this health counterpart in northern ireland to ensure that northern ireland cautiously and carefully moves forward at a similar pace as they hear bearing in mind our level of transmission and tandem with the need to be wise and worry can i thank the honourable gentleman for his remarks about the the vaccine and as he has said it is a very successful uk white program the the take-up of vaccinations in northern ireland is is just as high as any other part of the uk uh i'm working closely uh with my counterpart in northern ireland we've already had uh two discussions in one week and then we will be speaking on a regular basis and coordinating and it's working very well andrew james mr speaker can i welcome my right honourable friend's statement i think he will be greeted by a sense of relief across the country the challenges that people have faced during this lockdowns have been so profound this success of course is only possible because of the vaccine rollout so will my right honourable friend keep the pressure up to ensure as many people as possible are vaccinated but whilst doing that also really put focus upon the significant catch-up record on dealing with other health conditions and particularly thinking about mental health and cancer my honourable friend is right to raise this and what he points out and sometimes i think it's uh missed by certain members of this house is that the the pandemic has caused many other non-covered health problems and uh he's he's mentioned two of the most important uh which uh the the increased uh problems with mental health uh that we are seeing plenty of evidence of and then also uh with cancer particular cancer referrals in fact uh i've been told that the the departmental officials think there's at least some 40 000 people that or in a normal year would have come forward for cancer referrals that did not come forward and uh and this is just a reminder of why it's important for us to move back towards freedom and learning to live with covert uh we now go to ben lake joe smart speaker the welsh government has suggested that an easing of welsh restrictions is unlikely before the july 19th and any divergence in the rules applicable on either side of the border will raise questions of enforcement now the responsibility for enforcing social distancing rules on trains is the responsibility of the british transport police and so what discussions has the health secretary had with the secretary of state for transport and indeed the welsh government regarding the status of restrictions and cross-border rail travel management speaker the honourable general will know already there's and this is understandable there's been a difference in approach uh between wales and uh england and clearly there will continue uh to be and we will continue to coordinate i know that my predecessor coordinated on a very regular basis with his welsh counterpart and also when it comes to transport we the three of us my welsh counterpart myself will work carefully uh with the secretary of state for transporting you madam deputy speaker um the it's hugely significant and welcome that the link between uh cases and hospitalization does seem to be broken by the vaccines i'd like to echo what my honourable friend from nesbros just said haribo nesboro and can my right honourable friend assure me that notwithstanding the risks he's pointed out such as potential variants and increased cases that that focus that the nhs will have the focus and the resources to continue to to on that backlog to to bear down on the backlog as my right honourable as my honourable friend said when cases like cancer which are scaring my constituents and and everyone yeah yes madam speaker i can give my honorable friend that assurance and the the the backlog already at five million and as i've said today it's unfortunately uh going to get a lot worse than that before it gets better i think we can all understand why uh but today's announcement i think would have certainly have helped her in in our march to clear that uh backlog uh my old friend will know that the government has given significant additional funding in the billions to help with that uh but there will be a lot more to come in dealing with the priorities especially cancer neil hanvey speaker all of the warm words from the secretary of state towards the nhs at the top of his statement have been completely demolished by his attitude towards breast cancer surgeon but he says that she should know better when the reality is that she does know better and he should apologize to the all right honorable member from central airship for those absolutely outrageous comments and to use the escalation of cases in scotland as a political tool is absolutely disgraceful i want to talk about this madam deputy speaker i do not agree with the honourable gentleman we now go to mark harper uh thank you very much madam deputy speaker and i apologize for any uh discourtesy to the house in not being able to be here in person the prime minister has confirmed that there will be contingency measures in place uh for winter and even if they're not legal restrictions they will have that effect on business can the secretary of state confirm what they are and publish the detail so members can scrutinize them at the earliest opportunity madam deputy speaker i can tell my one or more friend the i believe what her he's referring to is that we will be keeping in place uh contingency measures uh and particularly for local authorities the so-called number three regulations at least until the end of september in case those powers are needed uh in the case of a a local uh breakout and of course there's there's no intention at this point that those powers will be used but we believe that it is necessary uh to have powers in place uh uh just in case he would have heard me earlier uh talk about the risk that still exists uh from uh new variants and uh and and that is the uh plan uh but i'll be happy to discuss with him further we now go to caroline lucas thank you madam deputy speaker can the secretary of state explain why when other public health and safety measures aren't left up to individuals to decide he thinks that's an appropriate approach to covid failing to mandate mask wearing and stuffy crowded places like public transport where people are often pressed together for much longer than 15 minutes risks high costs allowing people to choose whether or not to put others at risk is both reckless and unfair if the freedom to pelt down the motorway at 100 miles an hour is restricted because it poses risks to others why with millions still unvaccinated with some immunosuppressed and with the risks of long covets rising why does the health secretary not apply the same logic secretary of state madam deputy speaker can i say to the honorable lady i do understand where she's coming from but the important things we do have to learn to live with covid and that does mean that these restrictions that have been necessary up until now that we have to at some point confront them and start removing them and now is the best time to do that because of the defense that has been built by the vaccine sir desmond sway we will never again sacrifice free enterprise freedom of association and indeed freedom of worship in order to manage hospital admissions ever again will we madam deputy speaker i i take it from that that my one honorable friend is pleased with today's announcements speaker some have suggested that removing all restrictions in the way that the secretary of state has announced we'll create factories for new variants in parts of our communities so what advice has the secretary of state received from experts about the potential for new variants and what contingencies has he planned for containing such an outbreak if one were to occur madame deputies week the honourable gentleman would have heard in my uh statement earlier that that no course of action that we take now is without risk i think the honourable gentleman uh understands that and it is because there is still a pandemic as i said the pandemic is not over that we of course will continue to first monitor for new variants we will continue to have border restrictions in place we will continue to have some test trace and isolate procedures in place and uh and i think these measures taken together with the success of the vaccine program uh is the is the best answer to his question uh we now go to david simmons who i think is going to be audio only madame deputy speaker one head teacher in my constituency tells the tale of losing more than 2 700 days of education 390 children sent home and zero transmission amongst pupils in school so can my right honourable friend assure me that swift action will be taken to ensure that children can get back to school head teachers can get back to teaching as soon as possible without the damage the current situation is creating yes madam deputy speaker i can give my honourable friend that assurance and the education secretary will be saying more uh later this week but i can confirm to my honourable friend that on july the 19th it is our plan to remove bubbles and to end the requirement for early years setting schools or colleges to routinely carry out contact tracing and we i will have more to say on how we intend to exempt under 18s who are close contacts from the requirement to self-isolate grady speaker given that masks help reduce the spread not just of covert but all kinds of respiratory diseases isn't it important to avoid mixed messages and actually encourage everyone to continue that kind of practice and the likes of good hand hygiene as a relatively routine part of a new normal to stop coughs and sneezes from spreading diseases deep state mana deaf speaker i think what the honourable gentleman is suggesting is that people should have the freedom to wear a mask if they wish but it should not be mandatory it should not be mandated uh by law and there are countries yeah i lived in singapore for three years where uh people uh would wear masks if they were feeling unwell out of respect for others and if people choose to do that here that that'll be a good thing but it won't be a requirement from the government and uh and as i said earlier that in in certain settings in a crowded place let's say on the tube in london i think many people despite not being a legal required would choose to wear masks we now go to caroline noakes thank you madam deputy speaker the immunosuppressed want to know what the plan is for them will they be allowed tests for spike antibody levels on the nhs and will they be able to get a booster before september if their antibody tests show they have no protection despite being vaccinated madam deaf speaker it's an important question for my right honourable friend and we are still uh considering uh what more we can do to to to give more confidence to the immune suppressed and we will be saying more on this shortly we now go to paul blonfield thank you madam deputy speaker um until recently ministers were saying decisions would be would be based on the link between infection and hospitalization although the link has been weakened it's not been broken hospitalizations are up 20 in the last week they've doubled in a month we all want here to unlock the economy but surely we should maintain barriers to infection where we can the secretary of state has said that wearing masks would be a good thing so will he accept that requiring them on public transport in essential shops and in similar locations would make sense and would reassure people hey madam deputy speaker no one is suggesting that the link between cases and hospitalization because of the vaccines has been completely broken what i've said and and this is the the fact based on the evidence that we are seeing is that it has been significantly weakened and that is uh clear uh from the data we're getting on a daily basis if you look in england the case rate of 25 000 i think less than 2 000 people uh currently with covid in hospital which is far far lower than what we've seen before when we had such a high case rate mary robinson thank you london deputy speaker i'm grateful to the secretary of state for his uh his statement today setting out the way forward in 150 years since the foundation of cheatles together trust is championed and cared for people from 18 to 30 years old with disabilities meeting with their dedicated team last week it was clear that having navigated the challenges of kobe they're preparing for the future as a government looks to set out a new vision for the health and social care for health and social care can the secretary of state reassure voluntary and third sector bodies like together trust that they will have their invaluable contribution recognized and be included as equal partners in its design madam deputy speaker i'm very happy to give my honourable friend that a choice the cheadle together trust and many other uh third party and voluntary organizations across the country really stepped up during the pandemic when the country most needed it and uh we will continue to work with them and i think at the at a suitable moment we should give them the recognition that they deserve thank you speaker it's a dereliction of duty by the secretary of state for health to tell people to live with the virus whilst denying people the basic financial and other support that they need in two weeks time with restrictions lifted there could be over 60 000 cases per day the government says it will surge further huge numbers are denied the self-isolation payments tens of thousands of people each day will be forced to isolate on statutory sick pay of just 96 pounds per week so i ask the secretary of state for health could he live on 96 pounds per week deputy speaker it's right that we provide support including financial uh support uh for those that are isolating and finding things difficult and we will continue to do so and we will keep that under review dr luke evans madam deputy speaker i'd like to draw the house's attention to a story over the weekend of three batches of astrazeneca vaccines affecting 5 million people and the prospects of traveling to the eu i must declare an interest i've vaccinated many people with this batch and indeed had the batch myself so can he confirm that this is purely a bureaucratic issue that the vaccines are exactly the same and update the house over what talks he's had with the eu to resolve this problem first can i thank my honorable friend for the work that he's personally been doing during the pandemic and what i can tell not all doses that are used in the uk have been subject to very rigorous safety and quality checks including individual batch testing and physical site inspections and this is all done by the medical regulator mhra we now go to ben bradshaw given americans and other europeans have already been free to travel again for some time and given we were promised a vaccine dividend when can the millions of british families separated from loved ones abroad or simply who want a foreign holiday expect to receive the same freedoms back that other europeans and americans already enjoy madame deputy speaker i can tell the honourable gentleman very very soon and the secretary of state for uh transport will have more to say on this very shortly steve brown thank you last week i said i wanted to see a change of policy as well as tone from the new secretary of state and we have that today or at least an indication of such for next monday and i and i'm grateful for it can i ask my right boyfriend to give us some insight into his thinking about the future of test and trace surely it can't continue as now with context of contacts even if double vaccinated forced into isolation for ten days at a time with all the knock-on effects that that has for society and economy madam deputy speaker i will be making a statement to parliament on just that issue and i think i will probably make it tomorrow we now go to debbie abrahams madam deputy speaker last december professor sir michael marmot revealed that the high and unequal covert death toll across england was down to historic structural inequalities that successive conservative governments have allowed to go and check and last week he quantified this and showed that greater manchester had a 25 percent higher covet death toll because of these structural socioeconomic inequalities so when will the health secretary deliver on the prime minister's promise to me in january in terms of implementing sir michael's recommendations to address these inequalities in my constituency and others and will ensure that we bill back secretary fairer state madam deputy speaker it's an important issue that the honourable lady has raised and we have seen sadly through this pandemic because of various inequalities up and down the country some people have suffered a lot more than others so it is an important point and we do need to do more we do need to all collectively uh learn from this and i want to give her the assurance that i know the public health england and the and the cmo the chief medical officer are looking into this and we'll be reporting to ministers shortly final question hugh merriman thank you very much madam deputy speaker i welcome this statement from the secretary of state can i just ask for clarity um the legal requirement to wear face coverings including on public transport it states we advise this as a voluntary measure for crowded and enclosed spaces should that be crowded in closed spaces and does he intend to put out guidance and what will he do to ensure that private operators can't mandate it um outside of that guidance thank you madam definitely speak i can tell my original friend it's the the guidance is is really asking people to use their common sense that if there are many other people around them uh particularly if the if the people around there might be more vulnerable let's say older people uh or for some reason people that may be as a group and vaccinated then we're just really saying use your common sense i think everyone is in britain uh will will do uh just that in terms of uh private settings it will be up to private businesses you know shops uh for example uh to decide uh what they wish to do i thank the secretary of state for his statement and will suspend the house for one minute to make arrangements for the next business you ,False,False,False,False

Asia Leaders (HEAL) Programme, this session was the first of a four-part webinar series and took place on Tuesday, 2 March ...",rating today's session all right let's continue with the recording today's session is precision public health transforming health with data this webinar is part of a series that dr jeremy lin will tell you more about it's called health care executive in asia leaders or heal program and is supported by the temasek foundation thank you to tamasek in partnership with the american chamber of commerce in singapore which i represent i'm also an adjunct associate professor at the nus saw sweethawk school of public health and i'm a trained genetic epidemiologist it's great to be here with you guys today our other panelists are professor jeremy lim associate professor and u.s sofie hawk school of public health director of the leadership institute for global health transformation also known as light co-founder and ceo of amelie the first dedicated gut microbiome full service company in southeast asia if you want to know how to spell it it's a-m-i-l-i you can look that up very cool and of course professor lim has a special interest in ways that technology can increase health equity and access to care i'm also pleased to welcome assistant professor nina schwab principal visiting fellow international institute for global health at united nations university adjunct assistant professor at helbrunn department of population and family health at the mailman school of public health columbia university professor schwalbe also chairs the evaluation advisory committee at gavi the vaccine alliance and co-leads who's research network on covid in educational institutions and finally we have professor gareth banum thank you so much for joining head western australian register of developmental anomalies clinical geneticist genetic services of western australia program director undiagnosed diseases program western australia government of western australia department of health professor banum also leads the clinical implementation of genomic and phenomic objective phenotyping digital health technologies and omics associated policy and i had to pull that sentence out of his bio because i'm intrigued by every other word in that and i'm sure we'll learn more from him later in his presentation thank you so much again for joining us we have a really exciting conversation about precision public health coming up and so now i'd like to invite professor lim to give us the opening about precision public health thank you thank you sian and a very good morning uh good evening to all of you wherever you are i am just starting to share my screen uh just let me do know if you can see it up nicely said everything's good okay so and before i jump into the presentation proper let me just share that this is the first in in a in a in a four-part series um that's supported by the thomasic foundation and the impetus for this was really covid19 and which which has the first pandemic in a hundred years richly illustrates how health is in everything and everything does affect health so this entire series really explores the impact taken the impact of decisions taken by leaders across both inside and outside health and how public health decisions can affect and interestingly many investors many corporate leaders have approached the school to say teach us more about public health we've suddenly realized we need to know a heck a lot more than what we used to know and that it's becoming very critical and in fact interestingly uh quite a number of uh colleagues and friends who are in executive search firms have started to ask uh about this notion of having a chief health officer in large corporates whose traditional businesses have nothing to do with health so this is our effort to contribute to the really thought leadership and to bring like-minded people together and as you said today we are starting with precision public health and transforming health with data we're going to go on next to talk about food and talk and then about urban planning and about this notion of really health promoting cities and finally we will end the series by talking about what the lancet commission describes as the commercial determinants of of health and and hopefully through this mini four patter it gives you a nice flavor already what is out there and how important it is for all of us in health to know about the wider world out there and for the wider world to know enough about health because every decision they make whether to reopen borders even reopen cinemas have got profound health impact so now let's dive into today's topic which is around precision public health and i must thank gareth and his colleagues from from australia who had introduced me to this concept that i was really really um really intrigued by because it's almost as oxymoronic as as talking about personalized population health the whole notion of what we as public health professionals think about this is that we care about the health of populations and in a sense we necessarily almost have to box people into one box a one size fits all or into a finite number of boxes because it's just pragmatically easier right but i hope that after this 90 minutes um webinar you're firmly convinced that we can break out of this traditional paradigm right and really truly talk about precision public health because today's technology does allow us to do so in profoundly different different ways so what is precision public health there are many many definitions uh let me just simplify it um by borrowing from mueller who is the head of the center for uh who is head of the cdc's office of public health genomics and essentially it's about the right intervention at the right time every time to the right population and as nina will will share and guarantee that's a huge component around the digital signatures of individuals that use a geospatial location um and and and really and really infusing genetics into this so it's uh so precision public health is not narrow it's very holistic and it takes the sum total of the information we have about individuals about populations so how then do we make it real but before i go into that um skeptics have said that precision public health is really old wine in new sheepskins and that is really nothing and it's really no big deal we've always wanted to be precise i mean it's almost like really precision medicine which of us as physicians don't want to give the right treatment to the right patient every time what i would submit to you is that this time around it's different and it's different because the technologies and the and the data sets allow us to think about public health in completely different ways many of you will be old enough to remember the era of broadcast television right where you would uh and those of you really old enough will will remember the the series dallas and how who killed j.r ewing was the talk of the town for months and months because uh it just had to be one size fits all the really broadcasting service pushed out soap operas and other content at a fixed time and you caught it or you didn't catch it and then it comes along netflix comes along disney class and it essentially offers you the opportunity not just to have content at the time that you want it but content that's tailored and customized to you so we live in a world that's very different if we look at it from a data perspective right and think about it in terms of collecting data analyzing data and using data all in real time so advances in computing advances in sensor technology advances in connectivity allow us to think about public health in completely different ways and hence public health truly this time has the opportunity to be precise so what's happening around the world i have put up this slide just to really quickly illustrate the point that precision public health is not something for the rich world yes very wealthy countries like the us can can infuse programs like all of us research where there's genetic sequencing digital phenotyping and and so on but even in the so-called developing world in low and middle income countries um it's really around using data to make better decisions at the individual and active and at the community or at the population level and two years ago the rockefeller foundation launched 100 million dollar precision public health initiative and essentially um in my conversations with the rockefeller foundation it was really crystallized into we have 10 nurses we have a thousand patients where should these tendernesses go and that's as simple as it gets but yet so important and so profound so let me uh give her let me whisk through a couple of examples because really my role to kick the series off is really to give you a sense of the breath and and i thought i would start with personalized population health and breast cancer screening right we're all familiar with breast cancer screening guidelines at our age and and the better guidelines would try to divide individuals into normal risk and high risk and the wisdom study one of the more recent studies really tries to look at individual risk based on based on really genetic profile based on family history and then customize what is the screening regime that would be appropriate for this person and if it works well then we could really think about how to screen in much more efficient ways and remember that at the population level national or global screening programs making one small change removing one screen affects millions and potentially billions saudi so the savings in time the savings in are really resources are truly massive and this then allows these resources to be channeled elsewhere and i know nina nina's gonna talk a lot about the geospatial focus uh let me just share this slide that's from the bill and melinda gates foundation and it made the observation that uh 90 percent of the disease burden spread by the mosquito the 80s egyptian can be managed by focusing on 14 percent of the total surface area or the total land area across the world right and this sort of overlay of of geospatial and other data points onto traditional public health issues gives us a lot of potential to have a much greater bang for buck and trust me in the world of public health as covid is again richly illustrating resources a very very finite demand is fine but the mind whether it's for testing whether it's for vaccinations is potentially much much larger than that so i wanted to share a little and this example would be familiar to many singaporeans because this was launched last year and it's a joint effort between apple and the singapore government represented by the health promotion board in a nutshell is personalized health promotion think of all the uh spooky potentially sinister nudges that social media may may push to you to get you to click like to get you to watch one more video and ask yourself if we took all these lessons and applied them to do good things to nudge people in real time at skill to improve health right can we do that and that's what this lumi health initiative is really all about it gamifies health offers persons the opportunity to take part in social challenges to earn points and to then get rewards right and in a year or two we will have very rich data as to to understand whether this works and for what sort of populations that this works well in um i do want to talk about mental health a little bit also because this is all of the rage and rightly so mental health has been characterized by being difficult to study being expensive and quite interestingly technologies allow us for the first time to think about population mental health surveillance passively meaning there's no active intervention needed at skill and quite inexpensively and i wanted to introduce this notion of digital phenotyping and i think that the online definition that comes out of the th chance school of public health is a good one it talks about the moment by moment quantification of individual level human phenotypes from personal digital devices now add up all of this and we have population mental health surveillance and in the two examples that i put out here the first is a voice based classifier of ptsd that's been that has been validated and used and this dates back to 2012. today we have startups and young companies such as such as mind strong which is a company in the in the us that looks at one's use of a personal digital device how many times you swipe how many times you turn on what are the haptic pressures the error rates and really so on and this then gives a gives a sense of the individual state of mind and again accumulates all of this and can we so can we passively conduct mental health surveillance at the population level especially high-risk populations uh young people migrant workers and and really so on so i and i wanted to end off with a last example and i and i took this from from from a friend in deloitte um because deloitte's doing a lot of work in rolling out the vaccine programs in the uk in australia new zealand and so on and i asked them to look at the hesitancy analysis out of out of the social media and and very interestingly um in the interest of time i'll move to this one um if we look at singapore's data starting from august through to through to february um the the share of topics around vaccine hesitancy evolves over time and and time doesn't permit us to to look into the details but but social media tracking gives us a good flavor limited one of many data points that we need to build in but it gives us an understanding of the initial concerns and as we as public health professionals think about vaccine rollouts we need to match demand for vaccines with with supply and with the capability of the vaccination center to roll out so it is a disaster given the upper the logistical challenges with the visor and with the modena vaccines if you if we think that a thousand people are are going to show up but only 500 show up then there'll be huh there will be there'll be 500 there'll be 500 vaccines wasted and this just would be such a real pity when the world is so short and so the challenge then is can we predict out of all the invitees how many are really going to show up by mapping social media commentary and other data points with with the location around the vaccination center those and and heads get a better sense a more accurate sense of what the true demand is right and then match it better to supply and lastly overlay the competency or the capability of the individual vaccination centers because you may have two vaccination centers with exactly the same resources number of doctors number one nurses but their productivity can be very very different and again we are we are in a we are in a pandemic that all of us are desperate to get out of we have to use the vaccines the limited ones we have very very wisely and this is one example of what technology can do so i wanted to close with this with this uh since i just had to spend very good money to subscribe to disney plus for my youngest kid i wanted to show uh those of you who are of my vintage will remember the movie minority report where the system predicts who is going to commit crimes and and preemptively and proactively arrest perpetrators before the crime is committed and i wanted to share that as we move into the era of precision public health remember that the mind of man is capable of anything we must not just embrace technology but bring in the ethical conversations uh set in place the guide rails because with great power comes great responsibility and on this note thank you very much again the time back to cnn thank you thank you very much jeremy you've covered a wide range of tools technologies various disease states um it's going to be very interesting to look into it more deeply and we already have a couple of questions i myself have a number of questions but i think it would be best for us to have all of our speakers go through and share with us their point of view on precision public health and the work that they have been doing so we get a bigger broader picture of precision public health then let's bring everyone together to for the discussion so next i'd like to invite professor schwab to you know share her thoughts on precision public health there we go unmuted great that's a relief thank you so much i'm really pleased to be here uh with you today sorry i just have a small um just gotta fix my zoom stuff sorry about that your slide looks great from our side it's just frozen there we go is that the is that the front slide is that what you're seeing excellent thank you so much so i would like to thank uh shen chen and eliza and jeremy for inviting me here today uh the saucy hawk school of public health and also amcham singapore it's a real honor uh to be speaking to you from from new york city uh you know jeremy gave a great introduction to what is precision public health and for me what's so exciting about it is this ability to target interventions uh to focus on reducing health disparities and really use multiple types of data to to better allocate resource and better ideally improve health outcomes uh a lot of the words in the center of this slide were used in in gareth's introduction so i won't even attempt to try to pronounce them but again as jeremy put it the idea is right time right place right approach and we hope that these data will inform and actually improve decision making because resources in health at least until the beginning of covid were extremely limited and we have to maximize not only those resources but also time and effort so this idea of risk stratifications how do we figure out who's most at risk and what do we need to do to reduce their risk um you know on a very basic level i think i first really visualized this idea just by using basic maps and this was an example from malawi i was worked at unicef for many years and it's sort of saying super simple idea instead of looking at national averages we have to look at what's happening district by district and then we know that instead of doing a national program for example to reduce under five mortality we can really target our our resource to district at highest risk which is the dark the dark centered slide and dig down deeper on what's actually going on there specifically if you'd asked me to speak a year ago i think literally a year ago i would have been uh an incredible evangelist for all the technologies at our at our i'm still an evangelist i just didn't focus other things but i would have been an evangelist of all the promise of geospatial mapping the internet of things the example that jeremy just gave genomics and how we can be really precise and understand how diseases are traveling and what individual level things are happening and also just the use of electronic health records which are now pretty pervasive in the ability of them to help us pool data get big data and share data now of course data sharing and i think we'll get into this in the discussion you know one of the barriers for precision public health is the challenges to data sharing their technical challenges motivational people don't always want to share some people own data so the idea of data sharing is problematic there because they want to sell it their political challenges people don't don't want to share their data because it shows shows bad things about them legal challenges on individual basis and then sometimes ethical of selling people's data without without their permission and and i wrote an article last year uh in the lancet on the use of ai for low-income countries um filled with with promise and on on data and data sharing and governance and then covet 19. and and i'm going to give you an example and i realize again i'm extremely honored to to be speaking to you um today you know i was looking at the numbers of singapore at least according to our world and data you know you've had 29 deaths which i is is tragic and i you know and i i'm sorry deeply sorry for every family that's lost a member of their family due to covid to just put that in the perspective of new york you've had 29 deaths in singapore we've had 29 000 deaths in new york city alone just in new york city and a lot of that happened quite early in the pandemic but not only you have a population of about 5.7 uh million people according again to the internet i hope that's correct and we have a population of about 8.3 so certainly not to justify that order of magnitude of the number of deaths um so i want to talk to you a little bit about vaccine distribution in new york which is something i've been quite involved in i've worked in global health my whole life i was actually supposed to be in malaysia all month um at the united nations university um and and in the last year i've been grounded as we all have and really focused my efforts locally on new york city and new york state um and so as you know the vaccine just rolled out we got our first doses at the end of december and it was very limited uh the eligibility were very limited in the beginning and then suddenly expanded for political reasons quite right so we have 14 of new yorkers have been vaccinated already we have about 4.5 million new yorkers 4.5 million who are eligible despite limited supply and people have there's been a number of articles which have been called the vaccine hunger games because of how people are trying to get vaccinated so let's let's go back to the data and what we knew and maybe how we could have done this better um so what we know this is data from the cdc can you see your faces on the top of the screen when i screen share or just the slide no just the slides that's the slide excellent so what we know from this is a slide from the cdc what we know about deaths in america are that older people 65 and older are considerably more likely to die of covid if they get coveted to factors of up to you know almost eight thousand so incredible risk here and we know uh we know that that's also the same for new york so this slide slows shows what's happening in new york city or what's happened in new york city this is a rate per thousand in the population and we see exactly the same as what we see nationally we see that older new yorkers are at much higher risk similarly this is what we know from the cdc which is our national disease control agency around risk of death by race or active or ethnicity we know that people who are black or hispanic are at least two to three times or two to two times more likely to to die from covid and we again see that exactly the same in new york as evidenced by this um slide we also know a lot about who lives where in new york city and where people are dying we have very strong we've always had a commitment in the city to to to equity in terms of how we think about designing our public health program and collect data at a very granular level which is then made widely available for analysis so what you see on the left here is uh socioeconomic status and race and and the top dark green is the darker or richer areas of new york and the darker purple are whiter areas of new york which is also associated here with socioeconomic status and on the other side the pink side what you see is the deaths uh and what you would expect to see i guess uh given that we have racial and social inequity uh in particular in new york city but also across the united states of america is you would expect to see just what you see here the richer whiter parts of the us are less likely to die they're not in the high mortality areas of new york and we have data on other social determinants which we can also map together rent burden households was a very important statistic or data source to look at early in the pandemic because of household crowding and what we knew from the early wuhan data about close household contacts uh similarly we know data on race and the bottom we know about people's professions then the question is what does this do to inform our decision making so we know a lot about the data on vaccine on on on who's dying where and why so this is a slide i pulled up um you know i have come to a strategic decision i'm going to pretend the data don't exist and that is unfortunately pretty much what we've seen in new york and this is an example so on the left we have uh the people who the districts that have a higher concentration of receipt of first dose of vaccine this is population adjusted and on the right we have that same death rate so what we would hope to see here is that the darker areas in the blue would correspond to the darker areas in the pink that would mean that we were vaccinating people in the highest risk districts unfortunately and i've circled two examples that's not what we've seen this is a very simple way this isn't particularly precision public health this is just normal boring old public health but we see that in new york 55 percent of the population is white they represent 40 percent of those 30 000 deaths but 78 percent of people have been vaccinated if we look at the black population they represent 14 percent of the total population 23 percent of deaths so they're over represented as what we say in public health we would expect them all things being equal to have the same percent of deaths as the population but that's not true because of the social determinants and inequities and only nine percent of those being vaccinated so and i think going back to jeremy's boxes we have a lot of boxes which give us a lot of data and we have a lot of data on a lot of determinants and somehow we really just have failed in using precision public health to deliver vaccines in new york city now i'm going to give you a slightly more positive example i hope or one that i hope will end up being a positive example um uh again as i don't know i i only read sort of delay and sit i've really restricted my reading to one journal a couple um so i don't really read the news but sometimes i pick it up or see it in the morning my kids are reading the newspaper and schools are a big deal here the the evidence and i chair a committee at who on evidence around schools you know the evidence basically show around the world that um that that schools are a reflection of community transmission they don't drive community transmission um but uh but there's a big panic around what happens when we send our kids to school and as part of that very early in the pandemic um there was a decision in new york city that any two cases in one classroom would close the classroom and any two cases in the school would close the school and the school would have to quarantine for two weeks so we have about uh over a million kids in new york alone and about 25 percent opted for in person learning you could opt either in or out the the graph here is the data from the department of education website which we've made as public health people a prayer to the new mayor to say please bring health back to the department of health because these data are certainly not precise enough to be very helpful if you look at the number of schools that have closed it's wild and all over the city and we have i mean schools are closing like ping pong balls because of this definition of cases two cases in a school and our hypothesis as public health people is that and what we found from the contact tracing when we do it after the school closes because that has to happen after the school closes is that those cases are unrelated so two kids come to school infected and happen to be in school but this is not an outbreak in school and what's really exciting and this is where i'm i'm very positive and and maybe gareth and and and jeremy you can put together a singapore program to come help us in in new york but we have some new labs in new york city which are going to use genomic sequencing to sort of prove that these outbreaks and have started to show that these outbreaks are not outbreaks they're different they're different cases that are both being brought to school but it's not an outbreak within the school so we're extremely excited about this this program moving forward so i think our challenge here is sort of how do we get the data ball rolling up the policy hill and sisyphus you know was always rolling that ball up the hill and this cartoon says when you've got a minute i'd like to discuss progress with you and uh you know we don't feel like we're making very much um and i think the first challenge that we face is how do we convince policymakers to follow the data the example i showed you was really clear it wasn't rocket science it wasn't ai it wasn't machine learning it's just sort of mapping and zip codes and geospatial planning and depth data it's pretty simple stuff but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be driving decision making and that's that's something that i think we just weren't expecting took us by surprise and then i think um this idea about how do we share data and certainly in the beginning of the pandemic that's been very hard and particularly around hospital data and death in new york i think what we've learned here is that we have such a decentralized system of healthcare and it's so privatized that it has been really hard to get people to share data and i wanted to take that out that that is not only here there's there's a there's a website called global health 5050 that looks at gender data and i mean i'm just shocked to see that you know out of the 192 countries uh that report data to the u.n you know really just a little over half are reporting sex disaggregated data so so i think also there's going sort of back to basics about if we really want to do good global precision public health we have to figure out ways to incentivize people to share data both big data ai machine learning all of that so that we can do some of the sentiment analysis that jeremy spoke to but also uh small data like gender so with that i'll end and i thank you for your time thank you so much nina i know you said that some of the data you showed was normal old boring public health but you got me super excited about about public health again just looking at you know very basic percentage of death mortality rates tells us so much and with precision public health it's the world of possibilities seems endless and with that i'd like to invite now professor bainham for your presentations and point of view on precision public health thank you very much there's beautiful talks by jeremy and and nina such brilliant work and thank you so much for the invitation i'm having a tech fail here i've actually i've managed to share my screen but now i can't scroll through my slides so i'm just figuring out why that is the case oh here it goes just a lag okay good oh so you can read this far far faster than i can talk through it um and i think really skipping to the bottom of this thinking about one planet and one human race and and really what perspective does when we lift our eyes and think about the and think about it and think about the globe and our diversity and our and our and our commonality this is of course a quote from a space traveler but it's not from an asteroid it's not from buzz aldrin or one of the other three that landed on the moon it's in fact from stephen hawking um and stephen traveled with his mind through space and in effect through through time and i want to take one perspective actually i'm going to talk very little about genetics or genomics today despite being a geneticist who does genomic stuff i'm going to talk a little bit about rare diseases which are paradoxically really common and we know that up to half 50 of inpatient hospital costs in the us are attributable to rare diseases we know that in ireland six in ten deaths are attributable to rare diseases and nine in ten hospital inpatient bed days are tribute to rare diseases and these numbers are similar across the across the developing countries um and it'll be increasingly the case in low and middle-income countries with demographic transitions we also know from last week that the cost of rare diseases direct and indirect costs um was one trillion or just under one trillion us dollars in 2019 so more expensive than cancer diabetes alzheimer's heart attack and stroke etc if we put all the different rare diseases people together each living with one of their many different up to eight thousand rare diseases we stuck them in a country that would be rare disease land and it'd be the third biggest country in the world so china india rare disease land everything else for people with rare diseases or more common diseases many things are about finding the right path and if you don't have the right language to have the discussions to make the understandings then how can you navigate how can you have the right path how can you get accurate information about vaccines or dispel myths about vaccine uptake or about vaccine side effects or or wi-fi or whatever the messaging might need might need to be so in 2019 as part of the united nations international year of indigenous languages we started thinking about building a universal indigenous medical translator and so we reached out to to unesco and said can we do this as part of can you will you uh endorse this and very gratefully they said yes and so we thought well how we're going to do this we think it's really important we need to sort of reimagine how we can do this how we can do this at scale because there are 400 million people or just under who speak an indigenous language globally it's all about making health care more accessible and reducing health inequities so we thought well why don't we connect youth to other to multiple generations to their senior community members and their elders because if so we can transmit knowledge across generations we can help retain and empower language um we can reconnect to cult to culture and so every age will feel good about that so we started by identifying champions and this is yellow thomas he's an incredibly remarkable medical student come so many other things and uh so we supported him to really work in this space um and start the life languages program and also which is what we've called this program and also to blend that with other technologies like facial analysis anyway so yellow started and you can see the little red circle in the in the middle in the middle slide um the block this is 300 kilometers east of a place called port hedland which will take you about 22 hours to drive to from the from from our capital city because we're the world's single largest public health jurisdiction geographically we've got about a kilometer per square kilometer square per person we have two and a half million people and two and a half million square kilometers and really he worked with his community to do these translations and then several other champions indigenous champions across australia joined in to work on other languages and then it spread internationally so there's some of our ghanaian life language champions and and in this case we see people who are their mental health experts allied health experts their computer scientists their doctors their media and promotions people all working together with it with their with a shared purpose and then it was like well there's all this human effort going all this hand jamming all these excel spreadsheets and on whatnot how do we scale this so then it was about the digital health piece and what digital technology can we use to aggregate and present this this information in different ways so then we started bringing together these different youth and their and their community and their community members and then we start and so we started first with a language uh younger mother language which is yellow loose language and tui which is the most prominent indigenous language in ghana and then really sort of build a portal and this is the first stage of an app to really sort of aggregate all those translations and then provide ways to represent that information for whatever use case you wanted to because it's one thing to ascertain a translation is another to implement it and it's another not to burn out people doing the translations so this is a way to re-implement for whatever public health issue whatever disease domain whatever age stage you wanted and also to build uh education resources discreetly around that that talk in aboriginal or indigenous narratives at the back of this is how we manage the knowledge so we also wanted to make this all computer readable um so that we could we could bring in new other technologies we could combine it with genomics or facial analysis or with ai and text mining and so at the heart of this you can see we take the medical terminology here's macrocephaly big head here's the lay translation big head here's the younger mata word for big head gender where to and here's the computer readable standardized term hpo000256 so now we can fuse community knowledge medical knowledge and technology to deliver solutions and everything's about trust nothing is as fast as trust nothing is as inspiring as trust nothing is efficient and sustainable as trust or if you want to talk about um was it the commercial determinants of health i love that term then nothing is as profitable as trust another trust mechanic was really about which uses spatial technology blended with other things is this incredible thing called mapper and what this is was where the community again is aggregated to provide solutions using precision health technologies so in the first instance we talked about this language and this build out of this universal indigenous translator which were then applied to covert messaging and for instance implemented covert messaging in communities within 48 hours from deciding to do it to disseminating it throughout the communities in multiple different languages in the supermarkets in their community locations etc this is another solution where the community has got together and built the solution so this is the aboriginal health council of wa represents all the aboriginal health control organizations which are all the all the medical providers of health care for aboriginal people dispersed against that 25 2.5 million square kilometer space and so what they really wanted to do was to use spatial technology combined with other technologies to get the right care right place right time to help with better with referrals identification travel follow up care care on country so you don't have to travel and and more culturally appropriate care to do things to build in things like what are the rhythm road conditions like what are the ceremonial times that will prohibit you from going to a certain place at a at a certain time where are when is the next visiting specialist going to arrive in our town for our heart service so for instance this is a satellite view of of of of the map of the map of platform you can see there's a whole host of um medical providers in there be they aboriginal controlled health organizations for their hospitals be their mental health where they drug and alcohol be they visiting specialists all aggregating the data into one place to make it available for patients and clinicians to use and so this is a this is if you drag down to a particular this is where maya this is uh the locust local health service to yellow lose to yellow loose to yellow's family um and if you want to know where then when cardiology is next visiting and where the nearest clinics are that they'll be visiting two to where you are then you can influence putting cardiology and put in your location and bring these up and it'll tell you the times the places who's coming etc it tells you about place and what's actually in those in those services it tells you about what the services provide who they're staffed by what their telehealth options are what the cultural elements and the weather elements are it builds itineraries for you if you need to travel so for instance if you wanted to go from port headland to perth um you would then have a tour out you would have a you know a bus a bus followed by a two hour flight followed by a taxi followed by a walk and it will plan it all out for you and then again to build trust what's the cultural elements what are the specific elements of the community and about how you engage with the community so you know those in advance so that you can you can you can adapt to your delivery style your communication to that because in the end if we don't uh if we don't uh approach culture and we and and we don't work with culture then then we can't deliver the most efficient care so then really what we do is start to move to merge these different technologies these different precision public health technologies so right now we're merging mapper and life languages so for instance when you go into life languages and you drill down to sections you'll have translations of various sections in language depending on who you are and where you're coming where you're coming from we blend it with our 3d facial analysis technology for instance uh you remember i showed there was this computer-readable code this step this precision medicine lingua francois called the human phenotype ontology our facial analysis also spits out these terms so we can take a 3d photo of a face and spit out standardized text descriptors which you can then fuse with text genomic information or or text mind information so we combine face space and place and really that's about capturing harnessing working with the voice of the of the people the voice of the indigenous people the voice of the doctors combining with ancient wisdom building in new technology to give us answers community and empowerment its artificial intelligence meets ancient intelligence it's scale and equity it's immediate and it's sustainable so my question to you is how will you help will you become a life languages champion partner to an indigenous champion to help will you support the technology development or the people well you think about how this could be connected to other aspects or could how this could be used could this be used for instance as we're starting to do now for covert vaccine messaging with our life languages program as we're starting to do that in in western australia and in ghana could we be partnering to do that elsewhere in the globe i'm sure there are many other ways that people can help and so please reach out and thank you very much thank you so much gareth i want to remind everyone that we are taking questions so please now take the time the presentations are concluded with by our wonderful speakers so please take the time to leave your questions in the q a and i do notice a couple of folks with their hands up so if you wouldn't mind just popping your question in the q a we will definitely get to them but i'm actually going to bring us back a little bit to a higher level conversation about precision health just as a reminder i have to admit i was a little obsessed over the last year with trying to define precision public health and then over the last few months and after listening to you speak i've decided you know what who cares we don't actually need a definition of precision public health because end of day i don't there is no clear dividing line between precision medicine and precision public health and traditional public health and precision public health but then it brings me to the larger question we have some students and aspiring researchers who are in the audience today if somebody wanted to delve into the land of precision public health what is actually the best way for them to get into it because i'm looking at all of the work that you all have shared and all of it is so fascinating but it makes me wonder aside from the typical public health curriculum you'd have to be a cartographer you'd have to be a linguist it's really intimidating so where would you advise students or aspiring researchers on how to begin their journey into thinking in the precision public health perspective maybe i will start with jeremy on this one yeah thanks jen that's uh that's a difficult question i must say that when we define precision public health as whatever works works this really opens up the entire universe i would really go back to basics and and and really start at the at the important point nina made that resources are finite demand is infinite and really it is the moral responsibility of all of us to to really channel resources to where they are most needed with a particular lens for health equity and for reducing disparities so and if that's the end point then a couple then there are many roads that lead us to precision public health and i would urge the young student to get a get a good foundation in classical public health because you must stand on the shoulders of giants secondly recognize you have to work as part of a team nobody knows all all the necessary skills so learn to work together as part of a team and have that mutual respect i know it's it's quite rich coming from a medical doctor when you're used to thinking we're the center of the healthcare universe but yes we are trying to change that um and and and and really adopt that uh stance of humility and willingness to learn and to be wrong because we are in frontier territory nobody really knows what is the right or the wrong thing to do uh but we have to do something uh the analogy that i like to give is that you're the captain of the titanic looking at the iceberg right in front of you you don't know whether you should turn left or you should turn right but for heaven's sakes you have to turn and back to you sin thank you jeremy what do you think nina how does someone get started in the field of precision public health you're a mute i agree with jeremy that it's quite a difficult question um but i mean i've been struck uh i've been struck also and i think i have my whole career by how important the basics of public health are and i'll give you an example of yesterday uh we're doing a study in elmhurst hospital queens about vaccine hesitancy and we've interviewed about 2 000 health care workers about how they feel about getting the vaccine did they get the vaccine so there's an analysis two parts of the analysis is um to look at sort of the racial effects uh the the the ra to what extent does race affect uh uh vaccine uptake and does what extent does race affect vaccine sentiment so the reason i say this is i was working with some younger researchers who who hadn't really structured in advance uh the question the hypothesis they hadn't really set up the null hypothesis they did a multivariate analysis where they just sort of threw everything in and then got a bunch of stuff nobody does that what are you talking about used to call phishing and sort of had to really step back and say what's your hypothesis what are you trying to and we have to go describe through all those language and so so i think really just starting with the basics allows you to to pick up the rest the world is evolving i didn't i mean when i was in school a couple of people were doing machine learning in the computer lab but that certainly wasn't sort of household household language uh at that point so so for me it's about starting with the basics and i think also um you know and not necessarily the toys and the other part i think the most uh influential work uh in in my career was uh an article again this is back to jeremy's sort of leaning on the shoulders of giants uh uh by mosley and chen on the social determinants of health and and that article changed the whole way i think not just about health but but about life so so i also think really digging down on michael marmet and the social determinants of health is a very important place to start that's great michael marmot social determinants of health and null hypothesis you know i come from the land of genetic epi where everything's gwas and let's just like look to see where things light up still can't come to terms with that sorry about that gareth what your thoughts on how to get started in precision public health i think you know position public health is about equity and it's about scale it's about doing the most for the most and for the most of need so if you're doing that already you're already doing precision public health and there's so many different ways to do that and i think we've seen all the it's just some of the different approaches technologies uh ground uh roots up community approaches that really form part of the nexus that is that is precision probably got so don't be afraid by it you're probably already doing it in some way the the other i think completely agree you want good grounding you want good fundamentals and you've just got to work in a team and the most important members of your team are the community you serve so make sure you're partnering with the community that you serve and then and they're telling you their needs that they need solved and then you go and solve them the other thing is to is to think about don't be afraid of the size of the task because there's lots of ways to contribute so for instance with life languages um it's a big scary thing let's translate all medical terms across the globe into all indigenous languages that's huge right where the hell do you start um and and then you'll be people that don't even speak an indigenous language they might be indigenous but they're not speaking any language but they might want to so we created ways that people can just translate a word when they feel like doing it and anytime and that just becomes part of it and guess what that become and then you're really sort of essentially expert crowd sourcing it or you can get very fancy about your level of involvement so we wanted to make ways that are really easy that you can use anytime anywhere um to to to contribute so just i think you need to just think about jeremy's comments about netflix and the and the previous models think about all the innovative ways that you already are or can can help as well as combining that with the traditional approaches where we all go through university and learn the fundamental schools of public health which is really important but there are so many ways to do it don't be afraid and bitter nike just do it nice thank you so much popular culture in public health awesome the first couple of questions that came through for our speakers actually have to do with the idea of ethics and uh i would just summarize it by calling a science supremacy so it's interesting because you guys maybe tell from my accent that i'm actually chinese-american and so the u.s definitely in the past few years has had a bit of a crisis with believing in scientists and science and so this idea that science is on the resurgence we're not going to listen to science actually does make some people a little bit nervous right because maybe science has superseded religion maybe science has superseded people's basic data privacy and those were the first couple of questions that were asked and i think um jeremy you have begun to answer it in the q a what are your thoughts about science supremacy and it taking precedence over other considerations firstly i would urge everyone to read the financial times article that i have posted in the link i do think harare offers a very thoughtful synthesis of what life one year after covet is and should be and maybe i can tackle some of the questions around data privacy and and really so on also um i i do agree that there should not be data monopolies where we concentrate data and the risk is just too high and i think gareth is very qualified to speak about about federated data models where where each part of the system keeps part of the data but agrees to be able to to connect the data so that in so that when the use case it is meaningful the safeguards are indeed adequate we can then pull the data together but we don't run the risk that in the event of the inevitable cyber security hack the data leak that uh that lives are absolutely ruined because everything i've ever said or done is just out in the open so i i do think that the technology does does offer ways to minim to mitigate or minimize risk but we will not eliminate risk around because it's ultimately not about the science it's about the politics it's about the political leadership right and i think science is one of the factors certainly one of the most important factors when it comes to to really public health by certainly not the only one and i guess uh for us as public health professionals and as voters in our own countries we should hold our governments accountable to higher standards and and really contribute uh the voice into the public space if i can take a second to share that uh last about a week ago the the national university shared the media hits and there were four of us who were who had decided very early on to be friendly to the media once uh at the start of kobit because we were afraid of misinformation before infodemic became a password we were concerned that if we were traditional public health academics and quite media shy then the space would be filled by everybody else and while i was impressed between the four of us in the school of public health there were we did 1500 media interviews over the year 2020 and i guess that's the that's the commitment all of us should be thinking about to make to not just producing good signs but communicating good signs in ways that engage with the broader public yeah thank you so much jeremy i'm going to pick up more on the data piece because that certainly has come up in the questions as well um first of all from a data perspective i think you know there's this concern about the accuracy of data how do we collect the data and also the availability of data i wonder if nina you could comment a bit especially one of the questions from gabriel yan has to do with how quickly data changes certainly we've been caught having to change positioning for example on mass based on the data that you know comes in and our you know understanding evolves and from a data perspective you know there's three there's three things i want to ask you about basically the availability of data right where do we get it is it open source how do we get data the second one is how do we keep on track of it so we can analyze it and the third one is possibly around the you know ethics of how we use the data it's all about data nina tell us the name of my business is data driven strategies so i should be able to complete a reasonable answer um to that and again i i must say that i'm you know i'm we're definitely here a bit shell shocked you know i won't admit that that we're not a bit shell shocked from from from the past year i i i wish i i you know data has to be available to researchers all of it uh and that means de-anonymized and all those things but that that's not it's not really rocket science to do that and you know in the u.s we we really had to fight for data that we could you know race sex age really basic data on comorbidities on on on covid deaths and um and we also haven't been able to share that globally very well so so i know that who now has a science division and the science division run run by a chief scientist is really focused on how do we better govern data so that we can share it and that involves technical solutions like interoperability but also more basic governance solutions on who gets to share and this idea also that we don't have to aggregate it different people can own it and we can reach into it gareth talked about that um and then about responsible use of data so i'm guess i'm moving to the third one i was really what so i think it's great jeremy that you you did that in the us that space was taken very quickly by a bunch of people it was really hard to get into that media space with credible information because i think we learned as has happened throughout the us history we're very good at this with the uk i think uh you know good journalism doesn't sell papers um but good stories do and i was surprised at even in the beginning of the pandemic and so this doesn't how do how did i explain how a virus transmits people didn't know the difference between a virus and a bacteria for example um we had to really go back to basics or what is herd immunity and and so i think we are we need to step back certainly here on a on a very basic uh level of education about about science that we certainly don't have and sorry just to get to the so the data part of that question is that um the other part of education that i've had to do as a public health person is explain what meta-analysis are and and you know the media here very quickly picked up as you all know you're all public health people we have a journal here called mmrw and the cdc produces it and the whole point of that journal is to give the weird case study that like hey i don't i'm a doctor i have no idea what this means i'm going to put it out for the medical community so that we can concentrate on it but this idea that a study shows versus really saying the data show or the evidence show and moving moving people past that so so availability of data is critical for us for researchers and then um you know again the problem here is that everybody became an epidemiologist so there was no quality control on who was publishing what or saying i mean one other example i'll give you is the new york times which i used to subscribe to but i'm protesting still um because the new york times started they said we don't really trust the cdc data we're just going to start our own data analysis site to collect data on kovit so keeping people honest about how they're doing doing the data so i don't have an answer i'm sorry that was a long ramble about how i wish i knew and i'd like to turn the question back to you no no you're not off the hook yet nina i got one more so with the data piece would you say that data is the top priority for precision public health given the complexity of it the need for it is data the top priority for precision public health i'd like to i'd maybe ask gareth on that because it's one part but the community engagement is also a critical part the data on its own is our numbers uh but you have to engage with people to understand what's the meaning of the data what does it mean and that goes back to the null hypothesis you know you have to have a plausible you have to have a plausible hypothesis or theory of change on what what what you're you know what you're trying to achieve gareth over to you yeah what do you think data is not the most important um data is a tool um it's it's an element um and what is most important is the need um so if you understand your need and that comes from working with the community to define what those needs actually are because they'll define the needs and the solutions that need to be delivered then you can aggregate and apply that data in meaningful ways and then data becomes the key element to serving the need but data is just data and more data doesn't mean it's better data and and so it's really how do you how do you make use of that that comes from serving the need and and and working together with the community to figure out what those things actually are in some sort of in some sort of uh in some sort of um meaning meaningful meaningful way so and that's engagement and that's trust um and so i think actually the most important element is trust um if you if you understand the need you have trust you can then do everything else um there are sharing data is not a technical issue um there are plenty of technical solutions to share data data through privacy preserving record linkage data that's federated a new data visit where the algorithms visits the data data that's interoperable through common data elements and standards it you know all these things exist all these things exist it's it's about what you're using it for it's about the needs of the community and that then needs to be because the community is the thing that sways the political uh uh messaging and the political delivery to some degree and depending on where you're at very large degree um and i think one of the other things we've seen in covert locally for instance in wa is is this amazing sort of focus on the importance of public health and saying this is really critical and you know our premier just gets up every time and says we're going to do exactly whatever the public health guys to tell us to do when you open that open this barrier when the public health guys tell us that it's the right thing to do and and yes there's still politics and there's still games and there's still those sorts of things but very you know i would say 90 of the the meaningful decisions are made exactly that exactly that way and i think also key to that has been having um very refined uh sort of almost like a chain of command through to the messaging in the in the media so there's you know it really is um sort of locally it's the chief health officer standing up there with the premier of our state you know side by side and and saying these are the messages coming through us blah and then and then the other public health decisions and other doctors then support that messaging and and and so i i think that's been extraordinarily powerful and it's been i really hope that we can maintain what's happened out of covert in terms of that trust in public health and that trust in in science as one part of the solution that you deliver working together with the community respecting religion respecting all these elements um but i i think you know covert has has has certainly locally whether it persists or not has certainly uh changed the whole political health dynamic um so i think it's really interesting times and maybe gareth can i ask you to comment there's a question from really stephanie about how the team got the buy-in from the indigenous people um was was it a formal process to build trust what are some of the lessons learned that may be extrapolatable to all of us who face this challenge with data sharing getting people to come forward for vaccination and all um just having a chat so um really was saying again i came down to need is like we've got this kind of idea we think it kind of makes sense does it um and and if so what should we build and how should we build it i kind of think we might do this and they're going to go that's not the way we want this thing over here um and then list and then just taking time um so you can you must not rush these things if you have i mean covert can put on obviously time dynamics and things around it but as much as you can you must not rush it and and just let the conversations evolve um and um and and lit and and listen and then do something um and do something discreet and meaningful as quickly as you can um so your return benefit one of the really challenging issues around data management and governance for indigenous people is that so many times there's been no benefit back to the community people have sort of flown in taking some data flown away done something and got a nice science paper and really nothing's happened at the community level so there's this real need to address those those elements of this mistrust but also you get solutions coming out of this so there are now data sharing solution you know there's things called fair findable accessible interoperable reusable data you know now there are also things called care nice acronym um which is the indigenous communities globally getting together and say yeah fear's great you need to think about these these other aspects that relate to indigenous health so these are the care principles and actually you can use the two together um and so i think it's just those those those discussions taking your time don't rush one of the big traps i think is often if we're doing something at a research banner and indeed in often the research funding is a short period a relatively short period of time um and that creates um unwanted dynamics when you're trying to engage and develop a relationship of trust and making sure that your funding actually supports the elders and the senior people and the youth to actually do the stuff because often that's not that hasn't been a focus of the funding it will be we've got x technology why expert and we want to do this for indigenous health um and and the the components of the program that actually make it work get very little or or sub-optimal funding to actually to actually actually do that and to respect the people that you're that you're that that you're working with thank you gareth i also think um we had some questions too that i think are connected to your work with the indigenous populations around you know how do we help the underserved i mean clearly nina showed some data from new york city and it's true across the world that there are huge health inequalities health inequities related to the covet 19 pandemic so i think those are all worth thinking about giving a voice and giving access both you know bi-directionally access to data on these populations so we can understand how to serve them and access for them in terms of covet 19 resources but you know there's a question in here about omics and we we did banter a bit about the omics piece and it's very very specific to covet 19 vaccinations and vaccinations in general so i wonder anita if you could comment i'm actually going to read the questions because it's quite complex but it's very thoughtful are there any comments about a relevant omic right now vaccinomics and averson adversomics it is hard to pronounce these things precision medicine for vaccine effectiveness and safety so for instance for those with rare diseases we don't know how they would respond to the vaccine whether they would have any adverse effects you know what what are the thoughts about these types of omics and application specifically for mass vaccination i mean i guess the question would be around covid or in general because i think covid was done at the speed of light in a way i mean if you look at those trials many of those vaccines weren't even tried on the elderly who were the target population who are the people that are dying the most and as you know as well we haven't tried them on children yet or we're just starting those trials and if we want to reach any sort of herd immunity i mean in the u.s that's uh that's about 25 of the population so so i think in an ideal world we will be able to test subpopulations using everything that we know within our clinical trial work i mean i i actually haven't really thought about it to be honest i think it's a great question and again that's where i'm pulled back a year maybe 10 to say well isn't it remarkable that we're not even using the data that we have which should be driving us in a particular direction to make really simple decisions um and i i think sometimes those discussions can put us a little bit off off base uh off base now i i think uh i think the u.s is also i can it you know this will be a great case study in lots of things in decentralized healthcare systems and why they don't work why you need a centralized health authority but one of the another things that we've done really simple things that you've done brilliantly and most of the rest of the world has is just genotyping of the virus so we didn't do in the u.s surveillance we had this weird thing where we focused on um case percent of positive cases which if you talk to most public health people they go like what um isn't there bias in the denominator uh i mean even our former president trump said that and he got sort of laughed but i think the public health people were thinking isn't there bias in the denominator so using just some basic we weren't doing basic public health surveillance around you know testing every 10th person who went to the supermarket there was no surveillance system in place and theoretically i mean the genotyping jizzaid started that really early we just we just weren't doing that so so yes ideally um i think it's a bit tragic that we can't answer more questions i mean we know for example there's so many questions that we have about the data on the vaccines and the studies and and i guess with covid specifically we're just gonna have to wait some time and hope that those questions are being studied as we now have a massive population roll out agreed it's a it's it's it's almost like how long is a piece of string where do we start um do those vaccines also as you know there was some of the vaccines only tested in the us others primarily in white populations there was a lot i think one one might have done one might have done differently again but given that we are where we are the best thing that we can do is make sure that those trials continue and and and focus on risk risk populations moving forward yeah i i think that then leads to a follow-up question about just um the ability to collect data so after all of these vaccines have gone into arms what is the ability of governments or public health officials academia to track those who receive vaccines so we can do this post-market surveillance um i think we know that we're going to get some loss to follow up and in this case you know what do you think is the risk to just general vaccine belief in vaccinations and whatnot and also just in terms of ending the cobit 19 pandemic in new york we're doing a really bad job and all over the us on collecting data at all the cdc has a very simple form which has like you know where you got the shot it's got like seven things you have to fill out including race and in the initial data on race 40 of the people filling out the form neglected to fill in their race category on that form and we've put forward as a as public health professionals we've said to mr biden you should not be distributing that vaccine to people that can't figure out how to fill in all seven seven parts of of the form um but i know again i don't know you you you know i don't know in australia or singapore you know i'm sure you've got better plans to do that than we had here um if i can chime in i think that singapore can punch above it's its way in contributing to the post marketing surveillance small compact uh and actually relatively aging also and with incredible data nobody can get a vaccination without filling up the form right and because we have a and really because singapore has a unique identifier called the called the identity card system we in theory can pull data from multiple sources to then look for rare events and to look for the risk factors that may have contributed to some of these events even no matter how esoteric they may actually seem so i'm not privy to what exactly is being being collected but certainly i do think singapore can contribute in this space and put out papers that can help to guide the rest of the world because we have the infrastructure to do so gareth how about indigenous populations or overall in australia are the right data being collected to support vaccination efforts so i think there's there's there's a fundamental issue when it comes to several when it comes down to indigenous health and counting in that often indigenous people are not counted either because you have nina's example where that for a range of reasons that i can think about a number of different rates and reasons why that's to happening um is that um that information is not offered up um or it's not actively sought or it's not done in a standardized way and so we know when people have looked at um cancer for instance and looked at coding of indigenous status that it's woeful um and what that means is that all your monitoring and your interventions have a false denominator which is what luna nina talked about so it's actually critical that you have that you are that you are um that you are counting indigenous uh status um and the best place probably to do that is in the health system um and and so tell you how you do how you do that uh how you do that better because after all if people aren't counted then they're going to feel like they don't count um and um so i i think that's probably almost the most fundamental issue for um any health system about indigenous health care at a systems monitoring level is actually the counting of indigenous status um then there is all the the cultural considerations about and and barriers or enablers to that actually happening um and uh so i i i think i think that that counting question is is fundamental the the other thing uh from a western australian perspective is that we have this linked data universe essentially so our health systems are linked to our justice systems data our link to our educational systems data and so we have all these data sets that we can link in a privacy preserving way to do whole of population studies on outcome xyz um and um and so similar to to the singaporean status with a with a rather than having a a a single health number but we can people can be uh tracked and counted um in a in a de-identified way to add to to do whole populations a bit whole populations uh studies um so i think there are also you know there's there's a really nice complimentary opportunity between singapore and say western australia or other or other other places and something i'd love to explore um some more data linkage infrastructure has had a massive revamp um it was happening anyway and then of course covert came along and supercharged everything um and um and so i think there are there are opportunities to to explore to explore exactly that yeah thank you gareth i'm going to actually move on to our final questions our time is almost up and i love the way the the word you use supercharged so my final question to the three of our speakers is what would it take to supercharge precision public health what do you think success would look like for us in the next say five years gareth youth um so i think youth are superchargers they're brilliant they're enthusiastic they're driven they're motivated and their minds aren't dogmatic and haven't been fettered and institutionalized um so i i think it's you know how do we um how do we engage how to engage and learn from because i think the solutions are going to come from uh from from youth and i always think go to where it's hardest um because that's where you make so go go the area the greatest unmet need you can think of and start there you'll deliver solutions that are robust and then are generalizable other ways and what if you build a solution that that works for someone who's incredibly well resourced and in a you know a beautiful setting and etc etc won't necessarily translate the other way but many times if you make the solution that works in the robustly in in the in the most challenging domain you're going to get a solution that will work for everybody thank you very much nina what what what do you think was supercharged precision public health and what would success look like it would take a longer time period than five years but i think we started teaching public health in high school i think we should start teaching principles in public health in high school because as jeremy said i think covet has shown that everybody really should understand a little bit of of good old-fashioned public health and not just one subject of it infectious disease epidemiol epidemiology but kind of the whole the whole the whole system of public health so i think that's what i would do and in the meantime i would uh at your school of public health propose a a crash course for mayors policy makers and decision makers oh that's a good one um to just kind of get up to speed and that's maybe my supercharge element excellent thank you jeremy what's your super charge element um it's also the reason why we're hosting precision public health in april meaning uh that's that's that's a month away and that's really making precision public health useful in the conference we have deliberately invited public traditional public health people as well as the as well as representatives and leaders from the tech giants uh amazon google facebook and release and india and their chinese counterparts and the whole logic i mean everyone knows that the tech companies conduct a massive amount of surveillance on all of us but we accept it because it's useful right so we do have to make the use case very plain that that people say i'm not 100 comfortable but i'll take that leap of faith and once people have entrusted their their data with us there um we have to be completely rigorous and religious about safeguarding this and to make sure that over the next five years there are no major data breaches that the system works and we can balance the use and the trust very nicely then i think these are the twin engines that will turbo charge precision public health you're on milk now cnn i was typing but a great way to end the session i wanted to let everyone know i've put in the link to the precision public health asia conference for you it is complementary please do sign up we look forward to seeing you and i do like to give people a little bit of time back after a very long webinar thank you so much to our speakers today gareth nina jeremy for sharing your thoughts insights and just getting us super excited about the future of public health and precision public health thank you very much everyone for

Get access to hundreds of stories and ...,we're live now good evening everybody over pandemic and its impact on mental health it gives me indeed great pleasure to moderate a webinar of such immense importance on the platform on the combined platform of scope and fam health mental health and well-being especially in these civil times is indeed a pandemic within another pandemic it's unlikely that anybody in this year 2020 has not uh been affected by what's been happening around the world why are we so anxious what and how severe is the impact does it relate to the neurological structure of our brain at all and upper body to discuss this and some of our very very critical uh of our questions that are ready we have a highly distinguished panel of psychiatrists from india and abroad um i will uh request mr sophie in just half a minute to introduce our eminent panelists but in order to take the constructive points um may i request everybody who has questions on mental health and how do you cope with this better to please um send you know type your questions on the questions tag which is available on the screen and we'll make it a point and i'll do my utmost best answer just in case i'm unable to cover all the questions today please please please um keep sending your questions either post them on the scope social media sites or you can log in to fam health dot in slash community or free registration you can leave your questions and we'll do our level best make sure that uh we do respond to each and every question if we need to do another webinar we will um just you know before we start introducing our panelists maybe i should stands for family health and it's a platform where we believe that families across india and the world need better support to be able to deal with lots of unanswered questions to this end we run a tv service with tata sky uh it's called tata sky family health it's available on 510 on data square set drop boxes and fam health dot in okay so uh to come to address the webinar um and in order to make it constructive and we've got many many speakers lined up i'm going to um without further ado call upon mr atul director general of scope to say a few words and welcome our eminent panelists on our webinar await pandemic and its impact on mental health uh mr is a visionary he is a leader we're close to almost four decades of very versatile professional experience third you were the cmd at bhel before you joined scope as the director general we have no doubt and given you know the popularity of the webinars that you're conducting that you will take scope through your initiatives to even greater heights may i call upon you mr sophie sir let's get started thank you thank you for the nice work very good evening everyone since today we are joined by ambulant exports and parts friends from across the globe good afternoon to all joining from the east coast including italy and good evening to all joining from usa probably the only one thing the pandemic has impacted positively is our connectivity across the globe which we are seeing today also it's very rare occasion that one is very happy to be amongst the doctors and so many doctors and for me today it is one such few occasions ladies and gentlemen standing conference of public enterprises scope you might be aware is an fx body of indian public sector enterprises known as state enterprises internationally besides policy advocacy we represent employers in various national and international forums conduct studies and research and we also organize various programs for the capstic buildings of public sector lives as well as others and their families also during the pandemic period so far we have already organized certain webinars on a variety of subjects and all these webinars have got the overwhelming response so as the membership of various public sectors we can play nearly 1.5 million people around 15 lakhs such a huge employee base it's always natural that we need the human resources which are the most important assets for any organization for this purpose infected scope we have been organizing the talks and awareness campaigns on various guidances for the healthy people and in fact during the this pandemic period also we organized a webinar to provide a guidance on the healthy heart and healthy lifestyle we had the association with the partners for organizing that webinar including the fam health with the doctors from usa and india which also got overwhelming response while scope has been addressing the physical health concerns we thought it pertinent to even address the issues surrounding mental well-being especially given the uncertainty and growing fears surrounding the pandemic for this purpose as was mentioned by ashraf ji also we have the eminent panel of medical experts who have been doing extensive work in the field of psychology and mental well-being i am honored to welcome professor stefano palanti joining us from italy professor is a physician scientist and is associated with many institutes in u.s industry in the field of neuroscience he is a valued name in the world when new name in the world in his field i would like to welcome professor blanti and i'm thankful to him for spending his valuable time it's also my pleasure to be joined by dr ranjan avarma from mainland usa dr verma has been working in the area of child psychology a very important subject for over 25 years welcome dr verma i would also like to welcome dr amitabh shah who is associated with mex super specialty hospitals and holy family hospitals in delhi ncr doctor sar he has been contributing effectively in the field of psychiatry for over two decades now welcome dr saw we are also glad to be joined by dr anjani not pal she is cmd serenity clinic and she has many appellates to her name in the field of mental well-being and we are pleased to have her with us today for this webinar welcome dr northball i am sure that the acclaimed panel with us all of us would agree that while it is important to have everybody stopping of the strong immunity it's very important but it's equally important to have a strong and calm mind to deal with the uncertainty to deal with the pessimism to deal with the gloominess in the present environment in fact mental health is not only significant for surviving during this pandemic period but also it's an important tool to help preserve and reconstruct in the post pandemic period very important so the most important mental health aspect that the pandemic has stilled is the unimaginable and surmountable emotions that people are experiencing which are not only diverse but are varying in extremities the new realities are working from home temporary unemployment or in some cases permanent unemployment also homeschooling of children lack of physical contacts with our family members friends colleagues they are taking tool on most of us and some are responding to it with extreme measures if i talk about the facts about the mental health their endless list but just few instances i like to mention in india in fact since april there is a spot of over 80 percent of distance calls for suicide prevention helplines in fact as survey was recently conducted as per that survey today 61 indians are experiencing mental health related issues because of the uncertainty uncertainty because of the gloominess because of the financial crisis it's not only in india this thing is happening across the world if i talk about usa as per a study there is a thousand percent increase registered in emotional distress calls since april 20 as compared to the last time the last year further they i will i i i know that there is 65 percent jump actually registered in online therapy and the most scary is the who prediction which predicts one suicide attempt every two seconds if situation is not controlled soon while this statistics appears to be frightening scary it is important to deal with it rather than ignore it the webinars of scope and fame health sincerely attempt to nip the disease in the bud rather than take it to the level of mammoth face i am thankful to our partners family which is led by their dynamic md mrs asha kapoor who started this webinar in the beginning for hosting it and subsequently telecasting it on the tata sky also i am certain that international and national experts would guide us through the steps to deal with the unknown crisis in our minds and they will train ourselves to be strong on human being i request all the participants to make maximum use of this opportunity and ask their concern with the open mind question now the system has already been told by ashadi please be free to ask any question we'll try to reply to all the questions and subsequently also if you are not able to i mean reply due to the time constraint will definitely ensure that these are sent to you remember that anything which bothers us which troubles us cannot be small so please as i mentioned make maximum use of maximum benefit of the guidance of the experts who are here i wish the webinar a great success thank you very much thank you thank you so much uh mr sophie sir you know you raise some really uh vital statistics and they they don't seem very pleasant and i'm sure like you said with the support of this fantastic and eminent faculty we should be able to understand this condition just a little bit better uh the first speaker we thought would make uh um the most logical sense would be to look at the global impact of the pandemic to understand uh what is really going on with mental health and you know our psychology and and you know the impact on our neurological systems and who better than professor stefano uh to this entire session i want to read out a little about you uh with your permission uh professor on what i've gone through about your background so you're a professor of psychiatry at the university of florence and director of the institute for neurosciences in italy you are a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at stanford university medical center stanford california you are the visiting professor at albert einstein college of medicine new york usa and at imperial college london in uk you're an adjunct associate professor at icon school of medicine at mount sinai new york usa where you are served as the founder and director of the strategic center of excellence for ocd impulsive and behavioral addiction dr palanti as as mr gupta had mentioned you describe yourself as a physician scientist who applies cutting-edge neuroscience breakthroughs to clinical work by utilizing clinical activities to formulate research hypotheses really intrigued you know and to understand your observations on mental health and this antenna you know it's a very good pandemic so please help us understand neuroborbin 19 a clinical based approach to reduce the source of it related mental health sequelae so so if you can have your presentation that would be amazing thank you very much for your nice introduction thank you for having me today i'm very pleased to join this prestigious webinar and uh and i'm very pleased to have this collaboration with uh with your country and with the people that i love from india so my as you have introduced i am a clinician and i am a scientist and some of the observation that i'm presenting has been taken during the last few months when back from two years that i spent in palo alto working in stamford i was surprised in florence by the start of a pandemia of recovery 19. so as usual i take the opportunity to study things that i was facing in my clinical activity of every day in the academic hospital here in florence where we have i meet a few hundred people with less or more severe form of respiratory acute syndrome due to the kovi 19. so the first slide is about a a true case report that i see more recently this is to introduce all the issue this is a young is a lady that has been suffering but without being aware of a mild form of kobe 19 in february when the awareness about miss pandinia was not the same but here so she considered had just a severe flu seasonal flu and she was not at that time she was not diagnosed as kobe 19 because at that time we were not concerned about that after a week that she spent in bed due to the severe condition of this uh that she considered a form of influenza with the floor uh in march she she asked after a month so she asked for a psychiatric assessment because she was experiencing some behavioral and mind neurological symptoms like headache pain fatigue dysfunctional worries intense difficult in relaxing difficult in concentration and focusing and all place pessimistic and at the end she also developed some kind of obsessive compulsive rituals for that she was addressed to a cbt therapist to get some form of cognitive behavioral therapy and she spent a couple months through this kind of treatment then she presented to my office and we decided to uh pass through the assessment of a potential threat of coverage so she got a swap that was negative and then she got a serological assessment that shown the presence of a anti-kobe 19 antibody and also elevated level of uh egg egm and other inflammatory index like high c reactive protein levels uh electro rates above the reference level high level of alpha 1 and alpha 2 globulins so we understand that his suffering was related to uh to the uh um to the kobe 19 and so we decided to uh i can see my presentation i hope you can see it if you can see your presentation and your videos so okay so and so she started a different treatment uh a medical treatment that was uh replacing the cbt treatment with naproxen that is an anti-inflammatory agents and fluvoxamine fluvoxin that is ssri that but at the moment is being uh registered for a clinical trial for the treatment of the acute phase of kobe 19 uh title kind to moy uh because of his important action of immune suppression through the action of a sigma receptor so we uh we make a a truth that allows me to have a better understanding of a potential risk of a patient exposed to kovi 19 not just of a psychosocial risk but also the the risk of a direct asset of a virus on the central nervous system because we know that kobe 19 like all the other coronavirus and the potential are a potential threat not only for the respiratory apparatus but also for the central nervous system and we know that have to bind the angiotensin converted to receptors and this reset not only on the respiratory system but uh distribute on the brain so that could be one of the mechanisms why other mechanisms can involve the blood vessel we know that can pass through the endothelial barrier and other retrograde and peripheral nerve to the central one and presence of covid19 antibodies being documented in the server fluid so we are sure that there are potential risks for neurological system and this has been clear from the beginning because uh since the very first paper published in february from our chinese colleague 40 to 88 of the symptoms were neurological in the coming 19th patient so uh also is interesting because the neurological symptoms can appear even in asymptomatic respiratory patient and can precede the appearance of respiratory uh syndrome or can follow the respiratory so we can have different population like ratio that show first of a signs the neurological and psychosensorial science of hobbied attraction to the brain or we can have patients with neurological and psycho psychiatric symptoms following the infection and this is make things even more difficult the importance of of a of this potential threat has been known since the very beginning because we know already that uh since the pandemia at the end of the 19th century and the other one the most popular the spanish flu at the beginning of the 19 19 after the the pandemia had been developed in the from the spanish a million of cases of lethargic encephalitis so we know that these uh this virus are really uh represent very really represented threat for the brain and more more recent uh coronavirus infection the starts in the beginning of his millennium 2014 have already documented the risk on mental health and related disability this is an interesting study published by our colleague in hong kong with the title mental morbidity and chronic fatigue and severe acute respiratory syndrome survivors long-term follow-up as it is interesting because uh in 2009 they published that while the symptomatology related to the uh to this respiratory component of the disorders were gradually reducing uh presence of neurological symptoms increase during the time and at the end of the 40 years 40 percent of the patient monitor it that had been infected with sarcoid ii had de novo that mean without previous episodes without previous history of psychiatric disease the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis and this um was related no after four years so they have a progressive increase of the worsening of of behavioral and psychiatric disorders and that was related to the cytokine storms was not associated with corticosteroid treatment most common of course was post traumatic stress disorder but if you can see that 40 where depression or sleep disorders or pain of fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome and 15 of celsic compulsive disorder this is why special interest because we know that the sequela of of a copied uh 19 as much as the search cover was more relevant for disease related to basal ganga dysfunction between all the field of ocd and related disorder obsessive compulsive impartial disorder the functional disability was so severe that after four years most of the people had lost their job so and is impo extremely important that the disease was not relieving from his own but was worsening without any apparent intervention other way to to reduce the inflammatory uh activity and the impact on the behavioral and cognitive functioning of inflammatory activity so we know now that there is a list of symptoms that are assessed at the at the onset at the omniscient of a patient with kobe because this is one of the first paper that i published in march about the importance of an osmia because uh anosmia has been has been included as one of the symptoms of presentation of kobe 19 loss of smell and loss of test has been both considered as a marker of a potential infection of covenanting in this paper i also highlight all the other part of a syndrome that involved not just a reduction of a sensorial perception but a more deep uh experience of the realization of the personalization that run together with the reduction of obvious perception so this is a cl a call for a different stratification of a patient we cannot only consider patient uh in terms of their exposure to the psychosocial stress but we have to consider that there are some of a patient with psychiatric and psychological disorders that are directly connected to the virus on the brain so there are two two population means the population that is just psychologically traumatized and there are another population probably a broad one with people that have medical consequences and this is probably the population that experience more psychosensorial symptoms or previous of the respiratory one or neurological synthox have some specific inflammatory markers some of them easy to is it to collect a cbc or the edema of interleukin 6 that we can assess in this population so uh according to the first observation that lost osmel and loss of test could be part of the assessment you see here the public health england that include in the case definition items also neurological manifestation loss of change of normal sense of testosterone as one of the definition but if you go if you have a look of the discharge of patient there is no mention of a neuropsychiatric or psychosensorial component of the disorders and they only mention that this patient have to receive a proper and appropriate clinical assessment without to specify that this should involve neurological and psychiatric assessment i don't argue for everybody be assessed by a specialist but i i'm saying that physician in the intensive care unit and family doctor had to be aware that there is a large part of population that could suffer for this consequence of inflammation just showing behavioral problem and for that patient just a psychological support without an opportune screening of inflammation and maybe there are a different assessment of neurological functioning and also a change in the treatment could be not enough so this is why we are now uh validating an euro coverage 19 screening tests that distinguish between the different areas of symptoms mostly energy sleep psychosensorial cognitomotor symptomatology that can be part of the assessment of this patient in order to get the early signs of the involvement of the brain and to prevent the long-term sequela that we have observed with a paper published by the colleague of hong kong where forty percent of the entire population of a patient suffering for respiratory for massarts had after four years new onset of psychiatric disorders so as a conclusion uh we've uh recently published last week this paper euro copy 19 a clinical neuroscience-based approach to reduce a sask relate a mental health sequela that is a claim for a screening that involve this dimension of the disorders that mean clinical psychosensory and neurological symptoms and inflammatory panel considering not to separate psychological support to the medical one should be in continuity on a multidisciplinary panel and also this is a claim to improve also our culture because we we know that in all the field of psychiatry now there is a large interest between the for considering the importance of inflammation in the vulnerability and in pathogenetic mechanism of the disorders now we must be aware that we are probably facing a large number of patients produced by this combination of inflammation and stress and we start we have to start to use in a new way our uh medicine because we know that uh as an example ssri serotonin educations have a strong anti-inflammatory effect and we have to use it in any other way i told you at the beginning that fluvoxamine is now there is a trial to use it in the acute phase as an anti-inflammatory and the use of some anti-inflammatory for the treatment of this uh so-called mental disorder that are not mental at all but are related to uh the inflammation so is it this uh is a is a threat but is also an opportunity to improve the quality of our assessment to this patient and to improve the culture for the adoption of adequate response to this very vulnerable population in order to prevent what has been reported with the sars that 40 of his population will be still sick after years so let's it's open to all the discussion thank you for your patience uh thank you so much professor palanti uh very insightful uh little scary uh just a question and i know we've got many questions which are started coming up from what i i understood um ptsd over 50 percent more cases happened with the previous experience um does that get uh handled by counseling or do you actually need to get into medical treatment to handle ptsd and i know i do want to get on to the other speakers but before i lose track of the the points if you could help us understand this a little bit so thank you for the question psychological intervention is also a potential anti-inflammatory effect so i'm not saying that psychology intervention should not be the right things to do we can start but of course we have to monitor the patient and in the monitoring we have also to include the assessment of some marker of inflammation because in that case probably psychological intervention could be not enough in fact patient that in the paper i mentioned patient and physician had lost their job because of the stress of the pandemia remain unemployed after years so i think that is a difficult condition to treat but you need a more uh deep assessment okay and so you would suggest that people take their do their self-assessment with the tool that you have your presented or taken us through and then take a call on whether they need to go to a psychiatrist or not anybody who's actually contracted the virus itself right okay right yeah all right okay so while there is a flow of questions that are coming in and thank you please keep sending your questions i want to make sure that we cover all our panelists because there are different dimensions which will keep covering uh coming up in fact one of the things mr sophie had mentioned in his uh welcome address was the fact that there was economic uncertainty in fact we all know that we are all been affected and to that end um you know we've got nobody better than dr amitabh sahar to talk about this area again mr sophia is given an introduction but dr sahar is a senior consultant practicing in delhi ncr he is affiliated with the department of mental health and behavioral sciences with max hospitals both in vaishali and oda and he is the head of department of psychiatry and holy family hospital in delhi uh mr dr saha and i had a discussion some time back and since you uh professor palanti had just mentioned about the sars virus i don't know anybody but he you know other than dr sahar from indian background who actually saw it upfront face to face in his state in singapore uh he came up with with a lot of experience and i'd like to share that although your topic sir today is the challenges faced by the workforce but if you want to make a comment on how panicky we should be uh having heard professor palanti's presentation please please do that um just one last thing which is dr sahar has done his uh mbbs from nancy and his md from eems and um we welcome you it would be wonderful uh to talk about the cases you're actually dealing with right now so we will have the presentation share technical team could we please have the presentation while we're waiting dr saha if you could uh we can't hear you uh dr amita just uh can you see my slide yes we can see the first slide challenges faced by the workforce in uncertain times good evening viewers uh in the time of corona virus pandemic a new normal has set in we know classrooms are empty children are on their mobile phone and laptop for classes law enforcing instead of catching criminals our police is enforcing restriction so that they can contain virus there's no handshake there's no carpooling so today my presentation will be different from conventional mental health workforce presentation in this presentation i am not going to talk about satisfaction of job role ambiguity work performance work related stress reduction of abstinence absenteeism or increase in efficiency i will limit myself on how can we preserve mental well-being of our workforce and their family in this calamity now if you ask me the extent of psychological problem i will not present any figures everybody will present you figures that may be confusing i will just use one word alarming this is this pandemic is going to be followed by a mental health related pandemic what is happening why in the environment of uncertainty and immense stress a psychological problem have increased markedly especially depression many psychological problem in form of anxiety ptsd obsessive compulsive disorder and what we call hypochondriaces uh concerned with the physical problems concerned with whether i i have a corona or not this sort of a corona this sort of concerns so many patients we see nowadays so many because we get and both coronavirus and this coverage of our celebrity shushan singh rajput that has led to a quantum leap in suicide rates because all of us are staying in a house working from home there's so much of a close proximity family discord has increased because of a bow down substance abuse has increased patience with the psychological illness the problem is aggravated because of increased stress and restricted medical health so what led to this psychological mayhem it's just coronavirus no it's not just coronavirus yes coronavirus has a significant role to play but restrictive movement and the misinformation by our news channel and social media coronavirus rapidly spread globally and high mortality has instilled feel terrible in the mind of people if i or my family get infected what happens next and those who are infected fear of complication availability of bed in a hospital as professor palanti said the illness by itself has a direct psychological impact too what this lockdown or restricted measures have done because of a confinement change in routine working from home schooling from home temporary unemployment lack of social interaction lack of amusement limited international domestic movement restricted meeting and the restrictions meeting and care of corona patient disposal of dead bodies of near and dear without a proper ritual all this has led to a psychological unrest and it manifested in a different form two all this the news channel what they have done they have propagated all the negative news 24 7 and the bombardment of fake articles health related material in social media which actually propagated stigma discrimination and misinformation so what are the issues as a employee or as a workforce a person confront with first is workplace where is my workstation is it adequately adequate safe measures have been taken how i reach there public transport is not available if i am working from home i have a multitasking i have to do office work i have to look after my children whether they're actually i monitor my children whether they're actually attending online classes and household responsibilities too working from home there is also overcrowding it's not just you you your children your spouse everybody is in front of computer and for everyone their work is important so there is an overcrowding thing the other important concern is blurring of office hours when it starts but it starts but it never ends there are other issues also financial issues people who are running on high emi mortgages people have to think about their children's school fees if someone get affected by coronavirus they're not sure whether they will get a hospital facility whether they have adequate coverage from the company or not so there are concerns and there are many people in our organization who have already depression or other mental health problems their problems have increased so these are the concerns that we are confronted with so what is the solution my advice to employees is to first protect yourself and then support others listen to the listen to advice and recommendation from national and local authorities avoid news channels propagating negatively only view trusted channels on for few minutes in a day limit your screen time have proper hygiene eating habits follow office hours to exercise sleep in time curtail those propagation of misinformation through whatsapp messages in track with your family members children elderly elderly people are most affected because they can't step out of house they cannot step out of a house and they feel insecure about themselves and the whole family you need to form a peer group support peer support system collect clip approach only can help to mitigate stress among the workforce so you have to make a sincere and frequent interaction with your family friend and friend and colleagues my advice for people with the leadership role most of these phd organizations have elaborate human resources services so they need to inform workers about the safety measures in workplace health coverage tie-ups with the hospitals or a health facility if the crisis happens they need to see corona and government has taken us taken all the control from us so give some sense of control giving some sense of control will help if there is an issue ask the employer about the solution same for the working hours we need to consider be very considerate about the working mothers because apart from the routine household chores and office work working mothers have now have this burden or extra responsibility of monitoring children who attend online classes the sense of purpose must not be lost this is also very important if a person is sitting idle in a workplace he feels himself a liability so everybody must be engaged in a work and if there is a little work they need to be trained or their skills need to be upgraded some course they can attend that will benefit their career in future to help loneliness hopelessness and to boast morale this should be frequent virtual interaction among the peers colleagues like virtual coffee having a virtual coffee organization need to create a assistance program in collaboration with mental health professionals to initiate and follow up service for those who experience mental health issues and there is a responsibility of creating awareness about mental health problems and to destigmatize it now this is for everyone to know that there is some problem there is some mental health problem you need to talk about it either with your colleagues or with the professional you need to know this science if there is a mood swings a low mood for a prolonged duration increase anxiety apprehension irritability if you feel hopeless helpless worthless if you're not interested in anything around you you don't feel like interacting you're not able to concentrate in routine work either sleeping more or sleeping less you were sleeping but in the when you wake up you don't feel relaxed you get thoughts of self-harm then you need to consult a professional as early as possible my concluding slide just i just wanted to say that take away messages we will able we will walk through this calamity collectively and confidently i'm sure we will able to defeat this thank you i am unmuted i now can you hear me excellent you know there's so many questions that are coming we're getting flooded we do have two speakers please keep your questions flowing if you have to run over a bit with the permission of mr sophie sir i do need to address as many questions i as i can uh we do have two speakers who have put together a lot of content in fact dr saha while you were talking uh there were many questions which may have been already addressed but i am going to run through the questions uh i don't waste too much time because we are running a little behind dr nadpal i'm going to ask you to please talk about the most critical thing which is how does one know and you raised the entire thing of a celebrity uh you know we don't know whether it's homicide suicide so and so forth but there's just so many cases of people who are getting into anxiety depression suicides uh for the longest ever uh ma'am not paul you really need to tell us how do we identify a person who is going through mental health problems but before we start off with you may i um please give a little introduction uh uh about yourself um you're going to talk about recognizing and helping a person with a mental health issue at work and home you are the founder of serenity clinics ma'am twice awarded global talk 50 mental health leader both in 2019 and 20 by et now and world mental health congress you have received hero leadership award in 2015 what an honor it is to have you amidst us you believe in holistic approach in handling mental health problems through counseling yoga neurogenetic diet and lifestyle management you're exploring drugless psychiatric treatment and you are at the leading edge of treating mental health conditions through brain mapping neural feedback and rtms this sounds like music to our ears and uh man please tell us how do we identify somebody who's going through a problem you can't tell over to your man your presentation please send your questions i will address them just after they've had uh the two ladies finish their peace please please bear with me thank you ma'am over to you thank you so much asha so uh it's i'm really it's really an honor for me to actually be here and uh you know uh doing this presentation uh i'm not able to actually come here because you're organized yeah you will have to actually start my presentation okay yeah i hope the scope technical team has got that ma'am you want us to run the presentation you are the presenter it's okay i i think you can do it now ma'am you can see yourself yeah full screen yeah perfect man okay so today uh i'm supposed to talk about you know how do we know that we have uh you know the person who is sitting right next to us has some sort of a mental health problem you know the uh the co-worker that we have or the colleague that we have who actually appears to be you know always full of rage or who is always bossing around not ready to listen to what you are saying or who is actually you know taking all the ideas from you and presenting it you know as if it's his own is it because this is the way this person is or is it because it is something to do with a psychiatric problem so uh you know how do we identify that whether this is a mental health problem or not so you know mainly what we can see is there may be more changes you know in a person you know that this is very easily you can find it out somebody's depressed somebody's been too high you know somebody probably you know is you know this time it not feeling happy most of the time or they may be worrying a lot or you know in extreme cases not very often probably in our day-to-day life we may find few people who are talking to themselves or or who can actually hear voices but yes quite often we can find people who may have you know some sort of substance related problem it could be just about you know the the most frequent you know uh substance that that we may actually overlook is food so that could be the case you know somebody who's having some sort of an eating disorder or it could be alcohol or it could be something to do with smoking or you know especially in these days sleep may be a big problem it could be just about you know as i'll be talking later it could be the quality of sleep or it could be the initiation of this which could be a problem or sometimes you know the mental health problems because it is not acceptable uh to the society and to that person you know you know to accept that they have a mental health problem so it may be expressed as bodily symptoms you know which is very much acceptable in the in the you know in the society which can be you know either it could be some sort of conversion may happen or it may be you know some sort of dissociation that may happen or there could be a change in the libido or sometimes you know especially if in the workforce i would say it is more to do with the executive and the higher executive dysfunction that is you know the planning part the memory or you know uh some sort of you know in in which you you cannot actually uh concentrate you may not be able to solve a problem or you may be having uh some problem with the motivation so these are the sort of things you know which if you are finding then that means that might be you know these people may be suffering from some sort of uh mental problem so this is these are few things already uh dr sahar has already covered these but just to go a little bit about it you know what can happen is of course that absenteeism may happen you know and uh depression of course we all can somehow make it out you know some person who's who is low but not always you know sometimes it may be they may actually put a sort of you know facade that they are very happy and inside they mean they may be actually feeling you know really sad and then anxiety again we can see energy first and always restless you know always wanting for some sort of a reassurance or you know some sometimes even obsessive uh you know sort of actions may be there but one thing which may be overlooked is is bipolar you know these people are highly energetic and and creative and they may be actually doing a lot of work you know and they may they may have some sort of grandiosity that that they feel that they are above everybody else and uh they may they may not like to actually follow the rules and they may be very aggressive at times they may work a lot but the net result would be zero so the direction is not there so that these are the sort of people sometimes uh you know i i get from the corporate wherein we diagnose them as having bipolar disorder and then of course adhd may also be there adult adhd wherein the person may be disorganized and you know they may not be able to follow the deadlines and uh you know the the workload they cannot manage or you know they cannot follow the instructions properly you tell them three four things and they are not able to actually you know follow them up all of them then they may be a little argumentative because quite often adhd also is associated you know a co-morbidity may be that you may have oppositional defiance wherein you know for everything positive you know anything they will go just to the you know the opposite of what is expected out of them so of course now let us talk about why does mental illness happen you know what is the reason behind it we say heart attack okay fine the blood is not going you know that part of the heart in fact happens as a result you know the heart or either the electrical part of the heart is not running that means that the the stimulus which has to go the pumping is not happening you know similarly for everything we have a reason why does mental illness happen so first of all very very important factor that you know nowadays actually is being explored is that there is a lot of genetic basis to it we always do but for the last 10 years lot of work has been done and it has been found out that you know for uh for illnesses like bipolar and schizophrenia the uh the inheritance may go even above 75 percent you know it is called as this you know genome-wide association study which has been done in in many countries together and you know there they have found out that the how much we knew it is much more than that the heritable sort of component to it then of course stressful events could be there chronic medical condition you know if already you are having some liver problem or some other problem you know and during you know you may actually feel depressed or you know if you are having alcohol or any sort of recreational drugs you know after see anybody who is having alcohol uh as uh you know as a social sort of drinking it's still fine but if it goes beyond you know a level wherein either dependence is there you know every day looking for it or you know whenever you are drinking you are drinking to lose control then there is something you know you need to actually start taking charge of it because after a stage the brain structure start changing then if you are taking the same substance again and again and this is where you know the reward cycle is actually getting affected and you know again and again you will be wanting to have the same sort of you know substance and yet the amount may have to be increased then childhood plays a very very important role you know the first few years how the child has been taken care of earlier it was said that the first three years but now of course recently i was reading it it's not just the first uh you know 15 10 15 years it's even beyond that you know i think there is a recent research in london it has been done that uh it's very important this is how the personality is going to develop let me just point out that personality is is you know something which uh you know the part of the brain which decides about it is the frontal lobe and the frontal lobe is the one which matures the latest that is after 18 years of age the the you know frontal lobe starts maturing so anything that you are doing from 18 years to 25 years of age you know that becomes a part of your personality because your brain your healthy adult brain has never learned how to actually be without that substance or that particular sort of habit so it is very important for us to take care of our kids during this time during you know 18 to 25 years of age then similarly you know if uh the social you know sort of interaction is very very important the healthy relationship and all these things are actually very important important and of course if you have a previous mental health you know problem then again you know it may come out to uh have some sort of problem now i will be actually discussing a few of the you know uh scenarios or uh you know symptoms which may be uh which may be you know uh difficult to handle uh these days so how do we know that a person is actually going to get violent you know the first and foremost is that you know what are what is being done because of which this person is going to get fired if if you know sometime it so happens that a lot of controlling behavior may be there quite often in families it happens you know sometimes especially in indian setup you know the the financial control completely is kept with the uh with the male member and you know the wife may not be allowed or it could be vice versa also may not be allowed to spend at all so this is also a type of you know a violence in in a way then humiliating a person in front of others of calling some sort of tapes then physical abuse that is beating or whatever sexual abuse of course and then you know any sort of violence to elders or children or pets it could also be there and then any sort of you know agitation so how do you you know of course we will we can come to know if somebody is going to be violent but these are few of the signs you know which have been pointed out that the person may be staring you know the tone may be raised and sarcastic and he may get anxious and he may start muttering and pacing that means you know this person may be about to get you know violent so now uh after this i just want to uh you know mention a little bit about domestic violence because there has been a spurt of uh you know incidents of domestic violence during this long term time now uh now of course the things are opening up and it may not be that bad but still i would say that it is very very important that you know all the members have separate times and together times so all this time being together is not a very good idea you should have your own life as well it goes for both male as well as female you should have your own set of friends as well and then of course there should be times when you you both want to come together and then you know sometimes you may understand that you know some problem is going on and the conflict is escalating so it's very important you know it is not important to be right at that time it is important for that problem or all that you know that particular sort of you know flare-up to actually diffuse so give the emotional space which is required uh you just don't you know be very particular about small small things just see whether it is important that this person uh you know whether you are right or whether it is important that you both are together of course these things should be discussed i don't say that just hush it below the carpet but but look for the right opportunity when the person is in the right frame of mind it is very very important when anybody is saying something you have to understand what is the emotion behind that you know that thought or that behavior so it is very important to know do not judge that person on the on that particular sort of you know what that person is saying it is important that you understand why is it happening what is the intent behind that okay then focus on the emotions yeah focus on the emotions behind the behavior and it's very sometime it is very very you know important to agree to disagree that's a beautiful way of living that okay fine you have your way of thinking i have my way of thinking we are two different individuals and it is perfectly fine that you know we disagree on few you know probably ways or values but that's okay that is the way we are that is how we we are comfortable being have your hobbies and you know exercising and uh you know work also so all these are important so now when you come across a person who is getting you know you feel that they may get violent so what are the sort of things that you know steps you have to take care of this is something which is which i think has been given by who so first is that you have to maintain distance secondly you have to be either the you know you need to have empathetic growth you should not be you know too uh getting to get too close to that person yet have have a detachment that okay fine i can understand you have a problem and you know you that it should seem you should not get overly emotional you should be calm it should seem that you can control the situation then of course be careful how where that person is standing what is there in the hand if he can hit you with something then you know keep on talking to that person do not see anything negative at that point don't say anything punitive or you know judgmental at that time and but keep on you know de-escalating that particular situation then you know if required of course in uh you know we may try to actually uh stabilize that person in other ways so the second thing which i wanted to talk about was suicide now in suicide you know we have uh you know as we have seen uh with sushant singh rashford whether it was suicide or murder we still don't know but anyhow so how do we know that a person can is you know can commit suicide so these are the risk factors this person would have made an attempt or would have always talked about it okay there may be a prince presence of mental any other you know mental disorder or some sort of substance abuse or if there is a family history of suicide and there may be some sort of chronic physical or terminal illness and whenever the case baby always make it a point to ask the person if any client comes to me i ask them do you think that there can be some sort of you know self-harm deliberate self-harm in your case or i can i may even say that do you think you may actually try to commit suicide and if these people are sometimes just waiting to actually bring it out so don't think you are going to actually plan this idea this person is already going through that so i you will in fact help that person in bringing those those ideas out so for that of course you know what we do is we ask them to actually sign a pack before they go of course we talk we inform their family you know talking to the family friends then we ask them to have some sort of a diary and you know of course start seeking help so now so what are those things you know which uh we can do to uh you know help somebody so you can always tell them that i'm here to help you you know and you can say uh whatever you want to say you you need to be sitting there and be a good listener and do not make you know any sort of uh you know comments like there's nothing to worry don't think negatively no you should not you should actually make that person to come out with his or her problem you know never be you know judgmental and you know never say that okay i think you should have taken that chance i think uh you should have uh you know acted in time or something like that never never try to tell that person you know that he has or she has failed so and at that particular point you know show empathy and tell them that you know be with them tell them that i'm there i can understand whatever you're going through and you know be supportive and you know of course as i said you know ask them to sign a suicide pact before they leave so and this is a this is very much you know avoidable it can be you know if you take care of it in the right right way you can actually avoid this sort of you know circumstances now the third one which is again very prevalent is about insomnia insomnia is about sleep now sleep could be of many types you know problems it could be that you are lying in your bed and you know after even after 15-20 minutes you cannot sleep that is the initiation is a problem or you are getting up in between or you know you are very light sleeper that is you know might be the quality of the sleep is actually you know fractured or it could be that you get up early in the morning and you feel like crying right in the morning which could be a case of you know sometimes in depression that is a particular type of you know symptom we see that they get up early in the morning and they start you know feeling very very low or you know in uh so we have to be careful that you know what sort of sleep problem is there now having said that we do have to understand that uh you know sleep is something which is you know uh controlled by uh a particular sort of hormone which is produced by a pineal body which is called as melatonin and there is you know if if you go to the bed at the same time for one week most most probably you will be able to come out of this because the hypothalamus actually you know takes one week for adjusting so that is the amount of time which is normally you know taken if you are jet lag so you know similarly if you actually stick to some sort of you know uh sleep uh you know hygiene you will be able to handle that and you know the cause of course could be any it could be the travel stress it could be poor sleeping habit you know you always have either your mobile or your you know laptop with you or you are eating too much in in the evening or probably you know you are doing exercise very late that could also be one of the cause and that becomes very activating or you may have you know either you know caffeine nicotine or something late in the evening so what are the risk factors you uh if you are a woman you are over 60 you already have a mental health disorder or you are under a lot of stress or you don't have a regular schedule all these are you know are at increased risk of having sleep problems so how can we do that of course the first and the foremost is follow the sleep hygiene it is very important that you have your your bedtime your wake-up time you know it should be fixed stay active throughout the day check your medication you know sometimes some medicines you know they may be very activating so you you just check whether they uh any of your medication has this sort of a side effect then do not uh you know sleep in the daytime if you are having problem with your sleep cycles especially do not take caffeine you know and food and you know yes and very very important is that your bedroom should be there for sleep so whenever your brain actually sees the bed it should register that okay this is time to unwind let me start getting into that cycle so that is how you know our cicada rhythm is such that we actually adjust to you know this is the internal body uh clock that we have so it it will adjust according to uh you know the the routine that we are having so uh it is very important that you we sort of you know environment no noise and you know all these things are very very important to have uh a good uh sleep so uh having a bed bedtime ritual is again you know this is again a sort of uh you know a conditioned sort of reflex that can happen that your your brain starts registering that okay this is time to sleep you you may either have a warm bath and then you know you start reading not something very activating you know something you know which can actually put you to sleep or music these all can help you now uh you know what all can we do is uh you know how can we maintain our mental health we need to have a routine this is you know six hours it came came up uh you know i thought that uh see restriction may be there relaxation relationship rhythm and resilience so one by one i goes very fast i go so of course you need to have a routine you have to make your bed you know you need to have fixed menu time and you need to have regular breaks so these are very very important then uh similarly you know yourself do not see too much of your screen you know restrict your screen time if possible uh you know just take off those apps which which are there in your mobile and like you know mails and all it and put it on your laptop and put your laptop away so that you are not watching them all the time relax it's very very important to relax you know it uh so uh hobbies play a very important role what i tell my clients is that there are three type of hobbies which everyone should have one is you know something which is intellectually stimulating a second set of hobby is something which is physically keeping you active and third is something which keeps you creatively inspired so if you have these three set of hobbies you know it will take care of your mental health somehow breathing exercises you can do and you know mindfulness hot hot water but all these things will help you as well similarly you know being being with people is very very important you know there is genetically we we have uh uh the professor palanti would actually be uh you know saying it that uh we have a genes which actually decides how much we are going to be you know socially uh attached to others or showing you know how much empathy this uh genes is actually oxtr which decides you know how much oxytocin you are going to produce and and this actually decides so few people who do not have that or have a mutation wherein they cannot actually they do not like meeting you other people we have to tell them no you should do it because this may not come naturally genetically you are predisposed to actually being away aloof but you for your robust mental health you need to make an effort to be with others you know and that can actually help you a lot then uh you know joining religious activities chalia friday prayer and all those things can also help you similarly having the continuity is very very important following some sort of exercise regime or a serial this can also help us so uh one thing you know which can build resilience as uh professor valenti had already mentioned uh you know two three days back is gratitude so a lot of work is being done on gratitude you know feeling good about feeling thankful is is is a big you know sort of uh virtue in itself which is actually showing that it can increase the longevity and you can live longer if you have this and you know how flexible you are to change so these are few of the things so similarly if you have a person of course listen to him you know inquire about their needs and concerns validate them tell them that you know you believe them enhance their safety tell them that you are there to actually safeguard them support them they'll give them the right sort of information services or whatever sort of you know um social setup that that is required you know is there just give them those information and of course you know refer to mental health so thank you so much thank you very much uh can you hear me everybody yeah it's my theological all right thank you very much uh and as is always the case the last speaker gets the least amount of time for which doctor i can only apologize in advance what can i say um so you know there's so many questions coming and i'm waiting to get on to them and i know they're completely run out of time but i i know you work really hard in your presentation in fact the next few questions of the latest questions we've been receiving ma'am are on children and you uh you know you are a specialist when it comes to child psychological and adolescent psychological health um i'm going to cut your your introduction really short please but you are based in maryland usa you are going to talk about child in distress we will

need to do full server okay if you want i can see your first night full screen okay thank you miss uh asha for this opportunity i wanted to be part of this panel and without much uh you know wasting much time i will start um so covet 19 has caused profound construction can you help me sorry yes you're audible ma'am can you put your presentation on slideshow well that's that's yes yes ma'am yes ma'am this one only which one no no you're fine dr verma do care yes okay so crowd 19 has caused profound disruption to the normal rhythm of everyday life that is it is caused uncertainty for all of us including children and teens our children's concept goes down their sports and activities have shut down they cannot visit family friends grandparents extended family as they used to and um you know being sheltered in one place or being in a home all day that has affected their playing and socializing playing and socialization is a vital part of their lives and that's what they thrive on next you can just go to the left and press the next slide yes yes so this has created in a lot of uncertainty and stress for all of us including our children so during stressful times no matter what their age kids and teens want to know am i safe are people taking care of me say and how will the situation affect my life so here are a few tips guidelines for helping kids of all ages i took some of it from you know mass general hospital um number one most important is control your own anxiety anxiety is contagious uh if a parent is anxious child is going to pick on it and say and he's going to get here she's going to get more anxious and it's important to get the most credible information so about coronavirus you know i would ask a parent to go to a website such as uh cdc which is um you know or who so once you have you know the good information source of it is you can share that information avoid social media streams avoid breaking news a big headline news they have too much information they have misinformation and that can only fuel your concerns and it's all you know besides you know handling anxiety you want to take care of your physical health take care of your diet your exercise as a you know fewest um palace have already covered sleep is very important a good eight to ten hours of sleep good diet the caregivers parents should also focus on managing their anxiety whether it's yoga medication mindfulness watching a tv show or your favorite uh you know play your favorite game or talk to your relative friend it's really important to have be calm and do something for your own relaxation your child may ask you are you worried so be honest with your child and you can say yes i am worried or i am concerned about this virus but i know how it spreads and i know what to do should one of us get sick you want to approach your kids and ask them what they know kids and teens are getting information from all sorts of sources television peers teachers friends they may have overheard you talking about it so you want to ask them what they have heard about the corona virus and what are their feelings about it what are their questions what are their concerns and you know by providing them a open-ended open-ended questions and a supportive environment you are asking them to give share their concerns with you and once they share their concerns you can correct the misinformation or help fill in the gaps in their knowledge and you know make yourself available be there for them they the children should feel that mom dad or you know uncle and they are there when i need them i can easily go to them they would not be mad at me and you know they'll be there for me too if i have any questions or concerns you know it's a good idea to do regular check-ins um you know it's not a bad idea say hey why don't we talk about this every other day or every day just even for few minutes check in with those children check in with your kids teenagers hey have you heard anything new are you worried about something how are you feeling what are your concerns and you know honestly answer to the best of your capability and if you don't know the answer it's okay to say hey you know what i'm going to find out when i know i will let you know okay um when comments started kids had more emotional reactions they were scared they were you know petrified or but now with as things are evolving things are changing they may have more legitimate uh you know questions and concerns you know teenagers can ask you uh when is the vaccine coming out uh is it is vaccine going to be safe and could i please get the vaccine so these are some of the questions that you can get more information from you know a credible website or you know your care provider or a doctor and share with them that will be very reassuring to them you can also empower them by modeling good behavior you know demonstrate all the prevention behaviors such as what does it mean to be socially distancing what does it mean to uh wash hands and how long you wash hands with little kids you can do you know sing happy birthday song and make a game out of it uh sing happy birthday song twice it's 20 seconds and uh you know when you are not there kids will be able to do it on their own especially the little kids teenagers uh school-aged kids you can involve them in chores in helping around the house uh let you know the whole family be part of this prevention efforts and that the white surfaces so by doing so they feel valued they feel part of you know uh they feel important um and you know when you see them practicing good hygiene praise kids tell them you know hey good job you are doing so great i'm so proud of you not only you're keeping yourself safe you're also helping prevent the spread of the disease and your kids thrive on praise they thrive on reinforcements and you know continue to do that continue to provide some positive feedback and positive reinforcements it's important to you know provide reassurance um kids tend to worry a lot and they like how long it's going to last um so your school age kids your teenagers may ask you you know how are we going to get through it how long it's going to last help kids is um you know um using a family narrative or a story do you remember the time we had our house flooded and uh you know grandmom came to help us uncle came to help us our neighbor came to help us we were all stressed but we got through it so these kind of family stories are very powerful they have a you know really good impact on kids and they will give them hope they make them more resilient so it's uh you know a good idea to remind of remind them of the times when you know you have gotten through something stressful now the point how do we gauge our children's mental health okay uh most children are resilient and they will manage well with family support you know parents be supportive uh grandparents and external family around them they may show some problems like um problems with sleep uh problems with concentration but they are temporary or transient and with you know reassurance and support from parents they should be able to get through this however there are some who will have more risk factors and they will have more intense reactions such as um they will be more anxious they will can show more signs of depression and suicidation or self-harm behaviors so what are those risk factors so these risk factors include a pre-existing mental health issue uh such as a previous anxiety penis uh trauma or history of abuse abuse could be physical emotional or in sexual nature loss of aid loved one a family member due to covered or non-forbid reasons parents may have lost a job family instability financial issues domestic abuse so all these are risk factors so what do we do so when we see our child children you know kids um where is know their kids um they know what's their baseline so if you see certain signs or symptoms that last longer than more than two weeks then it's time to get some professional guidance or help and i'll come to those what what to look for age wise uh you know what are those signs or symptoms in case for preschoolers um you know bedwetting so most kids attend party training by age four boys little later than girls so either you see they have already attained they have achieved potty training and they start wetting their bed again they're going start going in their pants thumb sucking clingy to parents sleep problems not eating well fearful of dark wanting to sleep with mom and dad regression behavior regression could be you know the skill that had they had you know attained is they've lost that skill again it could be bedwetting it could be something like um you know um they know how to feed themselves they know how to dress themselves up like four or five-year-old or six-year-old can do that and suddenly they said no i'm not going to do that i want mommy to dress me up i want daddy to do this for me this is their way of asking for more attention from you more of your time and what can we see in our school-age kids so elementary school kids or uh um you know school-age kids can present with more irritability aggressive behavior clinginess nightmares poor concentration um refusal to do a chores refusal to do schoolwork they can be withdrawn from their friends and activities so and our teens or adolescents can present with irritability aggressive behavior clingy nightmares they can be combative sorry this yeah yeah the adolescence can be sorry um you know agitated they can present with education um they can be combative they can have more argumentative behavior with you they can be more defined they can also present with sleeping and eating disturbance uh school problems poor concentration delinquent behavior physical complaints i have a headache i have a stomachache i don't feel good so how do we what can we do how do we help these people how do we help our kids first and foremost is you know stay calm around them it's really important that uh you know if you're calm as a parent as a caregiver you are you have a sense of you know control and your child sees you that you are calm and in control of your emotions okay and the other important thing is when we talk to our kids we want to use language phrases examples words that they are age appropriate or that they can understand you know it is within their capacity language capacity to understand what's being said what we call as you know at their developmental level so for school age kids what can we do uh school uh facebook kids sorry i started the younger ones uh preschool kids you really want to monitor their television um so you know turn off tv tablets smartphones uh kids hear things see things that can potentially scary especially this social media there's a lot of information out there and it's a lot of misinformation and kids don't understand especially pre-school kids if it's happening let's say you're in the north part of india and something's happening in the south part of india kids may not understand that you know these is happening in in a remote and it made that virus can potentially also there are more deaths there they may think it's happening right in there uh close to their neighborhood um also younger kids you know they need a lot of extra reassurance um cuddles attention um you want to give them time you want to play a new game with them you want to read to them at bedtime a new book or a new something you know different you can do some things with them like hand washing hand washing again you can make it into a playful game invent a new song um with your school age kids with your teenagers again you can involve them in um you know being part of the household helping around with chores our middle schoolers our school-age kids they understand you know what it means to be a have a contagious disease so they understand how coronavirus spreads so it's important to remind them of um you know good uh hygiene um hand washing why you know why it's important to wash hands wearing a mask so what is social distancing and what is the importance of social distancing how you should do it and most kids will you know want to do that um it's very important and i think everybody uh previous families have mentioned that for kids to have a routine kids thrive on a routine so it's really important that have a daily schedule where kids know what time they're waking up what time they're eating what time is the school and after school what time is the leisure time what time is the play time or exercise time bedtime the routine makes the life makes the day predictable and predictability lessens anxiety so this is a really really important i think not only for uh school age kids but you know for everybody kids of all ages and even adults at the routine is very very important um school-age kids may want to engage in certain play they may want to play the same game over and over for example they may want to set up a hospital um and like we're using their lego sets or they may want to play patient doctor games and pins you know should not be worried about it that they are you know um doing the same thing over and over again or they're playing the same game over and over uh this is their way of binding anxiety mastering anxiety and this is a normal way of handling stress so there's nothing wrong with this kind of play uh so you you know don't want to stop them um and let them you know play uh act out be engaged in a creative play some kids the school age gets may regress to almost like your preschooler where they are you know refusing to be very clingy to you or just very much unlike their normal behavior um usually it is going to be transient and with support and your patience you know they will you know get better uh so it's not a good idea to tell them hey you know cut it out or grow up that's not acceptable just be patient with them and lots of patience lots of attention and they will hopefully you know get out of it adolescence and young adults so teens are much more knowledgeable about uh you know what's going on with the virus how it spreads what are the preventive measures and uh what are the futurists so they are also likely not to follow preventive measures so you may have to have some extra talk with them uh or uh you know sit down and watch some videos with them sit down and watch news with them uh have more open-ended conversation let them um you know go to a credible website online and find some facts and then you can talk about it so keep the channel of communication with your teens and your you know special and young adults open so that you can correct any misinformation and let them know that you are available for any kinds of concerns questions as well as you know check in with them how are you feeling about it because it's important to know if they are scared or you know what's going on again teens can be involved in you know more of household chores like shopping and they can watch a younger sibling they can help prepare meals they can uh you know help you correct supplies should you should you get quarantined by helping i think they feel that they are valued they're a valid member of the family they're contributing to something uh so they feel empowered and you know when you feel empowered it lessens your anxiety so no one knows how long it's going to last but we can help our kids become you know more resilient emotionally stable and physically protected as possible through a carefully planned means of engaging with our case at this time of crisis so the take home message would be stay calm it's very important as caregivers parents for you to be in control of your emotions and whatever it takes for you to get your emotions under control uh including you know self-care mindfulness yoga exercise um you know something to a leisure activity to help you with your mental health as uh then um again listen to your case um be available lend a ear um you know be very supportive and welcoming create a very welcoming environment where they feel that you're not judging them you're not going to be mad at them but you are there for them to answer questions and concerns and every now and then provide reassurance especially for little kids you know they need to know things will be all right yes eventually you can say that yes you are safe here as your school is safe and i'm keeping this i'll make sure that you're safe at home and eventually we'll get through this together we will be fine be a role model you can be a role model whether it comes to you know managing your anxiety or you know practicing for good hygiene hand washing to keeping your mask on always or social distancing um you know you can do some activities with them the exercise daily exercise is very important for all of us so kids you can if you get you know get them involved in either they can do daily biking or play outside or you can also do as a family you know give them some tools give them some coping skills such as deep breathing yoga um yoga um you know lot of youtube videos um catered to kids of different age to help them with yoga you know like animal yoga so it may be a good idea to watch those um videos with them or you know practice alone focus on positives um let them know what's going well you are healthy i'm healthy we have a place to live we have enough food point out what's going well okay and again i cannot emphasize enough establish a daily routine routine is so important it will bind anxiety it will give them structure a predictable predictability and a purpose um identify projects to do with kids that might help others like you know volunteer volunteer to uh drop off um essentials foods um to homeless people or uh help out a neighbor who cannot get out bring them you know groceries when kids get involved and they're doing things for us you know there's a sense of contributing again contributing to the community and feeling important valued last but not least is offered lots of love and affection so with that i will it was in my presentation thank you so much uh okay now we've completely run over uh by half an hour or close to half an hour uh there are two ways we could be responding to the questions and i don't know uh you know i know our guests from italy and america have a whole day's work left uh ahead of them uh they two ways uh mr sophie that we can answer this either we can individually get all the questions sorted out or i can take another ten minutes if that's okay with you to run through a few it's okay it's okay so professor you may want to unless you can give us time there's one question which i definitely need your as soon as i find the question in the meantime yeah please tell us how to know the difference between hypoxic versus inflammatory changes that's one question which came in so the question is about how the information sorry so the question um as it was typed out was what is the difference between hypoxic versus inflammatory changes okay okay so i mean all both the phenomena can have a detrimental effect on the neuroplasticity through different mechanisms the hypoxia is a more acute and more and most of the time you have an abrupt change that can be detected either at the clinical level or even with some form of neurofunctional assessment you know imaging function on your imaging uh inflammation instead is a is a is less evident and can be not easily to detect because it involve especially in vibram the microglia that is is activated and this activation is not immediately accessible either at the clinical level or uh even with instrumental assessment like function mri which spectroscopy as an example probably the most effective way to assess that so the issue is that inflammation can can work without hiddenly in the brain for a long time and depending on the vulnerability of each subject can affect different parts of the brain and now most of our modeling of mental so-called mental disorders involve some form of very light information that impact the natural plasticity of the brain so inflammation uh is opposed to the plasticity and uh the four can can can be part of a mechanism or different disorders and diffusing the brain the copy 19 is probably is one of the potential source of inflammation in the brain and we have to be aware of that and to consider not just the psychological understanding and assessment that is very very important of course but also to be in continuity with some kind of medical assessment to avoid the risk of the long-term consequences of information um uh just as i don't understand what you said uh professor a little better uh how many people actually get an inflammation of the brain who have contracted the virus are there any percentages of people who so does everybody who's had the virus uh get a you know neurological or inflammation upset or disturbance what is it a percentage i mean according to the first uh data we have from china you know the first kazistic being presented a large percentage of subject with kobe 19 neurological signs or symptoms something in between 40 and 80 percent so a large majority probably of a subject of course not all the subject presenting with neurological symptoms should have uh inflammation in the brain could be due to different uh cause including the psychological stress of a situation but nevertheless this deserves a specific assessment and as i show it's been already involved in the assessment for the definition of a case according to uk health as an example but is not yet considered enough in the discharge because i i've been i got the idea and i developed the idea that i i publish with my colleague from harvard and albert einstein about the importance of this fact because i was involved in the unit for the assessment of a patient discharged from the intensive care unit in my hospital and i was surprised that they've been called only once for you know under the patient because was not part of a normal routine my opinion is that that is very d is extremely dangerous to discharge a patient from the hospital without an assessment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms so uh my my claim is for a more close attention of his uh level of function of this patient because based on the statistic of a large number of this subject could have based on the data published from the colleague from hong kong this could have a long-term sequila i mean if you don't treat them the progress and the increase of the severity can last for years and so as soon as you can get the control over this process as much as you can reduce the risk of long-term disability in this population so is extremely important because when the patient is charged without any follow-up for this specific dimension can length can last for you know months in in some form of mind symptomatology without any specific support so this is the risk we cannot run this risk i think what we have to get over and we have to to follow up and to monitor it doesn't mean that each patient had to be seen by a psychiatrist this means that medical doctor involved in the care of this patient should be aware of the importance of this dimension of the disorders um you know this is very interesting uh conversation i wish we had a lot more time to do a deeper dive because what we've noticed in india versus the rest of uh you know versus the western world is there is a change or there's a difference of mortality uh counts we're less affected and so the jury is still open out there to find out why it is that fewer indians are actually um dying from from kovit i don't know from our indian uh panel and i'm it's a pity that dr sahar's network is a little poor right now but maybe dr nagpal are there any studies in india because you know inflammation 40 to 60 percent affected sounds like very bad numbers is there anything that we know in india has yet no i i'm not aware of asha but yes i i i do you know see that there's a lot of you know as far as the very fact that you're saying the mortality is less there are many factors which may be contributing to it you know it may be because uh as it is uh you know our exposure is most right from childhood so our immune system is attuned in such a way it is more robust probably uh you know handling infections so that could be and some you know somewhere i was reading it could be the tb injection that we get epg factors which is probably you know so i i think it's too early uh you know stage to actually to be able to answer any of those questions i'm sure that a lot of work is being done you know by the premier institutes and you know in times to come very very soon we'll be getting the data and we'll be in a better position to actually comment on anything but right now i'm not aware of anything you know which might have come so but after as the mental health part is concerned it's really uh you know nice to hear from uh professor palanti about you know all these sort of uh changes wherein there are two ways they are saying you know one is that you have a covet and then you are getting the neurological changes and the second is that you are getting only the neurological you know symptoms so that's what i could understand actually the question is are you asymptomatic and maybe you're getting an uh information because one of the questions that i came across was somebody saying that i feel all of the above that you were saying uh and especially your doctor i can't sleep unstressed i'm cranky so forth so how does one detect uh other than of course this wonderful questionnaire that i saw professor palanti on your presentation deck so be happy so right now i think we at least you know personally i would say i am not at a stage to be able to say that this is because of you know corona or is it is it you know uh the pre-existing mental health problem but yes you know in time to come as we keep on getting data you know from all over the world we will be in a better position to say that whether this is happening you know because of the virus or you know is it something pretty existing you know genetic sort of problem which is happening but right now you know i don't know if somebody comes to me and says that you know i have your you know depression or something i perhaps will not think about corona i'm frankly telling you i would rather take that you know trying more as as a regular you know thing and you know treat them on a regular basis but yes from now on probably i you know i'll keep my uh you know open so that in case such a thing is happening we can actually check for corona but yes because anxiety uh the thing you know the the screening questionnaire that uh professor valenti has uh shared that will be helpful because those those cases are coming those we are seeing and we are actually you know handling these and we probably are actually handling it like any other you know anxiety case but yes now you know we have specific sort of screening tools and we can actually go ahead and do it a specialized work yeah only in the interest of time uh uh doctor when we lost you for a bit because of the network problems i couldn't address this question to you but i have no time to ask you this question however later i will connect with you uh because i think professor palanti has raised a lot of weight facts and will be interesting again i don't mean to panic anybody including myself i'm already panic thank you would it be interesting to know how to deal with this um you know we ought to go a little better okay um again you know dr verma and professor palanti whenever you do want to get back to work or if you can spend some time and mr i can keep addressing all the questions you need to get me to keep quiet when you're done however before you go let me at least to our international faculty because i know we can get our indian presenters uh relatively uh easier i'm assuming sorry but i'm working so just to ask um my international speakers so there's a very interesting uh question uh professor and and dr varmath there's so many children related questions on you as well um so here's a comment i don't know whether we're different culturally versus what's happening in the west so here's the comment scared of going out we are scared of going to the office but we have to go regularly can't understand what to do is that the same fear that people have in italy and in america for that matter people are petrified of getting out but you know what they're resentful i you have the same experience outside of india professor palanti that's for you so about the you know above screening of this patient i just want to add that inflammation is related mostly to some dimension of depression that have some specificity so usually when depression is related to inflammation you mostly find three fundamental symptoms anedonia between loss of pleasure cognitive cognitive disorders or cognitive impairment and reduce energy of fatigue so it's a specific clinical picture now and if you find this and it's related to a previous infection and is a time correlated not to uh we know that is also a risk factor for suicidal behavior so i i thought that this specific population of that have suffering for kovid and then develop this syndrome with his three uh main core symptoms should be screened not everybody but of course this should be more accurate assessment this is my uh just to reduce the now because of course the number of patients that physician are facing now is huge i mean there are so many patients so we need some screening and we're offering a uh we're now validating a screening question so in case anybody want to know him or to we will please to send to everybody to to to share you know this experience that we are doing now in new york thank you very much for this so we will take it forward i'm sure uh dr nagpal and dr on what we could do uh in terms of you know better response in india um doctor meghan just shifting our focus to child health because um you know that so many questions have emerged so here's what people are saying because they've got homeschooling as a you know through zoom or through some uh web links etc people are saying or a question came in children are increasingly becoming homebound they increasingly liking to stay home and do not want to venture outdoors is it acceptable behavior and how should a parent deal with it okay so that's really a good question uh you know they've been forced to uh stay at home initially because of schools being shut down and as schools are reopening still most of the schools i think here as well as there are online okay so now are they they are more comfortable they feel safe in their house um so that is you know this is something they have they are doing for some you know some certain months so they were getting more comfortable so it's uh you know up to the parent to um you know try and create opportunities for them to get out more and you know again start out in baby steps start out with daily walks start with you know just meeting one friend in a socially distant way in a park okay so you gradually you want to help them get over that fear and you know get them to baseline and if you see there are some who are really resistant and are more petrified then you know they may need some more help and we need to be satisfied and professional okay another question which came through is how do you reduce screen time um you know so while we can say don't watch media don't watch youtube don't watch facebook and you can't so what do you do what do you do in america what do you advise you anyway so you know it is a pretty uh standard recommendation now by american academy of sciences and psychiatry but american academy of pediatrics american sleep medicine all these three societies have gotten together and saying hey for a school age kid the average screen time should not be more than two hours limited as parents we need to limit it okay so a child should be given this this is a privilege this is not a right this is not a given okay so here it is basically training parents to train kids okay so working with friends hey um you know try again establish a routine establish a structure establish um you know what the expectations are and then they can have screen time as a reward okay um so it is not again um you know their birthright and kids would fight you but once they know that you are serious about it and they are only going to earn this as a privilege then we'll you know they'll fall into that pattern and stop uh accept the limits or accept the rules but it's really important to watch what they are you know limited and also what they're watching the content for every age especially you know young kids preschoolers school age kids and even teenagers okay what i'm going to do is uh i know it's getting really late i'm going to ask about two or three questions someone on child health and you know and and thank you dr nathwell and doctors are you just giving such fantastic content so just a couple of questions on children one is a set of people who are saying adolescents they don't listen to us and they're getting really bored and they're getting very frustrated uh sitting at home should we let them out you know um what do you advise parents yeah so again it's a judgment call um you know yes you cannot keep them homebound but an activity that is safe for them you know an outdoor activity let's say hiking biking you know something that they can do in a safe manner with another peer or you know a small group um i think that should be okay so you don't want that yeah question was how do you keep them entertained but i know your presentation has got a lot of that uh content covered anyway with your permission man could we actually publish your all of your presentations on um the website and and panel yes do we have your commission yes okay great somebody wants to know how to cope up with over viewing tv and you've already responded to that um in terms of psychological issues how one could distinguish between a child and adult kids may not be that expressive so uh they may be irritable you know if they have any problem or if they're feeling low uh they may actually uh you know they may sometimes you know they they may show brutality or uh sometimes you know it it may be just about their grades you know which may be coming down so these are few things from which we can actually come to know and like you know regression may be there while they were you know acting like uh you know according to the their age as the pressure is there they may start you know going into a lower sort of a stage wherein they want to uh cling to their parents or uh you know those sort of behaviors will be there but in adults of course it's it's like you know if somebody is sad you more or less you would know that they are you know they may be low or uh sometimes they may have some sort of guilt you know the concentration may be low they may not be getting the sort of pleasure that they were getting earlier then energy levels may actually reduce they may be having all sorts of you know pains aches so all those things you know so this is how most more or less you know you can distinguish with with adults the symptoms may be you know is easy to pick but with kids they may be cranky you know irritable and i think uh you know they themselves do not understand what's happening to them so you know as the caretaker or as the parent it's your role you know where you have to take over and you have to actually understand and you have to provide the right sort of atmosphere and bring that child out of you know yeah so i would just like to piggyback on what you said uh you know uh the child uh they do not come they're not verbal they're not expressing they would come hey mom that i think i have depression they would act out or behaviorally and you know child has like three domains you know social academic and you know home so any change in their behavior um in the academic setting grades are falling you know they're failing they were bright a b student so that's a change from their baseline any change in their behavior you know suddenly as they're not sleeping refusing to eat that's a change so look for any change from their baseline and it's a change process especially this is somebody who had several friends who would like to talk to friends suddenly they're saying no i am not i don't want to talk to any friends i don't want to be with them i don't want to speak to them i don't want to be in the phone with grandpa so this is a change from their baseline so when you see change and change persists for more than two weeks it's time to kind of you know get some guidance or consulting professional yes okay um so dr sahar while you were presenting yeah and i've been waiting for your internet connection to come back strong on um here's a question which came up uh which is how do you convince a patient that he or she needs to go to a psychiatrist because of the stigma because of the fear uh and they're suffering from multiple illnesses like ibp diabetes fatty liver etc so how do you you know get somebody to actually go to psychiatrist nowadays the stigma has come down significantly with respect to psychiatric disorder in this part of the country nowadays celebrities do help us in a big way they have started talking about psychiatric illness and associating with the psychiatrist they have done our job much easier with the advent of a modern medication modern treatment people earlier used to have this notion that psychiatrist means psychiatric medication means a sleeping pill and they will be dependent on that or electric shock therapy now we have come up with uh we always tell patients that we don't prescribe sleeping pills only their psychiatry is not just what we call madness there is plethora of problems that we deal with and that is how we are dealing we are trying to okay uh i know we have lost doctor sahar's connection and signal again i'm sure he'll come back i'm very actively involved within in a media platform also so this is how we approach also i think uh um dr natwal and her slides did say please be open and honest and upfront talk to people and so did you know dr van that's that's a good takeaway there's a comment which says um there's scared of commercialization of most of the hospitals and doctors uh and you know i have to read this out because it's true a lot of people are saying this only big personalities are given special care but for common people it is a big question whether they were survived or infected it's on their feet i'm too one among them what would you like to say to this i don't know whether it's a gentleman or a lady they believe that the common person in india will not get adequate care is that true you ask may i respond to this yes please i it is for the event yes yes sure sure the everybody each and every citizen of india uh gets a is has a right to seek a treatment whether he or she has a money or a fame name and everybody gets treatment it's uh only a purchasing power the type of infrastructure they can avail otherwise treatment everybody gets treatment is everywhere same only the infrastructure and may there may be a variation but uh everybody gets a treatment this uh it's a wrong notion to hold that only rich people get a treatment no and maybe after that we in fact spoke to a survivor in the initial days of you know when you had survivors of of courage uh when we just only started interacting with this and he was saying such fantastic thing about a public hospital a government hospital and he was talking about not you know his hiccups were really well uh endowed in terms of high income group family and he was telling us that he wasn't charged for dying and he got such fantastic treatment and care so you know whoever sent this question we should see we're not getting syllables um i i know professor palanti and i know dr verma getting a little restless um what i could do with your permission uh mr sophie help me out here please is we could actually send a set of questions individually to all the doctors is that would that be okay with our panelists so that we can actually upload the responses i would take that responsibility and i'm sorry i will have to chase you for more answers but we cannot go one hour over time i mean we've already done it we'll be okay thank you thank you so much okay so thank you very very much there is so many questions still left to be attended thank you very much we are already long long overdue um please please keep checking on this social media platform and family dot in slash community i promise you as soon as we keep getting questions uh for whoever is still hanging in there and watching our webinar you will find all the responses to all your questions from each and every of our panelists with this note i'm going to sign off um thank you so so very much your presentations one thing i thought which is really rude of me because i was mindful of the time your presentations were so fantastic your content each one of you you know the reason i didn't push you is because you've all worked so hard to get this meaningful uh mr sophie would you like to make one last comment please oh thanks to everybody i mean uh the interest which has been shown by the arts fans and the kind of coverage which has been done by all panelists this is fantastic in fact i was listening each and every world whatsoever was spoken there and it has definitely enlightened me but i am sure this will help all of us to face this pandemic especially the mental health issues which we know is becoming very critical thanks to all of you thanks for feeling your valuable time thank you very very much okay we'll just wait to get ,True,False,True,False

management to avoid suicidal tendencies or suicidal events in psychotherapy now um psychotherapy is at the core of care for personality disorders face-to-face counseling with a specialist psychiatrist now because personality disorders produce symptoms as a result of poor or limited coping skills psychotherapy aims to improve perceptions of and a responses to social and environmental stressors next in patient care yes pedi pusilong because the underlying disorder remains basically unchanged by the by impatient interventions length of stay should be minimized to avoid dependency and subverts recovery from the circumstances prompting the hospitalization lastly you can do transfers some patients hospitalize in a psychiatric units of general hospitals where stays are generally shorter than two weeks maybe now this may require transfer to psychiatric hospitals that can provide long-term care all right patient stay hospital hospital my psychiatric ward general ward then you can decide for a referral to a long-term care facility which actually caters psychiatric um needs for patients okay once again these are your three medical management let's proceed pharmacologic through uh treatment or management now nurses i want you to understand that medications are in no way curative for any personality disorder they should be viewed as an adjunct not main medication but adjunct therapy supportive therapy to psychotherapy so that patient may be productively engaged in psychotherapy ampina again is psychotherapy in treating your personality disorders the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors another ssris a newer antidepressants are safe and reasonable effective however because the depression of most patients with personality disorders stems from their limited range of coping capacities antidepressants are usually less effective than in patients with uncomplicated major depression okay next anti-convulsants these agents are useful for stabilizing the affective extremes in patients with bipolar disorder but they are less effective in doing so in patients with personality disorders they have some demonstrated efficacy in suppressing impulsive and particularly aggressive behavior in patients with personality disorders next you have your antipsychotics response to antipsychotics in patients with a personality disorder is less dramatic than it is in true psychotic access one disorders but symptoms such as an anxiety hostility and sensitivity to rejection may be reduced once again these are your pharmac pharmacological treatment or management for patients diagnosed with any one of those types of personality disorders okay next next okay nursing assessment first of all history taking tayo many of these clients report disturbed early relationships with their parents that often begin at 18 to 30 months of age 50 of these clients have experienced childhood sexual abuse others have experienced physical and verbal abuse or parental alcoholism history taking porn important because that could be a basis of the doctors and all the medical team para malama monument is between 18 to 30 years old 50 of them are actually sexually abused next mood and affect this is another part of your nursing assessment the pervasive mood is dysphoric involving unhappiness restlessness and malay clients often report intense loneliness boredom frustration and feeling empty you no matter what they do they're not enough said okay now i'm just trying to i'm joking around don't get me wrong i just don't make this discussion lively i'm trying next thought process and content thinking about self and others is often polarized and extreme which is sometimes referred to as splitting clients tend to adore and idealize other people even after a brief acquaintance but then quickly devalue them if these others do not meet their expectations in some ways get knowing next sensorium and intellectual process nurses intellectual capacities are intact and clients are fully oriented to reality okay and on a on nursing interventions nurses promoting clients safety very topmost priority okay the nurse must always seriously consider suicidal ideation with the presence of a plan access to means of enacting the plan and self-harm behaviors in institute appropriate interventions next promoting therapeutic relationships regardless of the clinical setting the nurse must provide structure in limit setting in the therapeutic relationship in a clinic setting this may mean seeing the client for scheduled appointments of a predetermined length rather than whenever the client appears and demands the nurse's immediate attention scheduled commitment diagnosed with personality disorder um you need to commit to something you need to inculcate that to them next establishing boundaries in relationships the nurse must be quite clear about establishing the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship to ensure that neither the clients nor the nurse's boundaries are violated boundaries you as a nurse and you don't want that that's why you need to establish boundaries onset of the treatment or the moment that you meet that client set up clear boundaries to your patient and not just to your patient and all also to yourself all right next teaching effective communication skills which is very important it is important to teach basic communication skills such as eye contact active listening taking turns talking validating the meaning of others of another's communication and using i statement i statement okay malibu subordinating helping clients to cope and to control emotions the nurse can help the clients to identify their feelings and learn to tolerate them without exaggerated responses such as destruction of property or self-harm keeping a journal often helps clients gain awareness of feelings journals one way okay next reshaping thinking patterns cognitive restructuring is a technique useful in changing patterns of thinking by helping clients to recognize negative thoughts and feelings and to replace them with positive patterns of thinking thought stopping is a technique to alter the process of negative or self-critical thought patterns of treatment personality disorder more long-term slow progress is because you are talking about reshaping thinking patterns you become what you think your mind is so powerful what we put in our mind becomes up because who becomes who we are as a person so it takes time it takes commitment and it takes consistency for you as a nurse and for the patient whenever you're dealing with personality disorders next structuring the clients daily activities structuring apple and commitment is very important in you know treating your personality disorders minimizing unstructured time by planning activities can help clients to manage time alone the clients or clients can make a written schedule that includes appointments shopping reading the paper and going for a block yes nurses thank you so much please like share and subscribe to my channel for more nursing educational videos let me know boy if you have other nursing topics that you want me to create for you

JZ1L_xq3kCI,"Tips for Good Mental Health while Working &amp; Learning from Home by Psychiatrist, Dr Tay Kai Hong, SKH",UC1hp0pDwWzZPeKqq4K0LoeQ,Brahm Centre,2021-06-05T09:03:25Z,Dr Tay offers brilliant tips to individuals and parents to better manage learning and working from home to maintain good mental health. The last half hour ...,all right first of all yeah thank you to ram center and andrew for advising me to give a talk today i hope the audience will learn something um then so the topic is working from home in the area of kobe 19 right tip to boost your mental health so i also run the specialized sleep medicine clinic at synchron hospital in that state clinic we see different types of sleep disorders like insomnia disorder obstructive sleep apnea and other forms of interesting disorders so i'll also be talking a bit about how to improve your sleep when you are working from home and when they are stressed because of pandemic okay feel free to type into the chat box or if there are any uh specific questions uh for myself and even ng um we'll address them later on right so when we think about working from home these are some of the images that may conjure up in our minds right we may be concentrating on the laptop uh writing an essay for work with a crossover next to us or like this caucasian gentleman i have difficulty finding uh asian faces in the stock photos you see and also um you may be something like this this mom right uh guiding your kids during home-based learning right so a lot of picture-perfect family-friendly uh pictures of tranquility peace and concentration at work however the reality may be quite different or as most of you may already know we may have to contend with non-stop emails or even text messaging right now this every office has a whatsapp group without without the boss inside right and there's no alone time because your spouse may be at home family members may be at home if there are kids when you know moe you know kicks up kicks off the home-based learning is is another big stressor for the parents right who have to struggle with child care as well as kids at home for those of us with elderly at home during the first circuit breaker the nursing homes and some of the dementia day care centers senior activity centers they are also closed down also the care giving duties will increase in the day time even as you are expected to work um confining ourselves at home there is no outdoors no sunlight or physical activity levels would drop for those of us who are living alone there's another set of problems right although there are less say caregiving duties less distractions but we will then tend to feel lonely uh coping ourselves at home like you know like a prison within the four walls solitary confinement and then you know the world has changed right with zoom and webex and all the digital platforms where meetings are work is now conducted there's no face-to-face interaction whatsoever everything is through a screen so zoom zoom and zoom again so you can see there are a lot of articles actually documenting the mental health perils of working from home chronically singapore's stress levels show working from home is no holiday or this respondent clarence who was interviewed in this article talked about how she was how she used to knock off at 6 p.m but now it feels like she's working any time all the time at home there's no end to the working hours there's no start even right she could be sending emails at middle of the night she could be taking a nap at 4pm right so it really is a different reality for us most of us probably work well on work from home but some of us may find it difficult to code so there are other articles local articles right cna putting 50 putting in 50 hours while working from home is a struggle to draw a line between work and home right some of us may neglect our mental well-being says i am h a psychologist mr natalie and being forced to work at home can create stress and fatigue for workers singaporeans are stressed out from being working from home and from the kobe 19 pandemic in general such that 50 61 of those working from home are stressed out from work and this is higher than the 53 of frontliners uh frontliners may include healthcare workers right doctors and nurses those of us in essential services can you imagine that it's quite surprising i expect uh working from home to be less taxing less draining but the survey objectively shows that an even higher percentage of people working from home may be stressed out more than even the pandemic frontliners because so i'm gonna talk about briefly just five mental health tips but i expand on each area in more detail okay number one is setting the boundaries between work and home life because working from home really blessed the boundary right and uh it blends the boundaries in more than one ways which i'll elaborate upon later secondly managing relationships are all the more important because we are confined maybe 24 7 or with our loved ones and we may be missing out with our friends or our co-workers caring for yourself effective stress management and number four is about a more psychological uh philosophical kind of a shift in mindset cultivating gratitude and finally getting good sleep so point number one um working from home as i mentioned lost the boundaries between work and home in more than one ways it bless boundaries temporarily there is no longer like working hours nine to five you know in the past even when we work overtime you know maybe at 9 00 pm when i finally finish my work and i knock off even though it's not late at night i can finally go to kofu to get my sample get my dinner go home even though it's late and i'm tired at least i can switch off and i can work but right now it's like i can always assess my emails and answer my you know that may be meeting schedule after office hours because everyone is working from home so that is a new norm and i'm always multitasking right preparing breakfast and preparing for the meeting at the same time okay also bless the boundaries uh geographically because we are physically at home and we are working in our personal spaces could be the living room the study some of us the bedrooms or working in the children's playroom for example so there is no longer a physical distinction between work areas and home areas psychologically as well because then some of us may have work stress in last time and when it ends it ends right we get to enjoy the weekends but now um the boundaries are blurred temporarily dramatically and that's our minds our brains may start to unconsciously associate our homes without stress through a process called classical conditioning where we our minds will unconsciously associate things in our life between two areas and that can result in bug stress all around right okay so tip number one um how do we demarcate the boundary between work and home better preserve that boundary even while we work from home so very simple practical tips right temporarily um time wise we can follow a consistent schedule be disciplined about our work hours try to keep your devices screens and emails away after hours if you can right if unless it's a mandate from the office by the boss for example or it's a scheduled meeting after hours otherwise try to be disciplined about keeping your devices screens and emails are away especially during your bid time right because this um these modern features of our lives will never fail to disrupt our sleep and our rest time but there's never ends right or we can always do more right even even though it's already after work hours officially okay geographically we can try to designate uh strictly for work areas and non-work areas um it's inevitable that some of these areas may mix up right you know but but we can try to be disciplined about it and it can help to reduce the psychological blurring between work stress or work routines and personal family time personal and pers family uh you know rest time for example so we still want to preserve the structures and routines um that we had even before working from home these structures and routines which i will talk about how we will psychologically help us to transition between uh in the morning when we prepare for work and in the evenings when we end work even when even though we are at home so before work we can try taking a walk outside um or taking a bus to prepare for work even though we are working from home we can try also changing to formal attire something more formal maybe maybe a polo t-shirt right um or a smart casual kind of wear if you're dean icon because the the weather is really so hot these days right so having some routines built in maybe a 15 to half an hour routine before work can help us psychologically transition from our home personal rest time mindset to our work myself um all of us will have different identities and roles and for me at least how i behave and and think in work may be quite different from how i behave and think when i'm home or with my family right so i'm sure i think it's uh it's like that for most of us so we really want to get into the work place identity the occupational role that we have and leave behind um the family role or for example if we can right psychologically before we start work in the morning so after work or you can change back to your home outfit or you can take a walk in the garden again so taking a walk kind of stimulates uh the journey the the commute commuting time to work uh we no longer get to take the bus or mrt but at least we we can take a walk downstairs and also get some sunlight that will help with our sleep as well right okay so we can demarcate the boundary between work from home in several different ways right temporarily or by hours spatially and geographically by demarcating designating what areas and also psychologically right okay so we move on to the second tip um probably maybe the the most challenging right it's managing relationships okay so the um work from home when we spend almost a whole day with our family even though we have to work it really creates a strain for some family relationships um of course all of us may be in different circumstances right but but on national level or in the year of 2020 the sos local sos agency they had a 20 increase in crisis costs and a lot of these calls okay this is in the year 2020 as compared to 2019 and you know that 2020 was uh characterized by the circuit breaker and subsequently also um public was discouraged to leave the house and for doing for many months most of our parents have been working from home also in in the whole year there's a 20 increase in crisis cost compared to the previous year 2019. a lot of these are reported to be due to conflicts with romantic partners and family members causing a lot of emotional distress okay let's see what this straits times articles article talks about so i'm starting calls to sos as more distressing amino pandemic right okay so they also receive uh uh you know when when people have a suicide contemplate about suicide ideas and at times sometimes we advise our patients to call sos right as a as a crisis kind of measure just for someone to talk to and we can see that there are other problems with uh family relationships as well during the circuit breaker other countries call it a lockdown right china was the first country to go into lockdown and what the social scientists and and the divorce lawyer law agencies right they found that the divorce rates really spiked during the time of corona virus quarantine and this was experienced on the national level in all the major countries spain italy all the countries with major lockdowns uh you know the the family law family lawyers had uh made a lot more money because they were receiving a lot of inquiries about divorce especially during the time of the lockdown i'm not sure whether this is mirrored in singapore but from the sos data it seems like well there is definitely more marital strain during times of uh circuit breaker and working from home also there was a big issue with domestic abuse while in the past the victims of domestic abuse could leave their houses leave their houses for example to take a walk in the garden or go shopping not to escape the traumatic experiences at home during circuit breaker they were almost not legally bound to stay at home so they were in effect uh forced enforced captivity with their abuse perpetrators you can imagine how that how distressing that may be so the the abuse may come in different forms right um what we are most familiar with would be physical abuse whether it's towards children towards the elderly in singapore um some sometimes you see in the news that the foreign domestic helpers our foreign helpers we some of them maybe they may get abused when the families are stressed out right so all these victims of abuse they really had a hard time on during the lockdown of course there is also uh just verbal abuse or psychological abuse okay so let's move on so how to manage relationships and prevent um further family strain marital strain and also with our partners our spouses with our families that our parents for those of us who are taking care of elderly parents at home and also our children right so spending more time together does not necessarily mean more conflict right um easier said than done but we should all make greater efforts to practice kindness and patience to each other and not let the more time spent together translate to more conflict and strain right give each other some breathing space especially when we are expected to work from home so i'll share with you some practical devices some aids later that we can use okay okay while we are on the topic of relationships also not forgetting that we used to go to office and have to have colleagues to chat with a water cooler time right to gossip about but now there's no face-to-face interaction so naturally that may lead to more miscommunication between colleagues so what the expert's uh advice will be to body up with your colleagues stay in touch with each other even though you are not seeing each other anymore working in teams will help right so maybe the office can be split into different speed teams right each team may have three to four members and within the three or four of you really also try to bond over and beyond just uh doing work together staying connected digitally or even though there's no face-to-face and working from home also introduces other practical barriers to effective work right some of us for me i'm i'm really frustrated every time the iit issues there's something down with the problems with the wi-fi internet connection or i.t issues so this can serve to create more work stress as well as also cause more miscommunication between workers and for those of us who are only or do pay attention to your psychological needs or you may have more time because you're no longer traveling so may have more time to devote yourself to the hobbies maybe spend more time preparing good breakfast for yourself or stay connected with your friends uh through zoom and webex and whatsapp videos even though you are not meeting them outside okay okay so so home-based learning is almost like a nightmarish term for parents who are required to work from home um my my yeah it's my my my kids are like in baby and toddler right so they are not going to formal school yet but my friends who are parents of school going kids primary school secondary school they tell me that it is impossible to work from home and do home-based learning so the workbook quality will suffer when they have to supervise their children home-based learning thankfully the moe in conjunction with national library board and hpb and msf they actually came out with this three-part home-based learning kit for parents on how to guide their children for students right to do home-based learning and they actually have a very practical tips for example you know we know they're working from home and supervising young kids can be tough so what to do when my children interrupt me too frequently what to do when my children are bought what to do and they cannot stay focused to complete their homework effectively and they are spending too much time working on a screen right this is a part three so there's a two other parts or you can just uh google moe home-based learning kit and all these resources will come out it's quite interesting the tips are very practical for example adjust your expectations with kids around you probably cannot sit down for long periods to focus on your tasks right so just mentally adjusting your expectations about how how it may affect the quality of your work or how you are not able to concentrate for two hours at a goal that mental preparation will put you in a better position to tackle the challenges right breaking up uh bigger tasks to smaller segments so that you can attend to your children or in between the smaller tasks right be kind to yourself give yourself some incentives and rewards to stay on track remember that you need breaks too or joining your children's activities to get away from work and spend quality family time okay then this is number four is something that i want to emphasize uh specifically so uh modeling the behavior which you want your kids to to take over right um putting away your laptop and switching off the computer when you're done with your work or limiting your screen time as much as you want your children to limit their screen time okay okay so the kit um introduces some practical device we can use such as this uh you can write on the timetable like mommy is having a meeting from 10 am to 11 am you can paste it outside your study room so that your kids and your spouse will know what to expect and that one hour is really uh your family will know that you'll be engaged with your work and no one should bother you right of course it will take some time for your kids to adjust uh in the first two or three times they may still knock in the door dash in and ask for your attention but after the learning process after some time hopefully they get a hang of it and they know what to expect right so daddy is having a meeting from 2 30 to 3 p.m right okay also putting something like that outside uh will prepare the whole family mentally for uh for the day right and of course you can also put in dedicated slots for your for your for your children like 9 30 a.m to 10 a.m is to supervise our boy for english lessons right okay so we talked about practicing more kindness and patience to family and friends right and co-workers it's really easier said than done when we ourselves are stressed right so translating words to deed and what i mean is that um first we need to take good care of ourselves right be kind to yourselfers so not just being compassionate to others but we talk about self-compassion and we can see how we can do this managing stress effectively within ourselves so that we are more mentally resilient and so that we can then better take care of the needs of others right when we are well taken care of by ourselves and then we can practice kindness and patience that much more more practically to other people cultivating gratitude something that's more psychological which are talked about later so caring for yourself how to manage stress effectively during working from home or just during the era of phobia 19 in general it's really no rocket science right but these are the things that we will forget we will definitely forget from time to time when we are stressed we start to binge we may stock up on chocolates and eat beets like and um engage in you know maybe all sorts of unhealthy habits right whether it's with our diet or to stop exercise completely because our sleep hours are screwed up and we are stressed and we have just no motivation to exercise anymore taking care of your sleep also so really it's to remind ourselves from time to time that in order to work well and to take good care of our families and be kind and patient to others we first have to take good care of ourselves and eat healthily have a balanced meals the science behind this shows that the colorful foods and fruits are the more brightly colored they are strawberries blueberries green yellow bell peppers for example these colorful fruits they serve to boost the good chemicals in our brains right and also nuts so nuts and fruits vegetables or just having a balanced diet or in general is more important so that's how we can take good care of ourselves uh nutritionally looking into the exercise part um physical exercise not only strengthens our bones and our muscles but they also boost the good chemicals called endorphins in our brains so the more stress we are actually the more we should exercise because the exercise is almost like a natural a medicine for depression anxiety and for stress um these are the things that would suffer to work from home you know because if you thought you would tap out food for three meals a day and then the food panda would arrive outside no no and you would not exercise because the government says we cannot go out right so you can still go out and exercise go jogging go swimming right um sleep will naturally suffer when we are cooked at home all day with no sunlight exposure right uh relationships what we've talked about or inject the the main principle is really to practice patients and kindness but do it to ourselves as before to others don't not forgetting that all of us will still need our own hobbies our own or me time right to do the things that we like so avoid uh devices right smoking too much using alcohol to fall asleep using alcohol to cope with stress um for some of us it could be binge eating binge shopping as far as for some of the younger guys you know for a lot of students it is indulging in computer gaming the whole day but unhealthy internet news not just binging on youtube videos the whole day neglecting work and family as a form as a form of escape from the stresses of life this will not solve any problem but just compound the problem right okay so it's actually paying attention to your thoughts your feelings and your needs and your needs will include not just your physical needs like all of all of the above but also your emotional needs right in terms of your relationships your rest and your hobbies so this is really not a tip but it's more reminder to all of us which uh we we will do well if we bear this in mind from time to time so which vulnerable uh vulnerable groups are more prone to chronic stress in time of during the time of pandemic that will include most of some of us who are exposed to kobe 19 and are being served a quarantine or stay home notice my sister was inadvertently exposed last month and was caught up for quarantine order at a hotel so you could some of us could see that it's quite a fun experience right you go to a hotel free staycation but you are released confined to a hotel room for up to 14 days right so it's really a very stressful experience and my sister had experienced it firsthand all of us were anxious and stressed about her as well right so that also includes caregivers parents particularly new parents there is an article to say that you know the rates of anxiety and depression in postpartum new mothers have spiked during the circuit breaker and during kobe 19 right because partly maybe because it is more challenging to to bring in new foreign domestic helpers these days and because of uh kovit uh circuit breaker maybe the the help afforded by grandparents and other family members could be limited because they're not allowed to really come over the whole day it's right now it's limited to two a day right and the elderly elderly because uh an ugly who is suffering from dementia for example of where physical needs um when the senior activity centers the dementia day care centers close down their routines are disrupted and they have to get used to a whole new routine with their caregiving needs not being met perhaps also it's very stressful for them special needs population we met three days ago that the the minesville center is an adult uh disability home which uh houses uh above 100 more than 100 uh adults with uh intellectual disability right and they had an outbreak of kovit-19 over there so these special needs populations whether they are children or adults they really have other needs that the rest of us may not recognize right for example people with autism they they really need to stick to a very uh uh rigid schedule every day they are very used to doing the same thing in the morning afternoon at night at night at 2 00 pm they have to do something maybe they have to watch a tv program and they can't deviate from them from if if they are going for a walk in the garden you know every evening and every morning they really expect that and when it doesn't happen um they are in their routines get thrown out of whack they they may throw through tantrum they may act out in other ways or there may be other behavioral psychological problems which emerge so you can imagine how the kobe 19 and circuit breaker can can affect their lives get those of us with uh pre-existing physical and mental health conditions no other operations in the poly clinics and hospitals are also disrupted right routine care may be compromised when kobe 19 cases search right and icu's have to made room for copenhagen cases so we don't one still want to take care of our physical and mental health conditions especially if they are already pre-existing before the pandemic those of us who are staying alone have a different problem to contend with and of course with the economic recession because due to pandemic disadvantaged families are struggling with poverty already limited resources they will be even more economically stressed so some local articles elderly being hit by social isolation i mean uh circuit breaker measures this was in april last year right so new mothers are facing higher levels of postnatal anxiety during kobe 19 right feeling isolated and missing family because they are not able to get the practical help that they need a disadvantaged family is scraping by in a tougher spot because of the economic stresses okay and it's really all of us right if you look through the list all of us are falling too i talked about those living alone those living with too many people those with caregiving duties and all it's really all of us so covet 19 has really taken a toll on people's mental health um over the past two years and we don't know when this will end right we are constantly worried about the risk of infection not just for ourselves but for our families and it's not just the infection right when we get we don't want to be the black sheep of society right there's a there's a stigma attached to being exposed to kobe 19 or to even contract kobe 19 right maybe the public may perceive that those who get kobe 19 maybe you know they engaged in some sort of irresponsible behavior didn't follow the rules and when our names or when our details and particulars get in the me appear in the media it's it's really a stressful experience right now on social media uh those who are exposed or those who are behaved if responsibly in public intentionally or otherwise or may be maybe then condemned by the public so social distancing measures can lead to a risk of social isolation they are very different right social distancing we call it safe distancing measures right or safe safe measurement safe man management measures right okay but they run the risk of increasing the rates of social isolation amount among the public containment measures can lead to disruptions now personalized we all remember the days where and to see when our stock of tissue paper toilet paper right because everyone is talking because of our stress and kyasu so in terms of all these uh uncertainties extraordinary times um constant changes to work processes right and the economic recession all this will cause stress in all of us right but the stress is always bad right so stress is only bad when it is excessive in fact there is a term there's a significant term for for good stress and it is called eustress e-u-s-t-r-e-s-s right huge stress is good stress which spurs us into action spurs us into taking action taking steps to solve problems in our lives good stress helps us to perform well in our work in our roles whether it's as an employee as a business owner as parents as caregivers but without stress you can imagine that we'll be all in this part of the graph we'll be all be bored disengaged with life or there'll be no challenge so we we want to strive to be in in the green yellow and sometimes in a purple zone where there is optimum performance across this uh three colored zones comfort stretch and strain right but when we are strained too much when stress becomes excessive it results in fatigue poor judgment and over the long term it can lead to a crisis right when we are exhausted when we start to develop mental health problems when we suffer from burnout so it helps to consciously observe the levels of stress that we are in and kind of like moderate did like if we are in the red zone try to nudge ourselves back to the purple zone or the yellow zone and if we find ourselves in a blue zone for whatever reason maybe we are completely giving up already right and we refuse to acknowledge that maybe even not stressful like there's no challenge in our lives right then we want to take out more challenge and more hobbies more responsibilities even right to nudge ourselves to the to the green and yellow zones right so that's where good stress is at work and we want to avoid the effects of that stress so this applies to our work performance and also to our roles as as parents as friends you know in every role that we play in our lives okay so a bit about work related or occupational related uh burnout ordering if we are working from home or uh during copying activities state of emotional physical mental exhaustion due to poorly managed and prolonged excessive stress states we may be unable to meet our work and life life's demands any longer and we may disengage feel empathy apathetic feel like a failure okay and the complications of burnout which really just means chronic stress right stress is not not being managed properly professionally uh we will have a lower job satisfaction productivity will get affected um in the world organization there'll be increased rates of errors reduce staff morale higher emc and turnover rates right on the personal front um perhaps more importantly right higher rates of family discord divorce substance addictions whether it's a smoking alcohol addiction even caffeine addiction right people who drink 10 cups of coffee just to stay awake at work or just to keep on track and stay focused increase rates of anxiety and depression increase rtas is road traffic accidents you know um stress can lead to possibly higher rates of blood traffic accidents and physical impact on our physical health chronic stress and burnout when not managed properly and when it's lasting for years and leading to anxiety disorders can really affect our physical health it increases the rates of obesity or diabetes can cause high blood pressure over decades poorly managed stress can also increase the odds of having cancer right because there is an impact on our immune system and our immune system helps to keep infections at bay but also cancer cells help to kill off any early cancer cells that may may arise just spontaneously naturally in our systems um also psychological stress burnout can really affect our physical health and also reduce our life expectancy right there are studies that are um well known for showing that life expectancy can reduce you know when we sleep less than seven hours a day for example but this is over decades okay so the first step to address burnout is to recognize it uh some warning signs as i mentioned you may feel empathetic like you don't care anymore um you may feel irritable in frustration not simply just feeling depressed or sad right some of us manifest that sadness in by way of anger right frustration taking out out on other people we may withdraw socially from friends and family they may feel physically or exhausted tired all the time right so so so the top four points are more like sub threshold depressive symptoms assuming they don't quite reach the point of having clinical depression yet but it's like on the way there so if you recognize all this in us and they're lasting for more than two to three weeks do re-evaluate and practice more effective stress management right okay going down is excessive worries catastrophizing thinking the worst of every situation right feeling constantly nervous maybe insomnia planning symptoms physical sensations that are manifestation of stress or like chest tightness palpitations hyperventilating right breathing too fast or having a sensation that we can't breathe our patients who vomit when they are stressed or when they are anxious they feel that they are trembling and they are their palms and their skin are all sweaty right um some of us may have nightmares about work especially if we have made some mistake at work right or if we if we have an abusive kind of superiors right so do recognize all these symptoms and try to monitor and observe if you're having any one of this okay so simply put healthy versus unhealthy coping some of this is really a rehash of what we've talked about but it's the basic things remember to eat well drink when you're thirsty [Music] sleep well exercise connect with others taking your paws and mindfulness okay so really not just reacting to any situation that you come across some a lot of us lead our lives especially when you are stressed quite mindlessly and what i mean is that we are just responding to stimulus when there's a no we're just following the signs on the say on the traffic lights or um responding to cues in our environment when my wife shots at me i shot at her back right when my kids disturb me at work i i push him away right when my colleague is uh unreasonable i reply with a good email it's like i'm just reacting right there's no there's no self-agency agency that's quite mindless but what will help if i take a pause and reevaluate and try to respond to the situation rather than react so that's the difference between responding and reacting right reacting is like you you're not it's not going through your mind at all or you're just reacting responding means actually you're actually taking a step back observing the situation um analyzing the situation and regardless of how you're feeling whatever negative emotions you're having but consider your options and then responding with a more mindful more strategic kind of uh action which will help everybody for example instead of replying with a root email i may then text a colleague who was was rude and unreasonable with a message of concern how are you how have you been i noticed that you have been feeling stressed right so because the opportunity to build a relationship with a colleague rather than replying a broad email right okay so relaxation techniques like what energy brought us through just now um a bit of a progressive muscle relaxation deep breathing techniques um inculcating these relaxation techniques in our daily lives will definitely help to reduce our stress levels journaling and reflection has also been scientifically proven how to reduce burnout and manage stress effectively right the ones that we should avoid so i've talked about alcohol smoking excessive caffeine right binge eating excessive shopping right displacing anger to less threatening targets for example if my boss scolds me at work i may come home and take it out on my wife and my kids right i mean scold them but because then they become the victim of my my work stress right the problem is with the boss and my work stress but then it becomes a family strain because i'm displacing my anger to less threatening targets which my family members right so that's something we want to avoid but actually all of us do engage in these unhealthy behaviors from time to time right is to catch ourselves at that moment and then try to analyze it and remind ourselves not to do it again right impatience and aggression avoidance and escape right things to avoid unhealthy coping versus the healthy coping right okay so that's that's all about caring for yourself and managing stress effectively it's now i'm gonna talk about something more like psychological and uh philosophical about cultivating gratitude and how evolution actually sets us up for for having a lot of negative emotions in our lives so my psychologist will call this uh our caveman mentality all of us evolved around over millions of years right from reptiles and fishes and mammals right okay we are we are still mammals right how about the human race homo sapiens uh is actually human race has only existed in on planet earth for the past 200 000 years if i'm not wrong so that in that 200 000 years when we evolved from cavemen and hunter gatherers hunting for food planting crops and all what our ancestors what kind of genes they passed down right are the genes that allow us to do the following to worry non-stop about the future to remember bad things that happen to us to anticipate uh new things that can go wrong so if you look at this uh our dna our genes are really setting us up to worry to remember all the bad things we are always living in the future where we worry and plan right we are also living in the past in the form of resentment grievances bearing grudges unable to let go of that traumatic memory which we experience in our childhoods right so we are always living in the future and our past and we are hardly living in the present okay and that is really the natural state of the human mind and it's something that is no longer helpful for us in in the modern in the modern world right because these skills help us to survive the wow they help us to remember that there is a there is a tiger uh on this road of the forest right and to avoid that path or that is remembering the bad things that happen because we will attack once or to plan about the future whether there's enough food for the family uh in the next winter whether there is uh uh whether how to prepare for weather right better to gather all the resources but in modern life modern day living we no longer have to not worry about all these day-to-day survival we are all equipped especially in singapore right but the problem is with happiness so all these skills help us with our survival but not with happiness so what we really have to do is to try to get out of this mode now it's almost like working against your jeans which is not easy to do but uh barbara fredrickson who is a canadian psychologist will say that the negative screams at you but the positive only whispers at you so what we want is to try to tone uh tune down the negative screens and to tune up the positive whispers and that is where cultivating gratitude uh in various ways life can can help us with that for example we can start a gratitude journal where we can write on it maybe once a week um maybe once a day or maybe even once a month when you set aside one day a week or one day a month to write down what you are grateful about for that week or that month so the science of it uh scientific evidence or research has shown that writing one gratitude letter can promote resilience for six weeks and being constantly uh you know grateful for things in life uh behaving behaving in that way like you know can promote resilience for six months so the gratitude letter can be to anything it can be to a person it can be to something that happened it can be to even a stranger right but there is more impact if you actually let the person in question know that you are grateful and you are thinking about you know that that grateful event okay the other way is to write down uh just simply three good things like about the day before you go to sleep there there's something that my department practices every week by hrd will get us to write down some good things that happen about the week and email him then he'll just compile and send it to everyone so middle managers if you are a supervisor or manager you can also you can also introduce this workflow or this habit into your team right it promotes a team bonding and it also helps to inculcate gratitude in your employees because good memories are like teflon teflon is the substance in a non-stick pan right they just slip away and that membranes are like velcro they stick to you forever so this is about retraining our brains to remember the good things rather than the bad things in life living in the present right rather than worrying about the future and resenting the past right so this is not just uh uh ati fatty kind of thing but there's solid scientific evidence packing up all these practices right okay the last one is about getting good sleep i am particularly interested in this because i run the sleep clinic right i have a special interest in insomnia so let's let's see what we have okay first we'll start off two processes which regulate our sleep rhythms um firstly it's a sleep drive and secondly is the body clock okay um so sleep drive simply means that uh the more the longer we stay awake the more sleepy we feel uh we that's our experience right it's consistent um also it's the top part of the graph the longer we stay awake assuming we wake up at this point right away so we only feel sleep we feel sleepy in mid daylight the most right and then we may take a nap or if we can okay okay right so so the part where the arrow is longest that that's where sleep drive is the strongest and we fall asleep at night okay the other part is the circadian rhythm or the body clock right it is governed by um glands in the brain which produces melatonin when uh when there is no sunlight or in times of darkness so when the sun sets and the moon comes out melatonin increases in our brains right and then we feel sleepy right so so you can imagine for night shift workers actually these two rhythms these two processes are in conflict they may feel a very heavy sleep drive in the morning because they just finished a night shift but their circadian rhythms are their body clock is asking them to stay awake because the sun has been up and their melatonin is not being secreted okay but for most of us who work in the day the two rhythms these two processes are synchronized okay so insomnia is very common in singapore uh 15 suffer from insomnia at any one time right and 30 of us will have some form of severe insomnia at some point in our lives singaporeans sleep on average six and a half hours which is short of the recommended seven hours or that's the international recommendation singapore is consistently voted or surveyed to be the second most deprived country in the past few years now right japan is the mostly deprived country but if you rank it in terms of cities if you consider singapore as a city then actually new york new yorkers and londoners have less sleep than singaporeans okay right so kobe 19 and sleep when there's more anxiety about the pandemic when there's more worries more stress because of job insecurity or child giving caregiving duties working from home naturally we can't sleep as well and when we are asked to work from home our routines are disrupted we are indoors all day we don't get sunlight right when we don't get the sunlight in the day our body clocks are not as strong it's not as entrenched right so the for example we are always in duster maybe melatonin gets secreted in the brain even at midday so there is not enough stores on medicine to get a search on melatonin at night and then you can't really sleep at night your sleep will be disrupted so what you need to do is to go go out to the sun or uh in the day right may not be midday right when the sun is at its highest but we'll talk about it later right okay so when we are not commuting uh to work not driving as much not taking public transport uh not walking as much or this reduction in physical activity also reduces our sleep drive we are just naturally we're just less tired when it's time to go to bed uh some of us even worse right we work in bed as a student i used to study in bid you know i studied for my old levels and a-levels in bed so i i had surveyed insomnia i never knew about all these concepts right it's a long long hour spent in paid especially for work classically conditions our brain to associate the bid with work stress so it's not just a home we are not just associating the home without stress we are literally associating associating the bit with the stress that we have at meetings and unpleasant uh emails and you know an office debate is because our office right so that is a sure recipe for insomnia right because every time we hit a bit our brain will think that we are going to work okay some of us may engage in over

stimulating right okay so just these five tips and some details about each of them um demarcating work and home [Music] areas and hours and psychologically managing relationships with family co-workers the elderly parents or the young kids for home-based learning right and your friends taking care of yourself is more reminder because all of us know this it's just that we forget all these things from time to time essentially paying attention to your thoughts your feelings and your physical and emotional needs cultivating gratitude something that um you may not buy it but if you start doing you will realize what good it can do for you okay and sleeping well or doing working from home circuit breaker so when to seek help if you find yourself constantly stressed uh anxious having panic symptoms like no chest pains uh hyperventilating for no reason especially if you are not if you don't have a risk of a heart heart disease right a lot of these panic symptoms can mimic a heart attack right if you're having these symptoms constantly for more than two to three weeks and your sleep and appetite are significantly affected you may be gaining a lot of weight because you are using uh binge eating as a coping mechanism or you may be losing weight because your appetite may be affected and you're missing meals all day right so whatever mode changes or anxiety which are affecting your family life and block performance significantly right it may be some warning signs and some indications that may be worthwhile to seek help okay um feelings that life is not worth living and um even worse suicidal thoughts right our thoughts that about ending our lives right so where and how to seek help um it's up to you well most of us probably go for the last option first right talk to friends talk to family talk to our religious group leaders huh this is also what my most of my patients do before they come to see us in the hospital or in the clinics so which is okay uh sometimes uh family and friends and religious leaders can offer the support that you need and some this uh depression anxiety kind of symptoms just go away after you learn to take good care of yourself for a while well that's that's okay then you don't really have to sit with professional help but what if it doesn't work do talk to your counselor and social worker at every family service center every neighborhood in singapore has a family service center and they provide free counseling services most of them right you can also approach your family doctor downstairs for a chat and if you want to seek professional mental health services from the hospitals you can also subsidize rates you can seek a polyclinic referral otherwise you can just call into any major hospital in singapore and book an appointment to see a psychologist or psychiatrist right and the government has also come up with all these helplines right there is a national care hotline uh for the worried well they call it rent for those of us who are worried stressed anxious about kobe 19 stress about working from home circuit breaker and some community partners uh these uh agencies they they offer counseling psychological support of um which are free or at very low charges okay uh there are very specific ones right some more general about mental health being a mental well-being okay some about marital and parenting issues then there's the ones always who specialize in family violence or family abuse okay so um some specialize in counseling huh and of course brown center is one of them right specializes i think in mindfulness causes and all so my patients have some of my patients have gone for the mindfulness courses at brown center and they tell me it's very very good okay this is my last slide okay i welcome any questions uh angie back to you thank you so much dr tay for the excellent presentation and the comprehensiveness of what you have offered so uh some of the questions have already come in so would you like me to read them to you would you just like to read them yourself uh they're in the q a box at the bottom of the screen okay let me see whether i can access them who an a-box is it yes do you see q a the first question yes yes yes is from mr chua so i think it might be easier for you to read it so mr trump asked uh what are some of the key neuroses that an individual needs to be aware of given this restricted work schedule now okay okay so um the term numerator the term neurosis uh refers to uh if i can put it in a layman's way it's just stress law or stress stress related conditions which are not really um um it's not like serious or major mental health problems like schizophrenia or psychosis but it's really things that we struggle from day to day so the common disorders that i see that are increasing because of kobe 19 and working from home are mainly four types of neuroses like if you can put it that way or there's a yeah more prone to anxiety disorders or if we are always worrying about kobe 19 and um it reminds me that of ocd sufferers obsessive compulsive disorder ocd sufferers they may have a obsession with cleanliness or with hygiene or very very irrational fear of contamination sometimes the safe management measures like hand washing and all uh really they run the risk of having their ocd getting worse because they are all the more dead paranoid now or with kobe 19. um there is also increased rates of depression adjustment disorders and insomnia these are the consequences on a national level and individual level if stress is not managed well okay so do try to adhere to the three the five tips that i i laid out then maybe you can we can uh prevent this from happening okay uh miss neo uh is new asked about how do you think we can demarcate the boundaries if the boss likes to use whatsapp chats for work discussions which make it hard to break away from work okay very good question very practical okay um so what i presented is the ideal you know it's the is the ideal uh situation for ideal uh outcome right but sometimes uh we are also limited by the realities right if our company or our boss or the nature of our work requires us to somehow not keep to any regular work hours if our boss is someone who don't really know uh uh follow work hours i mean some bosses may hold meetings like ungodly hours or texts uh important work messages at 2 3 ami so if your boss does that i i don't really expect him i don't think he expects you to reply straight away i don't think he expects all of you to respond immediately and go and check your emails it's probably acceptable to reply the next day uh in the morning huh um so maybe if if that's the case uh maybe it is even wiser to put your headphone away or leave it out of the bedroom so that your boss when he when you know when you check the one set at least the tick is not a red line if it's double take blue and it's like red right then you better act on it but if you are not even checking it because because you're asleep or resting because you're spending quality friendly time it's probably okay to reply the next day like i think your boss will understand if your boss really expects you to to reply then i guess there's no choice but you have to find other way to work it or walk around and still manage stress and still kind of enjoy your work uh not break down mentally and still have a good quality of life okay so practically if you i if i if my hunch is right and your boss don't expect you to reply immediately then put your hand phone away for the night reply the next day if your boss sees that you are not reading the messages you will assume that you are asleep and that's okay okay okay mr trump asked what are the most effective coping mechanisms without without without much effort huh okay okay yeah it's back to basics now it's it's it's not rocket sciences it's the tip number two and three that i talked about managing your relationships in your life and taking good care of yourself think taking good care of yourself is all that more important because you have to take good care of yourself first before you take good care of others and that's how you then preserve maintain good relationships with family friends and co-workers right and avoiding things that things to avoid are just as important as things to adhere to right so we talked about advices right um smoking drinking gambling for some of us um excesses uh binge eating indulging in video games and uh escape like binge watching videos the whole day huh um all of us probably do that from time to time now which is okay but just that just just be careful that we are not using it as the main coping mechanism for all sorts of stressful situations okay so angela asked about how to deal with seniors who are depressed okay okay very good question um okay yeah seniors have a unique set of challenges to contend with right whether it's uh in the era of kobe 19 or not um they most of them if they are retired um they may be contending with a lot of loneliness at home so i see that in a lot of my elderly patients loneliness seems to be the the main problem you can call it depression some of them may or may not qualify to have clinical depression they may or may not need antidepressant medications but all of them will benefit from alleviation of their loneliness that can come in many ways right uh kids and family and siblings and try to spend quality time with them visit them when you know when circuit breaker is over or bring them out in masks uh to parks and gardens outdoor spaces however the risk of infection transmission or copper 19 is not that high um some of them really benefit from going to the senior activity center or the day centers where they naturally will make friends play mahjong listen to music sing karaoke and provides them with a natural circle of friends uh when when family has to be at work long right so but if uh the senior the elderly person is depressed to the extent that they are losing a lot of weight not eating well um some of them start to hurt themselves like they hit themselves or they they say things that you know um sun for me is uh what boosts your life is not worth living right it's really quite meaningless and you'll see that yeah it's really quite severe then those bring them to sick treatment with either the the family doctor downstairs or the or or one of us in the hospitals every major hospital in singapore has a psychiatrist and psychology department which has expertise to treat uh elderly depression okay but the first tip will probably be to look into how to reduce their loneliness spend more quality time with them and try to apply for the senior activity center nearby right okay the okay okay right so uh anonymous attendee says that writing in a journal introspection reflection i've taken to be healthy like coping i've been trying to do this i feel good panning down my thoughts how can i avoid a downward spiral of emotions okay sometimes i reflect too bad too deeply and i cry and feel sad afterwards okay okay and uh actually made me withdraw from others okay okay right so so the sadness and carefulness that you have after journaling um they may be i i don't see them as necessarily bad or unhealthy lah i think they are good ways to have some catharsis or to process your emotions um at least you are realizing that you are sad and unhappy and you probably after reflection uh will be aware of the reasons so the problem solving mode may be not to gwen resolve those problems right whatever problems or reasons that is causing you to be sad at night but the crying and the sadness in itself is is probably more good than that i feel um of course if you are having really severe suicidal thoughts do seek professional help withdrawing from others for some time is also okay um but try to make sure beware that it's not going to be your main mode of coping or this social withdrawal is probably good to re-establish your relationships and touch base with other people who truly care for you so it could be your family or your friends or your you know or your siblings or your colleagues could be anyone or sometimes it's sometimes we find it more easier to talk to people whom we are not so close with or so maybe a stranger on some i don't know but it comes with its own risk right stranger on some online chat groups okay um or calling the sos helpline where is essentially a professional but a stranger talking to you right so you can call the helpline switch i i i flashed out in my last screen just now um if if you find that it's easier to talk to strangers than to loved ones or otherwise think about who you think really you can trust and is truly concerned and reach out to the person um you can see talking to the person as a verbal way of journaling and introspection especially if the person is truly concerned and especially if the person is hopefully someone who doesn't pass harsh judgments readily someone who is good at listening someone who doesn't like to talk so much or and pass judgment so easily okay the next question is when i wake up at 7 00 am i am never sleepy until 2 a.m can i take melatonin tablets okay yes you can you can take melatonin tablets is the short answer melatonin is a natural supplement that is produced naturally in our brains it is so over the counter at guardian pharmacy unity right um watson so it comes in 2 mg formulation and it is really gives giving you that boost of sleepiness so melatonin can help with bringing forward your sleepiness or um to an earlier part of the night well if that's what you really need to do um but i wouldn't focus so much on the insomnia as i would uh your daytime functioning if you are functioning well in tip-top condition doing your work well um caring for your family and the house hold well from 7am to 2am and then you sleep for 5 hours and somehow you are still coping well in the day i think the daytime function is more important than just looking at a number of hours to sleep at night so it's also the quality of your sleep not just the quantity of your sleep okay but 2 a.m to 7 00 am five hours is a bit too short now i would like most of us to achieve at least at least six and a half hours also that at least we are on par with the average singaporean okay having said that it's not every day that i expect to sleep six and a half hours they are nice that i sleep four hours then i make up the next day then i may sleep eight hours the next day so there may be good nights and bad nights which is which is actually okay as long as the as long as you are still functioning well of course the idea is to keep to a consistent sleep and weight schedule and wake up at the same day every day go to bed at the same time every day that's the ideal huh but sometimes the ideal is aspirational most of us struggling from day to day stressors we expect good nights and and bad nights okay [Music] okay so what i have another practical advice to help you feel sleepy at the right time is to engage in a pre-bid time routine so my state psychologist will advise his patients to engage in a 30 hour sleep routine before big time for example you can mark up 30 minutes before you go to bed and in that 30 minutes what you should do is to do some relaxation activities in the same sequence in the same order every night without fail these 30 minutes of a routine will prepare your mind and your body to fall asleep so some suggested activities could include some light yoga stretching having a warm glass of milk um um having a light snack not listening to uh relaxing music or some light reading okay avoid those horror stories uh adventure adventure thriller kind of stories now that will just stimulate you and then you cannot force it after that okay so 30 minutes without fail every night to prepare your brain and your body to fall asleep if we are spending one third of our lives in bed or in our sleep it is definitely worthwhile to spend 30 minutes to prepare for it okay um jocelyn asked whether i would recommend to people with physical whose physical environment were not allowed for demarcation okay okay well very very real problem right in this age of shrinking living spaces and some of my my brother-in-law bought a like a loft unit it's a two-bedroom living space right so some of us are yeah we are just confined right uh property prices are so high okay big room is also the study huh okay okay so so at least you can de-market the bedroom um make sure you are always working and studying at the same place of the bedroom um maybe don't study in bed or work in bed don't lie down or sit in bed long you can if you can you can work i mean you know um there are those uh table tops where you can put on the floor and then you can sit on the floor and work next to your bed if you're ready if um living space is really a constraint but even within the bedroom i think you can do some demarcation designate work areas and sleep areas in your bedroom so at least there's a psychological demarcation um then if you can't really do the geographical or the spatial demarcation of the boundary as well then you probably have to rely more on psychological boundary or temporal demarcation also being very very disturbed in my work hours and doing some routines before and after work like changing into formal workloads going for walks before and after work going for a bath before and after work to psychologically psychologically transition from your work identity to your home identity so maybe even if you have to stay in the bedroom all the time at least you have that two other ways to do the market and that's going to help work from home okay another attendee asked how do i as a family member better support my loved ones what's unexpected uh experiencing burnout okay so the the first step is to at least be patient and kind to them right don't displace your stress onto them right that's the first step but how to support them huh okay i i i don't know how to answer this apart from um you can ask and listen us show concern by asking and then just listen to what they have to say and if they are not willing to share much then then say that it's okay long that you are there for them and that um talk to you when they are ready yeah that's that's probably what i would suggest now um don't don't don't have to force them to say and talk when they are not ready to or maybe there's not much luck maybe they'll get better by themselves but but just offer reassure them that you are there for them and um uh offer your presence and your attention when they are ready to talk so in shock be kind and patient and then ask them and then listen to them listening to them is is more is more helpful than giving them advice just listening the listening ear is very therapeutic okay thank you um mr chan or mr so uh for your encouragement and compliments okay someone asked about alcohol refrain from alcohol how about drinking uh bernadette dom 40 alcohol that's quite high daily before sleep okay okay right so the experts actually found that you know drinking a bit of red wine every day used to be used to be good for your heart and all right okay but the evidence is someone makes after that the scientists cannot really agree rather that alcohol even in small quantities poses any benefits more than harm as a psychiatrist i would say to if you can just avoid alcohol completely alcohol is a central nervous system depressant so in the short term alcohol helps you to sleep that is true okay however in the long term alcohol disrupts sleep for sure when alcohol may help you to fall asleep but alcohol disrupts the quality of sleep so the stage one stage two up to rem sleep right that that one goes haywire with alcohol so even though you are asleep because you drank alcohol you may wake up feeling even more awful you may wake up with a hangover even if you don't the brain studies right when they attach the brain electrodes to study the brain waves when people sleep with alcohol the sleep stages are all over the place the sleep is not as consolidated and in the long term it definitely um causes more harm than good luck i feel so what i can suggest is maybe you maybe if you have to rely on alcohol to sleep um in the short term for a few days it's probably okay but for more than a few days is is probably not good you have to rely on your lifestyle like like the getting more sunlight exercise uh having a consistent schedule and having a pre-date time 30 minutes pre-bid time routine all these things to help you to speak better without using alcohol okay so if you have to use alcohol to sleep use it in small amounts and once in a while it's probably okay but not not not consistently okay so brian asked what i recommended advice to the company to help employee okay so so that's good so that relates to our first question just now about the the boss who expects a 24 7 uh attention and responses on whatsapp right so part of our job as healthcare professionals is probably also to educate employees sorry sorry educate employers and companies so educate the managers and the bosses right um they probably they have to play their part for us to uh to have a good good quality of life uh while we are working from home so if i were to give advice to the company or the employer or the boss it is to help your employees achieve that five tips that i i laid out and to um check in on them once in a while or ask also ask and listen respect their work hours long maybe after 6 pm um you know even if you message them uh don't expect them to reply straight away long depending on the nature of the world of course some of our jobs require immediate attention um okay so good bosses are interestingly is the crux of having a good work life right often our the how how how satisfied we are with our work relates directly with how our bosses are how well our bosses treat us this is more important than the values of the company and the mission and vision of the company right so bosses out there do take care of your employees take care of your team everyone is more stressed uh during this period okay to be fair a lot of employees thrive on work from home or it gives them more family time more flexible all of us will save one hour of travelling time when we do have to travel to town to the office right and with that one hour we can get more sleep with that one hour we can prepare a good breakfast we can prepare a good lunch we can spend more time playing with our kids taking care of our parents spending quality family time with the additional hours safe from commuting so most of us may like to work from home some of us may thrive on it and we will miss it when it ends but there is there is that maybe 30 40 of us who really struggle to work from home and bosses if you can uh try to identify these people and pay special attention to them right um okay ng is it okay if i carry on how about uh take the last question and yes uh more questions are likely to come in if you don't end yes i think you're giving very good uh tips and also uh suggestions so i think a lot of people are benefiting from from them thank you so perhaps you choose the last question okay right um okay can i can i some of the questions are quite long so i i will just skip to the last one uh elin asked me whether what can i do if i lie in bed struggling to fall asleep any immediate remedies right so elin this is a very common problem for patients who come to visit me in my sleep clinic this is the initial stages of insomnia um hopefully short-term insomnia but if it lasts for more than three months it becomes a chronic insomnia and it kind of takes on a life of its own insomnia is very interesting sleep is something that is we can wish for but we cannot be forced upon so psychologically if we are struggling with insomnia we have to realize it we have to realize that that the more we lie in bit and toss and turn and force ourselves to fall asleep the more we are not going to get it okay uh paradoxically the less you try to fall asleep the more easily you may fall asleep huh so what you need to do is to spend less time in bed or spend if if you are struggling with insomnia right spend less time in bed if you can't fall asleep at night uh wake up don't die in bed okay get up um do something in the living room reading listening to music um having a light snack doing some stretching or going for a bath doing some relaxation activities preferably not not vigorous exercise preferably not work but doing some relax relaxing activities to calm your mind and then when you are finally tired and sleepy then go back to bed and try to fall asleep again but don't try too hard okay so i'm like contradicting myself right okay so um because the more the harder you try the more it will be that you struggle to fall asleep uh okay so so if you can't sleep and you're feeling stressed and anxious about sleep don't lie in bed all that is again classical conditioning where you are associating the bit with stress and wakefulness and the anxiety of not falling asleep so we don't want that you want to start to retrain your brain to associate the bit with peace and calm tranquility and and pleasantness and sleep huh um so it's not going to work in uh a few days you have to be persist and try this for one to two weeks then gradually your mind will learn to fall asleep again by itself or without you trying too hard of course if you last for three to four months and you really is struggling and you are struggling to stay awake in the day then uh do visit your family doctor too maybe you know get some very small sleeping tablets for a few days to kick start the process or it may be may it may make a difference so talk to your family doctor if you find that you have to okay thank you yes there are many people who have sleep challenges uh i may like to suggest that you try using the body scan practice and you can obtain uh free audio tracks to be guided they're on our website as well as on the bram center youtube page we also have a course that's called mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia that's starting in june now what happens a lot of people who have difficulty sleeping is because the moment they look at their bed uh their adrenaline is pumping so check to see whether your heart is beating faster your muscles are tensing up because many of you've had struggles going to sleep so when you look at the bed it already gives you this sense of heightened fear and this then causes your adrenaline to be pumped which is the last thing you want right because with more adrenaline means your your mind is going to be wide awake and then the more you struggle the more adrenaline and stress hormones are going to be excreted and that just perpetuates the problem so body scan practice may help because it actually relaxes your nervous system which is the parasympathetic system kicking in and therefore your stress hormones will now no longer be excreted in the amounts that are actually causing you to stay awake so dr t would you like to add to that did my help yes yes so angie's advice is uh yeah it's it's really good it's exactly what i will share with my patient in my clinic so you need to try that yeah and a lot of times like dr tay was mentioning about spending quality time actually a lot of people don't understand what it means by quality time right because you may be spending time but you get on each other's nerves uh you agitate each other you get annoyed so quality time is learning how to make peace with whatever arises so if someone like our mother or father we're taking out and then they have their usual uh nag or they say things that usually provoke us is to let that go and just don't react because if not that time is no longer quality time because you start to get on each other's nerves so quality time is just to be present and let them say whatever they want to say you know you've heard it a hundred times just hear it one more time and this time don't process it in the mind and then you have better quality time by just being present listen accept and let go so with that once again thank you so much dr tay for your very enthusiastic sharing and also all the questions you have taken and i'm just going to very quickly put up the slide here if any one of you oops i'm sorry i think it didn't work properly there yes if any one of you is feeling distressed uh we do have an assist line which you can also contact us after office hours uh because somehow more people feel down at night so uh just whatsapp us or uh call us okay and uh do go to our website and access our program next week we are going to have uh dr ho yuchin who is the senior consultant from tan tok singh and he's going to be talking about headaches and dizziness so headache is also one of the symptoms of stress but it also may be due to vertigo which is uh the imbalance in our ear or maybe something else like dehydration so whatever that may be he is going to be a great uh doctor for you to consult online and i'd like to bring to your attention our asia pacific mindfulness conference that comprises of 50 webinars 26 workshops are available for you to register there's going to be just full of fabulous speakers and i hope dr tay you're registered not yet i'm going to ng going to okay and so you can just go to our website and get more information so with that thank you once again and wishing everybody a very good weekend ahead bye bye everybody thank you ng bye bye everybody thank you you too

f2-sVY2fJPY,NGO CSW65 Virtual Forum,UCft9YZin7gnlAQ5LywPEEJg,Kilak Design Studio,2021-03-26T00:42:49Z,,hello everyone very warm welcome to all and a big thank you all for joining us today okay at our this ngo csw 65 virtual forums parallel event where we will be discussing about women's empowerment as well as mental health advocacy and promotion for women during the covet 19 pandemic okay just a short introduction my name is yantang or you can address me by my initials yd i am from silver urban singapore a non-profit organization that focuses on mental health advocacy and i will be the moderator for today's parallel event so before we begin i would just like to gently remind everyone to keep our mics on mute during the presentations so as to minimize disruptions we will definitely have time for q a after all the speakers have presented okay so save all your questions for the speakers until that segment so for today's parallel event we are so happy to have four esteemed speakers in order of presentation okay we have dr dr ingrid the president of the world federation for mental health professor gabriel president of the world dignity project ms claudia deputy ceo of the global mental health peer network as well as miss porsche executive director of silver ribbon singapore they will be sharing more about their organization as well as the initiatives and strategies implemented to promote mental health especially for women during this pandemic so without further ado let us invite the very first speaker dr ingrid dr great please good day ladies and gentlemen i hope you can hear me um it's a real honor for me to be here today and be sharing this panel with the various teen presenters and i'm president of the world federation for mental health as i was introduced and i really just want to say it's a wonderful opportunity for us to be here and to be able to share a little bit about the world federation for mental health before i launch into our view on the specific and very important subject on women's empowerment and mental health advocacy and promotion for women particularly during this very difficult time that the world faces so the world federation for mental health is an international membership organization founded in 1948 to advance among all peoples and nations the prevention of mental and emotional disorders the proper treatment and care of those with such disorders and the promotion of mental health our mission is a very clear one and our mission is to promote the advancement of mental health awareness prevention of mental disorders advocacy and best practice recovery focused interventions worldwide and in relation to today's um focus specifically we are looking at women and the challenges that women face during this time so the women's section of the world federation for mental health states very clearly that women face different types of difficulties from birth until adulthood in other words across the lifespan which increases their vulnerability to mental health problems in developing countries this primarily includes but not limited to a wide range of discriminatory practices as well women also face economic social um sorry low economic and social independence in most other stages of their lives with high exposure to domestic abuse poor availability of resources for individuals familial and societal levels to deal with the and deal with the negative finding it difficult to deal with the negative consequences so when we look at specifically women during cove covert 19 pandemic we know that covert 19 global health pandemic has impacted on the mental health of millions of people across all nations and this virus not only impacts on the health outcomes but has a negative symbiotic relationship with mental health which compromises millions affected and infected when we look at the six disaggregated data we know that globally gender disparities along the clinical pathways remain pretty stable however more women are being tested than men and account for slightly more than half of the global confirmed cases of covert 19. however men make up a higher share of reported hospitalization intensive care admissions and deaths globally currently the global data show that for every 10 women with curved 19 who die there are 15 deaths amongst men so mental health effects of covert 19 pandemic on a woman specifically we know that gender is a critical determinant of mental health and meaningful illness gender determinants or determines the differential power and control men and women have over the socio-economic determinants of their mental health and their lives depressive disorders account for 41 41.9 of disability from neuropsychiatric disorders amongst women compared to 29.3 for men leading mental health problems of older adults and these are women are depression organic syndrome and dementias a majority of these are women an estimated 80 percent of 50 million people affected by violence conflict civil wars disasters and displacement of women and children lifetime prevalence rates of violence against women range from 16 to 50 percent according to the world health organization recent research has shown a higher prevalence of symptoms of stress anxiety and depression in female in the female population during the curvat-19 pandemic studies in china and we know that the virus spread from rohan in china have found that female gender is significantly associated with higher self-reported levels of stress anxiety depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms and more severe overall psychological impact of covert 19. women have a higher prevalence of risk factors known to intensify during the pandemic including chronic environmental strain pre-existing depressive and anxiety disorders including exposure to domestic violence cover 19 pandemic has affected more women profoundly than men in several areas both at the workplace and especially for health and social sectors which makes up the majority of women and at home with an increased workload due to lockdown and quarantine measures and we know that worldwide 70 percent of the health force is made up of women who are often front line workers then there's the economic hardship that women face during covert 19 which is greater for women according to the world bank in formal workers most of whom are women account for more than 90 percent of the labor force in sub-saharan africa informal sector jobs are particularly at risk as we know during this very difficult time across the globe during curvat 19 we saw and there's been a lot of discussion and media exposure around the increase in inter-partner violence in many countries affected by pervert 19 records for helplines police force and other service providers increased over this period seeing an increase in domestic violence in particular child maltreatment and intimate partner violence according to the world health organization violence against women is increasing and has increased during the covert 19 pandemic female activists or activists in kenya reported a significant increase of 34 during the first three weeks in south africa alone where i'm based gender-based violence call centers recorded a number of calls which doubled in the first four days in march of last year when we went into lockdown in fact the president in south africa identified gender-based violence during the covert 19 pandemic as the second parallel pandemic which women faced during these months and that we encounter where we encountered um specifically the impact of government 19. we know that woman for women home was not a safe place for many women they were confronted by gender-based violence women often felt trapped and disconnected from safe outlets and support almeida ital 2020 these studies stated that due to isolation guidelines implemented across countries in effect in many places victims of intimate partner violence were deprived of the option to stay with a friend or a family member or go to domestic shelters or even found it difficult to file for protective orders and get the necessary protection required they stated that gender disparities may have accentuated particularly for employed women or single parents as women are disproportionately responsible as we know for the bulk of domestic tasks including child and elder care they added that women who were pregnant postpartum miscarrying or experiencing intimate partner violence were especially at high risk for developing mental health problems during this time the united nations secretary general antonio guterres stated very clearly he said that the perfect pandemic is having a devastating impact on women and girls and the fallout has shown how deeply gender inequalities remain embedded in the world's political social and economic systems so what do we need to do a real call for action around awareness advocacy and interventions and the call to action is we require greater awareness and attention to be drawn to the specific gender link challenges which women face daily during covert 19 as well as postcode with 19. government policies should include violence protection and prevention and responses to the pandemic which has preparedness and response plans to mitigate against this risk almeida stated that social support measures are key to protective and preventive factors to reduce mental health challenges faced by women during this time and these include measures for women at high risk of intimate partner violence such as access to hotlines 24-hour emergency acts which are immediate in terms of getting response and support and protection and regular checkings on these women who find themselves in these difficult situations providing parents support and reducing isolation for women and most of all as well to create social and financial safety networks networks for women and the girl child including those that will protect their livelihoods and most of all that we prioritize the mental health of women so a very sorry a very clear call to action the women's section of the world federation for mental health in their action plan and i'm just extracting three key points is to add the advocacy for the rights of women and protection of vulnerable communities is essential to identify the special needs of migrant and refugee women and prioritize awareness and calls to action against gender-based violence recently the women's section of the world federation hosted a webinar focusing on women's mental health and this focus mark primarily on women as caregivers as well as essential service workers the challenges and supports that they require so in conclusion the united nations policy brief on covert 19 and the need for action on mental health states very clearly that although covert 19 crisis is in the first instance of physical health crisis it has exceeds in major mental health prices as well if action is not taken good mental health is critical for the functioning of our society the united nations secretary general further stated that it is critical that we place women and girls at the center of a current and post pandemic recovery and recruit construction women's equal participation is a game changer and it is the game changer that we need we need to move beyond fixing women to instead fixing our systems pandemic recovery is a chance to chart a path to equal future rights for women in closing kofi annan said when women thrive all of society benefits so let us prioritize the mental health of women and the girl child during these difficult times that we face as a global community and i thank you thank you so much dr ingrid for sharing about the different challenges faced by women during the covet 19 pandemic such as the financial difficulties as well as the different types of violence that they might encounter and i think you know what was really helpful was the data that you have shared as well as the different initiatives and calls to actions you know that is catered to protect women's rights and mental health okay thank you so much for sharing once again dr ingrid now let us invite our second speaker professor gabriel to share with us more about the world dignity project professor gabriel please okay thank you very much for inviting me to be part of this special session i'm very grateful for many reasons i'm very grateful for many reasons you know first of all to be able to share with very powerful women on this forum i am the only man and is glued to be a minority for a change you know so so i want to say thank you for that opportunity i am i am a professor of the president of the world dvd project also we are another heart because i do support the operating for mental health and recurrent security in general so and i want to thank again wfma for that opportunity i have no conflict to display i want to say thank you very much for this forum and especially my good friend posh pool for inviting me and all the people who have supported my work and all these participants because i think the participants made the game maybe allow us to do the best we can do and i want to share from everybody i've worked a long way with many people with service users partners families researchers institutions so i'm going to be taking extracts from some of the things i've learned along the way and i hope that i'll be able to also thank them as we go along what do i intend to cover i want to highlight the need for us to work together to support women's empowerment i agree with ingrid that women are the key to the society they hold the fact that the fabrics you know and really how do we support it and make sure they do they do all the good things they've been doing and support them i also want to look at the impact of kobe 19 on the division of women so especially on that issue because you know i'm looking at it from the perspective and hopefully propose some way forward so let me tell you briefly about the dignity project the dignity project is an ngo currently you know with our office in london the concept for it actually began in new york many years ago and really and it's got three key pillars a public pillar to allow us to engage in the public to ensure that the publics are well at between their challenges and be able to come up to see the things that they know and want to do differently it also has a pillar for professionals because we know that professionals have the key role so for for many people who have mental illness or their families when they grow for professional services sometimes the service they get is not what they expect so they say company for that but you cannot help the public the people who leave the experience and the professional without the policy makers because you need appropriate policies and laws that will make things happen and really so that's after one thing lacking in advocacy that we speak to ourselves we speak to our colleagues we agree but we don't advocate enough for the legal framework and policy that will guide what we do so the world needs project has especially focused on that you know and if to have time i can talk a bit more the good thing about the disney project that we have a very strong proceeds and again it's by craziness 50 50 50 women people say men you know and really so and they come from all walks of life and all continents of the world and they help us to drive our agenda in in and also carry out research you know in the field i'm talking about research we like to hear from the public you know i said because we've got a lot of research talking to the public all over the world so we're bringing their concepts and their thinking into our policies and then we try to use this to engage policymakers citizens uncle so really so that's kind of what we do and what one of the things we'll try to define is what called the dignity taxonomy that what are the key things that promotes dignity and it's about this individual you know how people feeling curtailed and supported about the journey of hope that at the end of the day we need hope so we're everyone at distress and working with societies and this is very critical when we talk about women issue that often that we don't promote enough hope for women and also the family don't value what they do and i hopefully i can cover cover some of that in the next series of talk i said earlier on that women hold the society together i agree with that because i can say for myself without my mom i will not be myself and i will not be here because my father used to work he used to travel around the world you know but my mom was there all the time she was the constant person in the family that had all of us together and she provided the discipline allowed us to do our homework and you know and everything so really so but often we don't show we don't see it you know because it's in in the house because you know sorry let's say i think we need to actually begin to highlight the good work women do and and we need to respect them and the kobe 19 has allowed us to see some of the challenges that they faced you know that we would not be able to talk about so for example one of the work we did in the dignity project was we looked at the psychological impact of kobe 19 by dominican people and then when we found out for what women were telling us in ourselves all over the world very some of them are very distressing you know and then first of all women they were they won't do most of the housework don't encourage me even when their partner's at a home they're the one doing this schoolwork you know because schools have to close you have to become a teacher a mother a teacher it's not it's very difficult to be a teacher anymore at the same time when you need to to provide discipline you don't want you to show love so you have that people felt isolated they were lonely they couldn't be you know they had nowhere to go to so really so this paper actually highlights what the stories and what we've been working on all over the world i want to say something it's not only in europe so it's not only in africa it's only in china it's all over women face the same problem all the time so and often we try to cut you know present them in one small compartment but actually what it showed was it's a global phenomenon women have crossed carry the burden and they carry the suffering more than the rights so really so you know one of the things that struck us and again from our work and in the literature we'll be looking at is that at least one third of women are exposed to gender by a partner of violence during cover with 19 left one third that's very very high number one third you know and i want to say it's not it's this cuts across low high or medium country when you look at homicide one third of women who have survived from home inside of from their partners and then psychological abuse cognition has shown us something that totally we weren't expecting between 20 to 75 percent of women have psychologically abused recovery 19 19 loved them but one thing i was looking at and i mean was we found out that education attainment seemed to be a protective factor for these women so i've just we just contacted bradford university in united kingdom to say is anything they can do to help develop a program that will support women because often particularly women from epi minority they marry very early they stop school so they don't get the certificate they need to group a higher job so bradford investigates pathway that will account that we recognize what women have done you know in terms of you know where they are suffering and their experience and are credited towards a degree program so really i'm looking forward to working with so bradford to promote that i was looking at you know a pre-recent report from the world bank and again the world bank agreed with all of us the paper you know what the thing they just said was the dignity project fund what the wpa found that kobe 19 had a disproportionate suffering on women both financially financially emotionally you know socially celebrities i think you know so the world bank user i i recommend you read this paper you know but i've taken some extra from it you know and they said look why why should we empower women you know so this is one of the key thing that came from it that he said that when you look at kobe 19 you know and that and let's focus on women issue there are what's called social norms that prevent women from doing things you know so for example so social number says you could marry early but really what is saying that we should challenge certain social norms because they do not allow or support women to be to get the best they can ever be access to health that women's health are poorly funded all over the world so it doesn't matter whether it's in africa anyway and that again you know even some women have access to sanitary towers and things that they can need to give them dignity and so if you are locked down at home you you have your period you cannot you don't have appropriate sanitary system it can be very devastating so really so but these are things that easily can be tackled by a system and as i said hey you have the exposure to psychological vulnerability about but i think one of the things they looked at was that finance you know that the market the assistant the current market system it's not very good for women but i will come back to that you know and uh so therefore they have poor livelihood therefore whether i hope your husband is already violent you know and you need money from him all the time where will you go to so you have that and because of that this leads to negative coping strategies in women and their and leads to their burnout but we know that we need women to be strong because they are the kids so if they want to look after the children who they want to keep the house together so really we need to find things that will protect them we need to find a way to support them and we we need to begin to think about how to challenge the gender in what they that says men are powerful so we have to think in a different way i know we're talking about could be 19 but we need to think beyond that so because condemnings will come again whether we like it or not so really he wants us to think about challenging the early marriage that people have all about the world you know so how do we think about it you know in a way that is different you know so that also educating men but i think part of his ignorance of men you know because if you educate men you know properly maybe some of the things that we said norm will not be known so that's so that's the thing so let's look at it again again from world bank project and again from what we are talking about when you look yeah unfortunately there are over representation of women in our core healthcare in health and social care activities if you look in england for example most of the bars in england you know you know most of them are young women you know who work there and they went because united happened weapon they all lost their job you know you know so and they're food preparation cleaning jobs but many of the girls have lower pay than the type of job men get you know so you work in the army you know you are mature type of job so this is about again this yellow tip as to what is good for the woman what is good for a man so really so if you want to empower women to do well we need to encourage them to say actually you could be an engineer you know i'm glad my daughter is an engineer you know you know but you know but you should you don't have to do only cleaning work you don't need to be only healthcare system so really so i think we have to find a way to begin to highlight that and showcase women that are doing well because many women do work because they do where they're in high places you know so we need to begin to talk about that about part of this project this this research is from institute of physical health in england they looked at you know the lockdown probably i didn't love that what happened so they looked at fathers and mothers very interesting you know when you look you know that in their job unfortunately during the coming i didn't look down less women were impaired german men but you can understand why because some of the type of young women did wasn't it so therefore that happened even though that you know men and women at home you know i don't belong down what happened with housework women do more housework than men you know far far more than the men and child care again so the women did all the child care majority of the child care so you have the men at the home that are paid you know during the lockdown maybe they are on a fellow scheme and they don't do housework really don't do child care you know really so you can see that that you know that we have to find a way to challenge the nuns because these are part of the nouns that are happening but in terms of leisure men and women these things likely activity of course your body locked in the house what can you do you can't go up so therefore that is the case and same with personal care and sleep you know so really so we have to say that mothers again at home took the dispositional burden of the work child care housework and no pay but it's not all bad news let me say something because i said you know that when women are in power they are very very good you know so i was very happy when i read this paper that countries led by women during cover 19 did better you know so that's it's a good paper so i think we needed to showcase this you know so it's not about uh england and france you know the men really makes me know they have fewer cases of death you know literally could be 19 what country led by women so the women showed more empathy on the system they showed more care they invested more in healthcare you know so really so so but what i'm saying i'll do we will show a picture of women difficulties women suffering but when they get to the top they are they they show if they provide a different perspective so really so i think you know we might the key what i was driving out here was that women should not think they can only be healthcare assistants they can they should become politicians because they should become policymakers as you go to council because you can make the case enough for successes and changes and on young women we look forward to look at what you do and try to do it differently i know that united nations is very keen also on on the rights of women because i've just joined a team of people who have you know who've just made a contribution to the challenges you un is thinking about especially for older women and i i think you see you can see contribute to this october 22nd and one of the things we said about it was that you know as part of the u.n they should begin to think about what i say finding a kind of not a world bank but a type of different bank you know a cooperative bank you know that can support women you know so that they can become more self-sufficient you know you know it could be you know so really so we need to think about that i read about a charity in east africa where they support women to buy goods you know so you give a woman the academy by the two goals and then they will you know be able to feed themselves feed the family provide milk and cold i think it looks very small but the report i'm getting from india that is giving the women power to think i don't need my husband for everything so really so we need to think again also how we can empower women better than we are doing now i think we need more women to be in power so we said that's the key thing we're going to be in power because they will show the empathy they will also show decade as necessary i think we have to find a way to support ngos that support women and women issue differently you know because and support it financially so that they can support local women in where they are working to empower them to be able to earn money so if you earn money you can become more self-sufficient and therefore support your family differently after we need to have some joint session between men and women you know where they look at things differently because i'm very sure no one wakes up at home to say i want to be back to my wife you know but somehow you know you know they think it's normal so maybe part of the thing we should be thinking about the future is a kind of a joint workshop between men and women so that they can see things from their own lenses i said about what bradford is doing investor bradford hoping to do about empowering women into education because if you are not a graduate you are one third of your weight less you know so really so beginning to think about such projects that you know give them an opportunity to become equal partner in the wealth creation and well-sharing of the nation so in a nutshell so really so women are the key and when they the tea they hold it well right so going to say that kobe 19 has shown that they have carried a more burden than the rest but it shouldn't be so let's remember that you know pandemics will come crisis will come let's think again and work together you know for a better society that will be proud of that is good for our mother because if you ask a man how you how do you want your mother to be treated is with respect of course how do you want your wife to be treated i'm not sure you know so really we need the world that is good for our mothers and that's what i want to say you know thank you very much for giving me this opportunity thank you very much professor gabriel thank you so much for presenting on how the impact of the pandemic has on you know women as well as the different kinds of responsibilities that they take on in addition you know compared to work and as well as the vulnerability of their livelihoods you know being affected by the pandemic itself and of course the importance of women's rights and i also noticed that you know in the chat that you know some people have been asking for the data as well as the slides so i would encourage you to reach out to the respective speakers if let's say you would like to you know get the slides from them you can email them directly for their slides all right so without further ado let us invite our next speaker ms claudia to share with us about the global mental health peer network as well as its initiatives miss claudia please cool all right so just as jd said um my name is claudio sato i am deputy ceo of the global mental health peer network and um so i thought to take a slightly different stance to the presentation um it actually works quite nicely in support of what dr daniel said and um also with professor gabriel so what i'm going to talk about is who is the global mental health peer network what do we do what structures do we have in place that empowers women um and also what are the kinds of activities that we do that empowers women and so i will get that started and then just for the purposes of the talk because the name of the organization is so long i'm just going to call it the peer network so if you just bear with me on that um okay great so about as the global mental peer network is an international mental health experts by experience organization so in other words persons with lived experience with mental health conditions it is a hundred percent lived experience orientated so everybody within the organization from our volunteers to our executive representatives across the world staff members we are all lived experienced so that brings quite a nice variety to the voices of persons with lived experience our global global office is based in south africa um but we do have representatives over 30 countries and currently sitting on over 70 representatives and so the peer network was developed from the initial movement for global mental health which was an international virtual network of individuals and organizations operating from around the world to improve services within a human rights framework perspective it became a solid foundation for the peer network and from that the peer network was registered in 2018 as a non-profit organization and subsequently in july 2019 it was registered as a public benefits organization with the south african revenue services and then last year we were quite fortunate enough to receive our equivalency determination certification which recognizes us as a united states public charity which really emphasizes our global presence so since our establishment we've got two main focus areas or principles that we we are really passionate about one is to develop a global leadership of lived experience so a global community of lived experienced persons where we can all share our voices and then in order to share those voices and experiences and perspectives we provide a sophisticated platform so that would be the second part so it's kind of twofold on the right hand side of our screen we'll see the global office which is myself as wtco in the middle our founder charlene sinkel is quite prominent within the mental health field um we can share this later which you guys will then see what our tasks are responsibilities so if there's ever a time you want to reach out you guys can use this sort of as a the contact you know or the guide to reach out to us should you want to collaborate or um take anything further then we've got our project assistant so purely just from here even though we're still fairly new you can see that we're two women and one man um so that kind of just shows the initial woman empowerment um side of our organization so from this i wanted to jump in to just briefly touch on the development of the global leadership purpose that we're running and then i'll talk slightly um i'll talk a little bit more about the platform that we have so jumping in on that so developing leadership for for the peer network is super important um we have created a structure um which i will explain just after these next two slides um sort of the structure that we have in place that helps develop people with lived experience so and what we aim to do with that is by developing and having them in leadership roles or getting them into leadership roles through our activities it will then um look at all of this and say okay cool we're going to empower them now they'll be effective engagement from their side they get to meet people from abroad really make good connections and everything that we do is really person-centered it is not focused on the biomedical model so it's purely a person-centered approach a human rights approach and with that said because we're quite diverse the perspectives that we get come from such a broad range of people of circumstances from the lower middle income countries to the higher income countries and also one of the challenges that each country faces is different so when we do get perspectives from our members it's really diverse and really unique uh all right to the next one now there we have seen a an increase in the global recognition of the role of persons with lived experience and i think to some degree covert 19 has become the reason that this has sort of escalated um because now we need to ask persons with lived experience within the different realms of mental health so research policy reform service development and meaningful and authenticated engagement right so genuine conversations and then we we aim to have the organizations that we collaborate with actually take their recommendations and put it into policy so it's not merely just a tick box um oh i've spoken to people with lived experience in the tick box we take that one step further so that's how we promote their leadership and development and also through that we've noticed that there's that global recognition to include include people with left experience so yeah it's just a nice little childhood you guys can see when we share when i share the presentation should you want to have a look uh okay so the next slide here this is more about our our structure and this i think is very important to say and explain how we work so we work from a very systematic approach so the global structure is as you can see here we've got our board of management which is five people then we've got our global office which you had seen number three and we've got regional executive committees um members so that is we have regional leads from across the world and then we've got the country representatives so they kind of work together and you'll see our country executive committee is established based on the world health organization regions and um we'll have a look here so again just re-emphasizing that everything everybody in this structure is a lived experienced person or an individual um we and and what it does is just filters really nicely through that even the chairperson is somebody with lived experience all the way to the volunteer who helps us draft the newsletters that we send out every month on what we do so that's super important to know that there's so much value within those with lived experience further below you will see two pictures here so this side on the left hand side we've got our profile per gender so if we look at the board of management we've got two females two males staff it's two females one male so you can see from here i'm not going to go through it due to time but that primarily we are more women sort of run by more women and having involvement or with women um we don't know if this is anything to do with culture but this is sort of the stats as at this week we're sitting at more women than we do men um then on on the right hand side we've got subcommittees which were created post-covered um which helped us identify key uh areas that need specific focus so our executive committee members have the opportunity to join these these subcommittees and focus on key areas within their countries and the peer network helps with the platform for them to reach and achieve what they think is is important so when it comes to women empowerment we can look at youth having very young you know young adults young ladies trying to step into bigger positions we've got lgbtq and then we've got family and carers as it was mentioned in the previous presentations we've got a lot of carers mothers daughters so it's important to have this kind of subcommittee in place so the family carers is still quite new the rest have been established we're in the process of finalizing the structure for the family and carers um and also to jump on that what we did is uh for on the 8th of march we commemorated international women's day so we presented a task to our executive committee members and we said we asked them you know if you wanted to see gender equality or if you want the future to look like gender equality what is it that you would want could you give us one or two words so the flyer that you'll see here was based purely on their responses and bearing in mind that every these many people within our organization that hold hard positions the women hold hard positions with lawyers psychotherapists maternal mental health nurses carers child and adolescent psychiatrists peer support workers so the women are really involved a lot in what we do um and they actually speak up more which is is also good for us because we get more information and in everything that we do because it's person centered and human rights centered we are really working on gender equality women empowerment and human rights okay so as mentioned before the other um i think professor gabriel mentioned that mental health is an extremely important or advocacy is really important and we couldn't agree more from the peer network the start of 2020 really has covered impacting on mental health and increases the burden of mental disorders and this big spotlight on mental health now but from all of that what we have gathered and from our work to over the last year specific to covert we've really picked up on peer-led services and support this seems to be quite a big um or it's a common thing that people want to want to take take up really seriously so we are working on um establishing some regulatory body which is something that we're still busy with but peer support is something that we're genuinely looking into that's gonna also place a lot of empowerment and leadership into our members and broader um so you can see just briefly here peer support will help with the reducing of coercion and service delivery it will help navigate systems we can promote recovery and so forth so there's a little bit just on that on this slide here i had mentioned the common themes that we had picked up from some of our work so what we had done was workplace mental health uh webinars for big international companies across the world and these were sort of some common um themes that we brought up that was raised so i'm not really going to get into it because this was brought up quite nicely in the previous presentations so in the initial stages of covert we offered international banks specifically a lot of workplace and covert mental health workshops and there was a lot of engagement and the women came up with a lot of challenges and they were the ones that actually suited us we cannot be a mother a daughter sister a carer without priority prioritizing our own mental health because if we don't prioritize our own mental health we can't really help our children or our family and even go to work and you know sort of take that role as well the peer network also worked alongside fgrp the federation global initiative on psychiatry which is also very focused on promoting humane and ethical services and with them we drafted a joint statement so we can share that later if you wish we hosted roughly around six to eight months of peer support virtual group sessions to the public so that was really nice we got a lot of mainly women attended as well some things to note and you can see on the right hand side um the un secretary journal had a nice conversation with sean she's a little bit over there which you can't see probably um but it was a three-way conversation about with another mental health worker but what's the best approach from this discussion there was a policy brief launched i can also share that with you separately and the three main recommendations that came from that was we need to as a society and as stakeholders within the mental health profession apply a whole of society approach um and ensure we've got emergency services in place for now and post covert and then also just building mental health services for the future i'm not going to be much longer now but our recommendations from the peer network and we say this for almost everything that we do is collaboration and joint partnerships are super important if we can rather work together we can stay stronger together we can have a bigger voice and we can make a bigger impact as opposed to being fragmented and staying isolated and then the second point is meaningful and authenticated engagements and that goes back to what i mentioned earlier it's not just a tick box exercise anymore we don't want that we refuse to stick to that so if we are providing services and we're reviewing mental health policies as soon as we get lived experienced voices directly from our committee we'll also take part in those activities we ensure that their recommendations do go into the policy changes that we help with so i think for me that that's all i really wanted to say and if there's anybody on here that has lived experience with a mental health condition wants to help us drive change whether you're a family member that's looking after someone that has mental health conditions or whether you your cell phone you feel like you need to take that next step we are currently recruiting so we're more than happy to receive applications you can contact me and i'll help you with that um and and i think it will just be great to get more people to represent from all over the world so i just want to say thank you very much and um i'm very happy that i got to have this conversation with you thank you thank you so much thank you thank you so much miss claudia for sharing with us about the different types of you know initiatives launched by the global mental health peer network yeah as well as the different challenges that you guys faced as well you know when it comes to the different structures as well as the different initiatives that you have so thank you so much for that so finally last but not least let us invite miss porsche to share with us more about the mental promotion efforts during the covet 19 pandemic in singapore miss porsche please hi good evening everyone greeting from singapore and hello ingrid gabby claudia everyone for joining us as well as connie from australia prof chang from taiwan becky jonah hannah jesse and zai thank you so much for joining us this evening from singapore so i'm going to show briefly about what is happening in singapore yeah so um okay the outline will be a psychological impact of uh week 19 and effort made by government because like many of you mentioned about you know the contribution and the role of the government in uh advocating for mental health as well as ngo's effort as well as in media effort so the thing is like claudia mentioned about collaboration and joint partnership this is very important and i guess that's why all of us believe in this and we have especially come together to reach out to everyone at this session okay to begin with the psychological impact of kovite 19. so this is something that i share at the world federation webinar as a set news a tragic event uh that happened during the kobe period there's a depressed a mom who has depression actually killed the artist the sun with autism before committing suicide in singapore and this happened around world mental health day last october and it was rather disturbing and i i see the need to address on especially women's mental health because women actually take out multiple roles in the society so of course everybody has been talking so much about kobe um the thing is according to the studies there are proof showing that it might lead to anxiety depression post-traumatic stress and insomnia and um for now according to an online survey conducted by our team silver ribbon singapore one in four experienced low mood anxiety and loneliness more than usual during the kobe 19 period so according to the latest study in singapore pro jaffa actually and her team from nus medical school in singapore performs 68 studies involving 288 over 1000 participants from 19 countries to assess the risk factors and they found that among the people most affected by cool week 19 are women younger adults individuals of lower social economic status those staying in rural areas and those who are at risk of covid19 infection so according to pro-java finding women were more likely to experience psychological distress than men consistent with other global studies that anxiety and depression are more common in women yeah so um the lower social status of women and less perfect you know uh prefer show access to health care compared to men across those 19 countries and according to her outreach program for mental health services must target women proactively so i'm going to share more about what we have been doing in singapore so for the government effort this is what happened in singapore we use or adopt a different term from other parts of the world we didn't use the term lockdown but we adopt the term circuit breaker so we have the circuit breaker from 7 april till 1 june and um i managed to obtain a statistic earlier on and actually there were a total of 60 000 over confirmed cases in singapore and there's a total of 30 number of deaths in singapore and 60 over a thousand actually recover in singapore with lots of blessing and with the support of all dedicated health care workers so during the circuit breaker there were a whole list of restrictions and there were a lot of people experiencing anxiety because they are not clear of the restriction and there were some cases where some people were arrested for not wearing a mask in the street and everybody really get paranoid especially those who are not i.t savvy they do not have access to the social media so the government also classified some of the businesses where they are supposed or not supposed to be operating during the circuit breaker period that is your lockdown period there are a lot of conclusion and in addition to that there were a number of people who were being retrenched or suffered a pay cut which actually affect their lifestyle their financial status so the government actually offer financial support for the community especially those who have been retrenched and during the circuit breakout period or the lockdown period i tell a lot of people who are looking for sanitizer and there are some people who actually mark out the price of the sanitizer we are almost running out of sanitizer and the government were quite kind they actually offer free sanitizer and our group was one of the group that helped in volunteering to distribute this sanitizer to the community and at that time basics sanitizer mars was another item that we are running out in singapore and the government actually started to distribute few free marks for the community as well to allay our anxiety and in addition to that there are a lot of fake news and uh everybody like what i said no we're experiencing high level anxiety and in addition to that you have fake news and you make things worse so the ministry actually came forward to manage the fake news and start implementing some punishment on those who start spreading fake news during that period of time and the government also set up this national uh care hotline which my organization supervising is also involved along with other ngos in singapore so we come together to provide free emotional support for the community and recently the government also announced that all singaporeans will get to receive free vaccination and as volunteering is free of charge and you receive two doses of pfizer biotech in singapore and uh our team actually are quite blessed and we actually receive both the two doses and this is a very very happy news uh which has announced uh recently that the government announced that 2021 we declare as a year of celebrating women the wrecks of the women the wellness of the women so this is a very special year and i think it's very appropriate for me to share with you i'm not sure whether singapore is the first country to declare this and actually last week um we worked together with a government agency the national council of social service and they actually launched beyond the labor media guide to guide all the journalists on how they should report positively on mental health so that they won't perpetuate stigma and able to encourage more people to come forward to seek help so ngo's effort so we have been highlighting very much on the need to monitor the psychological impact of kobe 19 during this period of time for example there are some people especially um [Music] women who are working from home they are feeling extremely stressed out because uh they have never experienced that and um they have to juggle with work as well as taking care of their loved one at home and clearing household chores and taking care of somebody maybe elderly or their kids so they are extremely very stressed out and during our counseling session some of our clients were asking am i being productive working from home i feel that i'm not doing enough or i'm i'm experiencing high level stress i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be doing because there's so much to do so we do have quite a number of women coming forward to seek help and at our end we also provide online emotional support so we are one of the two charity organization which started to launch this online emotional support even before the lockdown and we have been distributing this flyer all around among the community and we have been receiving very good response even from other countries as well and we do not charge a single cent we actually raise our own fund to provide this service we have been organizing a whole list of online events to engage the community to let them know that they are not struggling alone and we have been involving uh mental health professionals peers caregivers mental health advocates to share about mental health and to encourage everybody to move on with their life during this difficult period and i remember gabby early on share about the importance of collaborating with policy maker so we worked very closely with the policy maker in singapore and uh we'll host some events or talks uh to to encourage them to come forward to join us uh to talk about stress management or the impact of kubrick 19. yeah we also start sharing all these messages on social media self-care is not selfish egg and asking them you know sending messages to check on each other and this is being shared on twitter and instagram uh eunice olsen is used to be our miss singapore miss universe and she is a very active advocate for women's rights as well as mental health and chef has been running this women talk regularly and she'll always offer us a platform to share with mental health and we work with a number of companies and we try to encourage more companies to come forward to collaborate with us and we emphasize a lot on corporate social responsibility and there's one of the company pokhari that's a quite a popular drink in singapore and we have virtual run as well as some talks on wellness we also work closely with the religious group and we start conducting talks at the churches collaborating with some of the pastor and the priests and this is interesting for those who go shopping especially for women we actually have all these stickers on the floor when it comes to this safe distancing we start having the sticker and on the sticker we start spreading all this positive mental health messages to encourage them to move on while they are shouting and we also hold all these workshops and talks to encourage more people to come forward and to educate them on the warning sign of mental health mental disorder and the resources available and that's the online mental health survey that i shared that we realized that one in four actually were experiencing loneliness low mood and anxiety more than usual during the kobe period and of course we set up this global mental health project um that's called the global alliance for mental health advocate and we are quite blessed to have a representative from uh you know 18 countries across the world to come forward to share the ideas and resources and uh we advocate together and we actually invited our president haley mayako uh to launch this uh mental health project it's a global mental health project and you see all the representatives on the stage launching together with her and i see a majority are actually women and we have all this mental health exchange talks and inviting representatives from japan taiwan philippines canada south africa agrees to share what's going on and share about mental promotion at their own countries yeah and uh this october we are quite blessed uh in a way that we are hosting this conference on mental health do feel free to join us and we would like to have the support of ingrid with us as well and of course our guest of honor will be a female there's a medal parliament that's the president of singapore and media effort i'll share with you never in my life except during the circuit breaker or the kovic period where we have so many media coverage about mental health so uh we are quite encouraged because like am glad that the government is really looking into mental health investing in it and providing more resources for the community to address their mental health issues so this is my last slide i'd like to thank once again gabby ingrid claudia and everyone for joining this session thank you thank you so much oh miss posh so thank you so much for all the presenters for sharing their about their organization as well as the different challenges as well as the initiatives and strategies that are implemented in different organizations or countries to actually combat and promote mental health during this cover 19 pandemic so right now we would like to proceed on into the question and answer the q and a segment for this event so perhaps um if let's say anybody has any questions you know feel free to unmute yourself okay and you can ask the questions you know verbally to our speakers okay so i think you know just as a question to all our speakers first right okay so in your opinion what do you think is the biggest hurdle to overcome when it comes to mental health advocacy you know especially you know for to promote mental health especially for women and what are your recommendations to overcome these hurdles yeah so perhaps you can invite the speakers to share your thoughts on this yep would dream great like to go first thank you thank you so much for the question um i think one of the biggest barriers is when we speak about mental health we speak about it very generally globally as well as nationally and if we're wanting to focus specifically on specific actions for the impacts of the gender link impact of of covert 19 on mental health for women we need to extract we need to focus we need to pull it out and we need to prioritize and i think in in talking about the impact generally on mental health of all people which is important as well we sometimes lose the um the challenges that women face and have faced during these very difficult times and in losing that conversation we lose the focus and we lose the opportunity to find ways to better support women during this time as we saw and from my presentation um women are the most affected during this time and so therefore it should be prioritized they already started off on a negative base you know a deficit base when you look at the treatment gaps in mental health interventions globally as well as within countries and more specifically lower middle income countries so i think we're really needing to refocus and in every presentation i believe we should be pulling out and prioritizing women and women's mental health during curve at 19. thank you so much dr ingrid uh professor gabriel would you like to go next to answer in your opinion what do you think is the biggest hurdle to overcome when it comes to mental health advocacy and what are some of your recommendations well thank you very much for the question a couple of things one issue of stigma and discrimination happens to people who people without mental health and their family so there's always that you know and therefore people are not coming forward you know so if you people hide you know because of the word is about stigma and discrimination if if you if you have on your medical notes you suffer from medical mental illness when you go to hospital you don't get the best care you know so you don't get the best case scenario for people of course we hide they won't be want to disclose that so really so one of the things we need to say is that first of all we need stronger laws to promote people with mental health and mental illnesses i think we need policy to be very strong to say that this commission because you have a mental illness is not allowed i was speaking to the president of the world psychiatric association he said to me lastly psychiatrists who three patients also have discrimination because by association so really so he wants to work with us to advocate so that we can so so i think we need to be thinking like we need to approach that first of all there's nobody that is immune against mental illness so that's one thing there's nobody that doesn't know somebody who has have a mental illness or distress but yet when we go to the public we don't want to talk about it so we keep quiet becomes a taboo as long as we have that we continue to have this problem i'll tell you about what i call the social norms we have we've created some norms that are not real you know that where you say you because you have mediterraneans you cannot do this because you're a woman you cannot do this because you are black you cannot be this you know so you have series of social norms that we've agreed act you know to carry on you know along with but we know they're not correct so so they say what are called the feel of the collective unconscious so collectively as a system we have failed so we need to articulate so we need people like yourselves you know your peer support network to articulate that i'm i've i've had the mental illness but i'm the deputy chief executive of this organization you know so you know think about you know i've added maintenance i became the president of an organization so i think we need more of that so people can see that it's not a sign of failure it's not a sign of weakness actually it's a sign of resilience that i can go through it you know because i've got to be suffering and here i am so i think so we need to change the language and this is why one of the reasons is that uh i'm gonna deviate from my role in dignity to work to wfmh this is why i like the wfmh you know about one mental health day and i really that we can articulate and say me too you know so so i hope we can begin to do that because you know there's no i've got family people with mental illness you know but i'm proud to say because i can say because i know we can seek treatment but not others can say that because they cannot have treatment so i think that's it in a nutshell you know that a new approach a new language a new paradigm so that we can sexually it could be any of us thank you so much uh professor gabriel you know i agree with you a new approach and new language is definitely needed when it comes to promoting mental health yeah so ms claudia would you like to go next yes sure thank you um it's very good question so i think for me um using the experiences that i've i've been through with the peer network um what we've found is that we've had to narrow down specific concepts so stigma discrimination is a concept worldwide right so when we when we work within our our different regions and countries we ask our members what are your what are the key barriers or what are the barriers and what are the key aspects within your country that needs attention so that we can help you um you know reach out to the right stakeholders and promote some help there so with that said for example african while stigma and discrimination is still very big in africa um they're becoming they're actually our biggest region with the most members which means that there are people that are now really trying to come forward and speak up and make and they're doing campaigns and they're really doing such great work and um with that we then found having more and more conversations and i think that's what's so necessary is these conversations um is we then found okay so we've got the generalized idea of stigma but now there's self-stigma so the stigma that you put on yourself and then there's stigma within the psychiatry field or the field of psychiatry within mental professionals themselves so what we now have done is okay so now we've reached out to various psychiatrists around the world and next week friday we're actually having a webinar purely to discuss what are the barriers why is it happening what can we do what are the opinions of these people that are going through these types of things because if we don't ask we're not going to know how to proceed right so while there is so many barriers um i feel like all the stakeholders that are involved in mental health promotion means health awareness news health advocacy should always seek out an organization that has lived experience within their own structures because you are going to get the most valuable information because it's coming directly from people that are struggling the second thing is what does lived experience mean right um does it mean you have to have a diagnosis in order to be part of an organization such as ourselves no it doesn't it means have you previously used a health care system for maybe just therapy or have you just used medication for a short period of time have you experienced trauma anxiety depression when you were studying or at work so we have our own charter that explains lived experience which we feel have we've broadened it so that we can really encapsulate as many people as we can into this title so to speak right so that we can have as many voices as possible and then the third thing is peer support this is the way forward for everything in our opinion and because there is always there's always going to be stigma and hopefully the next generation doesn't have to deal with that but you know because we're talking about it so much now maybe they won't have to but the reality is that it still existed we are working as an organization on developing peer support training structures so that peer support is not only just colleague to colleague let me help you let's talk about what's happening i'm relatable but defining what it means to be a peer support worker so that if you get just as an example you get you're having an episode at home or you you're not feeling well you've got to go to hospital who's instead of going straight to your clinicians what's the middle what is the in-between process who can you talk to in between because sometimes it's about prevention and not necessarily curing so those are conversations they kind of link in with everything so like professor gabriel mentioned stigma is a huge thing but maybe a peer support worker could step in before we go to the professionals so there's those sorts of things that we've seen from our experience um so i hope that's that's answered your question but yeah very good question thank you very much miss claudia uh finally uh miss porsche would you like to have a go at the question thank you yantan actually it is always challenging when you talk about mental health advocacy and of course um it's still the same thing like what claudia said earlier on collaboration and join partnership um mental health is everyone's responsibility so it's not simply the the job of a psychiatrist i mean like many times especially in singapore you know everybody just say oh it's because of the psychiatrist you know oh it's because of the caregiver is not doing enough you know but i i just feel that everybody plays a part it's only possible if let's say everyone can recognize that each of us play an important role in advocating for mental health be kind and not able to acknowledge the importance of mental health uh yeah the ability the knowledge the importance of mental health is very important as what i have said during the earlier presentation women play multiple role and at times we have played too many roles until we overlook the importance of taking care of our mental well-being we overlook and we neglect our health our mental health that's an important part so i think public uh public education and partnership the two peace is very important thank you yinten thank you so much miss portia i see that someone has raised her hand on this joey jonah thank you very much and thank you so much for those presentations i think they really fantastically reframed the debate i commented on that earlier in the chat box that that is so important you know i'm from northern ireland so a corner of the uk and mental mental health is massively under resourced access for women is particularly important for different reasons but my question is that there has been increasingly quite a lot of talk about mental health here but it is still that idea that it's an individual level problem and it even extends to suicide we have an incredibly high suicide rate that affects primarily young men but it how do we begin what's your advice and how do we begin reframing it that this is actually a cross-cutting issue because there's also work on a gender equality strategy here but that's very narrow and one department take responsibility when actually you know as you say women's mental health is the result of all those things across the lifespare fear how do we make policymakers listen thank you so much for your question ms jonah um who would like to have a go at the question first perhaps um talking great would you like to go ahead thank you so much uh jonah i think the challenges that you face in ireland in northern ireland is not um unique to me for example in south africa where about close to between 92 to 90 between 92 to 95 depending on where you are people have no access to treatment and these are people living with mental mental disorders so i'm very familiar with the context that you're describing um and so what we have done and what we promote as well as the world federation for mental health and it came through very clearly last year in our campaigning around world mental health day where we were calling on governments to invest in mental health because you know the return on investment for in in mental health is enormous has enormous benefits for countries you know and and i think if we focus on the investment call again and hold our politicians accountable we need leadership we need our politicians our our presidents to be showing leadership in this matter um and to ensure that our health budgets begin to shift on average we know about four percent globally of health budgets are spent on mental health that's never gonna begin to address the challenges we're talking about um so um our recommendation would be you know um to really ensure that our uh our political leaders uh um really start to change the policies to change the investment agenda when it comes to um to mental health specifically and as you said it's a comment the the mental health challenges that women face it's a cross-cutting issue you know um and there are ways in which we can provide very cost effective mental health services that don't cost a lot there's a lot of amazing innovations particularly if you look at a mental health gap and some of the innovations coming through um it's doable it's possible but it needs political will and it does call on us as mental health advocates to hold our governments accountable to whole countries accountable to make this investment in mental health you cannot begin to address this treatment gap um with a minute little four percent of your health budget for me to have and if you look at that if you draw down to that four percent it's mainly infrastructure and facility hospital facility type cost we're talking about community based interventions that provides mental health care and support for people to live an integrated life to have a journey of recovery that he respects their dignity and their human rights and the right treatment the right to um help the right to live a life as an equal citizen in their country and a global citizen across the world so it's it it's going to require a lot more advocacy on our side it's going to require for us to around the specific agenda to ensure that in every policy in every mental health legislation in every intervention plan that interventions for women have a specific focus that there is always a specific focus so yes it is a huge challenge just extreme treatment gap and as i said earlier on we started you know in the pandemic hits the world mental health was already on the back foot you know and then came covert 19 which added an additional layer of um need for resources and and i can imagine that that gab has actually gone got bigger there is though the one advantage and the advantage is that because of covert 19 pandemic there's been a lot of focus in the media and discussions around the impact of mental health so let us use that opportunity as as globally there's a lot of discussion showcasing and i said it earlier on it's a negative symbolic twin of cover 19 is a mental health fallout is to use that media exposure and to hold as i see governments accountable that we collaborate we can't do this in silos anymore we don't have the resources to do that but we need to come up with a local and national country level plan for shifting this agenda and the quality is for return on a better investment so that there will be the benefits for the country in terms of um cost reduction as well as having citizens more able to perform their role um across the world so that's my response thank you thank you so much dr ingrid would any of the other speakers like to add on to the question yes let me let me try you want to thank them for a very good question okay and i've been working on this field for many years and i agree with you it's very very slow but i think i think strongly that the key to this is to tackle stigma and discrimination specific and also for more people that understand mental health to be in leadership let me start with the leadership aspect first and i'll come to the stigma issue i was lucky to be the chair of a clinical commissioning group many years ago that control found about 800 million pounds i was very lucky i said that you know because i applied for it i got the job and what did i do one of the things i did was actually to look at the reason why we had a lot of patients in hospitals so thirty percent of the patients were driving the cost of our go to to budget so we brought in kpmg you know um pwc big accounting firm to look at this why what's happening and what did they find they found out that majority of those 30 percent they were driving because had concurrent mental illness with their with as part of their illness so didn't matter whether it was asthma copd diabetes cancer as soon as you have a co-morbid maintenance your cost went up you went to more casualty you went you spend more time in hospitals so during my period i made sure we invested in social care invested mental health activities and supported psychological therapy obviously affirming the job but whoever kicked the world and i'm going to look at to see what the new people have done but we also made sure we made the case in our in our commissioning group that mentor was a driver of of that and i think those of you all of us should do more research and make sure we publicize that actually if you invest in mental health you reduce hospital costs and i think kobe 19 will push to that because the government will not be able to fund hospitals they won't be able to fund health like they used to do so let's come up with ideas because they want to save us anyway we can show that so that's one thing we need mental service user to be on boards of hospitals to you know certainly look to be part of commissioning group put yourself forward to go into the board because you can ask the question because when you have challenges you don't ask the question nobody will ask it so really so they know therefore you will we don't have a voice in on the policy platform so really so we're gonna have to do that and i'll give an example again i did some work many years ago in chile when i was part of wonka in the public health firm and we looked at how to support primary care transformation in chile and one of the things they did in a place called makuu was that they set up a board a local health board that were made of citizens so before you had the major before you go to the government you had a board that looked at what was happening locally and they were very different so and they prioritized mental health so the indian board and so so we need to get into policy we need to get to management because if you are not in management who will do it for you nobody understands what you're doing so that would be the case but then let's hook up to issue of stigma unfortunately because we don't come out so let me give you a small example another example if i tell you today if you invest one pound you will make 20 pound savings you know in a treatment of cancer the government will jump at it everybody will jump at it because everyone will talk about it when we said the same in mental health it's not published nobody hears about it nobody knows about it you know so we need publications we need to agitate so differently from what we're doing so so i think we need to start doing that we need to love the government you know so one of the things that the wfo used to do we had somebody in the euro at the united states maybe we need to go back to that you know pay people love me so speak you know who we know we paid you to speak for us please speak for us but as long as we sit in our home and complain and moan nothing will happen we've got to be you we have to be engaged with the youths young people invest in the young people because they're the future you must actually help us you know twitter facebook all these kind of things we are not good at it you know we need to be better we need we need to be to to do things differently so it's a new language a new met a new way of doing things the old way has helped but cannot do more than he's doing now we need a new approach we need to put pressure on government because without policy no matter how good we think we are it won't work you know so we need to put pressure on them to say we need we we need to do this and we should be a vocal we advocate we should go to campaign go to the street to carry placards but sitting there home and complaining won't work so that's what i'm going to suggest that a new approach a new partnership of equals so service users advocacy organization professionals all working together and coming to say this is not working in ireland you know but when it's worked somewhere why don't you copy what's happening there and don't be ashamed your honor to say this is not working if you don't say it nobody else will say it everybody feel the same that whichever who will speak first please speak first thank you very much thank you very much professor gabriel um yeah any other speakers would like to add on oh yes ms claudia please go ahead um thanks jenna for the question um so i'm gonna take a slightly different approach to answering your question um so i think the first thing is um so you mentioned for example like your suicide rates have really gone up and you know that's something to to be concerned about obviously but i think with that we need to look at the behind the scenes and say okay um we need to firstly start changing the language so now we don't just like for example we don't say um this person committed suicide it kind of sort of criminalizes that that aspect it almost seems like this person should have been locked up first before they did it you know because it's kind of almost sounds like it's committing a theme so we need to start so it's about educating on language in all aspects of mental health so suicide was just an example that i thought would be nice to use but there's a lot of other things that we say um somebody i think leonarda in the group chat also said some parts of africa or a lot of parts of africa as soon as you say mental illness it's it's about somebody's being possessed demonized so again we're now moving into another realm or something else so language is very key in how we present to stakeholders right so when it's going to be like rather instead of suicide you say death by suicide or you know passing away from so you change that a little bit but with that said is we've got to start at the grassroots level and so the purpose of an organization such as the peer network is that if we have representatives in ireland northern ireland for example who say to us you know what these are as these are the issues that we're facing in our country what what do we do how do we reach government what what can we do so what we then do as from the global office is we say okay we take each country we write down what are the main action points that need to be done we work together alongside each other so we've got people that have just started or just joined us for example then we've also got those that have already been with us for two years so the level of expertise is different but we teach each other we skill share so what happens then is those from the grassroots level get empowered they get they sort of learn more about the leadership of taking on advocacy roles and then they move in they have the option then to move into a mentorship program where they teach the newly onboarded members this is how these are good ways to do things this is what works this is what doesn't so having an organization that has people that are passionate about this that have gone through some form of mental health issues right makes a huge difference because it's we're listening we are at the global office listening to what's happening across the world we're taking that information and we're trying to change things so what we then do is we say okay so common areas seem to be i'll just use stigma for example or education and we say okay we're going to draft a proposal we send that out to funders based on what our members are raising these concerns so that's how we then use our platform to reach out to the bigger organizations and to the funders to then help us so please give us x amounts of money so that we can work on creating campaigns we can work on policy reform you see how it all filters through and then eventually we reach the bigger the bigger stakeholders to make that input then make that impact and then as i had mentioned in the presentation our main recommendation is that it's partnerships and the second one being meaningful engagement so it's not good enough that i hear you say you know government's not hearing us we then as the organization all together work nicely together to say okay a northern ireland has spoken and these are the issues so please take that and put this into your reform so we take it that step further so that's sort of how we operate so i hope that kind of answers your question but that's i think that what's been working for us is to reach the bigger people through that platform thank you so much miss claudia finally um miss posh would you like to take yeah would you like to share your views on this thank you um after hearing from uh claudia and actually we do have a question uh in the chat box by our supporter connie and she actually uh asked this question that i know we have lost around covering suicide what's the change with the new guide i mean like it's in line with the this topic that is how are we presenting mental health it's about the perception towards mental health and um when i first started this ngo i faced a lot of problem i faced a lot of problem in getting people to collaborate with us i faced a lot of problem on applying for funding to support our program and services i faced a lot of problem on involving policy makers so i try to ponder what's wrong with that and i realized that there's a highly stigmatized issue it's a taboo and in singapore it's part of the asia country where um mental health is a taboo nobody there to talk about it so i gotta start getting people to adjust their mindset it's not about even changing mindset because they have this mindset for years so we have to adjust this mindset slowly and i try to work closely with some of the policy maker i volunteer my time with them and whenever they have any challenges or they have residents behaving very strangely as what they said i'll say can we join you can we volunteer our time to show you that through the collaboration and as we involve all the stakeholders to handle this crisis they will be able to move on with their life and some of the policy makers were willing to accept our proposal they give us a try and after settling or managing resolve some of the cases they start having faith in in a mental health intervention so it's about us putting some effort in adjusting the mindset and we have to be very patient it's never easy especially those who have actually a very uh unpleasant encounter with some persons with mental health issues or they have very limited knowledge and they draw a conclusion based on their con assumption after reading a negative report uh you know and another thing i talk about media guide media guide is very important because in singapore most of the time they try to link a a crime um with a mental health condition in singapore so we see the importance of developing and launching this media guide to to advise or to get to support the journalists to report mental health in a positive way and stop linking up on this tragic event and by mentioning uh about a certain mental health condition until you know i think that's uh this is very important so you can't blame people for having negative impression because they start reading all the negative news they start you know and they have very limited knowledge so public education collaboration and we're going to put in effort to adjust the mindset thank you so much thank you so much mr porsche there is another question for for perhaps um johnson ingrid as well as uh prof gabriel because i think one of the bigger events that you know comes to mental health promotion is world mental health day so can i invite dr ingrid to share a bit more about what's the theme for women's health day for 2021 and thank you so much for the opportunity i think it's a very appropriate theme and we've been through an entire process and again i just want to thank professor if the girl who's our secretary general and in ensuring that we brief the global world about the theme so please you can go onto our website but it's a great honor for me to announce that the theme for this year is mental health in an unequal world and how appropriate it's an amazing opportunity for us to advocate it's an amazing opportunity for us to highlight the gaps and the inequalities that people with mental health face and the disparities that they they encounter um so a wonderful theme to work with and and we're very proud of the way in which the theme was decided it was done by a global survey so this is a global opinion really about what the theme should be for this year um and so please go on to our website and that's the world federation for me to have website there'll be updates there's a brief at the moment that has been uploaded for you to read more about why the specific focus but in the covert 19 pandemic space that we're operating it is easy it is a thing we can really work with it's a thing we can lobby we can use it to um to highlight as i said some of these uh disparities and inequalities um and areas of of discrimination that people are still facing today um and and as a result of many factors as we've discussed in this very important uh session today but mental health in an unequal world you know it's a moment for us to raise the issues and call for this investment call for the redress and call for a world that will make um mental health a reality for everyone and not for the few so um i am going to ask professor if the gyro to add as well but it's an amazing theme and we're very excited about it we had great impact last year um in terms of um you know activating and campaigning and with our major global international partners and this year we want to have even greater impact in terms of contacts and spread so our goal is a hundred million and if not more but we need all of you to participate to spread the word it's the moment and the documentation will be made readily available to all of you to use in your campaigning it is the moment ladies and gentlemen let's use it and it's a global campaign it's supported by the world health organization and the united nations and so let's just move forward use this opportunity so it's my call and my plea to all of you to join us in really raising the uh the real issues that people are facing in this very unequal world it's not an it's not a a a world that is kind to many people who live with mental health challenges daily so i'm going to ask professor pajaro if he could just add because he's been you know obviously operationalizing um the campaign and the work that we'll be doing going forward thank you president you know i'm really you know really grateful to be able to to be part of today's event so one of the things i want to say first that we like you to be part of the great push towards this success you know so drop me an email you know so all of you drop me an email and i will respond back to you or my office very quickly to ask to to ask you what you intend to do and how we can support you it may also be that we will commission you to write articles and pamphlets for us you know so if you whatever skills you have it's a collective thing so really so that's all i want to say immediately we officially published it yesterday on behalf of our president of the board you know and therefore the time has come and we want you to be an advocate to join us comment your theme however you want to do it differently and we will work with you you know that uh so really so nothing to say than to say we are here to support you we are here to work for you and it's a partnership so drop me an email and then we pick it up from there it may be also you know sometimes we we use main languages it may be that you want to translate something or you want a small aspect of it or a big aspect but we have a big event we publicize is also for you so really well done to all of you you know we need to do something and this is just this is the beginning that's all i want to say at this point thank you thank you so much dr ingrid and professor gabriel thank you so much for sharing about the theme for women's at half day 2021 so actually i have received a question for all of the panelists so what are your thoughts on the collective healing notion yeah miss claudia would you like to go have a go at the question sure um the collective healing as in with mental health conditions i'm just trying to understand what what the question was okay yeah sure perhaps okay i can invite uh because i will ask the question to clarify miss aya yes yeah that's exactly what i meant like um and in regards to a mental health condition in regards to um as activists working um yeah and and we face a lot of pressure and traumas in how can how can there be a room for collective healing and the mid-set of what we're facing like um especially last year like during covet how can we practice that yeah well that's a really good question um and i'm gonna kind of answer it um with my two heads so um while i am a mental health advocacy leader and deputy ceo of the peer network i'm also a wellness counselor um so i have found that a lot of um professionals non-professionals and mental health advocates taking a lot of strain from last year well for the last year with covert and all the changes i mean it becomes really difficult to find that balance again and also everything that you're hearing from clients or patients or yourself and what are you you would always need to look at what are the self-care modalities or techniques that you may have in place um i like to relax on something called the broaden and build theory so what do you have currently in place that you can broadly build or you know and work on to enhance your well-being because remember um i think i mean what mental well-being is your social your spiritual your physical state of mind so it's all of their combined so what can you do on a holistic basis or from a holistic approach to help yourself so definitely um things like your meditation and your self-care and your yogas and things like that also very important is peer support and that's why we're hovering on it so much because if you are feeling really bad you should be able to have somebody in the clinic for you as a peer support specialist or worker or at your workplace or you know so that you could turn to someone to talk to that's relatable um so this is something we are working on we we do a lot of wellness webinars so you're more welcome to join us it's monthly um you'll find it on our page but um try and look at it from what is it that you need is a trauma debriefing if so does your company have that in place or do you know what to do you know to help yourself so really investigate what it means for you because each person's difference i don't know if that's answered your question yes thank you so much thank you so much miss claudia for taking that question um i noticed that uh prof professor chung has been sharing in chat so professor trump would you like to share yeah so i just like to say today is the happiness day so say my regard to everyone and for the reference and also because today also is the spring breaker day and night even it also shows how many equal and balance so this is also for women who have the ring for the image you also can use today as a tour yeah thank you thank you so much professor chung so so the rest of the audience um do you have any further questions for our speakers so if let's say there are no other questions i think we're also approaching the end of the session so i would like to thank everyone for your time once again and special thanks to the four speakers for taking your time out to you know share wonderful knowledge and experiences with everybody here today and we would like to thank you for taking the questions from the audience yup so thank you all so much for taking the time to join us today thank you thank you bye-bye thank you bye-bye bye-bye thank you bye bye bye

VjePU-U4Qo0,Singapore extends COVID-19 circuit breaker period until June 1,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2020-04-21T13:20:49Z,"Singapore's COVID-19 circuit breaker period has been extended by about a month to June 1, as the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Singapore's Cove in nineteen circuit breaker has been extended by about a month to the 1st of June as the country continues to grapple with the corona virus pandemic prime minister lee sin long has announced the extension of these strict safe distancing measures in a televised address to the nation existing measures will also be tightened for the next two weeks mr lee also says singapore is keeping a close eye on the situation among migrant workers calling it a serious problem Singapore is on day 15 of its circuit breaker good it's here with more so far cases in the community have fallen to below 30 a day which Prime Minister listen long says is a sign the circuit breaker is taking effect so he said there could be a hidden reservoir of undetected community cases because unlinked cases are not going down on Monday the Health Ministry said that there have been an average of 20 such and linked cases daily for the past two weeks the aim is to bring daily cases down to single digits or near zero to do so existing measures will also be tightened more workplaces will be shut with only the most essential services to remain open meanwhile entry to hotspots like wet markets will also be restricted to send out crowds even more mr. Lee also urged Singaporeans to go out alone for errands and not with family members during the lengthened circuit-breaker period many will be disappointed by the extension of the circuit breaker especially our businesses and workers who are hurting greatly but I hope you understand that this short term pain is to stamp out the virus protect the health and safety of our loved ones and allow us to revive our economy the government will continue to help our businesses and workers cope during the extended circuit-breaker period we will provide the same level of support to workers and businesses as we are doing now mr. Lisa delaying the deadline can also help contain any spill over from the migrant worker dormitories if it happens right now these workers for more than 70% of Singapore's cases which crossed 9000 on Tuesday in the mean time he said more medical resources will be sent to such dorms to ensure timely treatment older workers who are more vulnerable have also been moved to separate dorms for closer monitoring still mr. Li noted dorm clusters have remained largely contained and haven't spread to the wider community most of these cases also showed mild symptoms to our migrant workers let me emphasize again we will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans we thank you for your cooperation during this difficult period we will look after your health your welfare and your livelihood we will work with your employers to make sure that you get paid and that you can send money home and we will help you stay in touch with friends and family mr. Lisa Singapore will need to do three things to exit from the circuit breaker first it must open up incrementally making sure the country is safe at every step reopening prematurely could mean infections returned which might call for a second round of circuit breaker measures next he said testing must be scaled up substantially to quickly detect new cases to do that miss ELISA the country is procuring test kits from overseas and also making its own lastly mr. Li that Singapore will also need to make use of technology for contact tracing urging the public to download the trace together app even as it is developing other apps to do so I know this has not been an easy time for everyone we are making progress but we have not yet succeeded by a long way the results do show that the circuit breaker is working now we all need to do a little bit more make best use of the next two weeks of the Titan circuit breaker and the four weeks of the extension beyond that I asked for your support and cooperation I asked we are trust and confidence let us go all out to beat the virus and break the chain of transmission we will overcome this together thank you the multi ministry task force has announced specific details of the latest measures arrow joins us now for more on this Cheryl what can people in Singapore expect in the coming days in terms of what we can and can't do well Steve going solo is really the name of the game as the circuit breaker has been extended to June if you need to leave your house to buy essentials or to exercise the Task Force has strongly urged the public to now do this alone and not make it a family outing there will also be staggered entry to selected wet markets based on IC number for a start these are for the more popular ones that still see a substantial crowd and for such markets have been singled out they are gay long story market block 104 105 issuing road also known as Hong Kong market block 20 21 Marceline Lane and block 505 Jerome west street 52 so how it works is that those whose eye sees last digit ends with an even number can only visit these markets on the even dates of the month and conversely those with an odd last digit can only visit these markets on the odd dates of the month now the task force said this is because unlinked cases in the community have gone down but not fast enough we cannot be complacent and this is the time now to continue to hunker down and give this a further push so first we call on everyone to do their part to minimize movement remember the virus spread through people through our contacts with others and when we go out and touch surfaces and then our hands touch our faces yes we can take precautions like safe distancing and wearing of masks but the best way to beat the virus is to stay home so if you need to go out to buy food to buy groceries go out alone don't turn this into an occasion for a family outing and if you need to go out to exercise exercise alone and in your own neighborhood don't travel out to exercise so we call on everyone to do this because it is the best way to protect yourselves and your family members more financial help is also on the way for those affected by the extended circuit-breaker Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Hanks week it said key support measures in the solidarity budget will be extended in the month of May this includes a seventy-five percent wage subsidy under the jobs Support Scheme to all sectors so as to encourage employers to retain their workers and tack on grants for training and skills upgrading during this period I will further enhance the Job Support Scheme to include certain groups of shareholder-directors these are employees of a company who are also shareholders and directors and who missed out on both the Job Support Scheme and the self-employed income relief schemes are also with the foreign worker levied in me and provide employers with another 750 dollars in foreign workers levy rebates for every foreign worker in employment families whose breadwinners have lost their jobs can apply for the COBE 19 support grants from 1st May 2020 and the temporary relief fund the extension of the solidarity budgets will cost 3.8 billion dollars well Charlotte econsent for Singapore is the situation in the afford worker dormitories what's the update there yes sir Glenda manpower minister Joseph interior said containment and testing efforts in the dorms continue and so far 10,000 essential workers have been transferred out of these dorms to be housed elsewhere necessary also added that it is through contact tracing that there was found to be transmission at common construction work sites which may have contributed to the increase in the numbers of infected workers we will now require all the workers staying in all the dormitories to stop going to work this was something that we had planned for and now we are going to implement it now this new condition applies to workers from all companies including those that have earlier obtained exemption to operate but which mt i will now notify to suspend operations for this period we know that they are going to be some adjustments to be made by the companies but we seek the cooperation of both the employers and the workers on this new condition it is a necessary measure to minimize the risk of transmissions mrs. chair also added that with ramadan around the corner efforts have been taken to ensure muslim workers are well taken care of the task force is working with caterers and Daum operators to provide pre-dawn and a break faster meals for the workers it has also translated the MUOS Ramadan guide on the religious observations to take into account safe distancing measures and this will provide guidance for the Dom operators on how to facilitate Ramadan religious practices its back to you in the studio all right thanks for that Cheryl ",True,True,False,False
OEHeBSPztRo,Singapore&#39;s early planning and response to Covid 19,UCQ9NLJDG_-ulq1FGP0hdTcw,Hamad bin Khalifa University,2020-11-04T07:56:13Z,,[Music] david allen and uh he was first introduced to me by our inaugural speaker for this covet series that was uh of course dr swain chen from singapore and at that time it's not just the fact that i was in singapore for a long time but what i like about singapore and qatar is they're very similar to each other in many different ways whether it be size or systems or many things so i think many of the things they have learned our learning in singapore will be super applicable to us in qatar as well and you'll probably see that from the talk but let me tell you a lot more about david because when swain introduced me he said you don't want just anybody dr david is actually a very front line person and you're going to hear about what that means but what i like about david is his background he was he's a real product of texas so i spent a few years in texas at the university and uh dr david uh did his undergraduate at rice university in houston and after which he graduated with honors from southwestern medical in dallas and completed his internal medicine residency as well as infectious training fellowship in new york hospital cornell university center in new york city he was then a visiting investigator at rockefeller university and an assistant professor in the division of infectious disease and geographic medicine at cornell university medical center after which he was recruited to singapore to establish an infectious disease training program and he became the first in faculty's head of department in what was then the communicable disease center he's also a fellow of the academy of medicine singapore and a senior visiting fellow of the courage phone singapore he was that from 2011 to 2020 he's currently an associate vice president of the health information and transformation at national university of singapore as nus as we know it and an associate professor in the yang liu lin school of medicine at nus and a senior consultant in the division of infectious disease in uh national university hospital in singapore and with that i just want to let david talk about singapore's early planning in response to kobe 19 and i think it's gonna be a very interesting seminar for all of qatar uh here's dr david pk i appreciate the invitation i'm i'm very happy to be here let me see if i can share my slides with you here we go great okay thank you again for having me um so today or to this afternoon i'm going to speak to you about our experience uh in uh dealing with covet early on and i'll bring you up to date what's going on recently as well but our early experiences obviously informed us dramatically just to remind everyone if you don't already know asia is an emergency diseases hot spot lots of zoonosis have been discovered over the last several decades the numbers have been going up both zoonotic and not zoonotic and a variety of species have been involved and if you can see on the hot spot on the map asia and south asia and southeast asia have a greater incidence of this occurring with the understanding that uh preparedness is a global exercise you can see how money has been spent from development assistance uh in in 2019 just a fraction of the 40.5 billion dollars was spent on pandemic preparedness so that shouldn't come to a surprise uh be a surprise to anyone uh it has been a big issue there have been lots of panels convened after nepa after sars after uh pandemic flu everyone rings their hands and we talk about it but we don't get too much farther than that the main source of pandemic preparedness as far as funds have been through the um others uh agencies um foundations and organizations certainly contribute but the vast majority of the money is funneled through who to apply the preparedness not only has it been wanting but it's also been sporadic and so you can see countries that have revised their plans which is a surrogate for telling you um for influenza preparedness it's a surrogate for telling you about pandemic preparedness since 2010 it doesn't mean that a plan means they have funded it it just means they have a plan but you can see a lot of countries either have no plan in place or their plan is more than 10 years old and what does preparedness mean so based on these metrics uh of global pandemic preparedness you can see some of the countries at the top have actually done the poorest some of the things that they measured were funding up for prevention and detection and reporting and rapid response and compliance etcetera etcetera etcetera despite all of their preparedness uh things didn't turn out the way they wished uh and here also is another way of uh showing the same those countries that are best prepared at least by the metrics that were used and though at that time uh you can see how they ranked as far as number of cases per million population so the u.s supposedly best prepared uh is has the 11th most uh cases per million uh in the world and some of the countries um maybe somalia that was least prepared um much fewer cases per uh per million now you could argue whether there's reporting you can all argue a lot of things but i think in general i think we the take home message is our metrics for measuring preparedness really didn't uh play out so let's get to singapore that's why i've been invited to speak singapore's connected to the world there's lots of airlines come through this is all pre-coveted numbers lots of airlines come through lots of cities lots of countries which either come in or out of singapore and each week 7 400 flights and 65 million people through per year would come through here so you can see that we are connected to the world and whatever happens in the most far away place we're going to hear about or be exposed to within a few hours of their flight landing so our preparedness uh pre-covered was influenced uh by uh co by uh sars kobe excuse me sars in 2003 the lessons learned we had 238 cases 97 were were in health care workers and we had 33 deaths so it reminded us that we're the nexus we the disease knows no borders and as a response efforts were made to maintain and bolster uh working relationships across a variety of entities whether it's basic scientists public health government etc and the strategies involve the whole of government being involved expanding capacity you can see a picture of one of our newer a photo of one of our newer buildings which is a national center for infectious disease that opened up last year uh predominantly driven many years in the in the planning driven by the events of sars in 2003 regular exercises to to make sure that we were prepared lots of uh supply management meaning stockpiling uh etc was involved so this was the strategy and it's been tried and tested on a regular basis ever since so this is the the strategy sort of uh in a diagram um there's comprehensive surveillance and we'll go through some of these aggressive containment to the leadership and effective efforts to prevent steps in all of those places so our infrastructure has been refined over the years as far as the the crisis management again influenced by past experience we knew we needed to expand capacity so we tried to have flexible capacity buildings that could expand they may have 300 beds but could be expanded to for six or 900 beds we we realized early on in the outbreak that cases many patients were stable we insist on isolating everyone not at home but they need to be isolated in a facility so we made community isolation facilities available we upgraded i mentioned national center for infectious disease but other hospitals were being built were built with pandemic capacity in place a lot more isolation beds than we otherwise would have and a lot of rooms that could be converted to isolation rooms were they needed plus we expanded our our basic research capacity which i'm sure swain spoke with you about the whole government approach was it's basically a task force made up of uh a variety of ministries manpower education transportation communications environment etc it's basically to direct the the response and coordinate with the community engagement and also to interface with the international community to make sure we're all speaking the same language uh there's part of the leadership in addition to the whole of government was having public communications and still even though the number of cases have gone down dramatically i get this all of us get updates twice daily through whatsapp regarding what's going on the number of cases in hospital and icu and isolation outside the hospital the number of people have been discharged from hospital twice a day we get updates uh it goes to everyone so there's a lot of transparency swift uh response to any uh changes in the kinetics of the number of cases showing up and quick uh intervention to it to deal with the falsehoods or people spreading conspiracy theories obviously we have social distancing and early on the usual things were suspended the senior groups and other high-risk individuals and eventually all groups were activities were suspended co-curricular activities for kids entertainment venues everybody began telecommunicating at home it was actually quite nice in the hospital where i obviously was coming every day because uh the the office space was very quiet i was able to get enormous amount of work done uh so it was quite nice and limited gatherings whether in in outside work whether in interpersonal spacing or in public spacing it was restricted how many people could be together as it is throughout the world when lockdown took place public health measures the usual things took place uh and minimizing non-essential activities the usual metrics it was a big effort to support health care workers they were overworked and so a lot of work was gone in by the government by hospital administrations by a variety of outside agencies that never had much to do with health care to really support whether it was providing vouchers free meals pick up laundry money uh gifts all sorts of things were done to try to let uh the healthcare workers know that they were appreciated uh and supported counseling services psychological health apps were made available free and everybody was encouraged to recognize the signs of burnout so who did we test in those days well we used our case definitions and the case definitions moved uh changed quickly currently we and these are the most uh liberal of guidelines we test all those who have acute respiratory illness to any agree who've had some epidemiologic risk factors or who've had a febrile acute respiratory illness in the last several days we test all people with community acquired pneumonias regardless of what's going on uh obviously if someone has an aspiration pneumonia or a nosocomial pneumonia we don't consider sars cov2 but in a community acquired pneumonia we learned early on that you could not predict with any certainty so we begin to test all community acquired pneumonias anybody who's travels to singapore gets a swab on arrival and then depending on where you came from you get a stay home notice for 7 to 14 days and you must stay home for foreign workers who continue to to stay in singapore and we are dependent on our foreign workers they get tested every one to two weeks but they are returning to work and we'll get into that a little bit more later surveillance strategies basically it's been liberalized but we used again the case definition we traced contact of all lab confirmed cases and we did enhance surveillance early on basically we picked a day and i'll show you a graphic in a bit and then we swabbed every person in the hospital that had a respiratory tract infection across singapore private hospitals government hospitals what have you anybody that had a respiratory tract infection particularly pneumonia got swabbed just to make sure we knew where all the cases were tried to make this uh as palatable as possible it was free and if you had coveted uh you were your cost of care was free especially in hospital and we tried uh eventually it took it wasn't our first step but we opened up public poly clinics and general practitioners so that they could do testing initially we tried to keep the tests in the tertiary care hospitals and main hospitals uh that became untenable as the numbers grew and we realized uh that we needed to expand that so you'll see in a moment that that expanded quite generously here you go here the public health preparedness clinics there's over a thousand across the country and you can either go online or you can go to an app and you could quickly find a clinic near you that would allow you to get the consultation treatment so we try to make it as accessible and as cost and as affordable as possible so we've ramped up early on obviously with everyone else we had concerns about shortages of swabs which we addressed by not trying to buy swabs elsewhere but we designed built and validated nasopharyngeal swabs ourselves we're able to make quite a number of them a day we're able to make several million a month and so we've gotten up to where we can swab up to forty thousand a day now with the capacity uh with pooling to go well over a hundred thousand swabs a day you can see the number of total swabs per thousand population we've performed and the number of unique patients that we've swabbed and we're swabbing we think uh appropriately we have less than one percent of our swabs have been positive telling us that we're being aggressive in our surveillance there's also other ways to survey people there's an app you can download to your phone that will use time stamps and bluetooth signal strength and tell those at the ministry of health if you turn positive they'll be able to say see everybody you were in contact with uh and be able to contact trace them quickly this is cut down enormously early on in the the pandemic before we had these we used uh other data cctv people's recollections phone calls etc to try to find out where they've been and when they've been very laborious this has helped dramatically now we have what's called safe entry so whenever you go anywhere you use the qr uh scan a code to you scan and it automatically tracks that when you're there and then when you leave you sign out they know everybody who's there at one time if someone turns positive if you were there long enough then they'll quarantine you but you have to do it everywhere even the hospital so contact tracing obviously uh activated once some a case is confirmed they track back everybody they've been exposed to the teams have expanded and we've used people that have maybe furloughed for for instance the singapore airlines some of the pilots got involved in the contact tracing uh military was involved in tracing uh the police and we had greater than 100 teams which means more than a thousand people working on this and they've used a variety of technology to try to aid in that so to ensure compliance uh we quarantine people up to four thousand a day and there have been more uh earlier in the in the pandemic right now there's about 18 000 people under quarantine and if you violate quarantine it's taken seriously uh the government will fine you and you're jailed or can be jailed um they'll also remote monitor you with true gps if they find out you're out of your house uh they'll track you down and throw you in the fuse gal they'll also do spot checks border controls we obviously tightened our border controls right now we've tried to liberalize them with countries that have low incidents of covet in their communities so china taiwan new zealand etc and it's not always reciprocal but we're trying to open up the the country a bit again for those singaporeans who return from overseas uh if they've been in a low in endemic area they'll be quarantined or stay home excuse me for seven days those who have been in a high indemnity area will stay home 14 and be tested throughout and singaporeans are advised not to travel except to these places where the travel restrictions have loosened a bit so again the isolation we keep all our positives in hospital and isolation facilities but not at home we have criteria when there can be released from isolation um and there's strict quarantine of their contacts and there's stay home notices again for people who have not had contact but of traveling uh from places where they may have had contact there's help care packages and resources and financial support to to make this a bit more tolerable it's still painful but there's some effort to ameliorate that and again these are some enforcement examples uh that they will deport you if you don't you're not a permanent resident they'll take your passport if you are a singaporean uh that doesn't make not much of a disincentive now since we can't travel much but they will find you and they'll put you in in jail they're serious about this there's also some other measures government economic interventions i've mentioned briefly there's some education and obviously our publications which i'll speak to in just a moment so the government a variety of measures you can see in the right of this slide there's been a number of stimulus packages that the government has rolled out many hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent and to support the country and it has made a difference economy is still slow but you can see depending on what uh industry in what sector you get uh different support so aviation and tourism has been roundly uh injured so there's higher support the sector is less so we've educate the community the usual sort of ways to do so whether it's on tv commercials print ads bus stop posters etc to help remind people we've tried a variety of techniques such as cartoons just to try to reach everybody and these are this these covet 19 chronicles come out of the school of medicine and they come out weekly and have been actually quite popular i've been involved in some activities uh one of which is covered 19 updates from singapore it went on weekly for 24 months we had speakers from around the world speaking on topics from uh macroeconomics to psychiatry to public health to basic science to treatment etc and very well received we on our last one it's the far right we had the director general of the uh world health organization in 24 excuse me and 16 other colleagues on uh it's quite a a well-received event lots of research coming out we've been involved in the room desevere trials are published in new england journal and some development of neutralization assays dealing with public health recommendations epidemiology and psychological impact there's been hundreds of articles guidelines etc coming from singapore we're quite proud of being focused and working hard trying to contribute to the international dialogue so we've been able to do all these things but what what what impact did it really have well first you need to know a little bit about our alert levels green is all as good yellow is beware orange is trouble ahead and red is trouble uh so dorschoon means a disease outbreak a response system condition uh singapore loves acronyms you can see there's an uh increasing incremental uh impact on either daily life or advice to public or nature of the disease so we use these alerts we've never officially gone past dorschoon orange despite the fact that we often meet many of the dorschoon red criteria but this has been our early response and this starts in january and goes until uh until late april you can see here or may excuse me the first of may and i won't go through this in great detail but you can see there were imported cases to the far left very few uh at this point but those got our attention the first case was on the 23rd of uh january and we went to dorscon orange two days before because we were anticipating this and then we we had local transmission in the community you can see the orange to follow the imported cases again fairly small and then we had uh the important cases our return of many of the uh singaporeans living and working abroad the government said come home and they brought covert back to singapore and then it spread from them into the community and then to our foreign workers which is the green line and the dormitory residents also the red line you can see we on the 7th of april we have what we call circuit breaker effectively locked down but it's the term that was preferred by the ministry of health that was imposed and it lasts until the 1st of june so this is the early part of our outbreak so i'm going to show you up until september but you'll get a sense of these epiderm epidemic curve so let's chat about the foreign workers just a bit singapore's populations five million six hundred thousand of which a million three hundred are a foreign workforce of which some are professionals uh about uh 370 000 uh and about 975 are unskilled workers and about 300 000 construction workers so there's a variety of ways that foreign workers are housed i'm a foreign worker technically and i live in well i live in housing provided by the the university and have but many of our obviously our domestic helpers work in the employer's home some of our foreign workers are actually malaysian and travel back and forth across our causeway we also have folks in dormitories and public and private homes so this is the distribution it's important to lay this out because our largest group of folks that became infected were our foreign workers living in dormitories we've got the three purpose built excuse me 43 purpose-built dormitories which take care of 200 000 men of which the largest of the dormitories housed 25 000 men we've also got some factory converted dormitories of which house a hundred thousand men so of a total of 323 000 migrant workers were uh living in uh dormitories uh not living in malaysia not living in employers houses not living in other uh housing uh 300 000 of them were in these facilities and as you might imagine uh housing can be crowded uh double bunks uh uh bunk beds and uh anywhere from eight to twelve and even higher beds per room in these large facilities usually located near where the industrial areas are industrial areas are here in gray or blueish gray and you can see the dormitories are located nearby so the challenges in in working with cobia 19 and our migrant workers were to identify them large volumes of men living in close quarters to be able to isolate them to find housing for this many men to trace them to quarantine them and to do so at lightning speed because we learned that it's transmitted asymptomatically so just the volume of testing was a logistics problem we had to ramp up our testing uh facilities uh swain was involved in that and still is involved in that uh as well as swabs and reagents and tubes etc we had to try to identify and approach and prepare appropriate new repurposed facilities and move them in there we thought that had not been infected and trying to to protect them feeding and monitoring them and getting the manpower mobilized to be able to provide these services was quite an effort there was need for economic support emotional and psychiatric support you can imagine these men were frightened being moved around and seeing that their friends had fallen ill it was quite a challenge and eventually as as things have drastically improved as how do we safely continue to allow these guys to work that are essential workers and those who aren't essential workers once they've recovered to allow them to return to work so lots of logistics that we had to work our way through so this is the isolated epidemic curve for our migrant workers you can see when the circuit breaker was in place from april the 1st of june and you can see how it is slowly declined there was a little blip in the august but that again has gone down and you can see most of these men previously were detected through surveillance uh now there are more of them have we've been able to get our handle uh our hands around the situation and more are being detected uh uh uh or isolated but before detection um and uh as far as proven infected by nasopharyngeal swab fifty four thousand three hundred have been proven which is sixteen eight uh sixteen point eight percent but we we know that more have been infected than that these are some of our community isolation facilities look like community isolation facilities that have sprung up around the world but we used a large exposition exhibition center we've used old schools we've used old malls we've used all sorts of facilities to try to do this and we're changing uh the living circumstances in the dormitory our current dormitory have a certain amount of square footage per van that's going to be increased number of beds per room you can see 12 to 16. they have to be less they're not going to be bunk beds because somebody on a top shelf obviously they're going to when they cough or sneeze it's going to fly farther than a meter when they're got a launch platform above the floor so no more bunk beds we've also built some additional facilities that are quick built they don't they're not intended to last but they're intended to last until newer dorms can be uh constructed and these are also spread out we've also keep an eye on the gentleman to be able to determine who has been cleared by subsequent quarantine clearance from quarantine and surveillance they go back to work so they have apps on their phone how to keep people that are on stay home notice at home and how to give apps so that the workers in their own language can seek medical care or at least alert medical uh folks to that they need attention so again looking at our different breakup of our uh epidemic curves uh the top one is the imported cases again very low over here when we're getting cases from china and then these are the returning singaporeans these are students coming back from the uk from europe the united states we did not initially isolate the asymptomatic ones we didn't quarantine excuse me the asymptomatic ones because we did not know then but it led to breakout outbreak in the community uh and then at some point in time uh our foreign workers it was introduced in that population and then uh caused cases there so we've had five waves essentially the imported cases from china the early clusters as a result of exposure to folks from china returning singaporeans and permanent residents from overseas and then getting into our migrant worker population and finally where we are now from may until the present where it's in the community and small clusters that break out so you can see here first wave second wave third wave fourth wave fifth wave which is what we're in now so currently this is where we are we have no one in the icu and haven't had anyone in the icu for probably six or seven weeks now the general awards were down in the hospitals were down to 29 as of the 25th uh in this is isolation facilities uh we've got 268 uh and we've had 27 deaths this is uh actually yeah 57 000 i think we're actually up to 58 000 or close to it so how do we measure how well we respond and and obviously pandemic preparedness at least the way we understood it before was not very good uh those metrics were not very good so this has been put forth by folks in public health as a way to assess how well you've done uh to assess your performance as a country ability to detect and break transmission change to decree desk to minimize hospitalizations to support individuals financially make sure that food medicine is available and maintenance of usual health services these are just proposed steps and things that you could measure that seem to make sense so what's an assessment uh as of late september of how we've done in singapore on the bright side we didn't default to allow viral spread to achieve hurt immunity um so we feel that we we were very proud of how things went initially we were a little concerned we're not a little we were concerned about how things went in the dormitories but we feel uh like we really made it a concerted effort to address that and and try to rectify that for future pandemics that will come we're talking about pandemic x now um we did we did well screening and early identification of patients and stratify and triage patients and get them to another facility before the hospitals became overwhelmed we managed to prevent fatalities by early recognition early triage of patients so our case fatality rate is less than 0.05 percent uh we've expanded our capacities even beyond what we had um we thought we had sufficient you can never have too much it turns out we've uh that's our isolation facilities we've expanded our contact tracing and our understanding how to use technology to monitor people the testing capacity we become self-reliant uh and we've become self-reliant with the ppe and diagnostics etc by getting scientists the manufacturing industry and the government involved what could we have done better well if we had appreciated asymptomatic spread which we were not alone uh but if we had appreciated it earlier we could have quarantined all the singaporeans who returned home from march we would still have had cases in the community but it wouldn't have been the surge we could have tested all before they were released from quarantine those we did quarantine even if asymptomatic and instead of assuming that no symptoms meant no infection we could have recommended wearing face masks sooner uh we waited until who recognized asymptomatic transmission to do so we were again we were not alone uh we could have understand the implications of communal living uh the government the prime minister has said would have acted more quickly and aggressively to control it if we would have appreciated that and we could have moved from the tertiary uh hospitals and and general hospitals we could have moved testing out into the community a little quicker we did it pretty quick but we could have done it a couple weeks earlier it would have decanted some of our tertiary care hospitals where people flooded because that was the place that could have gotten tests the government wanted to control and have an idea of what was going on and they felt they had better control by having it come to tertiary centers it makes sense but volume became a bit much and so could have been canted to those places earlier to get testing so things that are of current and future interest is we have low community central prevalence very low community cereal prevalence it may be 16.8 percent in the foreign workers but it is uh clearly less than one percent in the community meaning we have a vulnerable population we're actively trying to develop acceptable alternatives to pcr not just the the the inconvenience of the nasopharyngeal swab and the pain and the discomfort and the risk of the nasopharyngeal swab but pcr takes a long time uh and it's it's it's laboratory intensive we're looking for alternatives and where we're working in our here in national university hospital we have a number in development that look quite promising but we'll see we need to open our borders because that equals economic recovery and and important for our economic recovery we need to open our restaurants places of worship and entertainment to for mental health the the cultural health the financial health of these in these places that we hope will be there when we can go there we're trying to understand the role of monoclonal antibodies and the impact of vaccines i've been very involved in both of those and it's a fascinating area and more is known that previously but there's still some uncertainties and we need to efficiently utilize singapore's greatest natural resource we have no oil we have no gas we have nothing but our people and we need to utilize them more so the take-home messages are serious focused honest well-funded preparation helps doesn't prevent but it does mitigate we need flexibility in how we build our facilities whether it's a parking garage whether it's a hospital we need people cross-trained and prepared to be flexible to become they may be critical care icu nurses one day and they may need to run a ward the next day or they may be open omg nurses but they need to be able to move in in the same way with physicians we it helps to have fact-based regular honest messaging that has helped enormously we can see countries where the government is saying one thing the public health agencies are saying something else lots of chaos lots of confusion there it would be hard for someone to be confused in singapore the messenger is so consistent so fact-based so honest it would be very difficult to do that we know that aggressive shoe leather epidemiology helps with containment again does not prevent but it certainly helps prevent our healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and we need to be able to respond as new information becomes available so with that i thank you for your attention and i'm happy to take any questions that may come i'll unshare at this point oops so hi folks for the people that are listening i did send this message out through some chat channels but if you have any questions for david please use the q a and address all participants do not address specific participants and try not to use chat because this way your questions will get heard if nobody else has questions to begin with let me start with the first question um are you there david yes i am yeah just making sure uh so my first question was of course the migrants because i mean there's a ton of similarity between qatar and singapore one of them is the migrant uh worker community my question was you said it was 16 plus plus was probably the infected and he said it could be a lot more do you think that the migrant community especially the workers in the dorms is close to a herd immunity and how many more new infections are you seeing if at all in the migrant workers in the dormitories so i i i will tell you honestly i do not know that information i believe that is closely held information um and i do not know that i am uh the we we still see sporadic clusters uh in the dormitories one could interpret uh that we're not seeing more through a variety of interpretations uh i will tell you that the men have been dispersed uh so uh additional transmission is much more challenging now um so i can't i can't say that we reached a hurt immunity in that population or not okay so i have a ton of questions but some other questions are coming in so i'll give everybody a chance i want to be fair and so somebody has asked a pretty good question for the regarding the case definition what are the response strategies for cases having a ct value above 30 and does that affect the quarantine measures so we have a variety of measures um initially early on you had to have two negative swabs at 24 hours apart to be released based on the best available data uh now it's basically uh 21 days after a positive swab you can be released so we did have previously people in hospital 40 60 days until their swabs were negative no more we also use it with a combination of serology so we use symptoms serology and pcr we're very cognizant of ct value and certainly individually you can take that into consideration but from a government case definition or excuse me a de-isolation perspective that precise number is not taken and not factored in i will part of that is because we do not have one centralized place where we're doing our pcrs we have numerous labs there not all using the identical platform and so while we we all agree that a ct value of greater than 30 or 31 or some would say 24 uh would would uh identify those who are no longer communicable um that difference has made people a little leery of just putting up a number and saying that that'll be sufficient um i have a additional question this is about it's a personal question but honestly a lot of people are apprehensive about this deep brain tingle swab so you mentioned you've developed your own nasopharyngeal swabs what is your i mean the reason i'm asking is i hear all this like australia has developed swabs that don't go as far or just do several swabs around the nostrils i mean a lot of people are very apprehensive of something that's going you know quite deep and i haven't had it done yet but the people that have been subjected to it says it's pretty stiff what's her opinion does it need to be that deep or do you think we can uh have some other types of swaps well that's a lot of questions in one so let me try to to break them up so the answer is is uh depending on what day of illness or you were in or what day of infection you may have higher uh quantity of a virus in different locations whether it's the anterior nerves the nasopharynx uh the the trachea etc but the gold standard is the nasopharyngeal swab uh and it's it's the posterior pharynx so you you you you've got to get back there um and so it's seven centimeters regardless of your ethnicity regardless of your race it's only different from age but in all adult human beings it's seven centimeters from the opening to the back so we could not violate any patents so we had to find and create and produce our own swab so we took into consideration the need for flexibility to get there we took into consideration the need for absorption and retention of the material so we tested 40 prototypes many of them went in my nose sadly to say uh because before we're going to validate them in human and excuse me a human being before we're going to validate them in patients uh we had to make sure that they were safe so um the long and short of it is um we did a a we went through our uh uh our irb we got approval uh and we validated our swabs so since then we know that you can you can get probably or you can get comparable yield if you combine a mid-turbinate swab which is just two centimeters in plus a oropharyngeal swab that combination of swab for pcr equals the nasopharyngeal swab essentially and and me people find them less annoying uh and less scary but still they're pcr so we're looking at antigen detection uh both from swabs but we're trying to get away from swabs because if you're a foreign worker and you're getting swabbed every week or every two weeks to keep your job it doesn't take long before you get tired of that so we're looking to detect antigen uh the spike protein in saliva there's some amplification tricks we're trying uh we're also looking to detect rna through a non-pcr technique um and uh it's something called the envision platform and we have some other other assays that are out there trying to use saliva as a means of doing it uh the sensitivity thus far not as good but we're still we're still in uh process our problem one of our problems is the number of cases we have the number of positive patients is going down so our ability to test uh is going down but we're trying to design and we did with our nasopharyngeal swab tests that we are that are statistically valid that showed that they were they correlated very well with the commercial swell and and one person added to that uh as a question i think i know the answer but i'll get an expert's opinion and the swabs don't really pose despite their pain or whatever there's no real danger to a person from the swap no they're they're designed uh to basically hit the net you basically go till you hit the poster you hit the nasopharynx and then you begin you're twirling to scoop up a respiratory epithelial cells and the mucus that's there which is uh where obviously the rna is but no the biggest uh the two biggest concerns with the nasopharyngeal swab one is bleeding which occurs with all of them infrequently people who are on anticoagulation or hypercoagulated uh or over anticoagulated you need to be cautious about uh but they're not terribly risky to be honest with you they're terribly traumatic in people who are on warfarin and in range with inrs in the one to two and a half range um so you have to worry about bleeding uh which occurs very infrequently and you have to worry about the swab breaking off in the nose so ours were engineered specifically with that in mind uh and we've not had uh problems with that but uh if you have an inexperienced swabber who doesn't know where they're going or what they're doing i mean you can injure someone with a teaspoon of water if you don't know what you're doing uh so any swab is potentially dangerous but in the hands of someone who's has a modicum of of experience there they're they're maybe unpleasant but they're safe okay i mean i don't know i don't know how much time because i don't want to you know keep people but i just had some other biting questions which was i noticed you guys are only using hospitals in singapore to keep infected patients because in qatar they are also rolling in certain hotels that have been deemed as you know people for you know patients okay that don't need icu so i guess you didn't really have that many patients and my other question related to that was i assume you're only using the public hospital system and not the private hospitals because here at the private hospitals definitely aren't being used to house patients so we we let me be clear we are using uh that's one of the ways we kept our our government hospitals from being overwhelmed is we used community isolation facilities so we use large concert halls and have turned them into where we can put two or three thousand beds in there those are for isolation uh we quarantine people in hospitals and excuse me in hotels um and we quarantine some at home um but uh generally uh not generally we we have a fraction of our patients that are uh infected in hospital or ever went to hospital they've all the vast majority went to community isolation facilities we'd use private hospitals uh they agreed to be honest with you they were happy for the business because a significant amount of business in the private hospital sector in singapore comes from surround from china from india from a lot of people traveling from indonesia to come here they couldn't come here the hospitals were uh empty so the government said we'll pay you a fixed rate and you you monitor these people and they were quite pleased to do so um i have one more question i just came in from another response i think it's a very good question he's asking are there any methods of prevention or dealing with this outbreak that could apply to other nations that aren't economically stable as let's say singapore or qatar i'm assuming he perhaps means like developing oral emerging markets uh which you know it's a little bit harder to contain i think when you look on uh the world health organization uh site you'll find that a lot of uh countries that are considered uh lower income countries middle income countries are doing extremely well and it's not because of all the the the technology that we have they don't have that it's because they've engaged the community they've got a buy-in whether it's the the the village leader whether it's the religious leader whether it's the governor whether it's whomever they've managed to get people to say this is important we're going to protect each other so that's that's why now some it can be very judgmental it could be cl uh post uh arrogance to say it's because they're not counting all the patients and they've not tested enough but many of them have i mean vietnam is a is a wonderful example they've done extremely well many countries in africa have done extremely well so i think this is a matter of getting the message out and again many of these countries have experienced either ebola or sars in the past they understand this isn't a game yeah okay i think i'll ask the final question then uh uh because it's again and you were pointing this at the very end and it's an it's a really important thing i mean we're just worrying about uh you know kobe 19 right now and it is dangerous but you know i can think of a million other viruses that could be a lot more dangerous and you said you should be ready for other pandemics uh i don't i don't want you to be a forecaster because nobody can forecast a virus what are being an infectious disease expert what are some other virus virus strains that you see as potentially being much more debilitating than covet because i think things could get a lot worse influenza influenza influenza another coronavirus um yeah i mean those are the one i mean a hemorrhagic virus uh the trick is that all good successful viruses lay in weight sars was not a great great it wasn't skillful at being a virus because it killed people made him sick and killed him too quick yes hiv has been our longest pandemic hiv is a successful virus it can lay dormant in you for a decade or more so the tricky virus is the one is the stealth virus so this one was good because we didn't recognize asymptomatic spread we didn't recognize that that all these people are going around uh so it's going to be a virus that learns from from hiv and learns from uh sars kobe 2. yes that's so i mean i think to me having a the preparedness as you said is really the most important take-home lesson i mean because this is going to happen again yeah it's just a matter of pulling up our pants and just saying this is going to happen let's just factor it into our day-to-day lives and then we can get on with our lives we're prepared but to to whistle and hope oh we're too we're too smart it's we're we're not okay thank you david for a million other questions but i'll send them through swain privately because i don't want to take up everybody else's time but it was a really fascinating and i think there were a lot of take home lessons for qatar specifically so thank you ray yeah thank you for having me okay and for the people that are attending don't just go off i think there's going to be a survey that's going to come out so make sure you fill out the survey right omar hello oh hello is david still there i'm sorry david uh i'll ask i said it was finished but can i just ask one last question because an important question just came up so one last question is what do you think of the immunity certificate oh uh yeah i think uh who's never endorsed them i think they're problematic uh we we're not being disingenuous but it's a big issue is how long antibodies last and are the antibodies that are measured by the roche test and by the abbott test which are the common antibody tests out there are they indicative neutralization now there's some data to say they are but i think the big concern is is can you reliably be sure that that that antibody that you measure today will be there in a month and a half or two months and is it the right antibody so it sounds like a dumb statement but it's actually a very factual statement it's very important but there's other issues about how do you do this in an ethical way if i'm a country that the vast majority of my income in my country comes from my workers working overseas i might have i might be incentivized to give them immunity passports yeah okay okay thanks once again i think this is really it so thanks guys yep you ,True,True,False,False

My story shows how neurodiversity can overcome ...,[Music] success is failure turned inside out the silver tint of clouds of doubt and you never can tell just how close you are it may be near what it seems so far so stick to the fight when your hardest hit it's when things seem worse that you must not quit this poem resonates within me in a manner that no other has one ship a stormy night and the captain holds the ship steady in that moment i see determination on his face this was a part of my visualization when i sat on my desk in the school and memorized these words for the toughest moments i'd face in my life i'm anantha and today i'm going to tell you about my life some adventures i've had and how they make me rethink what it is to be brave i share my experiences on rebelling traditional societal structures a story of confronting various mental health diagnoses and misdiagnosis and how my family and i confronted cultural norms and the general idea of societal obligations to follow our hearts i was born in india and i spent my formative years in the uk i came back to india with my family in the end of the 90s and spent the rest of my childhood regretting their decision i then spent the majority of my early twenties traveling across europe asia and parts of the middle east searching for the meaning of life i spent nine years in the thick of the world's largest performing arts festival the edinburgh fringe and i have spoken to thousands of people from virtually every country including north korea i maintain my sense of calm by practicing a zen meditation technique called zazen for 20 minutes every morning why is that what makes me dedicate my morning routine to a meditative practice every day let me fill you in on the background first i'm born to two wonderful parents these are my parents and that's me my parents are very motivated talented creative individuals and according to my family and the society they represent they're both very dysfunctional it took me eight years of traveling and three years of education in europe to realize that they are not dysfunctional they are neurodiverse and burdened by the expectations for demanding society now when you look at both of them they come across as the average indian man and woman only my mother is characterized by a hyperactive imagination that makes her run from one place to another all the time she struggles to write a full sentence in english or her mother tongue but you ask her to design clothes or speak to 150 diverse group of nationalities in a day and she will do it with a smile with a smile that quite literally lights up my whole world my dad he's your average eccentric intellectual he has an odd sense of humor and can talk about any topic under the sun he's well traveled his english is impeccable he spells out sansa slokas in a mile a second all my life i saw him on a computer churning out pages one after another a few years ago he told me he was dyslexic wrong his challenges are not restricted to just writing it includes anger management repetitive rituals and an obsession for routine my mother has shown examples of a highly passionate life her creativity spoke to me through time and distance when i picked up on our trade 10 years ago she is a henna artist and she accidentally stumbled upon the world's largest performing arts festival in 1995 the edible fringe in the early 90s we lived in scotland and it was here that she began our journey with henna but when we moved from scotland to india in 1998 a few very strange and interesting things happened to us a house fell apart we went bankrupt the family separated not once but twice once when i was seven and then eleven at thirteen my mom suffered a semi-paralytic collapse it was my sister and our neighbors that sorted us out in the initial days after that our family helped us with just a few phone calls for those months that she was bedridden it was just me my sister and a housemate that was also the year i got my first cooking lesson and i almost burnt the stove down by accident at 16 my grandfather on my father's side passed away the family came together one last time before exploding into a cacophony of playing games that evidently sacrificed my mother and that gave us enough clues that we should leave it was clear we were not valued my mother my sister and i left our patriarchal home and moved to our mother's home despite everything that happened within the family my mother went to the fringe every year without failure that helped her run the house and care for her two kids as children it was painful for us to live without our mother for six weeks every year but it gave her purpose and a feeling of being belonged and valued she was happy when she came back and that mattered to us more than anything else surrounded by all kinds of performers and artisans she could be herself and not be judged that place was life at the age of 19 determined to help her i landed in edinburgh three weeks before the start of the festival she'll draw i'll explain great team a week later after my arrival she gave me the news that her visa didn't work out and she wouldn't be able to come so here i am i can't draw nor apply henna and suddenly the weight of the household was on my head determined to win and full aware that quitting and going home was not an option i contacted all of my mom's friends and colleagues in edinburgh stitched a trade together and sat with a banner and two stools in front of the dustbin at hunter square waiting patiently for my first customer two hours went by three hours and i had no one imagine a little indian girl sitting on a tiny stool with a few posters laid out in front of her in cold scotland i was breaking i was scared and alone what if no one came to me what if i wasn't good enough but then as soon as the sun bent over my side one girl came up to me and asked for a rose easy i scribbled roses on my notebooks all the time that gave me confidence to draw more and i began to draw abstract and they liked it and i never stopped it rained it shined my buskers and street artists were pushed along by the council and the police but i and my gang continue to fight for a dream and i write as street artists for nine long years when i think about how it all started it makes me laugh now my mother's colleagues were a bit shocked at the situation that a 19 year old with these big brown eyes had just landed up clueless two weeks before an international festival and managed to pull it along this would have been our 10th year but instead i spent the summer starting two enterprises planning my first tedx talk and living an ordinary but welcomed life the adam reference stayed at the epicentre of our lives the glue that kept us all together happy and sane even when we were tossed from one city to another even when the family broke down now let me explain why this was extraordinary we come from quite a successful family with its own burden of privilege my mother was well educated with a double masters but what she really loved was art and she rebelled ferociously against the system through words and action she was the oldest daughter-in-law sitting in the streets of a foreign land holding the hands of random white people excuse the political incorrectness but it didn't go well with their in-laws you can ignore the fact that we had barely any income but honor in india is everything when i took over her art business i faced a lot of backlash from my father and a lot from other members of the family they didn't recognize it as a career they didn't even recognize it as an enterprise but i didn't care i continued a legacy and i kept the whole journey hidden but hold on a second at this point i had been treading along with depression for eight years for the entire time from seven until this point i had been carrying the weights of a broken family an exhausted mother and a critical society that had been clipping my wings every time i tried to fly and in 2016 my entire system collapsed and i experienced a mental breakdown that was the same year goon broke into a house and almost got away with the life of my mother assuming that no one else was at home two village schools came by harassing her for money i heard someone muffling and assuming it was a monkey attacking her i ran out with a stick shocked to see her pull to the ground by two men i ran after them and got them arrested what followed were rendezvous with lawyers and police officers i gave up my country's legal system because it was either that or my own educational opportunities a year later i left india for my second master's degree and a scholarship vowing to never come back to a system that allows such things to happen and remain a bystander in 2016 i landed in a strange sounding city called rothworth if there's anything i can give away from the story here we can safely assume that i've had plenty of flight or flight situations and that i always got better i had been since the age of 19 contributing a majority of my time and energy supporting emotionally and financially a family of four separated individuals i was exhausted eight years of depression and struggled in academia i realized that i couldn't stay away from medical help and i needed psychological guidance most importantly i began to realize how i didn't really fit into the box that i was given to respect so at 25 i started talking to psychologists different ones all over the country and abroad when i tried to have myself diagnosed i tried a dyslexia test won the request of my university therapist i finished the test but ran out of money and then the pandemic happened so i never managed to get the full results i tried to have myself tested for adhd and anxiety disorders before that the psychiatrist suggested i may be an obsessive personality i left and a half me obsessive but who's going to get the job done and the third well the first and most embarrassing was after my 2016 collapse when the doctor clearly thought i was the s word and this was at india's premier health institution but really it was this social and academic pressures and my own undiagnosed disability that had me breaking down repeatedly when i would share my driving depression to my dad he'd say at any given point of time we have the potential to develop any psychological or physical melody in the case of psychology we can acknowledge it but we shouldn't let it overcome us my father's great he just drops these pearls of wisdom like a bomb every now and then and in fact that's how he talks solely and well that's not very helpful when you say dad what do i do with my life what career choice should i make just take a deep breath so at 18 i took a deep breath and i ran away from law school both my parents had evidently huge functionality issues of which they had no knowledge of yet they did what they had to do raised two beautiful driven and motivated daughters say that to them and they won't really agree with me but it's true coming from india we are still in the dark ages as far as mental disabilities and illnesses are concerned we reject it first and then we hope to be never confronted again to top it off we have feminism patriarchy and a dysfunctional traditional family system to guard against it and here i am every day i grow older the subject comes closer and closer to me i suffered from depression for eight years and came out of it without any antidepressants what i had was a passionate mother crazy colleagues and absolute to die for her friends but first i had to recognize that what i felt was wrong and then i had to accept that help won't come easy because i don't have the money to pay for it it is hard to diagnose a learning disorder in adults precisely because as human beings we are built up for building blocks of experiences that teaches us right and wrong good or bad fair and unfair and then if you're not nine anymore but 29 and 39 then well of course you know how to read or write or smile in front of a stranger and say hello would you like some henna but of course your everyday life includes you taking the wrong bus because you saw an eight instead of a five or you totally forgot to eat your lunch or you book a flight for december instead of september and end up on an isolated village in the middle of poland drinking moonshine with an 84 year old are you internally rehearsed a million times what are you going to say to the cute guy next to you who's evidently your boyfriend do you want to drink wine tonight shall we go for a walk can i have a karoo i mean i'm not an expert but can i afford one is there one available to me do they have time for me hello people in india can we have more psychologists and therapists please we don't want any more doctors and dentists from my experiences so far living in different cultures i feel we need more psychology enthusiasts just for the sake of the community i also feel that we need a better more inclusive psychological assessment system than the american dsm depression schizophrenia anxiety and the big 12 psychological disorders are just not enough to judge a vibrant transactional and honor-based society like india it's just not enough but basics of mood and thought discrepancies mania and depression should be introduced into the education early enough so when people become things they don't want to be or believe things that they shouldn't based on unfair traumatic personal experiences they can get help and so that people can recognize when someone is feeling bluer than you than usual are unusually happy and excited so how did i overcome my depression one thing one little thing allowed me to carry on irrespective of everything that happened externally when i was 9 years old my mother taught me how to meditate watch your thoughts be objective and just observe that was it it took me 15 years to understand what that meant but in all this time i had mastered one thing i am not my thoughts do not listen to your thoughts everything changes and that quite literally saved my life not once but twice i would like to say it was meditation all along and knowing that there is a separation between me and my external reality and my thoughts helped but i wasn't your average obedient child i didn't like doing what i was told instead i left my comfort zone i left everything that didn't make me feel safe even if it was my own family i also used building blocks of experiences over a prolonged period of time through random meditative moments my inner voice guided me to give myself short duration easily achievable tasks that i knew would help me make me feel happy i rewarded myself for nothing else would a chocolate a box of sushi a mischievous activity like breaking some random family room as i grew older my capacity to reward myself expanded i started planning travels across india and some other countries but it trips of course i traveled southeast asia for five months on a bootstrap budget and spent two and just spent two and a half thousand pounds that includes getting a diving certification so it's all possible i gave myself enough memories to feel happy about the fringe from 2011 backpacking from 2012 being societal in 2013 finishing master's degree in 2014 by the time i had my first major breakdown in 2016 and then my scholarship success in 2017 to another breakdown in 2018 i had begun to notice a steady up and down pattern and one day it was all gone i was free when i sat down to meditate i could breathe i could relax in a way i had never done before years i've gone by with me trying to let go let go of the years of stress and anger i didn't do anything special i just sat still and breathed my father once told me a beer a bee does not know it's not aerodynamic yet it flies true that spirit pushes me on every time i think of writing a new instagram post or fools me to taking on another academic project i'm dyslexic remember if you're the smartest person in a room then you're in the wrong room there absolute gold for when i make mistakes of course if i'm burning out then i can only motivate myself to keep going forward because going back is not an option so here's another tip it's a quick exercise and that will save you if your heart starts sinking or beats unusually fast in the middle of the day or first thing in the morning test which nostril is blocked and breathe from it a quick remedy to anxiety or a depression surge you can try it now if you want the force that you use to breathe from a block nostril gets the heart pumping enough to create a momentary sense of ease which gets you out of the repercussions on your body because of your negative thought loop if that doesn't work then touch your heart or have another person do it for you you know engage your heartbeat and through slow breathing allow it to slow down this is an age-old trick my father's been telling me since forever and i only recently got the logic of it talk about learning disabilities if you're walking on the street and your heart sinks even more because of a strange weird thought again breathe just like i just explained when you wake up in the morning do some exercises sit inside then or just sit for 20 minutes and breathe that's what i do every single day or i try to the whole thing sounds funny now but it wasn't back then i had been broken several times once at the point that i was a millimeter closed to call liquids i have failed and fallen so many times now that i can almost anticipate the next crash and prepare for it if you stay calm be mindful take a step back and just observe you can see how it all adds up ladies gentlemen and gentlemen today i have made public a very personal part of my life and parts of it for the first time i've ever spoken about out loud hoping that my struggles and challenges will motivate you to look at the glass half empty and see it as a glass half empty and half full life is not just one or the other it's an equal dose of both risk and reward pain and pleasure rain and sunshine it just depends on where we focus on more courage is the only thing that we have that can keep us alive not only that it helps us stay alive but it allows us to thrive stop for a second and choose to listen to the soft mama in your head that says i want listen harder and hear it say again i want more don't stop wanting to be better to live better because if i can do it so can you be brave thank you you ,False,False,True,False
