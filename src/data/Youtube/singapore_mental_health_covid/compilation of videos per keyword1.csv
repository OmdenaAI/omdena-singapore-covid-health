AIB_pFuSfpQ,COVID-19: Singapore authorities on how the mental health of migrant workers is being looked after,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2020-08-06T11:32:40Z,How are the mental health needs of migrant workers living in Singapore's dormitories being looked after? MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak ...,uh so my question is about the number of uh recent suicide and attempted suicide incidents involving workers living in dormitories right um so my questions uh are what uh you know what is the mts assessment of the anxiety and unhappiness of workers especially those in more badly affected dorms and how had their welfare been looked after mentally and also whether is mental health increasingly an area that the mtf is looking into by formulating a more comprehensive plan to address these budding issues thank you thank you very much for the question we're indeed concerned about the fact that our migrant workers have been accommodated in in facilities uh under vetted regimes they have not been allowed to come out of the dormitories into the community freely and that prolonged period of isolation will obviously have potential adverse effects on any individual not just the micro workers but anyone who in fact has to be cooped up in isolation with very limited opportunities for social interaction so this is a concern for us the in inter-agency task force working with mom and various private stakeholders partners have in fact been looking at how to support the welfare of these migrant workers in a variety of different ways they've taken pains to help the migrant workers to celebrate holidays to make their stay within the lockdown dormitories as meaningful as is possible albeit within the the lockdown regime that they are in they've also offered help through a variety of ways with an opportunity for them to call in hotlines for help there are staff that come down and encourage workers to step forward if necessary for counselling so mental health has been a concern for that particular task force for quite a while ever since they started work in the dormitories we continue to work on this piece and they have the task force has a work group looking very specifically at mental health issues and they have involved various partners across many domains including counselors social workers psychiatrists psychologists to see how to better improve the support that can be provided to men uh to migrant workers in this regard uh the uh we are aware also of incidence of self-harm or attempted self-harm through suicide in some of the individuals in the dormitories this is a cause of concern and task force continues to look at it to see how to reach out to support migrant workers who have a needs uh uh that have to be addressed in this regard uh and they're looking at ways to to reach out and support them further uh this continues to be a work in progress so i i do not pretend that that work is completed that we have a very comprehensive system of support but the task force is committed to making sure that the mental health needs of the migrant workers uh are looked into supported not just now but there is a sustainable framework that would continue in the dormitories even after the outbreak is comes under control within the dormitories ,True,True,True,True
QShkVkVOlzs,Living with anxiety during Covid-19,UC4p_I9eiRewn2KoU-nawrDg,The Straits Times,2020-10-10T15:48:14Z,Four Singaporeans share how Covid-19 had an impact on their mental health and how they are coping with the uncertainties that come with the pandemic.,i graduated just thrusted into like the working world as quick as possible and you just keep fixating on something that you can't solve not knowing how secure your job is at this point in time is very scary waking up on days just feeling like there are too many problems to tackle and that was not something that i had ever felt before in my life [Music] even with all the stipends that's been being given by the government you're being told by your parents that it's not enough and that like eventually your savings might run out everywhere else is telling you that like oh yeah stay calm like it's a pandemic you shouldn't be too hard on yourself but the reality is is that there's that pressure that you need to get a job as quick as possible like get back that stability that has been taken away from you sort of start feeling like you're caged and trapped and the feeling can often be that there are very little options for you to take and very little control that you have over your own life there were a couple of days where i had a few breakdowns and that's when i realized hey maybe this is something that needs to be addressed and i actually went and reached out to a counselor i would not be able to like do my work properly like i would get tired whilst doing my work halfway so i think that's when i decided okay i need to get help so when you talk about mental disorder we're talking about the scenario where the individual is having difficulties functioning he or she will need some professional help to get back on track so without that help right he cannot snap out of it by himself of course then there will be those who are not to the point of a disorder so what that signifies is that the brain has not gone into a fixed state in those circumstances sometimes they may be able to self-help in order to get their anxiety better [Music] i think once i was able to spot these things happening i knew what i had to do i knew what steps i had to take it's definitely not easy even it's the second time around but just slowly getting out of bed brushing your teeth making yourself a nice meal like that's the small things you do to really get through the day you just feel worried all the time like it's constantly at the back of your head thankfully for me i have close friends and families who i can just go to them and tell them what i'm feeling or what i'm going through i usually just take it in take a deep breath and just try to put things into perspective certain things are just beyond our control and what we can do is to just move forward [Music] i think the more i'm open about it the more i can try to normalize these kind of conversations and i'd rather that people feel safe approaching me because i would love to help them i try to talk about it as much as i can because it's perfectly normal for you to go to visit and i want people to know that they're not alone in this [Music] of course the older generation they would tell their younger folks to just you know snap above it and many times the younger folks do feel quite frustrated with that approach best way to go forward really is to have a very open conversation to try to educate their parents or their seniors in the family mental health is really a lot like physical health one is being able to be comfortable opening up to someone but the second is also recognize that hey i need help [Music] [Music] you ,True,True,True,True

university in asia elena a very warm welcome to you without further ado let me hand over to elena today elena over to you thank you very much christina really nice of you to kick start this important event and i'll welcome everyone disability is high on the diversity agenda and um it's for many companies health is one of the highest causes of disability in the world today and it causes companies billions of losses each year due to employee absenteeism lack of productivity and innovation the world health organization estimates that 10 of the global population suffers from some form of mental illness which means it's one of four of us is affected unfortunately stigma and taboo surrounds in mental health making it a poorly understood topic across the world and asia is not an exception fear and traditional beliefs prevail preventing many that are impacted by mental health issues from reaching out and receiving help that they need not seeing the apparent demand and not knowing how best to approach the sensitive subject unfortunately few companies today are addressing this critical aspect of employee well-being in their organization so to get us started and to set up the scene i would like to ask professor funk to share with us the landscape of the mental uh health sector in singapore and some of the common mental health conditions but particularly those that are increased over the recent years thank you elena i hope everyone can hear me um and i my slides are up okay i'm just gonna start off give us some background to what's happening and perhaps uh then we could leverage uh and speak on mental health and mental illness now the impact of this pandemic on mental health firstly has caused a lot of concerns because there's ex expression of the increased prevalence of illnesses and problems associated with economic recession job loss even family violence and abusive behaviors in lockdowns where people are kept at home at the same time there's concern that people because of that isolation may uh if they were emotionally unstable resorts to three sides this actually is data that uh we have in our institute looking at patients that we take care for at this point i don't think suicides are on the rise but suddenly we are monitoring the numbers and that's of concern at the same time uh the very providers of healthcare that are looking after our population are under tremendous amount of stress because this is a new virus we do not know how it works and what are the implications on life in general and there are risks and fears that people have so in fact in the study between singapore and india we compared the groups interestingly in india um you know depression and anxiety is slightly higher than uh in singapore where post-traumatic stress disorder was significant and i know it's a busy slide just just take my word for it it's quite significant and it's it's of concern uh certainly for us because workers if they are not able to manage themselves and uh suffering from some degree of stress would not be able to function and and truly in this study they actually showed that there's a higher um complaints of things like headaches throat pain apart from the the usual emotional aspects of insomnia tightness and lethargy and even anxiety alongside this process is what's happening in the world uh i had a quick scan of the literature this is a couple of studies one is in china where it looked at people returning to work well 10.8 percent of respondents suffered from ptsd or post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to work but returning to work did not actually cause an increase in psychiatric symptoms that means illness itself or mental illness didn't arise i'll talk to this a little bit later more executives are practicing hand hygiene and more workers avoided sharing utensils which is a good thing infection control measures were in place in fact another study this one looked at what's the real stress behind all of this it's actually financial stress this is the primary mediator for emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes so these are important points so what has happened since the pandemic the old normal this is what's happening in our hospitals number of admissions the hospital has been moderated the outpatient clinics the specialist uh outpatient clinics people were not coming forward as much emergencies were coming down because there was fear in the air this was in healthcare outside of healthcare i mean what our old normal was really meeting up and and um getting together in meetings and having collaborative face-to-face meetings had to change in fact digitalization working from home home-based learning for children and telly everything i mean we're having a webinar right which we would have been unheard of but we have a meeting in a room with lots of people it's changed it's changed the way we provided healthcare it's changed the way we've worked in our offices and and zoom is very well known i've used zoom so many times in the last i'm kind of over zoomed actually and it's a it's it's not a good thing so what is the mental health approach we have to take in this context first i want to talk a little bit about mental health because it's an area that is quite important and sometimes poorly understood now in the population and providers like myself as doctors and clinicians we are one end of what i call a pyramid the other are patients people who already have mental illnesses now mental health affects the general population what is mental health mental health is not merely an absence of illness it's actually a very overarching well-being concern now very often we are well we'd like to think that majority of us don't have much stress but some of us do and when stress increases we start to have this stress and we start to have problems these are mental health related issues on the other hand mental illness is slightly different this is a biological problem it's not a reaction to stress this very often have genetic um and and brain related abnormalities and they have to be treated by professionals that is about i think christina said or is it elena who said one and four i think in singapore the data is about less than one in one in five but um but it depends on where you do the prevalence studies and of course in mental illness there's mild illness and moderate illness and severe illness here in the institute of mental health we deal with mostly the moderate to severe illness so the percentage is much lower now what this slide actually shows is that there is you can have mental illness and you can have mental health issues they are not necessarily on the same dimension but they're in the same pyramid and severe mental health problems doesn't necessarily translate into mental illness the other piece of course is you can have a mental illness and be still in good mental health that means you are happy with your life your illness is under control very much like someone with diabetes or hypertension you're on treatment you're fine so it's important to understand the role of stress in this this is just a singapore mental health study looking at figures so one in seven is a lot lower than the one in four but that's our local data in singapore now what can we do what are the kind of services that are needed for our patients people with mental illness i think now because of infection control measures we need technology to enable the management uh and for um in the hospitals i think trying to manage trauma is important because post-traumatic stress disorder is very much associated with what's going on in and everyone's scared and frightened and fearful um and then of course there is the possible mental illnesses that may result from covet what we know of covet 19 is that we think it's a respiratory disorder actually it's an autoimmune it's a immune response disorder that causes an inflammatory process that can occur in the brain as well you're not sure on the mental health side of things there is need to provide firstly some guidance on health and how to seek help i think some of the other speakers on the panel will speak more on this but i just you know broadly say there needs to be both live support which is synchronous and asynchronous information needs to be available for the public so they know where to get help and what to do when they are in distress at the same time in the longer term i think there is importance to first train mental health professionals and even general health professionals to manage mental illnesses in general and reduce the stigma for the population at large psychological first aid and mental health literacy to understand mental health concerns do not necessarily translate the mental illness and what are mental illnesses in the first place to really manage issues like anxiety and depression as a whole in the workplace most of the issues are not around mental illness it is around mental health how do you manage stress because now there's a lot of changes in work processes working from home economic recession job loss social distancing and isolation is not a good thing if you don't meet your co-workers how would you feel as a team so you need to be able to manage emotions have coping strategies social support and social linkages within the workplace that's important how can you do that can you respect the safety dignity and rights of individuals but adapt and consider cultural aspects particularly in this part of the world be aware of infection control how to look after yourself and when to seek help when that is needed i went a little fast because i want to complete within the 10 minutes and i'm kind of done uh as an introduction to how we can support the workforce thank you very much i'm gonna stop the sharing thank you very much professor thank you um so what i'm recollecting is that um public and organizational education um has created an awareness around mental health and uh we can indeed uh go and find lots of information online and that's good because more understanding will facilitate our empathy and open-mindedness furthermore compassionate and compassionate communication could help those affected by mental health and bring them closer to those that can help so with that i'm turning to leanne a question to you are you seeing more people seeking help for mental health conditions and especially during circuit breaker how have the npos and charities been supporting its clients and beneficiaries uh especially during this period over to you hello everybody good afternoon i'm leanne from singapore association for mental health uh i'm happy to be with you here today to share a little bit uh on what we observe on the ground as a social service uh provider uh for mental health services um during this uh whole period of covic and circuit breaker we like many corporates um from the social service side actually do seek a lot of happenings in that sense to people uh and about their everyday uh daily life and their work life uh the experience they go mental health issues that come up as a result um simple association for mental health actually uh we have 10 services we started operation in 1968 and we have always been focusing on promoting mental wellness for all and our services range from community engagement education raising awareness about mental health issues to providing creative services to help people to manage their anxiety promote mental wellness and more importantly we also have rehabilitation services where we support people in recovery of mental illness so uh just uh to contextualize um some of the things that um daniel had shared um we all know that from the last 2016 survey one in seven um singaporean here would actually experience a mental health condition in their lifetime and um from a psychosocial perspective um we look at mental health as a continuum and um daniel has said that um being uh men having a mental illness does not necessarily mean that people have poor mental health and actually uh not having a mental illness does not also mean that we have uh good mental well-being so uh when we look at it uh from uh continuum uh at different point we could be experiencing a different kind of um feelings and emotional well-being on the green side on the healthy side we could be happy uh generally very satisfied with life and um meeting our aspiration and emotionally more balanced but sometimes when trouble takes place or stresses come in we could be in the yellow and the amber zone where we actually um our life can be a bit disturbed and there's more anxiety and we may not sleep well uh i'm sure you you can actually some of you may identify may be able to identify some of the symptoms that come about and uh it really depends on our coping strategies and uh how can we build our own resilience towards uh managing ourselves back to the green state yeah and if if um we move along and we don't take care of ourselves well and um do not know where are the resources to support us uh we can go into the raid state where we actually can become sick physically we can have very destructive lifestyle we cannot be functioning very well in our activity of daily living so that is a time of concern so uh in in this whole continuum um there are scales for us to actually uh look at where we are and often time um from our social service experience um we we we don't have a medical treatment so we we do a lot of psychosocial intervention uh to support people uh so this this are some of the ways we we help people understand um that um we need to take care of our mental well-being right um during this whole period um before we actually went into circuit breaker um we are already in dos corn orange in late february and um all the social service agencies uh in fact uh have to come up with our business continuity plan and uh we were already planning and uh to go into split team uh and in fact for singapore association for mental health we started uh going on trial speed team just before um circuit breaker kicks in on 7th of uh april and what happened was um it although we have plans we have preparation uh we had a lot of meetings discussion and preparation with staff uh actually we were quite affected by this uh circuit breaker the first phase because um the instruction is all services have to close except for um very very frontline services like uh residential homes so out of our tent service we only have one service that can fully remain open 24 7. that is our group home in bukit batu where we run a residential service for people in recovery so all the other nice services we have to immediately plan how to provide continually provide our service to our beneficiaries and community through remote means so it was very challenging for us because um we do not have all the hardware support at those in the initial juncture and uh when we acquire the hardware we may we do not have all the apps and software and it took us a while to get out the subscription of all this zoom and way backs up so and what happened was uh the instruction was very clear that due to the protective measure and uh uh safe distancing measures uh there's no way we could see clients and uh we have to actually uh refer services to uh other frontline that are allowed to or considered um white listed agencies uh that can actually visit cases so it was very tough and um what what happened was uh subsequently there was a reverse i would say not maybe not a reverse decision but uh moh has taken into consideration the feedback and um there was a um a new um advisory that allowed with exemption uh some exemption to some services so we managed to uh get some exemption and some of our services are listed as whitelisted agency and uh we could provide minimum on on-site support to our service recipient so our counseling services we could actually let some of our staff with minimum staffing go back to the center and we are able to see some high risk cases during those period yeah so during clear spirit uh even as we as a service provider try to adapt and change to using virtual means to provide consultations as well as sessions and activities with our service recipients um not all our service user could actually benefit from the remote services mainly we take it for granted that uh while we are ready you know people at the other end should be able to actually um enjoy what they usually enjoy during the on-site support uh but many of our clients actually do not have the hardware and they can't afford to do subscription um so we actually also face that challenge with with our clients who we want to support and also there are clients and beneficiaries who prefer not to do all this virtual um link up with us because their home environment is not suitable they are home condition and home buyer environment is not super and some of them are not used to this kind of arrangements where they felt that their privacy can be compromised especially if they have to do it in their house and there's not enough space and private space for them to do so so um so there is quite a lot of adjustment that we have to do um so we resort a lot to telephonic support and declines right okay just just a bit on what is seen on the ground which actually could be mirrored in in the survey national survey that uh carried out um one of the market survey company actually uh can show their survey results uh and i think it was published in the press and that uh actually a quarter one in four uh respondents actually expressed their that they are their mental health is not so good and uh one of our our partners uh silver ribbon they also carried out a survey of 500 over respondents and anxiety and mood issues also surface as a concern um uh i think everybody is also aware there's this national care hotline that was um launched uh on 10th of um april uh so shortly after the launch uh towards the end of the month uh in early may they have released this report to show that uh actually within a short span of time there is 6600 calls and out of this 6600 calls 40 percent actually uh need more support and uh these calls are diverted to uh social service agencies and other um community support agencies that provide more dedicated support to people with mental health worries and concerns um scss also have a chat board called bell the chat and they also see an increase during this period circuit breaker period of people assessing the web to to actually ask questions and seek help so i think it is also consistent that mutually people raise concern and have said that they are stressed and anxious and they need emotional support just coming back to our own uh singapore association for mental health our own service uh our counseling service has a toll-free helpline where our counselors um pick up calls from anybody in the community during this period between april to june uh compared to the same period in 2019 we have a 50 percent increase in callers and uh among the the callers that uh new callers uh we actually see almost 40 of um callers in the age band of 21 to 40 years old um this is pretty telling about the situation on the ground in that this would be the group of people who possibly are working adults and uh because of having to work from home uh because of the movement restriction um they have actually suffered more mental health concerns and um what surface is also 25 about 25 of them actually express or they are depressed they have an anxiety and mood issues uh very stressed during this period um and also they have also raised issues about relationship for example uh one of the caller actually said that during this period is very stressful and she wants to break up with her boyfriend and also family issues came up we have callers who call that they they um having a lot of conflict because of everybody being at home uh and um they are also those callers who are worried about their family members or friends who are expressing depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation and um the callers who are caregivers caregivers who are during this period is very stressed because um they are unable to send their children to child care nor are they able to send their seniors to day care centers for their rehab so it's elena i need to a little bit cut you um someone asked is there a phone number that you could share where um you know where people can call and probably we need another 20 seconds to close your section sure all right i will uh show some numbers and resources at the last slide okay so so i i think we are all aware that we all play uh wear many hats and now we are at the same time uh stressed with having to adapt to the challenges and move towards a a more um adaptive new normal uh so i'm just sharing i have two more slides just sharing some resources for employees uh and as well as for employers um tafette has some some guidelines on how we can actually uh be more mindful of our mental health concerns and issues and support employees throughout this period and there's also a workplace well-being work group comprising national bodies as well as uh corporates and uh jeffrey myset is also one of the company who is a part of this work group they have come up with an e-guide on managing the organizations and working with employees throughout this period smh has also partnered a corporate chancellor and we come up with a infographic and we have posted in our social media uh to share with people how actually this whole period of stress actually actually is a very good learning experience and we can turn it to very positive development for our own um mental well-being and we can become more resilient over time and um my last like is really to show um this is not exhaustive but these are some of the possible places where you can contact or your employee can contact uh if they need support yeah thank you very much it's really it's really pleasant to hear that many progressive organizations took the chance of corvette which is unfortunate chance yes uh they showed their resilience and uh showed a really good ways to advocate for those uh who need help and dispelling of the of their um issues around the topic and you've mentioned jeffrey which brings me amazingly well to uh to our next speaker jeffrey i know that you devote yourself patiently to supporting this big course and i know that you have a daytime job and uh sort of a another job of working for with the charity mindset that jardine set up please share with us how you've been supporting the mental health community and what what advices can you give to smes great uh can you hear me and hopefully you can be able to see my screen as well okay now not yet not yet i'm not sure why it's not coming through uh but it's okay let me try and see if i can share that once again there you go and is that coming true yes okay great thank you very much for your time and for inviting um mindset and myself to this i think you've heard from uh from daniel and from lian maybe just a little bit of background on mindset before i jump to the last couple of slides so mindset is the charity that the judy madison group has established about nine years ago and you're probably wondering why mental health when we started in 2011 this was a totally un interesting underserved area you would find a lot of charities focus on health on physical health on disabilities on children on education but nobody wanted to talk about mental wellness or mental health because it was a very taboo area to be a part of but not talking about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and so one of the things that group has started out over the last nine ten years is to be able to try and raise awareness about mental health mental wellness and to be able to talk about it for those of you who are not familiar with mindset well these are the constituent businesses of the group in singapore and i'm sure some of them would be quite familiar with you you know from the genki sushis to the starbucks the cold storage hong kong land and mandarin oriental this is all part of the group that is behind mindset in the jardins group itself we've been recognized for our efforts over the years and we've been encouraged by this what's our focus our focus really is trying to do good and to be able to recognize that this is a journey we don't do it alone obviously we do it with our partners and co-collaborators um two of them are with me today dr daniel fong of course and and lee yen from samh and you'll find that there has been a growing awareness and a environment where more people are aware of this and are willing to come alongside and be a part of it so we don't do this alone we do this with all our social service agency partners and if you think about mindset as an organization it's actually only made up of two full-time employees everyone else who is involved in this effort is actually a volunteer or has got a daytime job doing something else like myself um how do we do this we do this by way of what we call jardine ambassadors so every year we've got 40 individuals who come alongside spend two years of their life to be a part of this venture and to be able to walk alongside with the activities that they have what are the activities awareness outreach getting people back into the workforce and this is important because part of this inclusiveness is to be able to get and accept people who may be suffering from mental health issues to be accepted within the workplace and that i think just adds to this whole thing about how do we have an inclusive community as a whole social enterprise and fundraising um again this chart shows apart from the numbers that have been contributed to our effort are the other partners you know from digital mindset to singapore association mental health institute of mental health i just wanted to highlight two particular flagship projects that we have launched in the last nine years the first is with the singapore citizen mental health called mindset learning hub happens about raising the importance of the workplace environment and how if you're a mental health person in recovery how important it is to be in a work environment because that gives you a sense of attachment belonging to be part of a local community and it adds towards your self-worth in terms of building that environment for for persons in recovery the other one which we embarked on last year is kind of interesting uh it's with touch community services and this focus is on pathological gaming but it also talks about addiction to the internet and all things internet and it's kind of interesting because if you think about the last couple of months um i for one have been totally addicted to the internet i i am walking through that addiction right now and participating on a daily basis whether it's a webex or a zoom or some form of video conference that i'm on um and and i think this is going to be in my in our view a growing area that we'll have to address as we go back into that new normal of how to be able to regulate between the internet virtual world and the real physical world itself um i i think it would be an interesting challenge for us as we make that transition this is the one chart that i i think if you forget about all the other charts that i've talked about hopefully it will stay with you and what i would call the four is um as employers i i think it's important for us to be able to set the tone of awareness if you are an employee you would not think twice about saying physical safety in the workplace is important and you need to be able to have a place where your employees come in and will not leave injured because you have got poor processes but i think the fundamental shift needs to be not just a physical safe workplace but also a supportive workplace that accepts and supports good mental health practices and mental wellness and and as lien and says there's a group of employers have come together in the last couple of years called work well uh there is a e-guide that you know helps with steps is how you can be able to do this at the workplace and again one thing that i like to highlight is that it is not as daunting as it looks to be able to take that first step because i i think today we do have that support structure that's out there and and well this is one the second a that i would like to highlight is what i call acceptance because when you talk about mental health issues oftentimes people tend to light up their eyes when you talk to somebody about mental health challenge that you have but it's not lighting up to help it's lighting up to step away because immediately you have got that stigma that comes around and say oh maybe you're not quite that okay and if you're not quite that okay maybe i should not be associating with you or if i leave a label with you then i look at you in a very different perspective altogether and i think in hopefully over the last uh a couple of months of this corporate pandemic you know it's been able to show that none of us are immune from the stresses and none of us are immune from some of this mental health challenges that we may have whether it's stress at work for working from home over the last couple of months on not being able to separate our personal lives from our work lives um activities i think it's important as employers in the employment and environment to be able to talk about this to promote this and to be able to address uh stress management um i like to particularly highlight self-care here and i put down there especially for leaders why do i say that because oftentimes as managers and leaders in the work environment we don't tend to take a like a superhero persona and say of course i can manage this of course i can deal with this but i think it's also important for us as leaders of the groups that we manage in the workplace to recognize that we've had to first take care of ourselves before we can take off somebody else and and it reminds me that you know not that long ago we used to have this activity called flying on an airplane if you recall that before kovit came around and and and one of the things that they'll tell you is that you know if we have a decompression and the air mass were to fall down help yourself first as the adult before you can be able to help your children or somebody else and i think that's a good reminder that we have to take care of our own mental health wealth being as well and and then finally the last a would be assistance i i think that as it's not just the social service agencies have recognized the government has recognized and so there is formal support mechanisms that's out there that we as in the work environment can be able to point out colleagues and team members too lien has shared some of that mind line is one that was just introduced not that long ago by the government and i think they are certainly tools and help that's available so from from that perspective i would just encourage everybody to think about the workplace in in this perspective and with this mindset of the four ways of awareness of acceptance of activities and of assistance uh yeah so those are the points that i i wanted to highlight and uh happy to take any questions thank oh you thank you jeffrey you can mute yourself um really very interesting i didn't realize we have so many things in common like addiction to internet and um so as a small question small follower question for you that came so um for a while we have been imagining what technologies could do for our future and today we are bombarded with information and a new term that we are hearing is digizofrenia and it's said to be linked very heavily with mental health could you comment on uh probably the biggest influencer of the modern day mental health issues i i think it's a it's a question of trying to segregate work life balance and and daniel and bm can be able to talk to that technology is supposed to serve us and to be able to give us a lot more time to serve our own personal needs i think there's been a conflating and the bleeding of our personal lives in our work life and the technology that's supposed to help us i think is also starting if i can use that a strong word starting to hurt us and harm us and i think the only way that we should respond to it is to respond with a a a discipline as it were in terms of trying to define time that we would have for ourselves as opposed to things just circle on i don't have a commute now from the office from the home to the office which used to be about 15 minutes where i could have a down time listen to music and clear my head whether it's going to the office or coming back now my commute is from my bedroom to my study which is less than 30 seconds so how do i replace that to be able to get myself re-centered i i think it's important so those are some of my thoughts lovely thank you and thank you for highlighting the importance of creating environment and organization that promotes awareness of mental health and again that again brings very well to um rebecca and before i ask you a question can i just remind everyone to please uh continue populating q and a's uh we will try to address them as after after rebecca spoke and rebecca turning to you so if you could share how your company pwc has helped employees to navigate through this unprecedented times in fact i think the word unprecedent has been reported by google as the most uh searched word for the last half a year thanks elena um just checking so can you see my can here can see okay perfect i just put it on the screen okay great so um i was given the room of two slides so i've tried to pack it all into two but so forgive me um so i think just to understand how companies in general but pwc specifically have dealt with what's going on in the last six months um it was usual to look at kind of our well-being journey over the last year or so and where we were pre-covered um because that's also when we look at this it's important to look at you know where we're going to be when we emerge out of this as well so um i think for us really first of all looking at you know what is the state of mental health in the workplace in singapore the the business case is very well established for investing in employee mental health um in singapore the ncss study showed 5.6 times return on investment for investing in employment health in the workplace so but i think that's something that's not really been internalized necessarily by the business community here um as much as it could be um the message that it's not just a nice thing to do it actually makes business sense um so when we talk about mental health in the workplace um you know the 2019 study in singapore showed 92 of the workforce in singapore are stressed um but more importantly 12 percent said that they had an unmanageable level of stress so there's about risk of burnout and and this 92 is above the oecd average so in general not so singapore workforce were more stressed before you came in jacob than than the average and so that's kind of the backdrop that you start on but um as we were saying it's not just there's kind of the mental health um whether you have distress or a problem but there's also the clinical side so with one in seven people experiencing a clinical mental health condition uh not just distress during their lifetime and actually most most studies show it's about three quarters um have an onset by your mid-20s so that means that by the time you're in the workforce the likelihood you know that that a significant number of us are living with either mental health distress or actual full-blown mental illness it's actually very commonplace in the workforce and we just don't talk about it so it's not an other people's problem it's actually it's an everybody's problem um so what does that mean for pwc well uh so globally we have what's called be well work well which is kind of our framework for for well-being in the workplace which really focuses on four aspects of personal well-being so your physical health your mental health and then emotional and spiritual aspects but we looked about a year ago and said how do we really uh localize this and make this relevant in terms of the maturity of you know in singapore and we really wanted to acknowledge that workplace mental health is a two-way street so you have your obviously individual mental health affects the business right because um it affects engagement performance absenteeism presenteeism retention you know all of those things um but also work is a huge part of our lives particularly here i mean people work extremely long hours um and there's often a huge link between uh a huge amount of kind of um your identity and sense of purpose and sense of um of yourself that's very linked to to work and so uh what you do at work doesn't stay at work it also affects you at home and so it's a hugely important factor you're kind of what we call professional well-being is a huge factor in your overall mental health and well-being so that's why we have them kind of interplay of the two together so yeah so we look at it as both you're as as a as an organization but also as an individual you're responsible for your professional and your personal well-being and they're intrinsically linked so i think many of you may have heard before the daniel pink framework where he would talk about you know autonomy mastery and purpose well when we talk about professional well-being it's sort of similar we talk about you know your growth journey so for us that's is what you're doing um do you do you feel that what you're doing is is part of a longer career does it fit into your goals and aspirations and that's that kind of sense of purpose in what you're doing and are you getting kind of progression then really um the learning and skills so are you getting skills to get better at what you're doing are you really mastering something and feel that you are you know an expert in a topic and then the the huge part about you know the work culture and environment that has a huge um effect in terms of belonging so do you feel heard and valued but also do you have the tools that sort of enable you to do your work so all of those aspects really um on a pre-code on a normal situation or very uh have a very big link to your your mental health and the the employees responsibility to that so for us well being really um including managing your mental health it's not just a soft skill and a nice to have the the clear message from us is like it's a critical business skill to maintain your performance and engagement so that's also why we're part of that as i mentioned earlier the work world leaders work group and we hosted in last year the first ceo dialogue on mental health to really make sure that um you know this is a strategic priority that's been dealt with at a c-suite level so um you know in terms of the challenges we already touched on them before so stigma is a huge issue so we did the you know the beyond the label campaign internally um and we had an internal campaign last year where we had our leaders uh do a video where they were really saying why mental health is important to them and role modeling and saying and making a pledge and explaining like this is personally what i do to invest in my mental health um which was great but then we sort of realized realized that having asked everyone to pledge to talk about mental health the actual level of mental health literacy was too low to do that people don't have the basic uh understanding and language to be able to talk about mental health or mental illness so since then we really worked on increasing that mental health literacy um through trainings awareness and things like that um including doing a training for all of our uh front sort of front end um hr staff and some of our leadership so it was a full full day training on mental health mental illness and what that means in the workplace so that they're equipped to be able to actually deal with situations when they come up but then the other thing i think is around culture so [Music] the the type of organization we are and i think also in singapore in general there's really a kind of stress as a badge of honor kind of culture that means that um working unsustainably is kind of rewarded um and that's really seen as a you know that's a success that's a a great thing if you're sort of working yourself until you can you can barely function so how do we get around that um that aspect of it so you know places to start as an organization so you know as i said we started with a lot of awareness stuff but then it's really about leadership setting it as a priority so you'll hear a lot i hear a lot you know i don't have time i don't have time to invest in my own mental health and well-being but what that's really saying is i haven't made it a priority because we all have the same amount of time it's just that you're allocating your time based on the priorities and if it's not set as a priority you're not going to give time to it um so that's one thing where leadership's really important to set it as as a as a priority and then role model that so um yeah as i said we also did you know full day training for our leadership in our hr frontline staff um but then really you have to support it with policies so make it official so we've got you know flexible medical leave we've got which you can take a sort of mental health phase we've got insurance coverage that covers mental health and we have our employee assistance program and things like that but also practical tools so i was involved as i said the wellness guide from the work work world that um lee jan mentioned but also we have a mental health manager's tool kit and things like that so but fundamentally if you don't embed it embed mental health and well-being into how you recognize performance it's never going to be a priority so we've now just launched a revised professional development framework which builds um into our whole leadership portion we've really built how you manage your own well-being and how for more senior grades how you manage the well-being of your team um is actually one of the attributes that's measured in terms of your performance um and your yeah and so that's and your progression so that's that's um that was sort of where it was at pre-covered uh and then obviously uh covered 19 happened um and we've already touched you know the others have already touched on how this um affects your affects individuals and the workplace in different ways but i think many of you might have seen that meme that came out which was like what has advanced the digital transformation agenda in your organization more your ceo your chief digital officer or kobit um and the answers obviously covered 19 as we all went digital but i think that that also stands for mental health um because having been um it's really pushing the agenda to talk about mental health in the workplace um it's a for a long time suddenly there is a conversation that's happening um kind of naturally sort of opened up pandora's box really and even small things like on call you know ending calls with people and they'll say you know stay safe stay sane and you know for all that you know it's it's trite but it does mean that people are really acknowledging that there are physical impacts but also mental and emotional impacts of what's going on right now um and that they're that's something that's coming into the into the workplace sorry this alarm going off oh rebecca that fits really well with your timing and i need to kind of we're coming close to kind of an hour so do you want to close in with the next sort of a 20 seconds sort of on the key message and i think you're actually there's a question from cara sort of anything you're answering just nicely and uh if you could help me to round up your your slide sorry what was the question um i will read the question i think you did answer that but um i love the term step in not step away but a lot of managers don't know how to step in and know what to say when an employee opens up do you have any practical tips on how best to respond so actually that's something um that yeah so i was gonna get you so obviously the individual part of this in terms of you know resilience but really the critical part is getting managers and leaders it's that middle part because if you don't bridge what you're doing as an organization to through managers to the actual people it's it's there's a real gap there so that's one thing that we have had a lot of questions on so we're already working on it but essentially now instead of me going to people they come to me to ask so we've had some sessions on how to approach these conversations um where with someone who is showing signs of distress or who's actually come to you to disclose that they're really struggling or have a mental uh or facing mental illness as a coach or a manager so the the key message there is really on listening to understand not listening to reply or to give advice um and that you know and empathy is really key and also acknowledging you know we're equipping managers to have a conversation where they're listening with empathy and then can refer people to the right to the right sources of help you you're not expecting all of don't expect your managers or don't expect an individual to be able to counsel someone you're not you know beware you're not a psychologist you're not a counselor you're not a you're not a trained doctor um but what you can do is make sure that they it's around that psychological safety aspect that they really feel comfortable to voice their concerns and feel that you're listening to them and want to get to a better outcome and then you can on their behalf find find where to go next but really um the key there is really just listening to understand thank you so much rebecca i really appreciate and um um i know we're running out of time i wanted to address one of the questions and uh i know jeffrey you wanted to uh to to answer it we have a question from yvonne that would like to know how one can participate in the mindset jardin ambassador program thank you very much um the program right now is within the group itself and we've been talking amongst the x-com as to how we can be able to extend that outside of the group but i think i've sent a response to whoever was asking that question i think was nora my email please feel free to reach out and i think we can continue that conversation as to how we could get you involved thank you there is one question before i pass to uh to andrew and this question also from ewan and if possible uh dr fung would you like to take this question i'm thankful for the panelists sharing while what is the percentage of the employers in singapore that really care of aware of the importance of the mental health at workplace where most company hr hardly mention about it from my understanding that's a difficult question like i'm not aware of how companies look at this um but my own point is uh i think it's important to have not just engage employees and and workers in the in the companies but um employees uh and uh um workers who feel that um they are being um they are doing something that they enjoy you know it's almost like uh in healthcare we started this movement called joy in work and the reason was that uh in in at least in healthcare organizations there was an over emphasis on getting things done uh and not remembering the people the providers of the service that that needed support for themselves so i think trying to find joy in work is probably quite uh critical for overall well-being and that's that's something that i i hope that every employer would think about you well that concludes our event and i really would like to thank all the presenters and we could hear all the passion uh in the room and before we close off um if i may go to andrew um for to close off the event andrew uh chairs the dni committee of uh british chamber elena thank you and thank you to all the panelists i thought that was a fantastic and really fascinating discussion so thank you to all um for for taking the time to talk to our members about this very important topic um for me some of the takeaways i took from the discussion um i think the difference between mental health mental illness is very interesting and very important for us all to be aware of and i think we've all got a role as as business operators in the singapore community um we all have a role in protecting our employees in in in really looking after employees um but it's also interesting that the healthcare industry is is highly involved and charities are also very involved and there's clearly some some very good resources out there that we can use um to to really support our employees during this period and also i thought it was fascinating to hear some of the best practice initiatives um that the companies operating here in singapore are following and doing to support their employees and mental health was an area that has been highlighted by our members um as an area people would like more help in addressing and raising awareness so i think hearing from from companies on practical tips how to how to support your employees during this time is is really important so thank you both to to draw dean and pwc for for really giving us that overview of what you're doing um this is an area that the the diversity and inclusion committee are very focused on um it is an area that has got a lot of um interest from our members and we feel is important to to carry on this journey really to to improve the um the understanding and the awareness um of this issue uh going forward so you will see more um more initiatives from the dni committee going forward um but on that note i'd like to say a huge thank you thank you first to all our expert panelists um it really came across that you serious you are experts in your field and very good tangible advice that you gave to our members so so thank you to our panelists uh elena you're one of the the the members of britt trump you support us a lot in in a lot of our dna events so thank you as well for managing this discussion so well um and really helping

workers dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore are experiencing lower levels of anxiety and psychological ...,new research has found that health care workers dealing with the Cova 19 pandemic in Singapore are experiencing lower levels of anxiety in psychological distress when compared with previous outbreaks that could be due to increased mental preparedness following SARS for a closer look we're joined by associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma in the NUS a young rule in School of Medicine and by sociology professor Pauline strong from the Singapore Management University thank you both for joining us I will come to you first a pleasure Vijay how much correlation is there actually between increased mental preparedness and stringent infection control measures versus anxiety and psychological distress levels among healthcare workers you know it started from the South period when in 2003 we were attacked by us there were about 238 individuals which got infection and surprisingly 97 which makes about 41 percent of them were healthcare workers and the mortality at that time was 14 percent so there was a lesson to us and that prompted us that we should be prepared that something like this can hit us again so in the car you know I take it back like this that probably we were anticipating there's something like kovat 19 we'll be coming back again so since 2003 we had implemented an Hospital very strict infection control measures they were training programs for masks hand-washing and they were very frequently done almost like six monthly everybody has to undergo that kind of training so that prepared us so what happened the as soon as we got this Cove in 1900 at least our all health care workers they were immediately mentally prepared that we can jump into this war field and then we can battle it out definitely so this was actually this showed that we were mentally prepared now one important thing in this fighting you know such an outbreak like covert 19 is that we should have knowledge and we should have confidence so we were prepared with the knowledge because Hospital had prepared you know education programs there was a transparency we were updated on a daily basis what was the condition of it 19 how old 19 gets infected how people get infected how to prevent yourself from getting infected all these things they were in place so that prepared from knowledge point of view and confidence we were trained strongly and for a very long period how to fight infections how to be clean how to prepare ourselves for this infection probably that prepared us to fight this battle so we were both strong in another confidence as well as mentally preparedness from our experience so professors Vijay saying that then how is the situation here in Singapore compared with other parts of the world that are also struggling and you know dealing with cover 19 so I can talk about the healthcare workers so I I told you about the about a Singapore story but what happened outside there are very very few studies which are available on healthcare workers what is psychological impact of this illness whatever we have we have got a couple of studies one came up from Italy one came up from China and it was seen that almost all work health care workers they were having some kind of psychological impact and it was at least moderate in severity you know it is big it's to be taken in account that both these countries Italy as well as China they were massively hit the the you know the magnitude of impact of covenant infection was immense the Italian studies showed that about 10% of those who got the infection they were actually health care workers so this was such a heavy toll they will definitely be having much more psychological anxiety stress depression and all kind of emotional reactions which was seen in media you know from Italy and China they were probably reflection of the magnitude of the scale of this event and we know we know it that Europe and best they were never prepared for such kind of attacks they never have suffered these kind of attacks its Asia Africa which have been going through all these attacks in between you know the epidemics they keep coming so we were definitely mentally as well as physically as well as from resources point of view are definitely better prepared and professors drawn we're one week into the circuit breaker now and already some tightened measures have been kicked in as a result of some who've been so testing boundaries if you like based on what you've observed so far are people behaving in in a way that's sort of expected during a time like this office let me thank all our healthcare workers I think that they really deserve our admiration and praise and for keeping things in control so with regards to the general public right I think we had the opposite right Vijay said that the health care workers the professionals were prepared for for the next infectious disease you know attack and therefore when Kovac came they were already the lay public on the other hand we've been so safe in Singapore we have been so used to having you know a very peaceful life so this came as a big shock to us right and when the measures stepped in that we had to vary our normal everyday life it took the Singaporeans along the time to get used to it because I just don't understand at one lever you know that this disease is so infectious and at another lever it is also difficult to break from norm habits because we we have lived in the very very densely packed society we're used to rubbing you know elbows with each other so therefore if I'm not touching you that's already the social distance in my mind right so what more there's 1 meter 2 meter thing so I think we had to learn and I think the way Flender had laid out you know the rules as they're lay it on was quite remarkable it demonstrated to me and made me realize that it was a step by step calibrator approach and in every stance you know government had trust the Singaporeans you know to to abide by the boundaries and when we failed then most stringent rules had to be stepped in had to be Roden because we had to protect the vulnerable so I think that at the end of the day most Singaporeans okay obviously when you go out to the streets now it's very empty people are law-abiding no one is crowding you out in the supermarket or in the hawker centres and we're trying our best to to be good citizens and to do our part we hear of you know those who are you know who break the rules because for whatever reason but most of them I think most cases because they don't understand but by and large I think the community has pulled together this is certainly one of the better places to be in at this time in this global crisis I think all of us who live in Singapore are very grateful that we are here so or in oh I think we're doing what we're doing out our best we can do better and I'm sure in the weeks to come we will demonstrate that we will be able to do better okay well thank you both for speaking to us this evening associate professor Vijay Kumar Sharma from the NUS young Newland school of medicine and sociology professor Pauline stron from the Singapore Management University ,True,True,True,True

However, the official use of WhatsApp to ...",the amount of time spent getting updates on covert 19 is strongly linked to how anxious and stressed people feel however the official use of whatsapp to disseminate information appeared to reduce people's anxiety now that's according to a recent study by yale nus on news exposure during the pandemic which has researchers are saying that these findings are encouraging they could empower government agencies to develop innovative communication solutions that can perhaps help people cope during this crisis the study was conducted with 1145 residents here in singapore over eight weeks in march and april this year and for more we're joined by lead researcher assistant professor jean liu professor liu good evening and welcome good to talk to you this evening now though information seeking is encouraged during a pandemic you know we want we we want more information uh but the research has also shown that transparency promotes resilience your study found that the longer someone actually spends doing so the poorer his or her psychological health so why is that yeah that's a really interesting finding that research groups all over the world have been reporting so most people spend about half an hour to one hour getting covet 19 updates but about one or four people spend two hours or more and this seems to predict poor mental health there's a couple of reasons why this could happen first as the lauder of covet 19 news and rumors being shared the world health organization calls this an epidemic these are largely bad news as you might imagine so maybe reading about all these details makes you feel worse on the other hand maybe those people who are already depressed anxious or stressed may spend more time reading about covert 19 so the direction could really go in both directions were you surprised by the results you know are there other factors you think could have perhaps maybe contributed to what you found one thing that um um researchers picking up my paper have asked me is do you think uh the citizens trust in the government makes a difference um i think that is definitely a factor um that you know um the um uh you know our primary finding is that um over and above news uh news predicting um poor mental health taking updates and predicting poor mental health um using a whatsapp channel actually mitigates that risk so yeah perhaps people's trust in the messaging makes a difference so professor let's talk a little bit more about that whatsapp that official whatsapp channel because your research found that people trusted that more than traditional news sources like you know newspapers television like us and radio so can you explain the psychology behind that and and what what perhaps could that suggest for government agencies who might be responsible for information dissemination i'm speaking on channel news asia while i say this but um i think people still have a high level of trust in all the traditional sources so we asked participants to rate how much they trusted each source and radio newspapers tv all these had a rating of three out of four so it's very similar to the official golf.sg whatsapp channel you want to compare this to online forums like hardware zone or friends social media posts on the whole people rate this as much less trustworthy so i think the primary gist of our finding is that um people are saying that if the government makes an official statement they're likely to trust it but that said the nice thing about whatsapp is that you get the messages across very quickly and you can forward them very easily so perhaps this is a good way to counter the onslaught of fake news that is going around yeah well speaking of that your report also said that it's not too clear why the use of a whatsapp channel was linked with reduced depression symptoms but can we have a sense of what some of these potential contributing factors are yeah uh yeah we were very pleased to discover that you know um using an official whatsapp channel could buffer a person from depression and anxiety after you factor how much time the person spends getting covet 19 updates maybe this has to do with the info dammit again because with so much poor information out there getting timely and reliable updates through whatsapp maybe that could make a lot of difference professor lou people like glenda and myself we can't not know you know what's going on with covert 19 we need those updates because we're in the news but how can individuals perhaps balance you know news consumption better during the pandemic uh yes that's a very tricky one to balance for individuals i think the take home message of our research is that you need to look for reliable sources and you probably should spend less than two hours a day getting updates unless it's your job of course that's the norm of how much people spend in terms of authorities as well i think singapore has done a great job overall exploring different technological platforms to communicate risk to the public but one thing we need to keep in mind as a society is to keep on looking for those who are vulnerable so for groups that may not have access to high quality covert 19 information maybe because of language barriers or technological access so for these groups of people we need to plug the gaps because our research is showing that this could make a difference for mental health during this pandemic well thank you so much for speaking to us and helping us understand this study we've been speaking to jean liu from the yale and us college ,True,False,True,False

Although children may be ...",many of us reminisce back to our lives before the covet 19 pandemic and hope for things to get back to the way that they were while we simultaneously try to adapt to this new normal the pandemic has affected our lives in numerous ways but it is imperative that we focus on our mental health many people have reported about the fear and uncertainty about their own health the health of their loved ones their financial situation and job outcomes as well as tackling social isolation through following public health protocols mental health is inclusive to all age groups and should leave no one behind in terms of spreading awareness with this being said have you ever considered the effect that covid19 has had on children we could say that children are unable to fully grasp the concept of their mental health and well-being but the pandemic has taken away aspects of their life just like any other member of the community we urge you to keep watching this video for some insight on the mental health of the children within our communities and how you as a parent guardian or any type of caretaker can help to ease their experience although there are many factors to address children are particularly vulnerable due to their limited understanding of the current pandemic because of this many of them are also unable to physically and mentally escape the harms of the situation as they have little to no coping strategies and it is hard for them to communicate their feelings easily unlike adults although their understanding is minimal children can pick up on unverified information through social media or word of mouth as adults communicate which can aggravate mental distress and feelings of uncertainty as misinterpretation is bound to happen children are also in a continuous and critical period of development as they require special care in order to preserve and promote their mental health which has been primarily affected by a drastic change in routine the suppression of all class activities and learning as well as a shift to an online schooling has led to the creation of an isolated learning environment essentially schools are responsible for providing structure to a child's daily activities many articles have postulated the importance of physical activity during the quarantine as it is associated with a decline in symptoms of anxiety and depression research has also argued that schools play a primary role in providing a consistent daily calorie intake to ensure that children are getting their nutritional needs yet amidst the pandemic these essential needs have been significantly decreased a nationwide study in canada conducted by the international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity found that children and youth were actually less active played outside less where more sedentary engaged in more recreational screen time and slept more in comparison to before the covid19 restrictions but special needs are extremely vulnerable to the psychological impacts that come along for example shifting to an online learning environment has disrupted their daily routines and therapy sessions children with autism or neurocognitive disabilities are more likely to show problematic behaviors such as irritability aggression and social withdrawal online learning has also led to a decrease in assistance to these children as parents cannot replace special education teachers there is also a lack of technology to assist with this transition in addition to that social distancing and its effects are extremely new and difficult to understand especially for children that are experiencing developmental and intellectual delays for these reasons spreading awareness of the mental health of children with disabilities needs to be done on a global scale it is also no surprise that the pandemic causes parents and caregivers to become fearful of their own concerns research shows that fear can be contagious as children are sensitive to the emotional state of the adults that surround them to make matters worse parents are also unable to alleviate the stress through familiar mechanisms that were established prior to the pandemic such as visiting family and friends or going on excursions such as watching movies or dining out the process of isolation also imposes more constant contact between parents and children with this being said not all homes are safe places for children to learn or play due to exposure to various types of abuse during quarantine abuse complaints can actually decrease in frequency as there are limited ways for children to flee from perpetrators as schools usually act as an avenue for children to report issues regardless the frequency of children experiencing abuse at home may increase due to continuous contact with perpetrators in quarantine additionally browsing on online social media platforms and lack of supervision over the internet access has also increased vulnerability to online offenders attempted fraud and sexually inappropriate content due to these circumstances issues such as deteriorating performance aggression and regression may escalate these are all examples of environmental impacts that impair a child's mental health and physical perception of the world around them despite any of the negative impacts the internet has been a critical tool for children and youth in learning entertainment and even social interactions since the start of the covet 19 pandemic in particular research has shown that video games offer a temporary escape from real life but they also provide a fair amount of social engagement one of the greatest digital game distributors known as steam reports that since the pandemic started the number of users has increased significantly this report indicates that weekly users has increased from 19 million to 23.5 million although it is generally believed that video games have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of children recent high quality research by the journal of clinical psychological science shows the effects of video games on mental health and well-being is very small video games can help children and youth to fill in the empty gaps by interacting with their friends through online gaming additionally during the pandemic many children do not have enough physical activity so it is recommended to mix physical activities with video games there are active video games that kids can use which can be very helpful while the outdoor movements are restricted for example christopher alexander a professor of video games at ryerson university in toronto says video games can be positive activity during the time of self-distancing if we can take the time to discover the types of games that are best for you so what can you do to help your child during this pandemic there are several avenues of support that can be offered for children to ensure that their mental health is being addressed in this video we will cover the card system provided by the hospital for sick kids for parents and caregivers this system provides strategies that parents can play to help their children cope with stressful situations card is an acronym that stands for comfort ask relax and distract the comfort aspect involves talking to your child about what they can do to cope with their anxiety try to empower your child to overcome their negative thoughts by saying things like you are stronger than you feel also be sure to validate your child's concern by saying things like it's okay to be upset some other things that can be done specifically during the pandemic include limiting exposure to the media and news being mindful of the conversations that you have around family members and creating daily routines that give your child predictability and control next by asking questions your child is given an opportunity to open up some questions you can ask your child include what questions do you have or how are you feeling or what are your friends saying about this and lastly what fun things can you do today thirdly by relax this means to do things that you and your child enjoy to help them feel more secure and connected this can be done by listening to a mindfulness or relaxation activity together practicing positive self-talk or engaging in an enjoyable physical activity lastly a great thing to do is distract try to talk about things that are important to your child such as sports or dancing or art some great activities include reading books watching movies playing board games working on puzzles or even helping your child with their homework using card you can make a personalized system for your child to make their routines during the pandemic a little less difficult and hopefully this benefits your mental health in return because mental health as we said earlier is inclusive to all take care of yourself and don't forget to subscribe and

A little stress can be helpful. It can be the motivator that keeps us self-isolating or washing our hands. But constant or high levels of stress can negatively affect our mental and physical health. Taking care of our minds is always important, but doing so in the middle of a pandemic can be really tricky. Here are some tips and techniques to help us all get through this. Start your day well It can be tempting to reach for your phone or switch on the news first thing in the morning but starting the day with a simple mindfulness exercise, such as ‘Notice 3 things’, can help you check in with how you’re feeling and connect with your environment. Mindfulness is well known to make people feel calmer and cope better with stress. This quick exercise takes less than a minute. Before you get out of bed: pause and concentrate on 3 things you can see. For example, your patterned curtains, the blue sky or even just a lightbulb. Then listen for 3 things you can hear. The sound of cars passing by, a singing bird or the hum of your boiler. And finally, notice 3 things you can feel in contact with your body. Your PJs, bedsheets or even your cat. Get planning Although it’s tempting to stay curled up in bed - adapting and creating positive new routines can be helpful and keep you motivated. For example, in the place of what was your morning commute or a school-run: listen to a podcast or go for a walk Incorporating some form of exercise outdoors if possible, into every day is good for mental and physical wellbeing. And set aside time to speak to friends, family or work colleagues every day. Connecting with others releases feel-good hormones that help to relieve stress. Stay informed, not overloaded Although we are able to cope with some stress here and there, being constantly exposed to a rolling fear-inducing news-feed can impact your mental health Hearing upsetting or anxiety-provoking news triggers a stress-response in our bodies. Keeping informed is important, but managing your social media and information intake will make a big difference to how you feel. Try to limit the time you spend listening to, watching or reading things about the outbreak Turn to one or two reliable sources for news and check them just once or twice a day to stay informed. If feelings of anxiety spring up in your day, try a breathing technique, such as box breathing. Concentrating on and controlling your breathing is a scientifically-backed way of making you feel calm. Box breathing is quick, easy and can be done anywhere. Breathe in deeply, through your nose, for a count of 4 Hold your breath for 4 Breathe out completely, through your mouth, for a count of 4 And hold your empty breath for 4 Then repeat 4 times Getting ready for bed Good quality sleep makes a big difference to how you feel. But feeling worried or anxious can make getting to sleep difficult. You could set a coronavirus news curfew, so you don’t watch or read anything to do with the outbreak after 7pm and aim for a regular bedtime. You might also find it helpful to: avoid caffeine before bed, Not eat or drink too much late in the evening Have a warm bath and keep screens out of your bedroom. If getting to sleep is proving tricky, you can try ‘the body scan’. This simple exercise helps you to relax both your mind and body, and with practice - you might find that it even sends you off to sleep. Whilst you’re lying in bed or resting, take your attention to your feet. Relax and soften them into the bed as much as possible. Then scan up your body, moving to your ankles. Release any tension and soften them into the bed. Once they feel relaxed, move up further to your calves, then knees, thighs and so on. Keep moving slowly up your body, all the way to your  head, softening and relaxing every muscle along the way. We hope these simple daily steps will help. Take care. ",True,False,True,False

DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE CHALLENGE WE ALL FACE IN OUR DAILY LIVES HAVE BEEN EXASPERATED IN THE MENTAL HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE GLOBE HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR PENTA LIST, BUT TO QUICKLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SEVERAL HOURS AGO, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CITED COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT. IT IS INTENDED TO SPEED UP THE REVIEW OF HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS OR AA PI COMMUNITY AND I NOW HAVE THE GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE OUR TALENTED GROUP OF PANELISTS.

HIS MISSION IS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL EMPOWERED ONLINE AND PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BULLYING AND PEACE. WELCOME TRACY CHOU. WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS NOT BECAUSE FIRST QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT TO ERIC NAM SO THE IMPACT RACISM THAT HAS AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE UNITED STATES, IS IT REALLY LIKE AN INVISIBLE CANCER FOR IMMUNITY'S OF COLOR. YET SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REMAINS A STIGMATIZED. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE WAYS IN WHICH SYSTEMIC RACISM HAS AN IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH ESPECIALLY FOR THE AA PI COMMUNITY AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND ALSO HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC EXASPERATED THAT REALITY. ERIC: YES AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION WHICH I THANK YOU SO SO TIMELY FOR EVERYBODY AROUND THE WORLD. IN TERMS OF MY RESPONSE, IS PROBABLY JUST. REPORTER: MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH FOR ASIAN AMERICANS HIM I THINK THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT ASIANS ARE QUIET, SUBSERVIENT AND WE LIVE WITH HIS METHOD OF THE MODEL MINORITY AND WERE ALSO TRADITIONALLY TO THIS DAY I THINK WE HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY SEEN AS AN AMERICAN, THERE'S ALWAYS-OR QUALIFIER THAT HAS TO JUSTIFY WHY WE ARE HERE. AND THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CONSISTENTLY UNDERLINES THE ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. AND I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS IT CAN SEEM MINOR OR INNOCUOUS TO SUMMON LIVING WITH THESE MISCONCEPTIONS FROM YOUNG AGE AND IN SOME WAY OF FORCES US TO ACCEPT THE MICRO AGGRESSIONS WERE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN WHATEVER FORM, APPEARS TO US AS HARMLESS OR THAT IT IS OKAY WHEN, AND VERY MUCH IS NOT. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS, PERCEPTION THE WORK ALSO LIKE THE PERPETUAL CORNER WERE OFTEN TOLD TO SUCK IT UP OR NOT CAUSE A SCENE. THOUGH WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO BE HERE AS IMMIGRANTS OR AS CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS. THAT IN TURN FORCES ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICANS TO INTERNALIZE AND NORMALIZE RACISM THAT IS FORCED UPON US FROM A SYSTEMIC LEVEL. I THINK WHEN THAT HAPPENS INCREASE THE SITUATION WHERE IF WE COME ACROSS AN ISSUE SUCH AS RACISM, WE MAY NATURALLY TEND TO SHY AWAY FROM DIRECT CONFRONTATION. I THINK FOR ME, I HAD SITUATIONS WHERE I QUESTIONED, AM I ALLOWED TO BE VOCALLY AGAINST IT. AM I ALLOWED TO SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST HOW MANY OF US WERE RAISED. TO BE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE EVEN HERE. SO AM I OVERREACTING, BEING OVERLY SENSITIVE. THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO. AND IT KIND OF TOXINS OUT OF RAISING THE ISSUE BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY, WE WERE NEVER ASKED IF THIS WAS A PROBLEM OR CLAYMAN HAVE A PROBLEM WITH US. I THINK HAVING A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE NORMALIZED SYSTEMIC RACISM, IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A HEALTHY MINDSET. FOR SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT COULD STEM FROM AND I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE THAT IS ALWAYS LINGERING IS THAT BECAUSE MANY OF US INTERNALIZE THESE ISSUES, WERE NOT VERY USED TO EXPRESSING AT, WE ARE NOT VERY USED TO ASKING FOR HELP IN SEEKING COUNSELING AND FOR MANY ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICANS IT CAN BE SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AND IT HAS BECOME STIGMATIZED. AND I THINK THROUGH COVID-19, IT MAY HAVE BECOME EXASPERATED OR EVEN WORSE BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT I GUESS HOW DO WE SAY THIS. THE EXTREMES OF THE RACISM THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEMIC A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE LIVED IN. AND OBVIOUSLY COVID-19 IS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY BEEN ASIAN AMERICANS, WE HAVE BEEN HIT IN SO MANY WAYS. AND THE AAPI MOST HARDEST HIT AND MUST PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE RHETORIC THAT FRAME TO COVID-19 AT THE START, A.K.A. KUNG FLU OR THE CHINA VIRUS FREE TO GO TO SOME ARE FUNNY, THEY HAD INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE AND LITERALLY VIOLENT EFFECTS ON THE AAPI COMMUNITY. THERE'S BEEN A DIRECT CORRELATION OF THE RISE WITH THE USAGE OF THESE TERMS IN HATE VIOLENCE. NO WONDER SOMETIMES IF THE STEREOTYPES THAT PEOPLE HAVE EVEN IF THERE KIND OF UNDER THE SURFACE OF US BEING MODEL MINORITY ARE NICE OR PASSIVE, AND WE CAN SURMISE ALLOWS FOR PEOPLE TO CARRY OUT HATE CRIMES ARE TARGET NATIONS AND ASIAN AMERICANS EVEN MORE WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRIMAND OR CONSEQUENCE. SO I THINK BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF HATE CRIMES, BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT BE HISTORICALLY WELL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, WHEN WE ALL OF THESE THINGS COMING TOGETHER. I THINK WE ARE RIGHT NOW AS AAPI CRITICALLY IN THE STATES WE LIVE WITH HIGH ANXIETY STRESS PARANOIA, AND PROBABLY A SLEW OF ISSUES THAT ARE STEMMING FROM THIS . WE FEEL ATTACKED AND UNSAFE AND I THINK IT IS ALL REALLY BEEN EXASPERATED BY COVID-19. I'M SORRY THERE WAS A VERY LONG RESPONSE. >> THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. IT MAY SEEM MINOR BUT FOR THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING IT, IT CERTAINLY IS NOT MINOR AND NOW DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY I WOULD LOVE TO PULL YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION CAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON WAYS SYSTEMIC RACISM HAS IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH. KSAKRAD: SURE, SYSTEMIC RACISM IS IT SOMETHING THAT QUITE VIOLENT AND TRAUMATIZING. I WANT TO PUT A PERIOD AT THE END OF THAT, IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS EMBEDDED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY CULTURE. FROM WHAT WE LIVE TO THE FOOD WE EAT TO THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE HAVE IN THE EDUCATION WE RECEIVED TO THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT IT IS THIS HIDDEN THING, IT IS WORKING VERY MUCH IN THE FOREFRONT OF SOCIETY. AND EVERYBODY'S LIVES IS A CONSTANT PRESENCE. WITH THAT, AT TIMES WE CAN BECOME A PRODUCT OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP A PERSON WHO HAS WORKED I OFTEN PUT TO WHEN WORKING WITH MARGINALIZED PEOPLE BUT HE ESSENTIALLY BELIEVED THAT THE PSYCHE CAN BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN WHICH WE LIVE. WE WERE BORN INTO. AND THAT IS OFTEN SOMETHING THAT IT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN IGNORED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THE MENTAL-HEALTH COMMUNITY. SO STIGMATIZED AND OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DID NOT HAPPEN IN A VACUUM AS WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK. THAT THERE WAS THIS PARANOIA ESSENTIALLY AND FEAR OF DOCTORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS. HE DID NOT HAPPEN IN A VACUUM AND IT DID NOT COME OUT OF NOWHERE. A LONGER TIME IN THIS COUNTRY, MEDICAL PRACTICES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICES HAVE BEEN LARGELY RACIST AND I'M DONE A LOT OF HARM TO THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO IT MAKES SENSE THERE IS A STIGMA TASTE AND WITH REGARDS TO MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL. MANY TIMES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT A PERSON IS FEELING AND WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING. SO I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE STIGMATIZATION A MENTAL HEALTH AS A PRACTICE, HAS BEEN LARGELY DEVELOPED OUT OF PAST HISTORICALLY RACIST PRACTICES WITHIN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE AND MENTAL HEALTH. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE LARGELY BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 DUE TO THE SOCIETAL DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY EXPERIENCED IN HER CHALLENGE WITH. AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY, THERE HAVE BEEN HISTORICAL RACIST PRACTICES BUT I THINK THAT WITHIN THE SEVERAL RESEARCH STUDIES SHOWN TO ILLUSTRATE THE PREJUDICES AND BIASES OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS CURRENTLY IN PRACTICING READ THAT MAY HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE LARGE DEATH RATES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WHEN INFECTED WITH COVID-19 AND ADDITIONALLY, THERE AREN'T ENOUGH TESTING CENTER SO THAT ALSO EXASPERATED THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ALSO MANY TIMES PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE THE FRONTLINE BROKERS. OR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SO THEY HAVE EXPOSURE TO COVID-19. SO ON THE SOCIETAL FACTORS REALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXASPERATION OF THE DISCREPANCY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND MEDICAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES THAT WERE RECEIVED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR WHICH MADE THEM A LOT MORE VULNERABLE THAN SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTRACTING AND DYING FROM THE DISEASE HAS WELL. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY I THINK YOU FOR GOING INTO DEPTH AND OUT TRACY CHOU I WOULD LIKE TO PULL YOU IN AS WELL IF YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY SEE INTO ONLINE HATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH REGARDS TO THE SCHISM. TRACY: THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS WHAT HAPPENS ONLINE IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT THAT HAPPENS OFF-LINE AND PARTICULARLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND EVERYTHING IS ONLINE ALL OF HER INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE, THE WORK AND PERSONAL LIFE SO EVERYTHING IS ONLINE RATED THE HARASSMENT WE ARE SING ONLINE REFLECTS THE SAME PATTERNS OF BIAS IN HATE, MISOGYNY, RACISM AND THAT ARE CORROSIVE THROUGH THE REST OF THE SITE AND ONLINE HARASSMENT IS NO LESS REAL BECAUSE IT IS ONLINE. AND THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY VERY REAL AND SIGNIFICANT. AND IN FACT, WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE DIGITAL PLATFORM TO BEING ALIGNED AND VERSUS THAT ABLE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AT A DIFFERENT SCALE. BECOME TUMOR WEST COAST OF PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT IS GOOD WHEN YOU WANT LOTS OF USERS ABOUT WHAT IS ALL NEGATIVE AND THINGS COMING OUT TO YOU AND WHEN KNOWLEDGE THAT I THANK YOU SO ACTUALLY THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED ANTI- ASIAN HATE ON THE STREETS. PEOPLE YELLING THINGS ASKED ME LIKE GO BACK TO BEIJING. PERCENT TO THE SKILL OF WHAT HAPPENS ONLINE. WE HAVE GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF THOSE KINDS OF COMMENTS IN A ONE EVENING. EACH OF THOSE COMMENTS CAN BE PAINFUL TO HEAR AND THE FEELING I GET WHEN SOMEBODY CARESSES ME ON THE STREET, JUST ONE BAD COMMENT. BUT WHEN IT COMES IN IT IN A FLOOD IN ITS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS PILING ON, HE WAS JUST COMING TO SEE THIS IS REALLY PAINFUL. IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT. I'M LUCKY IN THAT I AM NOT SO HIGH-PROFILE BUT STILL ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCE THIS. IT CAN BE SO EXTREME FOR ANYBODY THAT IS TARGETED FOR SAYING THE WRONG THING OR TWEETING ON THE WRONG STRIKE. SOMEONE JUST HAPPENED TO GO VIRAL, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT THAT CAN COMMENT IS ABSOLUTELY UNREAL. AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC, ORAL ONLINE, THERE'S EVEN MORE ON LINE BEHAVIOR A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE FRUSTRATED AND TAKING OUT THE NEGATIVITY ANOTHER FOLKS ON THE INTERNET. SO I PERSONALLY FELT A LOT OF THIS MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT AND HAD TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO I MINIMIZE THE, TO MYSELF AND SEE ALL OF THESE NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL SAY LIKE, JUST GET OFF-LINE IF IT SO BAD. THAT DOES NOT REALLY A SOLUTION. WE ALL LIVE ONLINE, SOCIAL MEDIA IS A FACT OF LIFE FOR ALL OF US. FOR MANY PEOPLE AS A PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENT TO BE ALIGNED TO GOING OFF-LINE COMES AT A VERY VERY HIGH COST. I GUESS THE FIRST STEP IS TO REALIZE HOW REAL ONLINE HARASSMENT IS, ON LINE EIGHT AND MANIFESTATION OF VITAMIN C OFF-LINE BUT JUST GENERAL SOCIETAL ISSUES SO ALL OF THIS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF RACISM JUST TRANSLATES INTO SEVERE HARASSMENT AND HATE THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN DIGITAL FORMS AS WELL READ. HOST: THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IN THANK YOU, IT IS NOT EASY TO JUST GET OFF-LINE. IT IS A PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENT WE CANNOT JUST DELETE OR SOCIAL MEDIA. MANY PEOPLE INSURED TURNING INTO DAY, FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS EVENT THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA SO IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO UNPLUG AS MUCH AS MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO NOW DOCTOR MARY YANG I WOULD LOVE TO INVITE YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THE WAY SYSTEMIC RACISM HAD AN IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH. MARY: I AGREE WITH WHAT EVERYONE HAS SAID SOME ACTUALLY BASED IN CANADA WHERE I THINK OUR ARE THE COUNTRY'S PERCEPTION OF RACISM IS THAT IT IS MORE, NOT AN ISSUE. IT'S AN AMERICAN THING. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS OFTEN LIKE A LOT OF COMPARISONS, NOT AS BAD AS THEY ARE WHICH REALLY JUST SERVES TO MINIMIZE THE REALITIES OF PEOPLE LIVING HERE, THAT THERE ARE REALLY BIG DISCREPANCIES IN MANY WAYS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT COVID-19 LIKE REVEALING LIKE WHEN IT'S REALLY BEEN HERE ALL ALONG TERMS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM INEQUITIES. AND HARASSMENT THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE WITH. HOST: THANK YOU FOR SHARING DOCTOR MARY YANG. HIS NEXT QUESTION TO DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY IF YOU COULD ANSWER FIRST PARTY TO SEE ANOTHER GLOBALLY THINK HOW COLONIALISM AND THE TRANSATLANTIC FLEET TRADE LAUGHED AND LASTING IMPACT ACROSS EVERY SOCIETAL STRUCTURE. HOW IS THAT LEGACY MANIFESTED IN THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES LIVING UNDER THOSE DUAL SHADOWS. KSAKRAD: I AM PERSONALLY OF THE BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL LIVING UNDER THIS SHADOW AND IT CAUSES US A GREAT DEAL OF PSYCHE HARD FOR EVERYONE. I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT JAMES BALDWIN AND PSYCHIATRIST LIKE A NON- OFTEN SPOKE ABOUT SUBJUGATION OF PEOPLE BEING NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN WHITE SUPREMACY. SO IN OTHER WORDS, WE ALL HAVE INTERNALIZED THE NOTION THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE LOWER TO BE EMPOWERED, THERE NEEDS TO BE OPPRESSION THAT HAPPENS. AND THAT NO ONE CAN REALLY EVER LIVE WITHOUT HER EXIST WITHOUT THE SUPPRESSION. AND IT IS NORMALIZED IN A WAY. I JUST FEEL THAT THIS CREATES THIS SENSE THAT IN ORDER FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE TO BE EMPOWERED FOR ANYONE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE IN POWER, THAT THERE MUST BE A SUBJUGATION OF ANOTHER PERSON. AND THAT THIS IS OFTEN DONE IT IN A VERY NONCRITICAL WAY. IT DOES NOT LEAD US TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH IMPRESS OTHERS WERE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEHUMANIZATION OF OTHER PEOPLE POPULATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. SO I THINK THAT IT CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL IF WE REALLY STOP TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THE SOCIAL POLITICAL STRUCTURES IN WHICH WE LIVE. IN RESPONSE TO AND SUPPORT. WE CAN ALSO SEE THIS AS A WAY TO RESIST IN A LOT OF WAYS. AN OPPRESSIVE STATE ARE OPPRESSION WITHOUT OURSELVES AND IN OUR SOCIETY BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A WAY TO HUMANIZE YOUR SELF. AND OTHERS AROUND YOU BECAUSE IF WE DON'T THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT OPPRESSION OR SUBJUGATION, THEN WE ARE BOUND TO DEHUMANIZE OTHERS AND MINIMIZE OUR OWN SENSE OF HUMANITY. SO WITHIN MY OWN PRACTICE AS A PSYCHOLOGIST, I REALLY LIKE TO WORK UPON THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF LIBERATION PSYCHOLOGY. WHICH WAS LARGELY DEVELOPED BY UNNECESSARILY DEVELOPED BY, IS ENHANCED BY MARTIN BORROW WAS A SPANISH BORN PRIEST AND PSYCHOLOGIST THAT WORKED IN EL SALVADOR. ESSENTIALLY HE SAID THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE IN DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS. SO WE NEED TO DEVELOP A CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SENSE OF LOVE AND PEACE IN YOUR HEART OVER THERE COULD ALSO BE VERY CRITICAL OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN OUR LIVES AND THE SOCIAL POLITICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH WE LIVE. ALL OF THIS IS TO DEVELOP A SENSE OF GREAT HUMANIZATION OF YOURSELF AND SOCIETY. THEN I ALSO TAKEN A STEP FURTHER. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO ALSO BE KIND OF A DINAR MINERALIZATION. A MAINSTREAM SOCIETY. OF WHICH WE DO HAVE THIS ECONOMY OF LOVE AND OPPRESSION OR POWER AND OPPRESSION. AND THAT OPPRESSED PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, THEY TENDED TO THRIVE WHEN THEY ARE WITHIN THEIR OWN SOCIETIES AND CULTURE. SIZES PEOPLE TO HELP THEM LOOK FOR THANKS IN THEIR CULTURE AND SOCIETY THAT EMBRACES THEIR OWN SENSE OF HUMANITY. THEREFORE THE HUMANITY OF OTHERS. SO I WOULD SAY THAT IT COULD BE HELPFUL IF OTHERS COULD DO THIS IN THEIR PRACTICE. NOT JUST MARGINALIZED PEOPLE BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, WE ARE ALL AFFECTED BY COLONIALIZATION IN THE TRANSATLANTIC - TRINITY. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY AND ESPECIALLY WHEN RESONATED WITH ME WAS THE MAINSTREAM SOCIETY BEING DENORMALIZED. AND DOCTOR MARY YANG I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL. MARY: I THINK MANY THINKERS, MUCH SMARTER THAN ME, HAVE SUMMARIZED RACISM ABOUT MONEY. LIKE THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE TAKING OF NORTH AMERICA FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE. MOSTLY RACISM IS ABOUT MONEY. IT IS OTHER THINGS AS WELL. IN MANY WAYS, THE REALLY COMES DOWN TO MONEY. SO I THINK WE SEE THAT IN THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND IT IS ONLY REALLY THE LAST TEN OR 20 YEARS THE MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH SERVICE AND SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND TREATED AROUND THE WORLD. I THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LIKE SUCH A ENLARGED BODY RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT THE RISK OF PSYCHOSIS IN CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION IS LIKE, . DIRECTLY, RELATED IT WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF RACISM AND THERE ARE MANY STUDIES, SEVERAL THE STUDIES THAT ONTARIO SHOWS THAT PEOPLE COMING FROM A PEOPLE ARE BLACK WHO IMMIGRATE TO CANADA ARE MUCH HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND PSYCHOSIS AND PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT'S REALLY PHYSICAL ELATION WITH RACISM SO THEY QUICKLY TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF MENTAL HEALTH OF THESE COMMUNITIES, AND DETERMINES A LOT OF THE FULL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHICH CAN AFFECT MENTAL HEALTH AS A WAY THAT THEY WOULD AFFECT PHYSICAL CONFIDENT DEFECTS, TEXAS PEOPLE HAVE TO RESOURCES. HANNAH LIKE WITH ERICKSON ABOUT THERAPY IN MANY COMMUNITIES BEING SEEN THE WHITE PEOPLE DO. AND I THINK THAT WOODY ALLEN MIKE SAID DIFFERENTLY INCOME FOR YOU. IT'S A SELF-INDULGENT THING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND WORK ON. AND TO SEEK SUPPORT FOR. SO I THINK HE COMES BACK TO MONEY. MONEY HELPS TO BUFFER FROM LIFE STRESSES. YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GAP TO IT, IT LEAVES YOU MORE VULNERABLE AND PEOPLE ARE OFTEN HIGHER RISK AND MONEY ALSO LEAVES YOU WITH LESS ACCESS TO RECEIVE TREATMENT FOR THESE CONDITIONS. I THINK THIS IS TRUE IN NORTH AMERICA AS IT IS IN LIBERIA, AND MANY OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES. WIT.HOST: ONLY THE PAST 20 YEAR, THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAS REALLY BEEN SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH SERVICE. HIS MIND BLOWING GOOD. ERIC AND TRACY, WOULD EITHER OF YOU LIKE TOO BAD WHAT'S IN. TRACY: SPEAKING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN ASIAN AMERICAN IS SORT OF A COMPLEXITY DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES AS A NATION THERE IS PROXIMITY TO BRIGHTNESS AND THIS IDEA THE MYTH OF THE MODEL MINORITY WHERE ESPECIALLY TECH NATIONS ARE OVERREPRESENTED, WERE HELD UP HIS MATED AND VERY WELL REPRESENTED AT LEAST IN THE ENGINEERING RANKS. WE ARE PRESENT. TECH IS CONSIDERED WEALTHY INDUSTRY SO FEELS OCCASIONS I MADE IT WITH A LOT OF PRIVILEGE IN THE IDEA OF MODEL MINORITIES OF ASIANS ABLE TO SUCCEED BY THEIR WORK ETHIC. REALLY IS NO TYPE BLACK RACIST TOOL THAT IS MEANT TO SEVER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HIT ASIANS AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE TREATED SO THERE LIKE SYMPTOMS THE UNDERLYING ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THERE'S THE PRIVILEGE OF THE ONE HAND WE HAVE POSITIONS BUT ALSO EXCLUSIONS WE STILL FACE WE SEEN A LOT OF THAT MANIFESTATION OF THE HATE AND STILL THERE AND QUITE PREVALENT PRE. IT ALSO LEADS TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHERE WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THE POSITION THAT WE HAVE IN SOCIETY. WHAT ARE THE SAME TIME WERE STILL BEING TARGETED AND KILLED BY MASS SHOOTERS. SO THERE IS THAT TRICKING US AND, AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT ON COLONIALISM. PERHAPS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE TRANSONIC TRADE SLAVE, BUT THERE'S ALSO COLONIALISM AND ASIAN THE LEGACY IS STILL PERSISTING AND I THINK THERE'S A TO SOMETIMES TRY TO FLATTEN THE AAPI AND THAT WERE ALL THE SAME, WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF COLONIALISM. LIKE BACK HOME, MY FAMILY IS FROM TAIWAN. THAT IS UNDER JAPANESE COLONIAL RULE FOR SOME TIME THE JAPANESE CALLS A LOT OF ASIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THE LEGACY OF COLONIALISM BUT THERE'S TELLING DEALING WITH THIS AS WELL READ WITHIN THE ASIAN COMMUNITIES WE OFTEN PERPETUATE RACISM AS WELL. WHETHER IT IS A STATIONS UP FOR SOUTHEAST ASIANS AND SOUTH ASIANS AND EVERYTHING IS INTERSECTIONAL. AND CLASSISM AND OTHER FORMS OF MISOGYNY IN ALL THESE OTHER FORMS OF BIAS THAT GET INTERLACED. IT IS QUITE COMPLEX. IT'S A DIFFERENT FORM OF RACISM WE HAD TO DEAL WITH HESITATIONS AND WHAT BLACK PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DO WITH. ALL OF US HAVE SEEN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTEST AND SEEN GEORGE FLOYD, THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF RACISM THAT WE HAD TO CONTEND WITH. IN AMERICA AND GLOBALLY THAN WHITE PATIENTS DEAL WITH. THE COMPLEXITY OF DOES NOT MAKE IT EASIER TO TRAVEL WITH. ERIC: SO YEAH, TO TAKE OFF OF WHAT TRACY WAS MENTIONING ABOUT EXCLUSION I THANK YOU SO SOMETHING I WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON FRIDAY THINK INTACT, YES, THERE ARE A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE ENGINEERING THE DEMAND WITH THE IF YOU THINK ABOUT FACE WE WERE EXCLUDED FROM A CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOOL. AS BEING IN WORKING IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. A COUPLE OF STUDIES LOOKED AT FILMS THAT CAME OUT IN 2019 AND THE STATISTICS WERE QUITE JARRING TO ME. ELECTED 1300 OF THE TOP FILMS NUMBERS 1300, ONLY 44 HAD AN API LEADER COLLATED OF THIS 44 FILMS WITH THE NATION CLINICALLY, 14 OF THEM WERE JOHNSON LIFE ABSOLUTELY LOVE. DWAYNE THE ROCK JOHNSON. I THINK IT REALLY GOES TO THE - I THINK THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR HELP ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS AND WE BEEN WANTING TO BE FEELING EMPOWERED AND EMPOWER OTHERS AS WELL. AND WE GET TO A POINT WE CAN DO IT NATURALLY AND IT'S CONSISTENT. WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS UNTIL WE GET TO THE POINT, WHENEVER THAT IS, WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT AND KEEP BRINGING IT UP. I THINK OF THE PARTHENON WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS STILL IN THE EXCLUSION APARTMENT I MOVED TO KOREA AND 2011. ALMOST EXACTLY TEN YEARS AGO. ONCE I STARTED TO DIDN'T MUSIC IN THE U.S. AND KOREA, THE PRESS WAS LIKE WHY DID YOU GO TO KOREA WHY DIDN'T YOU START HERE. INTIMATE, SUCH A FUNNY QUESTION. WHEN YOU SEEN ANYBODY LOOKS LIKE ME ON THE GRAMMYS ON MTV, GROWING UP I NEVER SAW THAT PERSON. STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW A KOREAN, AND ASIAN COMEDIAN ON TV READ FOR ME. FOR SOME TIME IN THE '90s AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOSH, THERE'S NATION PERSON ON TV. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE MINORITY, THERE LIKE WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO SEE YOURSELF IN A POSITION OF POWER OR OF INFLUENCE OR WHATEVER, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DREAM IT HARD TO IMAGINE IT BUT YOU ARE BECOME FOR FULFILL. AND I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY HAVE TO ACTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST IS MY FOURTH IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION. I CAN START MY CAREER, TEN OR 12 YEARS EARLIER, AND WHAT I CONSIDER MY MOTHER LANGUAGE OF ENGLISH, MAYBE THINGS WOULD'VE BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT THAT WAS NEVER A REALISTIC OPTION FOR ME. I WENT TO KOREA I AM SO THANKFUL THAT HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE DID MATTER THAT I WAS ASIAN, IT WAS CAN YOU SING AND PERFORM. WAS BASED ON MY ABILITY AND SKILL SET AS AN ENTERTAINER INSTEAD OF WHAT IS ASIANS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT BOX TO PUT HIM INTO. MASS AMERICA GOING TO BE OKAY WITH AN ASIAN KID SINGING A POP SONG. I THINK THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE ARE INCREDIBLY EXCLUDE FROM AND THAT WE HAVE HAD LEFT STRIDES AND A LOT OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS BUILDING FOR VISIBILITY AND INCLUSION. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WERE ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT WE NEED TO BE WILL BE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE. I THANK YOU SO ALL KIND OF TIES AND THE SYSTEMIC PARTS OF THIS AS WELL AS INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION AND STEREOTYPES AND OBVIOUSLY THIS TOPIC IS SO VAST AND SO COMPLEX. BUT DID WANT TO ADD FROM MY EXPERIENCE MY 2 CENTS ON THAT. HOST: THANK YOU ERIC FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU AS WELL. RESILIENCY, THIS IS A WAY TO DETERMINE WE OFTEN USE IT TO DESCRIBE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO JUST KEEP GOING DESPITE THE CRUSHING REALITIES IN WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED IT. SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU DEALING WITH THAT TERM PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY AND WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO PEOPLE LISTENING WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO WITH THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH IN RACISM. SYSTEMIC RACISM. ERIC: I THINK WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY ERASE THAT IT IS HARD. AND EVEN IF SOMEBODY SAID THAT IT'S A WAY TO SIMPLIFY IT OR MAKE IT EASIER, IT IS ALL RELATIVE AND IT IS THE BIGGEST MOST CHALLENGING THING FOR YOU PERSONALLY, ANYTHING I SAY IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. BUT I JUST WANT TO AGAINST ENCOURAGE WHOEVER MAY BE GOING THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES TO REALLY REACH OUT FOR HELP. AND NOT BE AFRAID OF IT AND FEAR IN PLACE VERY BLESSED SINCE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THIS NEEDED TO BE RESILIENT THEN YOU ARE PRIVILEGED, SO PRIVILEGED THAT YOU CAN HELP OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE GOOD TO . I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A TWO-WAY STREET, IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING, ASKED FOR HELP LOOKING UP SOMEBODY. THANK IS JUST A GENERAL WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE TO ANYBODY WAS LISTENING. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT BEING RESILIENT IS TOUGH BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE STRUGGLE OF REALLY GOING DAY BY DAY AND EVEN FOR ME, I RECOGNIZE THE COME FROM A PLACE OF PRIVILEGE SO I WILL NOT HAVE HAD THE SAME NEED FOR EXPERIENCING AND THE NEED TO BE RESILIENT. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED AND SOMETHING THAT CAN COMPLETELY AFFECT THINGS BEYOND JUST LIKE YOUR DAY TODAY, LIKE YOUR PSYCHE, EVERYTHING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND THE WAY YOU SPEAK WITH THE WAY YOU REACT TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS, IS A BURDEN THAT CAN CONSUME SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING. SO PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE, WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT. RESILIENCY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT UNTIL YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IT, YOU DO NOT KNOW AND IF YOU'RE IN IT, CAN BE INCREDIBLY PARALYZING TO EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN OPENNESS AN OPEN MIND TO REACH OUT AND REACH ACROSS THE BORDERS AND KIND OF ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP RATED SARNO THAT IS CRITICALLY HELPFUL BUT THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN DO, SEND GOOD VIBES INTO THE UNIVERSE. I REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE A PART OF THIS CHANGE THAT WE NEED. AS A SOCIETY AND AS THE WORLD. HOST: YES WE ABSOLUTELY ALL NEED TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP A BIT MORE. AND TRACY AND WONDERFUL UN WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU ENGAGE WITH THE TERM RESILIENCY BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND PERSONALLY AND IF YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR WORK WITH BLOCK PARTY AND HOW THE ADVICE TO GET FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH. TRACY: PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY, AND FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO CHANNEL IS MUCH RESILIENCY AS I CAN. IT DAY BY DAY. THE PERSONAL FRONT SPEAKING TO AN EARLIER TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, ONLINE HARASSMENT, I DO QUITE A BIT OF ONLINE HARASSMENT A VERY PERSISTENT BASIS. AN EVENT SO FOR A DECADE OR MORE. ""AND SO ON PHONE PERSISTENT I HAD TO GO TO THE POLICE MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY AND SOME FEAR OF MY PHYSICAL STOCKING AND THOSE ISSUES. AND GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE MORE CASUAL HARASSMENT AND I GET ONLINE AND THERE HAVE BEEN POINTS WHERE I HAVE WANTED TO JUST COLLAPSE IN THE QUARTER AND PRIDE HAVE DONE THAT AS WELL. I BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE THE HARASSMENT CAN GET SO TERRIBLE READ HOW THE PROFESSIONAL SIDE, I'M SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ONLINE HARASSMENT WITH MIKE KEMENY BLOCK PARTY, IT'S ALSO FRUSTRATING TO EXPERIENCE THE SEXISM AND RACISM OF THE TECH IO KNOW HOW MUCH ARTERY DOES AS A WOMAN TO RAISE MONEY FOR EXAMPLE. IN 2020, 2 PERCENT OF ALL CAPITOL MONEY WENT TO FEMALE FOUNDERS. 2 PERCENT OF ALL OF THE INVESTMENT GOING INTO TECH, SORRY THOSE WENT TO FEMALE FOUNDERS. IT PERMEATES ALL ASPECTS OF TRYING TO BUILD MY COMPANY. SAME WITH LIKE TALKING TO INVESTORS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND ONLINE RESPITE IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM. UNABLE TELL ME THAT, I'M IMAGINING HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. CAN I AM CREATING A PROBLEM WHERE ONE DOESN'T EXIST. IN ALL OF THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING BUT JUST THE FLIP HAVE IT, THE WAY I KIND OF TURNING AROUND IS THAT I THINK ABOUT HOW I CAN EXPRESS MY AGENCY AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. AND DOING A LOT MORE RESEARCH AROUND ONLINE HARASSMENT AND TALKING TO FOLKS WHO HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM . CAN BE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO ATTACK YOUR LINE. BEING PERSISTENT ABOUT IT CAN REPORT THEM OUR CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM SO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO MUCH EXCEPT IN EXTREME CASES. SO CAN FEEL VERY PARALYZING BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IT CAN DO. AND IN THAT. PERSONAL POSITION THAT I CAN ACTUALLY CHANNEL MY SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES AND NETWORKS TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND BUILD THE COMPANY THAT CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM USE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS SOMETHING I KNOW. TO TRY TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND SO IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING ABOUT THE WAY TO TURN AROUND AND SAY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY THING, THE ONE THING THAT I CAN TRY TO DO. NOT TO JUST MAKE A BETTER FOR MYSELF AND BETTER FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO DO IT. LIKE GOD IS HOW I KEEP MYSELF GOING EVEN THOUGH HE CAN BE REALLY FRUSTRATING. AND  I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK AND THIS PERSON CAN ONLY TAKE ON SO MUCH. AND IT JUST FEELS A LOT MORE EMPOWERING AND SOMETIMES I THINK OF THIS BATTLE IS ONE THAT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN ME AND IF YOU LIKE I AM DOING SOMETHING LIKE IF IT WERE FOR ME, NOT SURE WHO ELSE LIKE I'M IN SUCH A POSITION OF PRIVILEGE THAT I CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR US ON THE MANY PEOPLE SO FORTUNATE OR HAVE THAT EXACT INTERSECTION OF INTERSECTING OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAVING THE SKILLS TO ADDRESS IT. CISCO LIKE MY TAKE ON THE RESILIENCY, JUST KEEP PUSHING FORWARD. IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE BUT IS ALSO THE BEST CHOICE TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING AND IN TERMS OF ADVICE FOR OTHERS, I GUESS THE FIRST IS TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE. YOU ARE NOT CRAZY AND ARE NOT IMAGINING THINGS AND ALL THE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU INTO THINKING THAT. AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME IN THE PAST LIKE THERE IS NO SEXISM OR RACISM. JUST IMAGINING IT AND PROJECTING IT AROUND YOU. DON'T LET PEOPLE GAS LIGHT YOU INTO THAT. I THANK YOU SO SIMILAR TO WHAT I TRY TO DO, FIGURE OUT THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU HAVE AGENCY AND CAN TRY TO TAKE CONTROL SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL BACK. MY BE THINGS LIKE CHOOSING WHO YOU WANT TO ENGAGE WITH. IF YOU WERE TO SPEND TIME WITH, PEOPLE CAN GIVE ENERGY AND CHOOSE A WORK ENVIRONMENT IF YOU CAN IS MORE FAVORABLE TO YOU AND MORE WELCOMING OUR GET INVOLVED WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER SYSTEMICALLY. WE FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING EVEN IF YOU'RE STILL ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE SYSTEM IS VERY BROKEN AND NEEDS FIXING. HOST: THANK YOU TRACY AND DOCTOR MARY YANG I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE IT AS WELL AND YOUR ADVICE FOR RESILIENCY AND OTHER STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH IN THE FACE OF RACISM. >> PEOPLE THAT WE THINK OF AS THE MOST RESILIENT RARELY SEE THAT AS A COMPLEMENT. MARY: I THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK OUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THROUGH THEY HAVE TO BE RESILIENT, THERE OFTEN LIKE COMMENTS ON THEIR OWN CHARACTER SIX . THINK PEOPLE WANT JUSTICE. RESILIENCY THE CONCEPT OF THAT IS NOT. I THINK PERSONALLY IS A TERM THAT WORKPLACES USED TO TRY TO BRING OUT THE LAST FEW DOLLARS OF PRODUCTIVITY FROM THE WORKERS . LIKE I PERSONALLY THINK THE MANY WORKPLACE PROGRAMS THE HAVE THIS AGENDA, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T ADDRESS OTHER CONDITIONS ON THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH PEOPLE HAVE TO BE RESILIENT. I THINK ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE ALL HAVE TO DECIDE WE CAN ACCEPT AND TOLERATE AND AT SOME POINT, THE CONDITIONS WE WORK IN THAT WE SEE AS A SOCIETY, LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON YOUR STREET, AT SOME POINT IF YOU DECIDE YOU CAN'T TOLERATE IT, YOUR JOB IS TO CHANGE IT AND I THINK THAT GOES REGION EVERY ONE OF US. I THINK THE MORE AND MORE I DO THIS WHAT I REALIZED THERE IS A SYSTEM. BUT IN MANY WAYS, ABSTRACT THINGS THAT WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN, IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT EXISTS. THE WAY IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS AND PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM BUT THERE OFTEN ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN YOUR COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS IT IN WAYS THAT WERE WORKS. OFTEN I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE LOCALLY, MAKES THINGS FEEL LESS OVERWHELMING . AND OFTEN NO MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS IN HER CITIES AND THEIR PROVINCES AND STATES RATHER THINGS IN A HIGHER LEVEL JUST STARTING OUT WITH KNOWING YOUR COMMUNITY AND WHAT IS GOING ON THERE. BILLY CONNECTED AND I THINK IT CAN REALLY HELP. AND I THINK MINIATURE THE THREAT OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY ANYTHING WHAT KEEPS MANY PEOPLE GOING AND KEEP THEM RESILIENT IS HAVING THAT COMMUNITY CONSUMING DOING WHAT YOU CAN TO FEEL CONNECTED TO IT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SHARE YOUR SIMILAR VALUES. UNDERSTAND THE WAYS IN WHICH ALL OF THIS HAPPENS AT THE STREET LEVEL OFTEN THOSE ARE THE PLACES EASIEST TO CHANGE. MY LAST PIECE OF ADVICE FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH I JUST WANT TO ECHO TO GET HELP. IF THERE IS ONE MESSAGE SHE SENT HIM I THANK YOU SO REALLY IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT SELF-INDULGENT. THERAPY IS NOT JUST THE THING FOR WHITE PEOPLE, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR SURVIVAL. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR MARY YANG AND DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD IN YOUR THOUGHTS AS WELL. KSAKRAD: . [INAUDIBLE]. I'M SORRY. I BELIEVE THERE IS SELECTIVE RELATIVISM THAT IS OFTEN EMBRACED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESILIENCY. OFTEN TIMES, MAJOR CULTURE AND THE MAJORITY SELECTIVELY CHOOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCES ARE VALID READ AND THERE IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT THE CULTURAL SIDE THAT IS OFTEN PRESENT WHEN EXPLORING AND EVALUATING THE LIVES OF MARGINALIZED PEOPLE. THEREFORE, IT IS ONLY THE PRIVILEGED CLASS THAT AFFORDED THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AND TRAUMA. AND SUFFERING AND THE REST ARE TOLD TO KEEP PUSHING IT, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN . GOOD TO THINGS OFF AND CONTINUE WITH THEIR LIVES. I THINK THAT RESILIENCY HAS A PLACE ON A THING IT CAN BE IMPORTANT. BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF DENYING A PERSON'S HUMANITY OR NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF A PERSON'S DENYING THEIR OWN HUMANITY. EVEN MOST IMPORTANTLY. I BELIEVE THAT SOME PEOPLE FIND IT A LOT OF STRENGTH I WILL SAY BEING A BOSS. I'M JUST KIND OF KEEPING IT PUSHING BUT I THINK IT COULD BE A LOT OF STRENGTH AND IS FOUND IN RECOGNIZING YOUR PAIN. RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ARE AFFECTED FROM LIVING AN EXISTING. THE SYSTEMICALLY RACIST SOCIETY. HOST: THANK YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY AND WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION, UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN TO YOU DOCTOR KSAKRAD KELLY, DOCTOR MARY YANG ERIC NAM AND TRACY CHOU FOR JOINING US INTO EVERYBODY WHO TUNED IN THIS EVENING.

yxnmE-Aeulo,How Do We Solve Mental Health Stigma in Singapore?,UCFRIAxGTWQ4mllzdkdomAkQ,TEAM NOC,2021-04-13T07:00:11Z,"This week, we sit down with Mr Eric Chua, Parliamentary Secretary for MSF and MCCY, to review mental health memes, talk about mental health issues and ...",[Music] hi guys welcome to another episode on team nlc i am sylvia and today we have a very special guest to talk about a topic that is very close to my heart mental health mr eric choi hi everyone just an introduction for those of you who don't know who is mrs erich tell us what do you really do i am championing youth matters especially you who are in not so privileged situations so disadvantages youth with issues like mental health issues so recently i spoke in parliament about youth mental health and also young people from disadvantaged families right so what do you do also as co-chair right of the youth um mental well-being network yeah actually very simple we started this uh youth methodology network in february last year oh no was it response to coveted 19. well you already wanted to do it we want to do it all along anyway okay so uh we actually said oh who wants to help out in this piece of work so we had a lot of parents young people professionals practitioners coming forth and to date we actually have 1 500 of them wow both individuals and group organizations who have come forward to say hey i want to help so now we have done quite a few sessions and we have organized ourselves along eight areas and they have as of now thought about at least 30 projects oh wow so hopefully this year we should see some of the projects bearing fruit why this passion in mental health do you know someone who has gone through it or one day you just woke up and be like yeah they need help i think it's a very prevalent thing actually in fact all of us contend with some form of mental health even if not mental health inventor well-being issues you know in a recent survey it was actually found that one in seven singaporeans actually contend with some mental health disorders at some point our lives and then how do we cope with it how do we reach out where do we go to for help i mean these are all questions that maybe a lot of people have but we don't have really answers for so i think coming from that and coming from a personal point of view that's something close to my heart in that sense and i'm sure all of us grapple with our own you know demons every day so i think uh online right there's been a rise of memes also that's concerning mental health so we'll be looking at seven okay and then we will be talking about how relatable this is to you okay and what you can tell us about it sure okay number one so going straight means actual therapy turning right makes oversharing on twitter and you see the smoke behind the car the views of the car so like suddenly right turn yeah over sharing so oral examination tell me about this photo i think if it's uh memes are meant for mostly young folks right yeah so young folks tend to be digital native so people like me digital migrant right so i think we want to express ourselves and we do a lot of sharing on our socials i think in a way that is also kind of like a reflex just to try to communicate with the world about hey what are my emotions at this point in time and i think that's good but i think also the online world is also a place where you can have resources so for instance you know beyond the labor movement they actually have a chat bot her name is bell yes so you can chat with bell and bell can point you to resources that are good for mental health that can possibly be of help to you both in the online world and in the real world and also there are websites like mineline.sg that you can go to so after you post that go to the line to sg all right chat with belle you know but let me just question you one thing also okay do you think people out rightly will tell people they are in therapy well i hardly think so actually because there's still stigma associated with mental health conditions right so even though we mentioned one in seven have some brush with mental health conditions at some point in their life but i think it's also a fact that one in three still think that mental health conditions are oh it comes from weak willpower right but i think that's not a good position to start with okay but the fact that one in three persons thinks that let's fix volumes of what we as a society think about mental health and how we react to it so i think there's a lot of room for us to reshape the way we think about mental health conditions as well as the people with mental health conditions in one sentence it's just about reducing the stigma so what is the youth mental well-being network right doing to you know help people say it's okay to tell people you're in therapy it bears repeating the phrase or the sentence it's okay to be not okay right right so i think we just need to remind ourselves as one people that you can seek help you love your value you are worth it and we just have to get this into our psyche and it's not easy because it means fundamentally changing some engine parts are yes in ourselves right yeah and just all got to keep at it well and i think that's a very practical uh word of advice that it is you know a habit we have to get into we have to constantly remind ourselves it's okay not to be okay one time is not enough you viewing this video one time is really gonna not gonna help your mental health condition is when you take away from this video is really okay not to be okay you telling yourself you telling the people around you and all of you saying the same thing then it will work keep nagging the next beam all right okay what i think yeah this is quite interesting quite cool yeah you do you know who's that i have no idea actually oh my goodness you oh okay so i think what um this meme tells us is that people always think that mental uh not wellness okay has a faith but the fact is a lot of these people are actually high-functioning adults walking around us and i think that's that's very true because um how then do we really identify who amongst us need help and i think here's where uh i'll throw in three letters you know government mama said acronyms right so we have look listen and link right so look just look out for a person's behavior right do i look like i'm a little listless do i look like i have lost interest in usually the things i'm passionate about right not looking at their physical appearance but looking at yeah behavior yeah right so second l is listen listen to what the person is saying is he or she saying something that hey usually you don't sound so pessimistic and these are all signs and symptoms so look listen and then you talk to that person in the process of listening and then if you realize that hey this person possibly has a problem then we link link to what link to the resources linking to persons around him or her who loves him or her because all of us have you know at least a few persons that loves us in our life right and and we go to them for comfort we go to them to re-center and refocus ourselves to recharge our inner core during this pandemic right i think a lot of people who are also like business leaders or you know you know like owners co-founders right they face a lot of stress like they will see like you know their colleagues having lower morale and that is look we see a problem yes right and then we listen they will tell us oh i'm i'm overworked right i feel very lost i'm very upset right and then the problem where we struggle is the link like as a boss i personally feel like it's too personal for me to say hey you should be doing this because i feel like we don't have that relationship but what can i possibly do simple you take out your company's organizational chat it's quite a big group right and then you look at that employee they're concerned about who are the friends the good friends around that person so have that person reach out and get a rough sense of hey what's going on is there anything going on at work in family life or things like that so it's a little bit of detective role in finding out hey what's the angle we can come in to help and our intention really is because we love that person right and we really want to be somebody useful and somebody constructive in that person's life to help him or her and the moment that that person realizes that hey there's somebody who cares about me i think that makes a world of difference so if you are like you know you know also you know running a company and you're facing the same problem as me i think um what eric just said i think it really helps okay next one when somebody asks me how i'm doing but i also want them to feel sorry for me oh my gosh ah this one oh again it goes back to it's okay not to be okay and i think forwards we are worth it so we are worth it because people around us love us even if it's just one person even if it's just your cat or your dog oh my god no ryan my best friend is my daughter yeah so so long as somebody loves you you are worth it so so don't ever ever say oh okay let's not impinge on others correct correct i think i think as singaporeans or like asians you know or in our society right we just don't want to be a burden and i think that is so real because you know everybody is facing the pandemic everybody also stressed like who am i to tell people i i'm very stressed can you take care of me you give me a bit of attention yeah okay me for a while i think that is hard for every one of us but it's okay just three words right don't buy stuff yeah just go because they love you they will hug you oh my gosh it's quite funny because like we've gotten to the stage like don't pass it just ask for it yeah like we are all burns anyway so we might as well just acknowledge it next one right this one's philosophical so you have a hand then you have another hand and then you do a high five and then the hand sinks into the water yes i think like you know i've been advocating for mental health for maybe two three years yeah right and i realized at the start there was a really a lot less awareness but i think now we're getting really into gradually yeah into the conversations and we are really looking at the nuances and the layers of what constitute mental health right it's really not just depression it also means you know your daily things you know how you look inwards and reflect and all that so i think this pose talks about hey now we are aware but still there is this gap between awareness and action that's where i go back to my triple else okay listen link and i think the link part is the critical part because you look you listen and probably you already know but you don't know how to react you don't know how to respond that's why you give a high five and then the person sings deeper yes absolutely but i think we we ought to be able to know where the help is so there's so many hot lines uh because of the pandemic we set up the national care hotline that's 1 800 202 needs to call this hotline if you think that you need some emotional psychological support go ahead there will be volunteers will be behind the line if need be they can actually make referrals for you the professionals they operate from 8 am to midnight every day but if you think that you're in a crisis that means you're in an emergency you have suicidal thoughts there are also emergency hotlines out there so for instance the sos hotline which is 1-800-221-4444 and there's also the imh hotline which is uh 6389-2222 these are good hotlines to call for emergencies they're on 24 7. so if you think or if you know somebody who is in need of help urgently in crisis mode go for these hotlines so i think a lot of us watching you be like oh this hotline is not for me no i think even i i think that we're like oh it's not for me i'm not that serious yet i think i can deal with it without calling some government hotline because that would make it so official that i'm in trouble but you know let us know who who are these people who actually really call this hotline and you know are there any examples that you know people have actually gotten better after calling these hotlines well it's all anonymized that's why i won't be able to tell you um of uh maybe auntie who and who or student who and who not really but actually if you are really really worried there's also another service which is a community health assessment team chat so they offer a range right can actually make an appointment to go down to skate they actually offer services for youth between 16 to 30. you can make an appointment there'll be actually practitioners there who help you walk you through some services and if they can also make referrals for you if need be and the best thing is this whole process is all anonymized right right yes so the bottom line is you know help yourself and help people around you right so well uh if you're a little bit stressed and you don't get a call hotline i tell you what just call first and then see how later yeah i mean it's there right it's free right it's free yes okay i mean like they're really steady that might as well just try like huh okay next one [Applause] [Music] okay so you know there are even a lot of tick-tock now right yeah like i said you know you really just bring into awareness all these kind of things what do you think you know of this kind of content i think it just points to the fact that hey understanding is not there yet i go back to the surveys that i talked about earlier actually one in five which is like 20 right think that people with mental health conditions should not hold any responsibility at all then what others do yeah so they expect people with mental conditions to just lie down corner i don't know so that speaks to the amount of understanding they have in our society and also about whether you are willing to work with or live near somebody with mental health conditions well it's only a little over five in ten persons in singapore who thinks that yes i can do that so it's only one in two who thinks that what about the other half do you know what's their primary uh primary fear i think it goes back to lack of understanding i think it goes back to the fact that people don't really know that it's actually so prevalent so i know we talked a lot about our downstream uh help right maybe the hotlines or where you can go right but let's talk a little bit about upstream what do you think are certain things every singaporean especially youth can really start adopting so that we are taking care of our health so we don't really get too too serious i think it's just about vocalizing how you feel on a day-to-day basis if you just reach home you just uh i see my wife how was your day and then just say like a lot of us would just say okay laughs yeah like that law yes but beneath like that law is what oh i had a few not so pleasant experiences at work today what are they what makes you feel that way and then decompress some of those thoughts and feelings right we are sometimes so detached from our inner feelings right yes that we think that hey very much yeah okay so for example right i live with my brother and i always ask him how is he uh yeah no like it's quite pisces to continue the conversation but what do you suggest well again what does he like to eat you know does he enjoy coffee does he enjoy a good cup of ice milo dinosaur or whatever it is yeah and then slowly make people comfortable get it out of the chat about their shelves yeah and it's hard to do so for guys i think so that is something that you do um with your family members any other upstream things that we can do non-verbals right just before going out for the day give a hug and show appreciation at work if your staff or your colleagues has done something right say hey that's a great thing that you're done thanks very much when you say you know say thanks i visualize me going out to the person and say thanks and i need so formal yeah and i don't think i can do that you need to organize world ceremony what thank you yeah right so just like simple things even a text would do if that is where you need to get started i think so long as it's heartfelt people get it the next one do you have friends or family that are going through mental struggles such as depression because i do and this is the biggest mistake i make as a friend see my friend suffers from mild depression and every time he gets depressed he falls into this dark hole and seeing him in a dark hole i will always try to give advice to help him get out of the hole but that's wrong that's very wrong we have to realize that when someone has a mental breakdown all they want is for someone to be there for them they don't need no advice they don't need anything logical they just need some emotional support so affirm them let them know that you are there and just be around them advise us they can wait they can wait until they feel better but for now all you have to do is to just be there for them do you agree you know they're so funny you know this reminds me of something at home actually you know typically when men talk to women about problems right okay so typically men are like okay let's go for the solutions yes how do we solve this and when women talk to men about problems and usually it's like okay like empathize with you i just want a heart kind of thing right so there are a couple of times which i i talked to my wife what today at work this and this and this isn't and then my objective was just to get a heart right and then she would tell me oh why don't you try this solution oh wow so she's trying to speak in the way that she thinks she gave me a 10-year series that's it actually yeah all i'm looking for is just some empathy and a heart class most of the times the the men and women dynamics you know the mars and venus thing is like that lah but sometimes it gets reversed and we often go back to one uh one joke about myself you know always all these personality tests right yes yeah and a lot one of these tests was uh let's find out how man or how woman you are okay so my wife said take the test i think i was like 80 women oh wow i mean for family right i think it's easier to say hey what i'm i'm looking for is just listening here and you just sit there there but let's say in a work context okay how how do we help somebody who's telling us their problems he think really is before you say anything just make sure that you're listening very hard trying to make sense of what the person is saying right and trying to empathize trying to be in her or in his shoes to try to understand from his or her point of view hey what's going on before you offer solutions this is the last one okay imagine what a perfect life might look like i'm not sure what i even want but it made me realize that some things i would keep i think the understanding for this one right is i guess for every singaporean every year out there we do have a life that is ideal for us a life that we used to be sick but at the end of the day halfway through seeking it will realize is this what i even want right have you ever felt this way and how did you deal with it actually a lot of us a lot of us just go through life without giving much thought as to hey where are we trying to get to right so i think it's good once in a while to really just sit down go to the gardens slide on the grass look at the sky really deep breaths you don't have to take a very long time 15 minutes to do right and then just take deep breaths i think deep breaths for me really work because it helps you re-center refocus and gets that blood bumping in the right way again and then really think about hey what is life about for you it's going to be different for all of us but we need to spend that time to really give some thought to it and get in touch really with your inner self right and they're deep breaths yeah and it's freela and you can just do it like right now when you're watching this video exactly so the final question okay i know you already mentioned you know since the start of last year you have already like a thousand over participants and volunteers so let's say if somebody who is watching yes they're taking that deep breath and they already feel better good very sad right yeah yes and they want to join right what what can we do very simple go to reach.golf.sg

khMfvU7uqNE,Singapore to launch pilots to vaccinate senior citizens against COVID-19 from Jan 27,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2021-01-22T10:38:34Z,Singapore will launch COVID-19 vaccination for senior citizens starting with pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar from Jan 27. Vaccinations will be ...,hey ministers uh johnson from today here uh my question is what are you hoping to glean out from these pilot fascination programs and what are the things that are still quite unknown about destinating a population that you hope to actually learn and whether this vaccination program is a two dose kind of a vaccination program we're hoping to go up to the ten thousand people two doses rather than just one ghost and a second related note is i noted in the press release that it said 39 ncid staff had completed two doses my understanding is that there were 40 who went through the first round of vaccinations so what happened maybe i asked dms to respond to the issue on the vaccinated numbers well i'm going to answer both your questions i'll start first with the pilots the purpose of the pilots is to make sure that the processes we put in place are robust enough that when we now start dealing with a larger group of people coming to the vaccination center to be vaccinated that this will be a most efficient process but also at the same time a safe process for all that comfort for vaccination each site where we set up a vaccination facility has its own unique challenges because the location is a bit different we started out with vaccination facilities in our hospitals and in the hospitals there were ready facilities that we could use to provide safe care and there was a lot of stuff that were present we also performed vaccinations at our poly clinics that required a different set of design of the the facilities given that the space constraints within the poly clinic were very different compared to in the hospitals and as we set up the vaccination centers this required us to design the placement and location of the stations to maximize the use of space to accommodate a larger group of people coming in but at the same time to make sure that the vaccinations were safe now we're talking about pilots where we want to bring seniors coming into the vaccination centers and seniors will have their own challenges some may have mobility issues others may have other concurrent medical conditions that require a lot more attention to be paid to ensure that we can observe them safely and and have them uh uh uh looked after properly within the vaccination centers and that requires us then to work out those processes through these two pilots once we are confident that the processes are tweaked and are optimized and we are confident that we can look after our seniors properly we are then going to roll this out opening up new centers scaling up the capacity for vaccinations with each center and then increase the throughput for vaccination for seniors in all the centers that we set up so that explains why we still need to carry out several other pilots as we open up for a new uh a group of uh our population that is to be vaccinated uh you're right that we started out with a about 40 healthcare workers being vaccinated we have recommended that they should have their vaccination the second dose of vaccinations 21 days later but it's not always possible for individuals to come in and have that done exactly and on that same day for a variety of different reasons some people may be working at that point in time and therefore when we actually had the original cohort of staff that came from ncid having their vaccinations it turned out that we had 39 being vaccinated on that first day but i'm quite optimistic that the remaining healthcare worker will eventually also get vaccinated it's just a matter of straddling and the difference in dates does not lead to any significant impact in the benefit of vaccination for the healthcare staff it's a scheduling issue and it's also when they're available to come forward to get that second dose done thank you i should just add that one of the purpose of the pilot is also to ensure that because the target group for the first batch are the seniors and we will also need to test our messaging our explanation our outreach to make sure that we are able to reach out to them as i mentioned i think during the previous press conference that seniors is a very challenging group for us because many of them are states staying at home they don't come out because of the kobe 19 situation so it's not so easy to reach out to them and this is one of the areas that we want to also pilot in conjunction with the people's association how we can effectively reach out to this group of seniors to share to explain to them the process and to help them go through the process the lessons that we learned from this pilot will then be implemented in subsequent vaccination efforts that we roll out so this way for the subsequent batches of seniors it will be a much easier and more simpler process for them that has been tested and this is will give us more confidence in rolling out the programs a larger skill for the seniors in time to come ,True,True,False,False
azZoksSWL5I,"How Are Singapore&#39;s Migrant Workers Coping With COVID-19 Restrictions, One Year On? | Talking Point",UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2021-02-17T12:00:00Z,"It's been one year since the deadly COVID-19 virus hit foreign worker dormitories, forcing a lockdown. But months have passed since migrant workers have ...",it's very squeezy and uncomfortable to having dinner inside the room it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail these aren't videos from a year ago they were given to us just a few weeks back it's been 11 months since the kovic 19 virus exploded in foreign worker dormitories and a total lockdown was declared since then dormitories have been cleared of the virus and migrant workers have gone back to work the pandemic put a spotlight on the 300 000 or so foreign workers who are housed in mass dormitories [Music] their living conditions provided the perfect storm for a pandemic to spread one year on i find out what's being done to control the infection in dorms and its impact on our foreign workers hi over the course of three months we contacted migrant workers for their stories in this episode of talking point i'm going to show you their lives through their eyes unfiltered later on this is my dormitory here is a playground before we played here but now it's totally restricted my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook so we have to choose cattle our dining area still empty we are not allowed to come here and eat we have to take our meal inside the room one room got 12 people if we want to go supermarket to buy something groceries we have to change our pass while some of our migrant workers live in accommodations such as rented and private housing about half of them live in mass dormitories all located in obscure parts of singapore it was in these dorms where coven-19 cases exploded leading to over 150 000 workers infected the government moved in to seal off the dorms began a regime of mass testing disinfecting the premises and instituting safe distancing measures by august infection rates dropped and the lockdown was lifted most workers could go back to work i asked those who live in dormitories to tell me what life is like for them now staircase also medicated we are not allowed to take staircase while we are collecting our food from the catering we have to take a long queue to collect foods or buy foods so all the migraine workers are depressed right now following all rules and regulation restriction video stood out to me the most so i'm giving him a call to find out more sakib works as a safety coordinator and has been living in singapore for 11 years it's been about five months since his dormitory was released from lockdown [Music] we are not really allowed to go out on the field or any playground we are not even allowed to gathering on corridor yeah we are only allowed to go to toilet use toilet and come back to our room we are not really able to go all those facilities system like cooking and sports zone or physical exercise because the restriction is still in there before covet 19 struck workers could access these facilities and congregate in open spaces freely so do you feel like you are still in lockdown yeah i do feel because i'm not really able to go out in community and i'm not really able to take any public transport and i'm not really able to cook yet and i'm not able to go to playground there is so many restrictions still in my room so i feel actually i mean [Music] i can totally understand why there are restrictions i mean even for you and i we've got all these new social distancing rules because of this pandemic but i can't help but wonder if the rules imposed on our migrant workers are a bit too much [Music] i want to experience for myself what life in a dorm under these restrictions is like i was denied access into sakif's dorm but i was allowed to visit another dormitory ten months ago this place was declared an isolation area it was one of the first few dormitories in singapore to be identified as a covet-19 cluster at that time about 7 000 migrant workers here were under lockdown one of them is surge good morning good morning prepare myself fast food packing so can you leave the room for work anytime you no no no like i only transport timing only i go back outside to minimize congestion workers can only leave their room for work at designated times so just now behind there is the last scan yeah this one last scan can go out for work hd wordpress this one permit green means can go out for work i am a healthy uh red means not allowed to work oh and how do they find out you know if you're green red yeah this one tasting surface blood test workers and dormitories are tested for covet 19 every two weeks all right thank you i'll see you at night while suresh is at work i noticed the barricades outside and inside the dormitory i've asked to speak to the man in charge of this dormitory i want to know if all of this is necessary jimmy why are there all these restrictions in dormitories these restrictive measures are very very important in order to indicate the infection weights therefore it's really really necessary to reduce the crowding and also our co-mingling of the workers within the dormitory so as you can see this is the segregation measures or even the new entry points basically ensure that we have multiple releasing points in this dormitory so as to ensure that the residuals go in and out of the dormitory swiftly and also go through the necessary checks so definitely the intention is to try to keep them safe and well socially distanced right that's right there's a definite lack of social interaction now have the workers gotten used to that well they have no choice practically we realize that they do need to have some social life they do need to entertain [Music] it's 8 pm and suresh has just returned from work as the residents here aren't allowed to eat in the canteen for now they can take away food from there or cook their own dinner something that this dormitory unlike at suckabs has provided for [Music] [Music] suresh after work what do you do in your free time after work for coming room after dress up cooking then makan go bed now see movies play games phone home calling just things so before covet what did you used to do when you were free before covet i sometimes free time i go out just i sometime only i meet my friends do you miss doing those things that you used to do yeah miss but no choice from what i see suresh is allowed to cook and it's not very cramped where he eats since my visit to his dorm the gym has opened up and communal sports have resumed but i'm discovering that restrictions differ across dormitories with some being more stringent than others and as i'm about to find out strict rules don't just apply within the dorms but even on the one day these workers are supposed to get their rest and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes [Music] i'm in little india typically on a sunday you'd see many foreign workers gather in open spaces like these to socialize or to play games but today it's noticeably quiet as evening falls i try to speak to some of the migrant workers but finding ones who stay in dormitories is proving to be challenging oh do you stay in a dormitory no damage no no i use the house no dormitory company house and i soon find out why your friends were in the dormitory what are they allowed to do they're allowed to two hour or one hour later three hour the government give the permission the dormitory people they give permission only they go out forever and so you don't need them a long time never sit there last time have contact but now they cannot come out you ever know what they do on the resident of they also they stay in the house or dormitory inside these workers i'm meeting don't stay in dormitories so they're not subjected to the same kind of restrictions since the pandemic migrant workers living in dormitories can only go to purpose-built recreation centers on their rest days these centers have amenities like fnb outlets a barber remington service and a supermarket i'm waiting for kavikuma he typically comes to this recreation center in sambawang once a week i want to know if that's enough for him hi hey kavi did you come for the dormitory yes how do you normally come here i just  only take the bubbly kavi is allowed to go to a recreation center only because he comes from a dorm clear of covet 19. still he needs to produce a negative swap test and apply for an exit pass he is only allowed to go to a recreation center assigned to him to apply for an exit permit like how long does it normally yeah so at least two days or one days before we have to apply and when you come out how long are you allowed to spend here only three hours three hours yes that's it yeah but no enough but no choice we are only allowed three hours are you shopping today [Music] so you mentioned that you are here for three hours yeah is that enough for you of course no enough because normally we are only a load work and come back to dom yeah uh only one day alone exit was to come here so also i only allowed rc i'm not going to other place so what do you think you missed the most mostly is that i cannot see my relative here because only i can see that uh my dormitory my co-workers this other thing i really miss thank you okay thanks so much man for bringing me okay thank you bye bye after seeing what a recreation center is like and talking to kavi i can see why he wants to come here more often just so he can maximize his time outside the dormitory but even then he only has three hours a week outside and that includes travel time [Music] go liberation center then come back send money only because so boring our company lori bring and bring back to home it takes one and a half hour left one and a half hour i really couldn't make my time to meet friends and have fun for me it's not enough because it's very small small small place it's very sad for me because i cannot do anything like in jail just go go eating only eating watching movie like that and then go on bed lying in bed resting that's why it's very hard from us hi i'm good thanks for having me these strict rules imposed on our migrant workers have been going on months after lockdown it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people and i'm about to find out the dire effects i've been tracking migrant workers to hear their stories about what life has been like since covet 19 exploded in their dormitories this is the picture i'm getting the dorms me no longer being locked down but some of these workers still aren't able to do the things that they used to like gather with their friends for a meal and this is not just within the dormitories but even outside on their day off but just being able to spend their rest day outside is so troublesome that many choose to stay in i'm meeting rashid early this year his company moved him to a private accommodation as his dormitory was too far from his current work site yeah hi how are you i'm good thanks for having me over yeah thank you also this is where you stay now uh yes it's my accommodation nice russia tells me life is better living outside of dormitory but i'm surprised to learn he is still facing restrictions if i extend dormitory they have all the rules given by the dormitory and mom and government also need to follow here also i need to follow but still i don't uh go around like shopping mall or anything i just go out for my essential to buy food only so even though you don't stay in a dormitory yes you still have restrictions yes why is that restriction is uh from government uh mom bca as i am a safety personnel in my job site so i need to follow the bca requirements all those requirements they have still now we don't have any approval to go outside like as before so how do you feel now that you can't really do those things it's like feel something mentally depressed because uh you know that we are people we also need refresh my our mind how do you cope with that kind of feeling like how do you make yourself feel better i doing a lot of voluntary job as i am mentally depressed last time so i trying to teach other person who also mentally depressed i'm a safety coordinator for jobsite in my company and my job to take care all my company people whoever working in my side or outside so i have to take care of their health how are they feeling every single person have different feeling so in this case few of them they say they are very bored because during kobe they cannot go home leave so they miss their family few of them they say they are mentally not so good advocacy groups have pointed to prolonged confinement and job uncertainties affecting the mental state of many migrant workers in singapore so much so that a government task force was set up in november to enhance mental care support among the initiatives deploying public officers to dormitories so they can look out for workers who may be showing signs of anxiety or stress [Music] after months talking to our migrant workers i'm taking what i've learned to the manpower ministry martin cole oversees all the plans rolled out by the ministry's new division ace set up to take the lead in the fight against covet 19 in foreign worker dormitories [Music] martin i've been speaking to some migrant workers after lockdown and they brought up some issues which i was hoping that you could answer so firstly within the dorms they're going back to work but they still have some restrictions my cooking area is totally locked nobody allowed to enter or cook what's your response to that there are dorms that have on sweet cooking facilities now those that have communal cooking facilities that was where we had the restriction we were trying to control the the infection the transmission but we have already lifted it and we have invited dorm operators to apply to mom so that we are satisfied that the safe management measures are all in place currently we are staying at 10 this room is still 16 bed inside in terms of sleeping arrangements some of them have mentioned that yes there are fewer people but there's still the same number of bids in the room which means they don't have the kind of space that they need give us some time for the dom operators to do something about it we are working very closely with the dome operators to make sure that we continue with this de-densification effort i cannot go follow bus cannot go mrt is it true that dormitory workers are not allowed to take public transport at all for work activities we require employers to provide transport to and from work because when it comes to peak hour traffic the risk of transmission is the highest and when we have large groups of workers going out to work using public transport that's where we introduce this transmission risk in both directions between the dorm workers as well as the community but when it comes to other activities other than work while we strongly encourage employers to arrange transport we allow public transport because the transmission risk is a lot lower so migrant workers are allowed to take public transport as long as it is not during peak periods do you see the restriction on public transport changing anytime soon unfortunately for as long as kovit is with us i would say that i don't see it changing three hours you can go out and then come back that's it they're only allowed to go to the recreation centers and back for three hours when will this change we have already have plans to increase the frequency of visits to the recreation center and for longer and you can expect positive changes this quarter wow okay that's great news for them then given that we don't really see an end to this pandemic at this moment how would we go about improving the lives of the workers who stay in dormitories so we have already have seven quick build dorms that have been launched they have improved the specifications to improve the living environment for the workers as well as to make them more resilient to infection over the next the course of the year we will be launching more quick build dorms and to increase the number of paid spaces to about 25 000 quick built dorms are a temporary measure and will serve as a guide for more permanent solutions to our migrant worker housing so one year on because of all the robust measures in place covert 19 infection rates among our migrant workers have drastically gone down yes some are still struggling to adapt to the new normal but things are looking up this could be the future of migrant worker dorms in singapore more spacious rooms each with five single beds spaced at least one meter apart compared to a typical dormitory where up to 16 workers can share a room the room also comes with an ensuite toilet shower and sink outside there are also larger communal spaces like dedicated kitchens and shared amenities like a minimal thanks so a silver lining to this pandemic is that it has accelerated plans to improve the living conditions of our migrant workers but what they really hope for is to be able to rejoin the community i hope our restrictions have to pull out and giving us space to have release our stress i hope we can go around singapore and eat at the hawker center let us to go outside even once a month like that because we need to relax also our mind

zDx1LKkk5c4,Q&amp;A on COVID-19 and mental health --  #askWHO  -- with WHO&#39;s Aiysha Malik,UC07-dOwgza1IguKA86jqxNA,World Health Organization (WHO),2020-03-11T14:09:03Z,"Recorded version of the live Q&A on mental health during COVID-19, with Aiysha Malik, Mental Health expert at WHO speaking with Sari Setiogi, Head of WHO's ...",[Music] hi good afternoon good morning and good evening thank you for joining our life today from WH o headquarters in Geneva Switzerland we're live today on Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter and we're going to talk about coronavirus or the cove at 19 as you have heard in the news a lot so the disease have affect people from many countries and in January 2020 w-h-o have declared as a public health of emergency and for this outbreak we know that we are not only fighting the virus but we are also managing stigma fear and discrimination so today I'm sitting here with our mental health expert i sha malik to talk about why is it important to to talk to understand about the mental health aspect on this disease so I sure can you explain to our audience today why is it important to to understand about the mental health on covered 19 thanks sorry so ah sorry said we're not just talking about an outbreak of kovin 19 what we're also seeing is an increase in the anxiety that people are experiencing so it's really important to think about mental health as part of the public health response to covin 19 we know that in emergency situations the mental health can decline in the population and that there's a high rate of mental health conditions so people who might be vulnerable to experiencing mental health or stress during this time might include people who have pre-existing mental health conditions or substance use conditions in the community or who might represent other vulnerable groups who are vulnerable to stress so we're not just talking about protection from covert 19 but we're also talking about prevention of stress and fear during this event as well thank you Oshin and if you have any questions for Aisha around a mental health on Kovac nineteen corona the new coronavirus ascend in your question as comment on facebook and linkedin and on twitter you can tweet and use hashtag as w-h-o so I should there's a lot of fear spreading right now around the new corona virus should we actually be scared or is it a be the result of the spread of misinformation that people see in social media in the news can you tell us more about that sure so fear is a response to perceived or actual threat or danger and closely linked to that is anxiety or worry or stress which can come about when things are uncertain or unknown or unclear to us and ask Ovid 19 is a new virus and as we are still learning very much about this although tremendous work has already taken place already to learn about the virus it naturally can elicit these types of feelings so you will hear this message repeated quite a lot but it's really important to bear in mind that fear and anxiety is part of the normal response to this new situation so many things can cause fear and one of those things are is misinformation and rumors so this is something that can exacerbate people's fear and it's why a repeated message for managing fear in the cove in nineteen response is to to get fat so fat minimize fear and these facts can be obtained from credible sources or trusted scientific sources for example w-h-o or your national or local public health body as well in in terms of fear many of you might not think that you're experiencing fear or worry or some of you might be thinking that way it can express itself in various different ways so you might be experiencing a high level of questions that your arms asking yourself or a high number of thoughts that you're having so questions like how do I protect myself how do I protect others what's going to happen with my workplace these are all very natural questions to be asking and if you're asking these questions then I would again encourage you to go find the facts and get the answers as well so fear is something that's designed to keep us safe so it makes us take action to keep ourselves safe but sometimes the actions that we take might be inadvertently harmful to ourself or to others so this can include things like stigma this can include panic like behaviors it can include things like overwatching distressing sources of information so sometimes fear can be both helpful and keep us safe but also could be harmful as well and so it's important for us to think about how do we manage that fear Thank You Ayesha and there's a lot of information on our website you can go to www.imtcva.org I shall understand fear there is also a lot of discrimination and stigma particularly affecting the Chinese population because the outbreak started in China can you explain why this is happening and what is the solution okay so stigma or health-related stigma is something that can arise where a sense of disapproval or shame is attributed to a person because of their association with a health condition so here we're talking about kovat and what that does is it can result in the experiences of rejection or exclusion or acts of discrimination and these acts of discrimination can be very harmful physically and mentally for that group so our main message here is around the use of language to fight stigma so words are very powerful words can create stigma but that also means that words and the words that we choose to use can minimize stigma as well so for example one thing that we would encourage is not to attribute co vid 19 to any specific socio demographic so that could include for example ethnicity or nationality or geography kofi 19 can and has affected people from various different backgrounds it's a global issue and it's important to not attach it to a particular identity group because it can affect acts of discrimination towards that group or people who might be perceived as belonging to that group so language also can go beyond that as well so we can also think about how do we use language when we talk about kovat 19 one of the things that we can do is something called a separating covert 19 from the person that you're describing rather than giving them the identity bike Ovid 19 so in English what I mean by this is you would prefer to say a person has kovat 19 or a person who is recovering from Co vid 19 rather than attaching the label to the person for example The Cove in nineteen case Cove in nineteen family other examples of how we can think sensitively about our language in order to minimize stigma is to not use terms such as victims or suspected cases these are words the can arise anxiety and so it's better to use alternative phrasing so keeping your language as person-centered as possible an another important way to address stigma and discrimination is to really think about messages which evoke empathy messages which invoke compassion and which invoke evoke kindness so one way that this could be achieved is to start sharing stories which are around hope or positive messages like recovery so stories about recovery or stories about loved ones supporting a person who is unwell during that time or about communities supporting each other so we've heard impress briefings this week some very nice stories coming from communities who have been supporting family members of health workers who are responding took over in nineteen and on top of these actions that are constructive that you can do the community in the public play a huge role in tackling stigma and discrimination so you can yourselves be advocates for using these kinds of language tips that we've given and also for addressing any misconceptions or rumors or misinformation that's been spreading so I would encourage everyone to take a role in that this is something we can all participate in and we also have guidance aren't available on the WHI website which will give you some tips on the kinds of things that you can do to tackle stigma so we all have a role yes sure okay so we actually started getting questions from the audience thank you for sending your questions and I will be checking my phone every now and then and apologize for that because I need to read the questions so I should the first question is from Vasuki Vasudevan it's a good question as parents how do we cope with distress I'm following the news and all that about the coronavirus and how to how to talk with children about discovered 19m hmm it's a really good question it's a very important thing to be thinking about in terms of mental health considerations when we think about the stress that young people might be experiencing and in turn that role that parents might have as part of alleviating that stress so during a situation like this and it very much depends on the situation in your own community children will experience stress also children can experience stress and they might present in many different ways they could be more attached to you or more clingy to you they could be sad or crying or withdrawn or even to the point of bedwetting if they're very anxious so children express stress in different ways and what we encourage is for parents to give as much love and attention and their time to comforting their children if they are experiencing this now children are very smart they're very perceptive they can tell if something is different or something has changed for example perhaps you're having as a parent who's working perhaps you're having to work at home more and your child has noticed that or perhaps their school has closed and they've noticed that as well so children are perceptive to these changes and will naturally ask questions what we would do is encourage you as parents or caregivers of young people to be as honest as possible with them because giving children clear messages about the situation in a way that's adapted for their age can help them to understand what's going on so remember again the the idea of facts minimizing fear applies to every part of the population whether you're a young person or a parent if you if you're in a situation where you're having to spend more time at home or your kids have had to come off school we would encourage you to try to maintain as normal routine as possible for that child so helping them to retain on to some sort of normality and if that's not possible to create new routines which include times for playing and times for learning if that's possible so there's a big role that caregivers can play in this great at my so I think going back to individuals people who are facing discrimination in a question from Mahad iemon how can we provide support to this individuals who are facing discrimination because of this coronavirus that's a really nice question and I'm really glad you've asked that question because it really for me emphasizes that all of us have a role to play when it comes to supporting those who might be additionally affected by the current situation so in this regard I would say to make sure that you're providing is much kindness and compassion to that person as possible you can use principles called psychological first aid principles and that information is also available on our website where you're giving practical but emotional supports to that person if they need it I also talked about before all the actions that you can take to help to tackle stigma so around using certain types of language and also around your role in correcting any misconceptions or misinformation or Mis uses of language out there so that's another activity that you could do at the higher level if you feel that your friend or is really affected by this experience that they've had if they've had direct discrimination you can encourage your friend if they need to to reach out and seek social support from a trusted person so that could be someone in their social circle like yourself or like a another friend or a family member if needed it can also include seeking specialist supports from mental health and psychosocial services if they're available in your area if your friends well-being really declines good advice again so with this coronavirus some countries are asking people to do self quarantine or for visitor who just came to do we just come into the country to be under quarantine I get a question from remya or not to what kind of support we can give to reduce the anxiety for people who are on current e ha yeah really impulsive question being in some form of isolation or quarantine is a challenging experience for your mental well-being we advocate very heavily around social support being very good for your mental health but the idea of isolation or quarantine means that that can be a little bit limited that's not always the case it could be that your self isolating at home but you've still got other family members or friends in the house all that you're in quarantine and that there are other people that might be accessible to you if possible keep maintaining your social contacts within reason if in person according to the health guidance of your country otherwise if you have this accessible to you digital methods of communication or even phone it's a really good way to keep maintaining your social contact and it's something in particular to think about with adolescents during this time now when you're in isolation another important thing to do is still to continue if possible maintaining your routines to maintain a sense of normality and when I say maintaining a routines this is because it includes self-care strategies so you're eating well trying to make sure you get enough rest and sleep and trying to get physical activity as well so these are all things that you can do it when you're in isolation and also activities that stimulate your mind or the earth what we call cognitively stimulating can be quite good as well so a number of number of different simple actions that you can take to help minimize stress during during that time thanks Asian we talked earlier about children now we get a question from Andrea Quinta from Portugal who asked how can she help her parents to to cope with their anxiety about the coronavirus Oh so this is this Andrea asking as a child yes parents is 66 years old oh okay so really important question so I see we were talking about children earlier and now we're talking about actually our parents who might be older adult population so older adults vary in many different ways and what is important for older adults is ensuring that they have the facts and the information presented to them in a very clear way so again just reiterating that facts can help to minimize fear what can be helpful for older adults is to think about making sure that the information that they're receiving about how to protect themselves is clearly presented and is something that they're able to understand and implement for themselves so this is a very simple action that can be taken similarly all the advice about taking care of yourself so the healthy diet healthy sleeping healthy exercise or some form of physical activity can also be applied to older adults as well so this can be among some of the things that you're recommending to your parents if they're in if they're in that population now there are a variety of things that we also need to think about with the older adult population some people might have cognitive decline or a dementia and there we need to think a little bit more about how the messages are given to ensure that they're able to protect themselves so you might need to make adaptations you might find that you're needing to repeat that you're presenting information more simply using simple languages or even presenting it using images or pictorially this can be an important adaptation to make and this is something that can be helpful to minimize the stress of older adults at that time Nayla abu muhammad ani i hope i read a name correctly asked about what about health care providers who are taking patients with Kove in nineteen I mean with the number of patients I think they they're also affected and how can they take care of their mental health yeah that's a really excellent question and I'm glad that you asked this so health care workers or anyone that is responding at this moment in time in health facilities to Co viet 19 are under a lot of pressure at the moment they might be experiencing longer work hours higher demands on them many pressures and on top of that the fear around kovat as well which affects all members of the public and this can be detrimental to workers mental health and their stress and so it's important for people that are responding to recognize and be aware of the fact that it's very likely many of your colleagues feel the same way and feeling stressed in this situation a little bit like fear can sometimes be helpful it's probably keeping you motivated and active in your job and it's important to think about managing your stress as well as protecting yourself physically during the kovat 19 response because the better your mental well-being during this time the better capacity you will have to be able to do your job so it is important to think about stress management as well so again the same things apply to health workers in terms of looking after yourselves as it does for all members of the populations so your self-care strategies around seeking social supports looking after your health your diet your physical activity and also thinking about what are the strategies that you might have used before to help you cope with stress many of you might not have experienced a situation like covarine before that's okay the situation may be different but the strategies for managing stress are the same and it's really important as well for health workers to think about and everyone to think about minimizing strategies which might not be very helpful for you so these are things that feel really good in the short-term like having alcohol or having tobacco or drugs but actually in the long-term don't benefit your mental well-being so many things that health workers can think about but on top of that we are talking about a workplace situation where health workers have managers or leaders of health facilities so it's also important for managers to think about the idea that protecting their health workers from chronic stress will benefit that worker encouraging things such as taking breaks so encouraging them and modeling them can be very helpful for your health worker population rotating workers from high stress to low stress functions or pairing experienced workers with inexperienced workers or other forms of the buddy system can be really helpful and just like everybody else making sure that your team that responding to Co vid are kept up-to-date with the information so that's all the members of your team this can really help with managing stress at the time and finally that managers themselves are probably under undue pressure in this in this moment so it's important for them to model self-care strategies so it benefits them and is a good representation to their workers great we're getting a lot of interesting questions I think people are asking for a different group of the population we have a question from Heather Dawson who asked so as a mental health practitioner how do we control the anxiety of those who are most vulnerable for example the homeless substance addicted and severely mentally ill yeah yeah really nice question Heather about what how do we best support people who are currently experiencing mental health or substance use conditions or who might be at risk of experiencing stress such as a homeless population I think at this time it's very important to make sure that those people who are experiencing mental health and substance use conditions still have access to the treatment that they need whether that's in person medical treatment or psychological treatment or medication treatment that it's important that that support is still in place during this time and that's something really important to think about particularly around where people might have to self isolate so as I said earlier the situation like this can really exacerbate the stress of the population and can really exacerbate stress or potentially lead to relapse for people who do have existing conditions so it's important to ensure that that care is still in place and the mental health practitioners or mental health and psychosocial support practitioners a well-placed to provide this support many practitioners might not have had the experience of being in a public health emergency like this and I would encourage them to get some training to make sure that they are having the capacity to respond to people at this time so those are some of the messages to think about in this scenario Thanks hm there's also a question from Carlos Rivera Rosario thank you for your question this is about employers how can employers work with their employees for mental health in the workplace in relation to covered 19 yeah great question Carlos so again what's important in the workplace is the role that employers can play in disseminating information that can help with various aspects of the response to kovat 19 whether that's information about how you protect yourself physically so for example to the hand-washing and so forth but also how employees can be protected from their stress management as well so previously we've encouraged that employees have an active role in this whether it's disseminating that information by email or having posters of the same should be done for stress management as well and on top of that fundamentally this is around your employees having access to factual credible up-to-date information so encouraging accessing those resources is something that employers can do as well because facts will help with answering the questions that your employees might have and providing forums to have conversations provide an opportunity for employees to ask questions can also be something that's very beneficial at this time to address the questions that your employees might be having that might be causing them some anxiety it's a question from Tenzin chakra asking about what about meditation for those who are stressed really nice question something that we encourage is strategies that you have used in the past which have you have found to be helpful to you which have helped you to relax or to minimize your stress or minimize anxiety would really strongly encourage carrying on with those activities as long as they are helpful and safe for you so meditation could be one of those activities and there are many other activities that people might have found has been helpful in the past for them to manage stress and it's something that they can implement now so that I think that's a very nice message and another example of positive actions that people can take something that can be shared and encouraged in others another interesting question from who and Carlos Lopez in Madrid I believe who asked in relation of schools being closed either because there are case there is confirm covet 19 patient or as a precautionary his question is how to reduce fear about covet 19 among students and possible bullying consequences for children who are infected 19 interesting question very interesting question 1 and I'm making the assumption that with the way that you've asked the question that you're talking about a school that hasn't closed yet so you're talking about situations where students after or maybe afterwards situations where they might be bullying so really important point and actually ties into what we've been talking about earlier in this conversation which is around stigma and stigma having an impact on the acts of discrimination that people can take and bullying between young people is one of those examples so if a school is still in session this is an opportunity for schools to be able to disseminate the information which helps to tackle stigma so these are the things we were talking about earlier around not attaching kovat 19 to any particular socio demographic or nationality or geography because by doing so we can increase the likelihood of discrimination towards people who identify from those groups or who are perceived to be identifying from those groups so there's that's one aspect of it now if schools not in session this is something that parents or caregivers of young people can address as well so addressing how to manage the fear around a covert 19 so encouraging young people in a way that's adapted to that person's developmental ability and their understanding around what the facts are how to protect yourself and methods for managing well-being and stress so for example maintaining your routines maintaining a healthy lifestyle at home and encouraging times for play and learning if that's possible and additionally social support as well so keeping in as much contact with each other if not in person then digitally if that's an option if you're young if your child or for person that you know experienced bullying or continues to experience bullying in the community and it's something that is causing them a lot of distress we know there's a link between bullying and mental health then I would really encourage social support around that person and for that person to seek further support through local services and local providers to help them manage the distress that they're experiencing great there's a question from Twitter about the noose on coronavirus because there are so much so many reporting about this coronavirus and it affects people when they watch when we hear how to how to react to all this news around us yeah a great great question there's so much information out there at the moment and for some people actually it's quite normal to have so much information coming at us and be quite overwhelmed by it and in fact some people can find the news very distressing at this moment in time so we would really encourage as well as passive managing fear and stress in covert 19 to minimize if it's something that distresses you to minimize the amount of times that you are exposing yourself to news or media and you could even consider limiting you're setting a target to limit yourself for example one to two times a day only something just to reflect on with the news as well is just to remember that the numbers and the the information that's coming through these are numbers but we are talking about people and people's lives so that is just something to reflect on when trying to think about how do we make sure that we have empathy and kindness as part of our response to kovin 19 and a question from Jenny Chung about the panic buying when people are buying toilet papers past our canned food why do people behave this way and should they what should they do okay so I said earlier the fear is something that our we're all designed to experience fear because fear is something that can help to keep us safe and fear is something that we experience in the face of perceived or actual danger or weather where there's uncertainty something unknown something unclear so fear can sometimes lead us to take actions which help to keep ourselves safe and sometimes it can lead us to actions which might not be beneficial for us and might not be beneficial for others so this is something that fear does if we're experiencing a lot of fear and engaging in actions which perhaps aren't helpful or necessary for ourselves or indeed for the benefit of our communities it's it's something that it makes sense in the context of the situation but the advice around this is to think about what are the facts at the moment what does the information say about what you need to do to protect yourself and I think the advice is around making sure you have sufficient resources should you have to self isolate which is for a period of 14 days here is a interesting question that probably some of us experienced this day it's from Twitter my fear is about coughing in public people look at you with suspicion how can I approach or manage situation like that that's a very interesting question as well I think it's an anxiety that is indeed shared by many people the the important thing here is you don't necessarily need to take responsibility for managing other people's responses to you I think ultimately as long as you're following the protection procedures and the coughing etiquette so on that's been advocated by w-h-o that's what's important in this situation so other people I hope you are aware of of the advice that W Terry's been issuing around how to protect yourself for example good coffee but it's not it's not something that we cannot always manage the response towards other people but this is part of why addressing the stigma around covert 19 is is important it is flu season at the moment many people do have coughs and sniffles and when we are talking about coughing etiquette it means coughing to your elbow or cover it with tissue and then after that to throw it away immediately in a bin a closed bin right so one last question is also from Twitter so how can people be made aware not to fear stigma and to act logically so it's not only for themselves but also for others so not affecting other mental health well-being yeah it's a good closing question it's a rip this is a great closing question so overall we're thinking about managing fear during covered but in turn also managing stigma so first of all it's very normal to be experiencing fear and stress during this time facts facts on how you protect yourself how you can protect others are the solution to any misinformation or rumors which can be part of perpetuating some of the stigma at this time and self-care strategies are the way to address your mental health and your stress and manage your well-being at this time and should you experience a deterioration to make sure that you do go seek specialist support if needed minimizing the amount of time that you are exposed to news if it is something that's distressing you is important but also to manage stigma thinking about managing your language so not using terms the attribute stigma on to a particular group of people and also thinking about how to promote empathetic positive messages from around recovery stories around people who've supported another person during this time these can be helpful messages that all the community can participate in to help promote mental well-being and reduce stigma at this moment in time while we're all responding to Kovac 19 Thank You Asia and thank you for everyone who have joined us this afternoon we have people around the world joining our life from South Sudan Myanmar Italy India Malaysia Philippines Portugal Thailand Romania Kazakhstan Australia Denmark Singapore Indonesia Mongolia Costa Rica China Austria South Africa Jamaica Namibia Uganda Pakistan Cambodia and many more so we are all in this together and we all have a role to play as Aishah said so also as our director-general dr.

mdX61H4Rsnw,Inside Tan Tock Seng Hospital&#39;s Fight Against The COVID-19 Pandemic,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2020-09-13T16:46:52Z,Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) are ground zero for the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore. (Update: On ...,[Music] more than 26 million infected around the world hundreds of thousands have died that's a world war type of scenario world war casualty figures the first case of covet 19 emerges in uhan china in november 2019. in january 2020 singapore confirms its first case of the novel coronavirus the fight against what will become a global pandemic is about to get tougher and last much longer than healthcare workers can even imagine overnight we saw three times more singaporeans coming to our screening center my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited wart we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases i didn't sleep that day how do i feel one word sums it up tired tantoxing hospital is one of singapore's largest multidisciplinary hospitals next door under the sea management is the national center for infectious diseases which officially opened its doors just four months before the biggest public health crisis in the recent history of the city-state over the course of eight months in 2020 both will screen a total of more than 35 000 people for covet 19 and award thousands of infected cases almost every single staff member will be pulled into the war on the virus and it starts like this on the 30th of december there was reports from china that there were clusters of atypical pneumonia happening in muhan and the cost of it is unknown that signals that there could be something unusual happening and it's something that we need to watch closely for dr angela chao heads the department of clinical epidemiology at ncid one of its tasks is to look out for data on infectious disease trends around the world so every day they were monitoring for diseases very closely and receiving influenza and it also tells you where the countries the areas where there are active transmission or even users three days after the news from china singapore begins to screen all inbound travelers from uhan although the cause of the outbreak there is still unclear ttsh and ncid go into full outbreak mode it was never in any point in time in doubt in our mind that it would spare singapore professor leo eason was at the forefront of singapore's fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in the early 2000s which claimed 33 lives two of them were her colleagues at ttsh a very painful experience taught us that our systems need to be ready in the sas aftermath the hospital developed a comprehensive outbreak playbook every staff is assigned a role to play in event of an outbreak and hospital-wide drills are conducted at least once a year planning is an essential part of our state of readiness it makes an outbreak a known unknown realistically speaking dr ang hao who joined the hospital shortly before the sars outbreak now leads its emergency department which is singapore's largest and busiest emergency department has a long established history of running screening for outbreaks during peacetime we already screened partners yellow fever monkey pop ebola plague lassa fever and now kovid 19 this is new working closely with dr ang is dr charmaine manawas who develops the instructions for healthcare staff to screen patients there was a particular period where we had to screen for certain provinces in china so of course everyone isn't versed on where the provinces are so that's why they put the map here once we pick up a travel to these certain countries than they are triage to the fever area four days after screening begins ncid opens its first outbreak award to isolate suspect patients margaret soon is its nursing director with almost 30 years of experience the initial cases definitely is with a lot of anxiety because we know very little we also could tell the staff very little it's a tense period on january 8 chinese officials identify a new coronavirus that's related to sars and mers as the cause of the epidemic a day later its genome is made public scientists in singapore begin their race to develop a test kit among them is a team comprising staff from ttsh and the agency for science technology and research so when the first case arrived we could use our own in-house detection kits to be able to make the diagnosis in china the virus has spread from wuhan to other parts of the hubei province people begin to die from the infection and medical workers are contracting the disease in the line of duty in singapore ttsh isn't taking chances with the safety of its staff its infection control team ensures that everyone from doctors to cleaners is properly trained and equipped to protect themselves [Music] these strict protocols have been meticulously developed over the years by dr brenda aung another sars veteran the role of infection control to limit the spread between patients and also to try and prevent transmission to healthcare workers even contractors are mask fitted [Music] over the rest of january cases emerge elsewhere around asia on january 23rd the same day the chinese government put cities in hupei under lockdown singapore confirms its first case a 66 year old chinese national from uhan who is awarded at the singapore general hospital the day after case number two is confirmed this time at ncid it was actually a tourist from ohan so of course she couldn't quite remember where she's been what she's done finding out where she'd been and who she'd met is the job of dr chao's team in the weeks to come the role of thorough contact tracing will become even more apparent as more is learned about when and how infected persons transmit the virus from the point when they are symptomatic we look back one incubation period so 14 days the history can go back like two three weeks a lot of time to slowly joke their memories to recall where did you go with your daughter you know here i think who have rather active social life that is definitely good it's just it's a bit more challenging when you're trying to do the contact racing um to know exactly where are the places that you went to and what times you went as more close contacts of infected patients are identified the screening load at the emergency department increases ttsh decides to activate the dedicated infectious disease screening center ncid it was a very busy chinese new year for a lot of people not because we were going around celebrating furniture had to be moved in computers had to be set up we actually managed to cut two days off the activation time more nurses are also needed to triage and swap patients we have to draw nurses from various areas including nurses from operating theaters the clinics our nurse educators some of them volunteered actually the whole kang phong is involved so this is my night shift let's go and have a look a nurse at the cardiology department is one of the volunteers we practice and we do the swap on each other i tell you you won't think about do it again so far all confirmed cases here have been travellers from china singapore will restrict entry to all new travelers who've been to mainland china in the last 14 days regardless of nationality but on february 4th the inevitable happens a cluster of infections emerges from a chinese medical hall serving tourists from china the four cases signal the start of communities spread in singapore it also sparks a change in the definition of a suspect case to anyone with recent close contact with travelers from china taxi drivers tour bus drivers people who worked in tourist attractions or hotels and airports casinos they were all flooding in today it was three times more than what we saw the day before the task of making sure they stay ahead of this massive search and demand falls to this place [Music] welcome to the command center of tandoxing hospital this is where we have visibility of the entire operations industry hospital and the national center for infectious diseases this military-inspired command and control center is the first of its kind in a local healthcare facility it's overseen by dr jamie lim the hospital's chief operating officer the screen gives us visibility of the supplies that we have at the screening center how many patients do we have at that point in time we use colors to depict status when it crosses a certain threshold it either turns yellow amber and then the next threshold will be great we don't want to be reactive but we want to be ahead of the signs and sickness on that pivotal night of february 4th c3 system triggered an alarm in a span of 24 hours we open up an additional five words we had to open 100 bids within a day that was really stressful there's just a lot of coordination to making sure that the medications are there lyndon is there but when the bits fill up quickly with suspect cases who present as clinically well the team proposes a new strategy [Music] ncid clinical director sean vasu keeps the health ministry updated regularly we proposed to the ministry a swap and send home strategy where patients who do not in hospital care would receive that diagnostic test an adequate amount of medical leave to go home and self-isolate to the results come out within the next 8-24 hours at home these patients are closely monitored by the surveillance team to see if they develop symptoms those who test positive are brought in straight away by ambulance for admission to ncid we have also trained up our data analysts our biostatisticians pathologists our psychologists they were helping us with phone surveillance soon as the patient load increases as many as 50 staff are roped in to call more than 500 people a day as part of surveillance and contact tracing efforts another team working round the clock in the background is the department of laboratory medicine led by dr patha day we very quickly had to go to 24 7 operation from normal office hours right now i'm labeling the samples that we will be extracting for the next round of extraction they are another crucial link in the chain racing to provide timely confirmation of whether a suspected case has been infected or not even a negative result enables the doctors and nurses to discharge patients and free up beds for the new incoming suspect and confirmed cases almost every half an hour there will be samples coming in my busiest night throughout the night from 8 30 to the next morning 8 30 i didn't even have time to rest it was continuous running of samples [Music] the team uses the test kit developed by scientists from ttsh and a star made available to hospitals on february 6th and it comes none too soon [Music] the next day singapore raises its disease outbreak response system condition to orange alert level the disease spreads easily among people but is contained and not widespread visitors to hospitals will now have to fill in declaration forms and have the temperature taken staff are redeployed here from other departments to make this possible and as a safety measure the hospital cuts down on elective surgeries and closes some clinics i came from a acupuncture clinic a business office health department some staff like dietetic technician collis yap now work twelve hour shifts instead of normal working hours at fps is very draining my family members always remind me why i do this and why is it important thank you very much for coming on a saturday other medical staff are directed to support the screening center and outbreak warts obviously we needed more manpower the whole hospital had to cut down and leave and off days in fact i was planning for my honeymoon but i got cancelled and i came back to ncid to care for my patients but on social media accounts are shared of ambulance drivers and nurses being shunned on public transport and in public areas this paranoia however triggers the unexpected an overwhelming flood of love and encouragement for healthcare workers so we've received a lot of stuff from kids and from the public so this one is from little footprints preschool um look they have the babies uh these are the babies footprints and then the older kids wrote us letters so it's very heartwarming [Music] patients too express their gratitude mrs jung spent most of her 18 days in ncid under intensive care [Music] oh [Music] meanwhile the virus continues to spread in the community and new clusters emerge but the infection rate remains low compared to countries like italy and to some it looks like life could soon return to normal in singapore i suppose to the public that may seem like a loud period but that that silence was very worrying for us [Music] countries other than china go into lockdown and who declares covet 19 a pandemic [Music] we knew that it was a matter of time before we see the second wave we didn't know how big the second wave was going to be so we made a decision with the ministry to set up a tentach just outside the screening center if ever there is an overflow of patients coming in for screening the lab is also trying to ramp up its capacity from 500 to 800 tests a day with more staff and equipment but its efforts are hampered by a global shortage of reagents on march 21st singapore reports its first covet 19 deaths the icu team is no stranger to dealing with mortality but handling death from covet 19 is different what usa is outside the ico world what we see is the reality and the sickle cell patient unfortunately we do lost patients despite every effort we put they still pass on that was very very difficult for the families because none of them could come and see and you had to tell them over the phone what was happening and that your father or mother brother sister was was likely going to die you can imagine this is my love once i would actually want to hold their hand to see a proper go by we do have a relative actually funded during the video call we just feel a bit helpless yeah but we try our best to do what we can to help the patient and the family everybody does that yeah in the icu well spain is now emerging as a new hotspot for covet 19. by march 22nd the death toll worldwide from covet 19 is more than 11 000 and in singapore infection numbers have crept back up mainly from imported cases for the first time ever singapore closes its borders to tourists and short-term visitors the next day dr jamie lim's fears come true we called it the most terrible monday because we saw 520 cases we actually had to open tentach until 3 a.m at night with a lot of patients having to wait a little bit longer so that was a struggle i i didn't sleep that day this search in cases is due mainly to students and travelers returning home from countries going into lockdown what's it why suddenly so many patrons yeah then oh yeah we just chong mao we are 80 people if there's a job to do then we just do it ncid immediately enacts its plan to expand the number of bits in the outbreak wards so let's move to 5f okay we will go down to level 2 the capacity here at baseline is 330 bits we can expand the capacity to 586. the rooms in this building are designed in such a way that we can double stack or in some rooms triple stack but many of the bits are also being taken up by infected patients who are recovering well and in the clinical team's view can be cared for outside the hospital setting at the national level the decision is made [Music] there was a turning point in outbreak in terms of our isolation strategy this is where clinical data informs policy we knew that clinical presentation certain demographics about the patient their age and their medical history which means that we can now have younger coveted 19 cases being taken care of in the isolation facilities and most of them would recover without significant complications over a month three more community isolation facilities are set up all these are all like kind of draw plans already increase flexible it may not be already in your drawer plan but you must have a system where it is flexible enough so that it becomes situation based and we can still respond effectively on march 29th a porter who transports patients in ncid is confirmed to have contracted covet 19. an outbreak within its walls would be any hospital's nightmare it happened to ttsh during sars when some 100 staff visitors and patients were infected following exposure to the virus in its warts but this time nearly 20 years later the hospital came prepared to the fight and despite the more infectious nature of covet 19 the stringent measures from personal protection protocols to staff surveillance have prevented disease transmission so far now i can do it again everyone who enters into ncrd wears this tech all patients and staff within ncid wear a real-time tracking device which allows the staff surveillance team to quickly trace people who are in contact with the porter you can just open up all of them so you can actually see all of them have been in contact with every other people it provides granular level of visibility of where each patient is and where each staff is so this is the floor plan it shows this portal's movement history on this date the information helps ncid to identify staff at risk of contracting the virus and to quarantine them to stem a potential hospital cluster you could say this is big brother watching you but just say there's a friendly father hospital observing people again for staff a lot of safety happens as of september 13th 10 staff from ttsh and ncid have contracted covet 19 but none in the course of their work but elsewhere in singapore a time bomb is about to go off the coronavirus has been quietly spreading among migrant workers this was the dormitory with the bangladeshi workers dayden before he tested positive for the virus meanwhile though nowhere at the levels of countries like the us or italy the number of unlinked community cases has crept up on april 3rd prime minister lee sien long announces that singapore will go into circuit breaker mode closing schools and many workplaces we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period because this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus we do not want to wait for a situation where the cases rise sharply and then we get overwhelmed the streets of singapore have never been quieter but the scene at ttsh is very different [Music] each day up to 300 migrant workers come here to be screened the basic difference is that the migrant workers are unable to self-isolate because they live in a dorm we will have to hold them until the swab results are out if the patient is negative then they have to be transferred to a clean dorm if the swab results are positive then they may be admitted or they may be transferred to isolation facility on april 20th singapore sees 1400 new cases of covet 19 the highest numbers so far in a single day the majority of them are migrant workers i remember coming to work and overnight my twenty painted what just transformed into a forty baited what because we have to increase our capacity just to cope with this increase of infection cases it was then that we saw some of the most sick patients it was a emotional period for me personally because the patients that we see are usually fit young construction workers they had to be hospitalized for quite some time [Music] only i think about my family plus how to say my life i can i can continue my life i also very very my inside very question mark really daily new cases of covet 19 remain high throughout april and ncid warts are almost fully occupied again triggering its plan to expand into ttsh my name is nadia i'm an assistantness creation here in sandboxing and i'm a nurse working in the kobit award this is the first time when we have both covet patients and business as usual patients in the same building the first thing that we have to do is to make sure that the pathways are segregated that includes mapping of the rules and locking down the leaf or the kobe pathway so these are the two areas that is actually designated to nurse our kovid patients so let's go six general awards there are converted into outbreak wards one what is actually allocated to be the clean area the first shift is like you go in right it's not even five minutes you are like wet everywhere and then you feel like so stuffy and then you have this like fainting spells like you cannot breathe so well every cubicle there will be three big exhaust fans this actually to create negative pressure because the cubicle doesn't have an extra glass doors or an extra room finally after eight weeks of circuit breaker the rate of infection starts to slow with the reduced covet 19 patient load the additional outbreak warts at ttsh are no longer needed but for one department there is no easing up in fact our workload on microbiology for pcr has gone up a lot more it's doubled to cope the department hires additional staff and acquires new equipment that simplifies the testing process there's people who need to be cleared to go back to work like school teachers goods delivery drivers essential goods like groceries and so on the emphasis has shifted to screening which is a good thing which is part of reopening covid19 will eventually become the new normal respiratory virus that we will test for every year just as swine flu h1n1 on july 14th the lab makes a mistake a confirmed case of covet 19 has been found to be wrongly diagnosed due to a mix-up of test samples at the tantoxin hospital's laboratory to ensure that a mistake like this doesn't happen again the lab has automated its patient registration process i've got a thousand specimens to process even if we tell them take your time do they know there are patients waiting at the end of this and they want to do their best so we've had to try and manage all of that the psychological as well as the physical demands while the hospital still isn't going back to 100 business as usual it has managed to resume some elective surgeries and open certain clinics other inpatient warts have also continued to run all this while compared to sars when ttsh was designated the central treatment hospital enclosed to all non-sars patients in an outbreak people still come in with a heart attack people still break their leg and they need treatment emergency surgeries will still carry on we run essentially two hospitals tantoxin as the business as usual and ncid as the outbreak center with the same team of doctors nurses and administrators can you just page for me if there is any problem i will be in the office okay um nipping did not really reduce the illness patient ratio either at bau side and also at ncid side we deliberate plan for the ratio to be at one is to four especially because we think that adequate stuffing is important for both patient and staff safety but the months-long fight has taken a mental and emotional toll on staff and the war with covet 19 is a long way from over there's one day my husband actually come back from work having high fever i'm not scared for myself i really scared for my love once and what i don't want is because of me he got covered there is actually something really made me emotional at that period i realized that running the screening center takes a lot of effort and each of the different family groups contribute so much um [Music] yeah it's been tiring this one sorry [Music] everybody has been pulling together responding to this terrible pandemic you do a fantastic job not just during the pandemic you do a fantastic job all day every day i'm tremendously proud of my colleagues they are marvellous they are kind-hearted and you know they they really give the best in their care i think so far singapore has coped reasonably well and that again is the work of the entire healthcare system the ability to respond to the challenge however i think we shouldn't be complacent because i think the road ahead is still long and windy you ,True,True,False,False
Wy6xtIRAVAY,Coronavirus outbreak: Is a &#39;mental health pandemic&#39; coming after COVID-19?,UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg,Global News,2020-04-16T16:13:50Z,"While countries around the world continue to mobilize to contain the spread of COVID-19, mental health experts say we can't lose sight of an equally alarming ...",while countries around the world continue to mobilize to contain the spread of Cova 19 mental health experts say we can't lose sight of an equally alarming issue the long-term mental health impact the pandemic is going to leave on Society what I think we're facing here is a very traumatic event for a lot of people it's a it's a traumatic societal event for people and one thing that we know about trauma is that while it's happening you do whatever you can do to survive you bear down and you just get through it which is what we're all trying to do right now I think that we're still very much in the trauma phase the act of trauma phase of this pandemic but what happens after physical distancing measures are lifted what comes after the pandemic is over and people are able to get back to whatever their normal may be there's going to be residual stress depression certainly financial pressures learning how to re-engage with the world in this new way that's going to be difficult for a lot of people and those are exactly the kinds of risk factors that lead to increasing rates of depression anxiety and even suicide the rapid spread of the pandemic gave little chance to prepare for or even process all that has happened in terms of job losses and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships Maggie who is a student at McMaster University who suffers from a generalized anxiety disorder I shut down because I don't know what to do I'm not prepared for this I was I did not run run a rehearsal of the situation in my head it's exhausting to not worry because it is practically impossible for me to not worry henyk says for those already suffering from anxiety and depression the pandemic could be exasperatingly r symptoms he is also concerned for those who have never suffered from any mental health issues in the past and are now facing a life disruption without fully digesting the long-term impact this may have on them a large body of scientific studies show that there is a close relationship between indicators such as unemployment mental health and suicide research out of the Great Recession of 2008 reveals that a 1% increase in unemployment was accompanied by a 1% increase in the rates of suicides in the u.s. henyk explains there is a peak and a valley response in our nervous system when faced with trauma right now we are at a peak in which we are engaging with the immediate threat of the pandemic you go into survival mode which can be very taxing on a person's mental health and in fact it doesn't actually let you think through or process what's happening to you it's only interest is in getting and keeping you alive and keeping you safe once the pandemic is over there will be a valley in which we recover from that threat but the problem is going back to baseline without support can take a lot longer than we may think after the threat passes henyk says people can start to retreat or fall into depression or find many other ways of dissociating themselves with the trauma they experienced it can really become almost an infection on its own some people stay stuck either way at the top of that peak or they stay stuck down at the bottom or anywhere in between not everybody returns to baseline and that's where we become concerned about mental illness in Canada we currently have a universal medical care but things like psychotherapy which henyk says has proven to be an effective treatment for mental health problems generally isn't funded publicly henyk says the federal and provincial governments need to step up to make sure proper treatments and programs are funded so as many people as possible have access when in need adding that everyone including employers will have to play a role I think it's important for employers in particular to realize when we start to loosen some of the restrictions that we're currently facing that this needs to happen slowly that we can't go back to the way the world was overnight as for Maggie she says she already knows she won't be able to go from 0 to 100 right away I hope that was the buyer is slowly dying down my social supports like psychiatrist counselor therapist will out get those supports back slowly and help me with my current fears and uncertainties thanks for watching to stay up to date on the latest breaking national and international news be sure to subscribe to our Channel where we also dig into big issues around the world in our weekly series global news explains ,True,False,True,False
VjePU-U4Qo0,Singapore extends COVID-19 circuit breaker period until June 1,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2020-04-21T13:20:49Z,"Singapore's COVID-19 circuit breaker period has been extended by about a month to June 1, as the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Singapore's Cove in nineteen circuit breaker has been extended by about a month to the 1st of June as the country continues to grapple with the corona virus pandemic prime minister lee sin long has announced the extension of these strict safe distancing measures in a televised address to the nation existing measures will also be tightened for the next two weeks mr lee also says singapore is keeping a close eye on the situation among migrant workers calling it a serious problem Singapore is on day 15 of its circuit breaker good it's here with more so far cases in the community have fallen to below 30 a day which Prime Minister listen long says is a sign the circuit breaker is taking effect so he said there could be a hidden reservoir of undetected community cases because unlinked cases are not going down on Monday the Health Ministry said that there have been an average of 20 such and linked cases daily for the past two weeks the aim is to bring daily cases down to single digits or near zero to do so existing measures will also be tightened more workplaces will be shut with only the most essential services to remain open meanwhile entry to hotspots like wet markets will also be restricted to send out crowds even more mr. Lee also urged Singaporeans to go out alone for errands and not with family members during the lengthened circuit-breaker period many will be disappointed by the extension of the circuit breaker especially our businesses and workers who are hurting greatly but I hope you understand that this short term pain is to stamp out the virus protect the health and safety of our loved ones and allow us to revive our economy the government will continue to help our businesses and workers cope during the extended circuit-breaker period we will provide the same level of support to workers and businesses as we are doing now mr. Lisa delaying the deadline can also help contain any spill over from the migrant worker dormitories if it happens right now these workers for more than 70% of Singapore's cases which crossed 9000 on Tuesday in the mean time he said more medical resources will be sent to such dorms to ensure timely treatment older workers who are more vulnerable have also been moved to separate dorms for closer monitoring still mr. Li noted dorm clusters have remained largely contained and haven't spread to the wider community most of these cases also showed mild symptoms to our migrant workers let me emphasize again we will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans we thank you for your cooperation during this difficult period we will look after your health your welfare and your livelihood we will work with your employers to make sure that you get paid and that you can send money home and we will help you stay in touch with friends and family mr. Lisa Singapore will need to do three things to exit from the circuit breaker first it must open up incrementally making sure the country is safe at every step reopening prematurely could mean infections returned which might call for a second round of circuit breaker measures next he said testing must be scaled up substantially to quickly detect new cases to do that miss ELISA the country is procuring test kits from overseas and also making its own lastly mr. Li that Singapore will also need to make use of technology for contact tracing urging the public to download the trace together app even as it is developing other apps to do so I know this has not been an easy time for everyone we are making progress but we have not yet succeeded by a long way the results do show that the circuit breaker is working now we all need to do a little bit more make best use of the next two weeks of the Titan circuit breaker and the four weeks of the extension beyond that I asked for your support and cooperation I asked we are trust and confidence let us go all out to beat the virus and break the chain of transmission we will overcome this together thank you the multi ministry task force has announced specific details of the latest measures arrow joins us now for more on this Cheryl what can people in Singapore expect in the coming days in terms of what we can and can't do well Steve going solo is really the name of the game as the circuit breaker has been extended to June if you need to leave your house to buy essentials or to exercise the Task Force has strongly urged the public to now do this alone and not make it a family outing there will also be staggered entry to selected wet markets based on IC number for a start these are for the more popular ones that still see a substantial crowd and for such markets have been singled out they are gay long story market block 104 105 issuing road also known as Hong Kong market block 20 21 Marceline Lane and block 505 Jerome west street 52 so how it works is that those whose eye sees last digit ends with an even number can only visit these markets on the even dates of the month and conversely those with an odd last digit can only visit these markets on the odd dates of the month now the task force said this is because unlinked cases in the community have gone down but not fast enough we cannot be complacent and this is the time now to continue to hunker down and give this a further push so first we call on everyone to do their part to minimize movement remember the virus spread through people through our contacts with others and when we go out and touch surfaces and then our hands touch our faces yes we can take precautions like safe distancing and wearing of masks but the best way to beat the virus is to stay home so if you need to go out to buy food to buy groceries go out alone don't turn this into an occasion for a family outing and if you need to go out to exercise exercise alone and in your own neighborhood don't travel out to exercise so we call on everyone to do this because it is the best way to protect yourselves and your family members more financial help is also on the way for those affected by the extended circuit-breaker Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Hanks week it said key support measures in the solidarity budget will be extended in the month of May this includes a seventy-five percent wage subsidy under the jobs Support Scheme to all sectors so as to encourage employers to retain their workers and tack on grants for training and skills upgrading during this period I will further enhance the Job Support Scheme to include certain groups of shareholder-directors these are employees of a company who are also shareholders and directors and who missed out on both the Job Support Scheme and the self-employed income relief schemes are also with the foreign worker levied in me and provide employers with another 750 dollars in foreign workers levy rebates for every foreign worker in employment families whose breadwinners have lost their jobs can apply for the COBE 19 support grants from 1st May 2020 and the temporary relief fund the extension of the solidarity budgets will cost 3.8 billion dollars well Charlotte econsent for Singapore is the situation in the afford worker dormitories what's the update there yes sir Glenda manpower minister Joseph interior said containment and testing efforts in the dorms continue and so far 10,000 essential workers have been transferred out of these dorms to be housed elsewhere necessary also added that it is through contact tracing that there was found to be transmission at common construction work sites which may have contributed to the increase in the numbers of infected workers we will now require all the workers staying in all the dormitories to stop going to work this was something that we had planned for and now we are going to implement it now this new condition applies to workers from all companies including those that have earlier obtained exemption to operate but which mt i will now notify to suspend operations for this period we know that they are going to be some adjustments to be made by the companies but we seek the cooperation of both the employers and the workers on this new condition it is a necessary measure to minimize the risk of transmissions mrs. chair also added that with ramadan around the corner efforts have been taken to ensure muslim workers are well taken care of the task force is working with caterers and Daum operators to provide pre-dawn and a break faster meals for the workers it has also translated the MUOS Ramadan guide on the religious observations to take into account safe distancing measures and this will provide guidance for the Dom operators on how to facilitate Ramadan religious practices its back to you in the studio all right thanks for that Cheryl ",True,True,False,False

This is according to workers and aid groups CNA ...",prolonged isolation with a lack of clarity is taking a toll on the mental health of migrant workers here that's according to workers and aid groups we spoke with who say it's exacerbating anxiety among workers who are already worried about income and employment a bit amid the pandemic isabel limb with more abdul qader used to stay at a dormitory in mcpherson but at the end of april he was moved to a hotel in novina where he says he remained in quarantine for three months despite testing negative for covet 19 twice it's very fast that if you are in jail and you don't know why why you are in jail that makes the thing much worse and do know why you are in quarantine and how long you have to stay in quarantine when you can go back to the dormitory finally you can go back to the work abdul managed to get through the quarantine by taking online classes and staying connected with friends and family but some workers may not be faring as well charity health serve says it saw a rise in anxiety cases among workers who had to stay in isolation facilities for prolonged periods of time when they were some negative that was where there was a bit of a gray area of what do we do with them and then in turn that led to a lot of them being left in these isolation facilities for a prolonged period of time because some of these facilities they weren't allowed to even crack open the window just to have a breath of fresh air they couldn't open the doors or step out of the doors and it's not just the feeling of being left alone that's weighing on their mental health the stress and anxiety of course is due to loss of income due to the financial burdens on their families another thing with the with the long period of time of the lockdown is also that um the anxiety caused by uh the lack of clarity the lack of information about what is going to happen to me next when can i get back to work over the past two weeks the police have responded to a string of incidents in dormitories where workers who were apprehended appear to have attempted suicide healthserve says it has seen a tripling of cases of suicidal ideation among its clients in the same period it has counseled over 700 workers since april another group the migrant worker centre provides assistance through its helpline it's a network of 5 000 worker ambassadors also ring their countrymen to provide emotional support to workers including those in isolation facilities the manpower ministry advises workers not to put themselves in harm's way should they encounter problems with dormitories due to be cleared in the coming days more workers may be going back to familiar environments but they say what could really make a difference is returning to work i think everybody wants to go back to their world if you are alone people think too much about their past and while too many stops going on your head but if you are in work you actually keep forget these kind of things and move you forward ,True,True,True,True

other forms of like [Music] disorder it kind of rooted all the way back to like when i was a kid i guess i can remember things that are from 3 years old 11 years old 5 years old it imprinted in my mind very very badly sometimes i feel that i'm trapped there and i couldn't run out of it my mental health issues were the worst when i'm around like i say 19 all the way to like 24 year by year of accumulation of all the traumatic experience that i've had with my family my peers with schools with workplace it was just one thing after another and then just parked through like a whole chunk of like a load they have to carry so we are going through the first track right yeah what's the idea behind the song the idea for the first track is about like the past like a bad dream when i can't differentiate what is real and surreal so yeah i tried many ways to do it but then it's like it's not going anywhere so i was really like depressed and stuff so dino kind of like encouraged me to write songs and stuff to sort of like divert my anger and fear and sadness to something else then give me courage to write songs like with my broken grammar [Applause] is actually she's not like a trained professional singer but i i guess she she she loves music yeah just like me she she loved music from young like from the start so i guess that's her inspiration to want to do music now it's like and a creative outlet for her so bedroom is about the past like okay i see my life as a dream i don't think that like my assistant in this world is like a real thing it might be just a long dream that i cannot wake up from just another disappointment i really feel that like back then life was pretty pointless and meaningless and i wouldn't mind just at ending it kind of thing everything just so green it's just so so green and like you just couldn't get out of this black it's hole just a dream [Music] i work better with a lot of my suicidal thoughts so my suicidal thoughts will talk to me like a friend but suicidal is my toxic friend it's like an imaginary someone it just creeps in like you're not good you're not good that's where the bloodline of the um surreal and real thing like you sometimes you cannot tell i hope [Music] suffering for all these things uh it's like your mind is so tired and so busy and drained because your mind can work like point a to point b you have to go through like this whole part of mesa for you to dissect everything first to understand that this is actually what it is then you push through to it and say like oh okay don't get panic because that's not real yeah but it takes a lot please [Music] jess's condition has improved since more than one year ago but her depression ptsd and anxiety is still affecting her like sometimes during the day she still feels like a wave of depression anxiety so it can be a few days but then in the daytime she has to go and work so she has to sort of suppress or bury her feelings in order to do her work properly i own two basic studio so it's like a creative agency where i help brands to do their brand's content and also branding can you help me do like one shot right with three bottles together three bottles just plain with pink background here also can you know yeah for me it's like if the project is small i will do everything myself i will actually take charge of all the executing i like to have like my freedom my creative freedom to actually sit down and think what i can actually produce the best for the client i don't see that lamented illnesses is something that makes a person non-functional i have a very strong desire to get better because i always feel that my mental state is sort of like a blockage in whatever things i want to do when i feel depressed right i feel like not motivated and then i would be very sort of just self-deprecating kind of like mentality he's like oh i can't do anything i'm not good at suck and every and all these feelings it just like harvests me and bury me inside i just want to break through this whole blockage of mine which i actually since last year i saw a breakthrough that a lot more and then like now it's like i really can do a lot of things and i don't have all these things that's holding me back [Music] joy helps me to sort of like take my mind off things and then like helps me come down and also like solve like an escape so i will draw whatever i want and then nobody really can like say that what i'm drawing is wrong because when it comes to art it's like you can be expressive and stuff and it's something that like there's no judgement to it i'm actually drawing a nose with like bubbles blowing out of the nose so why is there a noose blowing up bubbles because like i always look at the new shrine it looks like the the thing that you put from the bubble up so i better with a lot of suicidal thoughts and it sometimes made me feel so pain inside to the point that i just hope i just really hope that like um i could just disappear from the face of the earth and so-called like dying is kind of like a fantasizing way of like sort of a release of myself so when you blow a bubble it's like you are like blowing your soul away going to my family in my childhood looking back it was pretty dysfunctional the punishment wasn't very lenient sometimes i feel that i don't even do anything wrong and then like the punishment was just like not good i guess it kind of gave me stresses and caused more disorder like a lot of things that even today i also have the anxiety when like there's a loud bang or like when i was like at my friend's house i would like scared that like you know their parents to school or whatever like i couldn't do this couldn't do that but actually like their house is actually okay so it kind of like still have this like sort of ptsd feel in my back of my head yeah i guess my family makes me feel that like i'm not good enough mentally i feel that like whatever i do is wrong i feel very like drained mostly because i feel that i always have to keep up to this standard it kind of makes me really feel like i'm just not loved where i wanted like the loneliness is like i guess it was like a big hole um when i first got diagnosed uh my parents think that it's like a taboo so they just feel that like i shouldn't talk about it i shouldn't um display elsewhere or whatever that is i shouldn't even go to a doctor i shouldn't even take my mess i should just like deal with it you know don't think too much okay i think back then i was pissed off there why didn't they support me and stuff but now when i look back it's like yeah they can't because they don't know and it's not their fault they don't know because my parents come from a generation that don't use internet i would say that the only reason why they sort of accept mental universes more was because the tv actually like sort of deep some awareness about mental illnesses and then that's where my parents sort of chanced by and washed it and then that's where they first realized that like what i'm going through wasn't a joke yeah and then they realized that it was actually a real thing so that's where they started to accept it more okay you know [Laughter] currently the relationship with my family is better than last time i think after i moved out things just like sort of get better it because they miss me also so i guess like that's how things just slowly changed for the better [Music] i love drawing a lot when i was a kid as i draw i feel like very relaxed very free very like like i escaped so a few years back i kind of like want to reconnect back to that part of me so that's why i started drawing again what that doing is like sort of the best way to go because i can actually earn money out of it while doing the things that i love and people are buying my art forever permanently on their speed so that kind of makes me feel happier okay just so how have you been lately great i think so far so good i mean i don't really have any much breakdown anymore but you if i have i will call you what that's true so sandra knew about my issues i realized that like the whole relationship was like a lot of times it's me telling her a lot of things then she's very patient to listen yeah i've seen like actually nowadays you're more significantly like better like more stable have lesser like outbreaks it's been like two years already yeah actually if you think about like how you've been since last like the first time i know you it's like a vast mass like vast difference before i met jess no i didn't have much of a knowledge about how severe mental illness could be i always just thought that people were you know it could be sad it's just emotions right it's like you just said for like a while then you can get better i didn't really think that it was a perpetual thing so when i met her i think it kind of educated me about the stigma of mental health and how important it is to destigmatize it what a lot of people with mental illness i feel that they lack something in their life that they are craving for i think it's important to just be there for them that would really help a lot in their um journey to recover there sandra you killed a bit more to the front of yourself oh you're closer yeah yeah i think that everybody has their own issues and it's not like they choose to have this mental illness jessa's mental health journey has definitely contributed in a very positive way to her work because i mean she's an artist right okay looking into the camera one two three did not remember to open your eyes for art it's never like something that is like a plain and simple by the book kind of thing every artist has their story that they want to tell so this is definitely her story and she wants to help other people like in similar situations as well to tell them that you know you're not alone you will get through this you just need to like find your way and find the right people to be around [Music] it's a baby stress i feel like tearing everything down i feel i don't want to do it i felt so troubled [Music] okay i want to bring awareness to mental health issues because going through mental disorders i feel very discriminated it's just that the hole is judging you like work place like you just judge me then i have like a family feel very judged by their friends that who doesn't know any better to feel that you are judged by them insurance also judge me in a sense that i can't get insurance also discrimination comes from every angle a baby stress i feel like tearing everything down actually i feel i don't know what to do i don't know i just feel everything very pretentious yeah i feel very like like like judgey and i it's like putting out a show everything just don't feel like me and then like i don't know i just felt this whole very overwhelm feeling because of i want to bring this awareness right then i have to actually put myself here to do this it's like yeah i feel like crap also i'm just like oh anxiety is like oh my god i'm so nervous and everything i'm anxious but then i have to do it because i think people need a voice to change the mindset of people so that is like so-called i have to actually put up with myself let's talk about discrimination many forms of discrimination can come like directly and indirectly so when it comes to the direct discrimination was getting rejection from insurance with um like from plans like hospitalization and as well as life insurance i think that is very uncaught for because personal thoughts and dreams right now is to get insurance like i really hope that my work here can really create enough noise to sort of alter the law a bit to solve no more discrimination from the insurance side [Music] hey what do you want give me a hug no schedule skip we met on a dating app and after that we we started hanging out as friends so we actually became friends first like recently we started seeing each other as like more than friends uh yeah it's been going slowly so as of now we're not really in a relationship but we're like friends but we're seeing each other i open my heart get crushed again i would say that i wouldn't mind being in a relationship with him but i think that he on his end he's not ready i think there's a lot of fear within him that like i have mental issues so like yeah i think he's scared that he's not up for it i dated myself but it boils down to loneliness so sometimes i do feel that like i shouldn't even tell the person that i'm dating that i have issues and then maybe i'll be accepted better but then it's wrong to think that way also so of course i try to be more honest i try to be more honest and be vulnerable since i get rejected a lot so of course that kind of makes me feel a bit like feel i mean you know try his best in a lot of things you try to take care of me be caring and stuff by scared that is a lot to us this is so [Music] surreal please just wake me i'm not gonna lie it can be tough like being in a relationship with someone with depression anxiety or mental disorders like in general so it's a lot for me to do i have to watch what i say i have to do the right things like i have to be extra careful and mindful not to trigger any of her traumas and and anxieties and all that so sometimes it can get very draining because i'm not a therapist i'm just a human i hope dream in certain sense i feel like i'm less of a human being i feel like i feel upset of course i don't think i'm rejected first time because of this so i feel that like generally i'm not good enough for anybody sometimes i feel that spring alone is better to be discharged means that you don't need to go back for follow-up it just doesn't mean that you're like fully recovered or anything it's just like you discharge from the hospital that's all when my psychiatrist wanted to discharge me i was happy but a bit worried i very scared that like i would relapse again and then i can't help i don't want to have an emergency and panic again but i feel very relieved that i'm much better now i guess i could let go a lot of things that i used to hold on with a lot of crutch so it's like a lot of things are let go and i guess i feel lighter [Music] whatever i've been through with the mental health journey actually got me to be a stronger person so i don't think i will be fully recovered but i feel that like that is actually made me a stronger person and i think that that should be something that we should celebrate instead of discriminating that you can never be better you will always be sick you will always relapse you know we should celebrate the fact that we have come so far and we have reached upon a stage where we can be contented with ourselves sometimes when people tell me to say i inspired them to give them like a hope or certain things to even help them speak up i feel very happy that like i can be an inspiration for someone else to help someone in their journey in recovery [Music] [Music] what's up ,False,False,True,False
AqOhXQ6kaL0,Singapore remains in &quot;critical situation&quot; amid rise in COVID-19 cases: Health Minister | In full,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2020-04-14T16:24:07Z,"Singapore authorities have now made it mandatory to wear a mask when stepping out of the house, with immediate effect. The new requirement was announced ...","as of 12 p.m. today we have an additional two hundred three hundred and thirty four cases in Singapore my director of medical services associate professor Kenneth ma will provide further details later it has been just about a week since the circuit breaker measures have kicked in by and large Singaporeans are taking the measures seriously and are staying at home in the past week public transport ridership and traffic volume have dropped by more than 70% and close to 80 percent of the work force are now working from home crowds have thinned in the public places enforcement offices have also observed greater compliance with safe distancing measures over the past one week we thank everyone who is playing their part to stop the transmission of the virus but we cannot be complacent we still see a few cases of people loitering or gathering in public places the authorities have issued more than 6,200 warnings and over 500 fines since 7th of April these safe distancing measures are put in place to slow the transmission of the virus and more importantly to protect Singaporeans therefore we must take these measures seriously and keep a safe distance from one another we remain in a critical situation the number of cases has been increasing and yesterday we saw our highest daily tally so far at 386 in particular the number of cases among foreign workers especially those in dimitris rose sharply to around 200 cases per day and reaching around 300 cases yesterday this increase is likely to continue as we undertake more testing at Adama trees the outbreak in the foreign worker dama trees has become an important front in our fight against kovat 19 our foreign workers have contributed much to Singapore and we are paying close attention to well to their health and well-being that is why we have set up a joint task force with senior minister Cho ji-hyun as our adviser to address the outbreak in the dormitories our foremost priority is to keep our foreign workers safe we have mobilized our medical resources to support the joint task force efforts at Adama trees our medical plan entails identifying those who have been infected or exposed to infection tests and contact tracing isolation and care for the infected workers all infected foreign workers will have their welfare taken care of overall we expect a number of cases to continue to rise in the short term before it stabilizes because you will take time for the circuit breaker measures to take effect with the rice in a number of infected cases our healthcare resources are stretched but we are still able to cope I would like to take this opportunity to thank our health care workers who have responded quickly to this new situation and made this and may have made the necessary adjustments to further free up precious Hospital resources we have set up community care facilities to take care of those who are clinically well but will still need to be isolated and monitored most of the foreign worker patients are young and few have underlying conditions hence we expect that few would need extensive medical care at a care facility at singapore expo two halls are now operational with a total capacity of about 950 and the third one will be operational shortly we are progressively expanding the capacity at singapore expo we are also exploring additional capacity for such care facilities to give us a greater buffer each of us must take the circuit breaker seriously this is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus we must work together to terminate and to disconnect this chain of transmission so that we can come out of this together now I would like to pass on to my that darker medical services to share some details on the medical cases thank you very much minister to expand now on the figures and you have to check this for accuracy against the press release or come out this evening as of 12:00 noon today we've seen an additional three hundred thirty four new cases of these new cases none of them my imported cases 189 of these cases have been linked to named clusters 23 of them are other local linked cases and 122 of these cases remained as yet unlinked further investigations in contact tracing are taking place and we are hopeful that out of this 122 cases a number of them will be recategorize into being linked to cases whether to other individual cases or to the clusters we have seen a number of these patients in fact come from the dama trees both from the purpose-designed and dom trees as well as others and within the dama trees the joint task force remains committed to doing their best to look after the workers who are unwell in the dhamma trees medical teams have been established within the dama trees and we continue to make sure that their medical services available working closely with the joint task force to ensure that that is that is indeed so and within sound of dhamma trees swap testing under an active case finding approach has commenced and as SWAT testing activities continue we fully expect more confirmed cases to emerge as a result of all surveillance activities concurrently we have worked to expand our facilities both in our swap and isolation facilities but also in our committee care facilities and as alluded to this committee care facility that we've recently established in the singapore expo yesterday they had 297 residents in the committee care facility and we expect another 150 more patients to be admitted into the committee care facility today and they come from a variety of different places including from the dormitories they come also from acute hospitals as a result of us being able to transfer the well recovering patients into the stack step-down care setting and a number of them in fact come across these different settings as well as of now the patients were in the compte care facility are well and they are looked after by the medical teams that we have established within the two halls at this compte care facility at the expo thank you very much thank you I'll now invite Minister Joseph into to give an update on the operations at our dormitories good evening everyone our immediate priority is for the workers in the dormitories to stay healthy and to minimize the number that get infected it is a huge responsibility and that is why we are mobilizing resources from across the whole government to make it happen and this is also why the interagency joint task force was set up I think it will be helpful if I provide it first an overview of the dama tree landscape in Singapore we have 43 purpose-built dormitories that together house about 200,000 workers there is a very specific reason we built these dormitories they tend to be quite large they house anywhere between 3,000 to 25,000 workers the specific reason for building these Dhamma trees was have communal living it was designed all these dormitories were designed for communal living meaning that we want the workers to be able to be with their friends prepare the meals that they like and practice their religious beliefs with scale these dormitories are also able to provide common recreational facilities such as TV rooms gyms we were also able to put in other facilities like mini months remittances and Wi-Fi and so when you put it together really the purpose-built dormitories are to provide a supportive environment to the workers the dormitories are professionally managed by a firm or what we normally refer to as the dom operator these dom operators are regulated and they have the responsibility to ensure that standards are met for example making sure that there is modern sanitation and also no overcrowding in terms of sleeping arrangements what does it look like in a typical purpose-built dome well if you imagine a badminton court and then you take half of the battement in court and you put five bunk bits in them that will be able to sleep 10 people and then you add another 20% to that half of the badminton court for circulation space that is essentially what a typical room would look like in the purpose-built dhama trees so that's one group of Dhamma trees we have another type of Dhamma trees we call them factory converted dormitories we have 1200 of them and collectively they house about 95 thousand workers these factory converted domes tend to be smaller they are perhaps between fifty to a hundred but some that are larger can be around 500 now these dormitories are either managed by the employers themselves or professional operators they have the advantage of being closer to the workplaces they are also regulated and must meet standards for hygiene for space and also for example fire safety and based on these regulations they are inspected and if there are findings then the operators will be asked to rectify them so that's the second type of Tama tree then we have a small number of what is known as construction temporary quarters or temporary living quarters they tend to be no more than 40 persons each and we don't have so many of them smaller number so that is what the Dom landscape looks like now what precautions have we taken at all the dormitories since the cove at 19 outbreak I think firstly we tried to limit the inflow of foreign work pass holders so that we could manage the risk of imported cases that's the first thing that we did we reached out to all the Dom operators to remind them to be more vigilant then we also produce materials in the workers native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves subsequently non-essential facilities like gyms and TV rooms were closed mealtimes and recreational hours were also staggered intermixing between the blocks we put a stop to it so those were the precautions that took place the question of course is why then has there been such a spread amongst the workers staying in the dormitories from the epidemiological findings there is evidence to link the workers in the dormitories to common work sites then the workers from the different dormitories on the arrestees may also gather and so they may socialize and shop at popular places like Mustafa now back in the dorms these workers would then socialize with another group of friends they might you know cook together eat together relax together so despite the safe distancing measures that were in place then in these dormitories the virus in the dorms spread through social socialising activities much like it would spread amongst housemates friends and also in the community this may explain why all the way up to middle of March the workers who lived in dorms that tested positive for Kovac 19 were few and far between but then in quick succession in some domitor is not all in some dormitories many popped up so what are we now doing to contain the spread it is a three-pronged strategy first in the dorms where there are already clusters we will actively contain the spread now it means locking down these dormitories no more moving in and out workers have to stay in their room as much as possible minimize the interactions with other workers meals are provided to avoid communal cooking and those that have to use communal toilets have scheduled staggered shower times we are also testing the workers to identify and isolate the infected ones and closely monitoring the health of the other workers so that's the first problem second it's useful to note that not all the doms have clusters in fact 29 of the 43 purpose-built dorms and almost all the factory converted dorms they have no clusters hence for these types of dormitories our aim is to prevent the clusters from forming all those in these dormitories that are tested positive and they're closed contexts would already have been isolated separately while these dorms are not gazetted as isolation areas we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown likewise the workers have to stay in the dorms within the dorms we enforce strictly the safe distancing measures which means no more cooking and freely mixing with friends from other housing units so that's the second problem third across all 43 purpose-built dorms we have moved out or separated the workers in essential services who are still needed by their employers to go to work this is now about 7,000 of them we put them in separate facilities so that they do not have to enter and leave the dorms daily or interact with the other Dom residents to provide a higher level of assurance medical screening was conducted to ensure that the workers did not have symptoms before moving into the alternative accommodation all the workers were screened before they moved to the alternative accommodation in the meantime while at the workplace or traveling to work they are required to also implement strict safety distancing this includes wearing a mask at all times not interacting with other workers and eating meals alone and like all Singaporeans they will be required to remain in their residences after work we hold the employers of these essential workers responsible and we look to them to do their utmost to keep their workers safe even as they go about their duties now what we have done to move out or separate the essential workers in the purpose-built dormitories we will also do for the factory converted dormitories move them out monitor them screen them all of them the moving out of workers from all the dormitories purpose-built or factory converted rooms will help to create more space for isolation facilities within the dorms so that we can house separately the workers who are unwell or are waiting for the results of their shock tests so those are the three prongs of the strategy now to implement this three-pronged strategy effectively there are also three key enablers the first is the fast teams that I've talked about for all 43 purpose-built dorms we have deployed the fast teams and they have been on the ground since last Wednesday working round the clock to implement safe distancing measures I visited some of the dorms comprising an interactive with the fast teams which comprised of SAF SPF as well as emam offices they understand the mission to put the well-being of the workers at the top of their priority they sort out issues with food as well as cleanliness they keep in close with the workers and attend to the feedback from the workers they are a great help to the dom operators and we will soon deploy roving fast teams to also support the employers or the dom operators for the factory converted dormitories so that's the first key enabler the second key enabler are our medical support teams at the dormitories these are also being stepped up progressively these medical outposts at the dormitories are supported by the regional healthcare systems which deploy teams of doctors nurses and technicians to the DAPs they tend to the workers who are unwell sort those who have acute respiratory symptoms they manage the cases that need to be sent to other facilities and then they will also assess if the workers are well enough to be returned to their rooms their presence in the dormitories give great confidence to the workers who are there the medical teams will also work with the fast teams to set up on-site isolation facilities we now have eight medical outposts set up and the gazetted domes and aim to have medical touch points at all 43 purpose-built domes now most of the other factory converted domes they are already well supported by the national network of PHP sees the public health preparedness clinics so the workers in the factory converted roms can also get timely medical attention so that's the second key enabler the third key enabler will be the dormitory operators as well as the employers now the more the dom operators can handle the food and hygiene matters the more the fast teams can focus on effective safe distancing and tackle other issues for example expanding the isolation facilities on site and helping the workers to remit monies home a big part of the workers sense of well-being is to be able to continue to receive their salaries it's important to them and this is where the employers have a duty to ensure that it is done so promptly in a timely manner so to recap we have a three-pronged strategy for the dormitories contain the spread in the dormitories where they are already clusters prevent a spread in the dormitories with know clusters and move out and test all the workers who are still needed for essential work we will also ensure that the three key enablers are properly stepped up the fast teams the medical outposts which implements the medical support plan as well as the dom operators and the employers there will be quite a lot of adjustments required of the workers living in the dormitories they cannot go out to work or meet their friends and we would have to help them to adjust and to keep them safe and healthy in summary we thank the workers for their cooperation we have a responsibility to these workers and we will do everything we can to take care of them thank you I'll now invite Minister Lawrence Wong to give an update on the safe distancing measures good evening it has been one week since the circuit breaker kicked in and we are very happy that many Singaporeans and residents are cooperating and doing their part and complying with these measures as you heard just now people movement all over the island has reduced significantly our safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers are hard at work on the ground and previous hotspots that we had highlighted including the wet markets hawker centres and parks are generally now under control most people are doing the right thing and there are a few who are not and they will be dealt with but just one week into the circuit breaker we know there are some people who are finding it hard to adjust some suffering from cabin fever we receive many appeals to do all sorts of activities and we've had to reject all of them because basically we cannot let up at this stage the these are still early days and we have at least another three more weeks to go so we have to double down on our efforts and just stay at home when we started the circuit breaker we were very mindful not to disrupt certain of our supply chains or to disrupt essential services that are still needed for daily living now about 20% of the workforce or kin are continuing to work under essential services now there have been Appeals at the start of the circuit breaker we have cleared their Appeals so having cleared the appeals we will now proceed to look at the list of companies that are still working classified as essential services and we will tighten this list further we the objective of reducing further people who still need to work so that more can stay at home and we can further minimize people movement all around now we will also continue to be very firm and strict in enforcing and implementing the circuit breaker measures we have gone straight because sufficient warning has been given to everyone so immediately for the first offense it's a fine of three hundred dollars the second offense would be a fine of a thousand or prosecution in court for egregious cases and we've issued more than 500 fines to date for foreign residents who have caught breaching any of the rules then on top of the effect the fines we will not hesitate to revoke their employment or work passes or even their PR status during this circuit-breaker period we will make a further change to our guidance on mask we had already updated our advisory on masks earlier based on the latest medical and scientific advice and that's why we went out to distribute reusable masks to everyone and that exercise has completed over the weekend so we will now take a further step and make it mandatory for everyone to wear masks when they go out there will be some exceptions or exemptions to this rule for example for very young children those below the age of two the medical experts recommend not to wear masks because of child safety so that group would be exempted for those who are engaging in strenuous exercise like running or jogging then you can remove the mask when you are engaging in strenuous exercise but after that you have to put the mask on and when you are engaging in running or jogging there make sure that you are maintaining a safe distance between yourself and others other than these exceptions everyone else go out will have to wear a mask and we will enforce this rule too like all the other safe distancing and circuit breaker measures that we have put in place basically as we have explained we are dealing with two infections in Singapore one in the foreign worker dormitories which Minister Josephine tio has highlighted and elaborated on and second in the general population the infection in our foreign worker dormitories is a very challenging task it requires new organization new protocols for dama trees and workers it requires strict and firm measures but at the same time empathy and understanding for the well-being and needs of the workers who have done so much for Singapore so we are sparing no effort to go doing all we can to ensure the safety and health of these workers for the rest of us in the general population we are continuing with our efforts to do contact tracing each time a new case pops up and we have the circuit breaker in place so all of us should comply with the circuit breaker measures not just to avoid the penalties but to protect ourselves and our family and our loved ones the health of all Singaporeans depends on each one of us and we can beat the virus together let me just say a few words in Mandarin suit what suit once washer shushing equal since Eli I mentioned is yet supported

raise hand function on zoom if you'd like to ask the question maybe now have the first question from Taobao women please thank you why men phone representing southpaw can I can we have more clarity on the dormitory situation how many more essential service foreign workers are not yet dick entered and by the meaning of these of essential services firms tightening by how much how much less workers and in terms of factory converted dama trees right now can Minister provide more details on how many among the clusters right now our factory converted dormitories which one is it and are there more confirmed cases coming from FC DS as mentioned in the advisory that M om distributed yesterday to employers thank you thank you as Lawrence to talk about the essential services then the Josephine tier will answer the questions on Adama trees well on essential services the ones that are continuing to work in the ones from the purpose-built dorms that are continuing to work we have largely already completed the movement of these workers to alternative accommodations so that exercise has already completed and they were they are continuing to work the key is this every time we move them out we will test all of them to make sure they are healthy and then we will provide alternative accommodations for them because they will be continuing to work in our community so that exercise is complete the one the question about whether or not how much more are we going to trim the list of essential workers that is ongoing as I mentioned for now twenty percent of the workforce are deemed essential including foreign workers in that myths right so that group of workforce is about twenty percent and they are continuing to work daily as I said we would like to bring that figure lower and we are looking at ways in which we can trim down and when we are ready we were more details perhaps I should just clarify that the 20% who are working refers to those that are still commuting every day to work there's still substantial workers who are telle community at le commuting so they are actually working from home and the numbers will be a dynamic number depending on whether they continue to be active to be involved in the economic activities but a large proportion of Singaporeans continue to work from home I'm now I pass it over to Josephine thanks my man for the question I mentioned earlier that we have about 1200 factory converted dormitories and as of the last set of data that was available in 37 of them there were some cases most of them have very few cases we are talking about low single digits but we do have one or two of the factory converted dormitories with cluster but they are very small minority of the factory converted domes which is why we are stepping up our inspection by today we would have done an inspection for all the factory converted dormitories over the last two days in fact so when we go out to these factory converted dorms to do our inspection the protocol has also changed whereas in the past our inspectors would look out for hygiene standards being met fire safety standards being met now the protocol also includes looking into the well-being of the workers in these factory converted dormitories we want to know whether the dormitory operator who may be the employer themselves have been keeping track of temperature of the workers for example they are required to perform twice daily temperature taking they are also required to inform us if any one of them is unwell so that we can keep track of how things are shaping up so these things are already carried out and as I also mentioned earlier in my remarks the intention is to also have roving fast teams support the factory converted mitrice because now we do not want them to do any cooking and so food will have to be arranged and provided for and over and above this we also want to make sure that the workers if they are unwell they know where to seek treatment generally it should not be a problem because they will have the network of PHP C's to tap on but where they have difficulties then we want to move in very quickly now on the factory converted dormitories were not working alone apart from the joint task force also having a supervisory view of the factory converted dorm situation we are working with nongovernmental organizations this include the migrant worker center as well as organizations like health serve in order to be able to take care of the workers not only in the purpose-built jobs but also in the factory converted homes next question we will have the next question from BH Atia please I mentioned about being mandatory for everyone to wear masks can you get some clarity on these and what are the penalties for those who do not wear masks what there's a clarity that you're seeking again specifically okay yes for those who do not wear masks and you know any advice all right so on the issue of wearing masks as I said we had updated our guidance earlier and advising people to go up when they go out to wear a mask so that had already been updated the change today is that we are making it mandatory right and in fact we had started earlier by making a mandatory in certain settings in public transport in wet markets and supermarkets but now that we have distributed the masks to everyone and that we have put and generally people have started to adjust to the new requirements or the advisory we are making it mandatory for all the minute you leave your room you leave your house you have to wear a mask when you go out so their world because it's a mandatory requirement now there will be penalties the same penalties for safe distancing and circuit breaker measures will apply first offense $300 beyond that 1000 and possible prosecution so it's the same penalties for failure to comply with any of the safe distancing measures this will be yet another safe distancing safe distancing measure that we are now putting in place next question the next question from ft Stephanie a please hi hello the questions the first one is with regards to testing foreign workers and dormitories are you considering by any chance trying to test essentially everyone or more people in dorms just by virtue of but yeah I know you've already mentioned the fact that you're also testing those that might be asymptomatic or some of them but but just by virtue of how how densely populated these structures are are you considering ramping up testing their further could you also mention how many more foreign workers who are planning on moving out in addition to be about sort of 7,000 that you already have moved out as EMS to talk about the testing strategy and then Joseph Inc and comment on moving out of our workers from the Dhamma tree we working out the testing strategy with our colleagues in the Joint Task Force at this point in time for the majority of the purpose-built Adamo trees we don't we don't have an approach of testing everyone at this stage but it's a much more targeted approach or testing those who step forward who are sick with symptoms and in an active case finding active case surveillance approach in terms of concern the Trend Task Force has also arranged for testing of confirmed cases so as to further identify possible other patients who may as yet not be symptomatic but in fact have already been infected and they would all then with the positive test result be isolated to prevent further spread of infection to other workers within the dormitories in other settings we have tested workers across very specific other settings across the board you no need to give her a surance in those settings these workers are in fact not infected at a point in time that we test them and examples given by minister where we shifted workers who belong to the essential firms essential services and as we were moved out we in fact had also tested them and continued to test them to make sure that they do not have any workers among the mates who are in fact infected and therefore pose a further risk to Adam for workers the worker who live with them and work with them as well so to the question of a moving out and separately housing the workers there are really two objectives that we are trying to meet one is to enable the essential services workers who still need to go to work not to have to have to you know move in and out of the dormitories on a day-to-day basis and therefore have interactions with the residents who are otherwise still remaining in the dormitories so we've already done so for the purpose-built dorms we are going to do this for all the factory converted amah trees we are tabulating the numbers and we can provide an update when that is available but I also want to mention that even for the purpose-built Dom's from which essential services workers have been moved out we do want to be able to create isolation facilities within the dormitories remember we mentioned that there is a medical support plan that has to be implemented part of that medical support plan which you got a full briefing on is to be able to take care of the workers whilst they are being swapped and waiting for the results or if they have been swapped and then we need to find some way to let them serve out their medical certificates say for example the physicians have decided that they should be on MC and not immediately put back into the rooms so to have this isolation facilities we will also have to look at the specific conditions in each of the dormitories they are all configured differently in some cases there is carpark space available that we can free up to serve as the isolation facilities with proper equipment put in as well as making sure that a level of comfort can be achieved in some other cases there may be rooms that are freed up that we can use so we will have to look at the specific conditions in each of those tamo trees to identify areas that can serve as isolation facilities and if it is necessary to move out some of the residents in order to create free up these isolation facilities we will do so next question we will take the next question from channel 8 car you please thank you hi a little chitchat right why there's a sudden change all the math guidance is it because there's now the transmission transmission rate is higher because earlier us which that shows that this foreigner virus might be able to transmit through top T so what's the mo page then again this what's our current our model right now because currently worldwide our noise is 2 to 3 percent what is so powerful in Singapore right now and then the second question is just now a minister ovens won't say that you are targeting to title them this office then sure services so what Taiwan essential services are you Genet Thank You us DMS to talk about our Arnott and then perhaps Lawrence can talk about the mass and the essential services the or not basically is that figure that represents that the extent in which a further transformation takes place from one case and we look predominant at just that are not actually what we discussed the or the effective are looking at this in until the outbreak had taken place within the Dom trees we in fact had or effective or that in fact was well below one we haven't done the complete calculation yet for the workers that come off on the dama trees because he actually need to follow this cluster true and to determine whether or not onward transmission actually takes place but my understanding is the RT it has in fact now crapped up I think it's somewhere closer to the one map but I'll have to check that and then perhaps one said informations available then make that known to all of you so on the question of mask actually the main change had happened earlier when we updated our advice on mask based on the latest findings and medical advice or scientific evidence right and that was there were two reasons for this as we have already explained number one the evidence or the finding that people without symptoms or with very mouth symptoms could be spreading the virus so the early advice was you wear masks to protect others try to keep your droplets to yourself especially when you are sick but if you can spread the virus even if you don't have symptoms then you may not know whether you are sick or not sick but you may inadvertently be spreading the virus so that was one key reason why we change our advisory earlier the second reason was as we said they are already some indicators that indicate that the virus was circulating in our community and there were more undetected cases within our community which was a cause for concern and therefore we had already changed our advisory earlier to recommend the wearing of masks particularly when you go out and you cannot avoid close contacts and indeed over the last weeks or so recent days you are seeing more people wearing masks what we are doing now is a next further step same reason same findings but an extra dose that just to make it mandatory and to take that extra protection and precautions so that anyone going out right in any setting wear a mask and I think that will be an extra precaution worth taking for all of us on the second point on essential services we have been quite as I said when we started out with the circuit breaker quite mindful of one thing to ensure there was no disruption to our own essential services for daily living our supply chains particularly since in Singapore we import so many things that we need for daily living our food daily essentials and then of course there are other areas like health care clearly an essential service you want that to continue you've got things like energy water waste utilities all of these need to continue and then food and beverage we still need to eat so FMB must continue but in each of these categories we kept these categories and we allowed them to continue but now having cleared all the appeals from companies that say they wanted to continue have cleared the appeals we are going through all of the existing categories of work that are deemed essential and we are going through as I said step by step to see which ones can be cut further we are already not doing badly to be able to reduce the work force that's still continuing to work not the telecommuting ones the ones that are still out and about everyday to 20% we want to go further than that so that we can further reduce the number of people who are out and about and minimize movement to as much as we can let me maybe just take this opportunity to remind all of us that in addition to wearing the mask personal hygiene is still very important so I would continue to encourage Singaporeans to wash your hands observe personal hygiene and which is a very critical factor in disrupting the transmission change and this is particularly important during this period of enhance safe distancing and that is why we have also enhanced our advisory on mass and now making it mandatory when you go out because we want to do everything we can to reduce the risk of transmission so as to cap our keep our number of cases to as low as possible and this is up in line with our strategy of this enhanced safe distancing approach over the next few weeks can I can I make one quick point I just made Minister gun said this I remembered something please please do not use this mask wearing requirement now to say okay I can go out right I buy a mask and it's okay to go out because in fact you should not go out as much as possible just stay at home do all the right things practice good hand hygiene and stay at home as much as possible and if you are staying at home you do not need to wear a mask but in the rare occasion that you do need to go out for purchase of your groceries or purchase of essentials then it's only at that time that you wear a mask next question take the next question from Wall Street Lisa please hi Lisa with The Wall Street Journal I just would like an update on trade together because it's been a while since we've been given an idea about race together can you give me can you give us an idea how it's been used by mm and how effective and useful it's been so far thank you we are still in the stage of our ramping up day and we encourage people to switch on these trees together we have a significant number of downloads but the number of people turning on is still quite low for this to be effective we need to have significant significant portion of Singaporeans turning it on so that we are able to trace those who have turned it on if only a small portion of Singaporeans have turn it on and the rest have not then when we wanted to trace and we would not have the significant number of a context so we are still in a process of promoting this app and we want to encourage Singaporeans to turn it on for as long as possible especially when you go out when you need to go out so please leave it on so that we will do.a facilitate contact tracing so it is to early days we are still in a process of encouragement and a promotion of this use of this app can I also add that we have always said that it's a useful app but it's a supplement to all that we are doing on contact tracing and ultimately the ability to do contact tracing well lies with the people we have and the skill of the contact tracers and that's why I'm Minister GaN that we have been all of us explaining that we have been raising building up extra capabilities and capacity in our contact tracing team beefing that up considerably so that that itself will not be a constraint even if we have more cases as we are seeing now contact tracing continues in a very rigorous and thorough manner next question we will not take the next question from CCTV su-mei please hi Isis to me from CCTV I have one questions we know in China we do the treatment with Chinese medicine jeonggi it works how about you think about addressing is a possible because so many case in Singapore now do you think it's a possible we used Chinese medicine also to do the treatment thank you maybe DMS can comment on the professional thing in fact the members of our Chinese medicine physician community have been exploring the possibility of conducting research I had to see whether or not Chinese traditional Chinese medicine has a role to play in the treatment of Kobe 19 patients in Singapore so they have started to engage us and we continue to have discussions with them they are also exploring collaborations with the doctors within our public health institutions and I look forward to seeing a research proposals come up in partnership with the doctors in the hospital and attrition Chinese medicine physicians and it may very well be that some of that research will start in Singapore in the not-too-distant future a question we'll take the next question from bernama meseta please thank you it's regarding newly identified cluster ABC host elsewhere six lesions involved would you able to tell who are they are they a group a focus so previously called me from Jobar ooh they are housed at ABC Hospital - with the mg own Tunisia do you know we don't have the details of these patients we'll see whether we can share some of the details with you after we have checked but we also have to make sure that there's a patient confidentiality we have to respect so we see what we can share with you later on when we check the details next question take the next question from SD UN Singh please hi you beast you have many other workers who are working in session service SMRT or safe distancing ambassadors and security guards but there has been an advisory issued to encourage older Singaporeans to stay at home so you know will this be reviewable some of this other workers be able to stay home instead of going out to work and the second question is that on the DSA has develop its own you know face mask or face cards made out of plastic right so how does this compare in terms of effectiveness to reusable mass or surgical masks and will we be looking at an operated appointment of this DST a face mask as well thank you as a DMS the comment on face masks and the face shields that we you mentioned and perhaps Minister Joseph into can talk about older workers I'm not too familiar with the face fancy referring to from DSD I'm aware that DSC has been in fact working on various personal protective equipment which includes face shields as well so so that's what can progress and as they in fact do this I understand that they've also been in researching what the filtration efficiency is and various other parameters we look at to see whether MRSA in fact are useful and we also have various other organizations in agencies including a star that also have been actively looking in this particular space my understanding is that in fact there's been quite a bit of progress made in terms of modifying mass designs such that even the reusable mass number the realism of mass designs in fact have some benefit also in these areas about I don't have enough information to give you today we look forward perhaps to compiling some information and giving it to you at a later date I think it would be a very good thing if the workers who are older themselves are very concerned about heading out to work and want instead to stay home even if they are performing essential services it is good that they are mindful of the risks to them they would prefer not to go to work now what then is our advisory to the employers our advisory to the employers is to be sympathetic to the concerns of their senior workers if it is at all possible to relieve the individual from having to come to work that would be good the alternative is that if the person really has to come to work then within the work environment can the person be redeployed to a different role where the interactions with the co-workers is kept to a minimum thirdly if that is not also possible then to find some way of ensuring that this workers are given adequate protection as all essential services workers should be given meaning that they should be equipped with suitable masks they should also be provided with the necessary standard operating procedures or processes that have been adjusted to take into account the nature of the work and minimize their interactions with either co-workers or customers or with suppliers now in the event that all of these things are still not possible then to make arrangements for the worker to stay home and the preference would be that the worker can clear their leave so that they continue to receive payment and if after the leave has been exhausted then to find ways to have an arrangement where the workers as well as the employers come to a mutual consensus and in those instances it may be necessary for an au pair leaf arrangement for a period of time so those are the various options that are available to the workers and to the employers I think it is really important for the employers to understand and to attend to the concerns of their workers particularly for the seniors we do want to take good care of them we want to ensure that they not only feel safe if they have to come to work but are actually well protected next question we have time for three more questions you will now take from it a toss if Dini please thank you good evening I just want to clarify about the masks when these requirements takes effect and one more question some cities introduced electronic passes for residents and these passes allow them going shopping or make some sport activity can we expect to introduce such passes here thank you okay all right all right so the wearing of mistakes immediate effect all right so once we have put it out the enforcement agencies will start looking at requiring everyone going out to wear masks as I said many are already doing it if you go out today you already see many wearing a mask we have made it mandatory in many settings anyway whether it's a supermarket or public transport so people are already used to it and now we are stepping up to require the minute you step out of the house when you go out wearing masks will be mandatory on the idea of regulating the flow of people in supermarkets or markets through some form of a pass system it's indeed something that we are we have been looking at for now we have as I say put in place safe distancing ambassadors they are deployed on the ground we have put in place also control access in the control of access into certain places like markets and parks where we were fence up the area and there we are control access into that particular area so if people want to go in then they will have to queue up and that so those sorts of measures the control measures that we have put in place so far as I Manchin have helped to stabilize the situation in some of these areas and if you look at the places that I mentioned they're like parks or markets and Hawker centers the situation today is certainly better than what it was when the circuit breakers started it's generally under control but we are continuing to review and we will see if additional control measures may be necessary to regulate further the flow of people in these areas next question we will not take question from mothership jr. please the mass regulation in place and circuit requirements with all of our measures we will continue to review so it may well continue after the circuit breaker as one additional layer of precaution that would be put in place for all to wear mask so we can't say with certain now when exactly this will end and whether or not it will end of the circuit breaker or it may continue but in any case as I said earlier even without making it mandatory we the good thing is that we already see many people wearing it based on the early advisory right when the early advisory was updated people are doing it and they are conscious and they are aware of why it is useful in order to protect others you know to wear a mask keep your droplets to yourself and you protect others it provides some additional precaution additional protection so more and more Singaporeans and residents are doing it so we made this additional move now to make it mandatory but even without it would say many are already of their own accord wearing a mask of their own I shall also take this opportunity to reinforce ice that that's at the end of the circuit breaker we will need to review whether or not there's a need to extend the circuit breaker period or even if we extend the circuit breaker period whether we need to make adjustments to the various measures that we are put in place and it's also important to bear in mind that even at the end of a circuit breaker with or without extension it's not likely that we will open this entire system all together and then free-for-all everybody do what they like it is going to be a gradual opening we made tighten some measures may relax some measures we may find you in some of the measures so it's not a end period and then that's it and everything else back to normal so we are likely even if we were to begin to open to relax it's going to be a gradual process and it all depends on the risk assessment at the point in time so I think that we should not have the idea that end of a circuit breaker and everything will revert back to normal and we don't have to wear masks anymore we don't have to have safe distancing anymore I think many of these measures even if we were to relax them is going to be a gradual process beyond the circuit breaker period next question do not take the final question from Bloomberg flip please hi good to see you all um couple questions here you know the measures are kind of coming hard and fast now lots of press releases coming each day and you know I wonder to what extent the government might admit that it's taking more of a reactive stance on the virus response as opposed to perhaps over pre-emptive stance that we saw perhaps in the early days when it was a more containment that's one question also I wonder if you can give an idea now what what industries you are considering that could be called fret essentials list and finally given the number of cases what chance do you give the lifting of those circuit breaker circuit breaker measures next month hey you were just talking about thank you so we just to clarify first of all we are still pursuing containment right you you said we were doing containment I think suggesting that we are not doing contain containment anymore we are still continuing with containment we are still continuing with very rigorous contact tracing and quarantine of suspect cases so that approach has not changed basically we are dealing with a situation where all of us know the virus spreads very quickly and it can move the situation can move in unpredictable ways any single day right so we just have to try our best to adapt to be to be agile and to move as fast as we can we've said from the very start of this outbreak that the key to managing the spread of the virus is not just the measures that we have but the pace that we are at which we are able to adjust our strategies and adapt to a situation that is very fluid and changing very rapidly for which the understanding of the virus is also evolving from the beginning till now we have continued to learn new things and scientific advice not just in Singapore but internationally has been continuously been updated and evolved as well so we are in the same situation yesterday and today our posture has not changed our strategies our approach has not changed it is one of constantly looking at the environment internationally and in Singapore and then constantly adjusting and updating our posture in our measure anticipate in a very proactive way and then anticipating also what can happen in the future and given the nature of the virus we just have to be prepared anything can happen in the future that's that's something they've been saying all along and that remains the case that anything can happen and the the way it spreads the new classes that form it can happen in very unpredictable ways because a single case a single weak link can easily lead to new clusters forming on the second question of what could be called from the essential services list I think I must have answered this question at least three times I think all of you are asking me for a specific detail which we are not able to give because as I said the work is happening right now and when we are ready we will update you on what is the which are the ones that we will be removing or reducing or taking out from the list of essential services as I said the aim the key goal is to continue to we started with a list with Delta the appeals and now we've gone back to that original list that we started with the sectors that are key and necessary right and then we are going to trim it down as much as we can in order to reduce a number of people who are still needed to work on a daily basis the third question was respond to that question I think there was a question about whether we are still hopeful that we will be able to lift circuit breaker as scheduled I think it is important for us to remember that we have just implemented the enhancer circuit breaker measures last week and this is the first week into the measures we need to continue to monitor how it goes and at the same time we also have to see cases in a dormitory as quite a separate a challenge that we are facing because the dama trees are now being safeguarded they are quarantine so the there's still some transmission going on within the dama trees which we are addressing through the Joint Task Force efforts but that because they are already quarantine in the Dhamma trees for those with a large clusters I think they are not likely to affect the community outside the dama trees and then we have also removed the essential workers from these Dhamma trees into a separate accommodation so they don't go in and out anymore by the same time we are also monitoring the transmission outside the dhamma tree in the community we are paying close attention to these cases especially the unlink cases as DMS mentioned we are continuing with contact tracing to attempt to link these cases to identify the sources of these cases we are watching and monitoring the development and we think that over the next few days a week or so we will continue to see that number rising because many of these interactions that we are seeing today are seeded before the safety sensing measures have been put in place so we will need time for these measures to take effect and we also need to make sure that we will continue to monitor and adjust our measures as we go along so I think if we are able to work together all Singaporeans observe the rules of a safe distancing I think we will be able to succeed in slowing down this transmission effectively thank you ",True,True,True,True
U7F4pkhUJ1Q,COVID-19 Effects on Mental Health of Healthcare Workers – Stanford DOM Grand Rounds – 22 July 2020,UCXb0w5GOQy0rLW1w8qGh_NQ,Stanford Department of Medicine,2020-07-23T15:13:16Z,"In this Stanford Department of Medicine Grand Rounds presentation, expert Debra Kaysen discusses the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare ...",okay uh good morning everybody uh today we have a really uh exciting uh presentation uh as usual before we get started with the presentation we have a couple brief updates and also as usual we will be offering the cme that link will be coming out to you very soon i also wanted to bring your attention to one new website that was created uh with help from uh michael hollis in the school of medicine uh with our own jack zhang together with dr harrington dr singh uh kathy um garzio and a number of other people they created a website called race for the cure it could be found uh jack wilson.link that really summarizes amazing uh all the different uh therapeutics that are in process being studied right now from different therapeutics to vaccines so we'll send that out later as well today but wanted to share that with you and so we'll start with our updates now so dr huja i'll turn it over to you great thank you good morning everyone uh today we have a 35 coveted patients in the hospital at this time focusing on the shc numbers of 224 42 patients have reached our icu and that percentile has stayed stable there have now been 10 deaths at stanford and again that percentage has stayed stable under 5 looking at the age breakdown and i showed you this last week as well um it's really you know been the same there was a small shift towards the younger population as we've seen and looking at our gender breakdown there is a slight predominance of females in our covid population just over 50 percent which is has been consistent at our institution and you can see here of the female population 26 of them have been pregnant giving us you know a significant number of uh pregnant women that we're taking care of in collaboration with our ob colleagues i wanted to show you some um information about the surge planning that we have and so there are actually quite a few meetings that occur either every day or you know every week at certain times in collaboration with shc and school of medicine faculty looking at certain triggers so looking at the awards and capacity for staffing there under the auspices of the icu leadership with the help of angela rogers arthur sung and weiniker norm risk and steve ruas looking at capacity with regards to our events and md staffing and then you know the support of our local community both in the bay area and patients coming from southern california with steve ruas and rudy arthofer helping be the gatekeeper of the transfer center and helping these patients who might need higher levels of care or potentially therapeutics and looking into therapeutics you know id with the help of shanti kappa goda has been really helpful in developing both uh some treatment indications as well as a lottery system should we ever get there if patients exceed the supply of rem death severe for example and then making sure that the clinical trials that have remdessed severe are available for patients who are eligible and interested i wanted to show some length of stay data the average length of stay of a patient on the general medicine awards is usually four days and you can see now with our covet patients for those who do not go to the icu it's about the same length of stay so i think the teams have you know really done a good job of streamlining their care they know how to manage these patients in fact the radiology reports now read uh for patients that have pulmonary findings that uh you know consistent with covet infection so i think there's definitely some patterns of familiarity in the care of these patients now however if a patient were to go to the icu the average length of stay is about 17 days and when these patients do go to the icu the majority of them occur within the first 48 hours so it's relatively early in their care and then here you can see in the green lines the number of discharges of covid patients per day and then the black line uh reflects the number of deaths and then down below you can see the i icu transfers to the aau so that's downgrades that occur day by day and then again the orange line is the total number of patients in the wards and the icu with the icu broken down in red and that dramatic uptick uh from late june to current day looking at our seven bay area counties and again noticing last weekend this week the lower proportion of icu patients as we see the uptick of patients in the hospital in part that being from the younger demographic that's being admitted and then finally for the last slide just looking at the seven bay area counties and the trends there with santa clara county being here in purple so thank you to my data team and errol i'll turn it back over to you thank you thanks so much dr hooja dr chang also has some updates he wanted to share with you regarding occupational health hi good morning uh so trends and occupational health are paralleling what we're seeing on the inpatient side as well as uh in the community you can see in this uh graph looking back over the last eight weeks that positive employees unfortunately have continued to rise steadily mercifully in the last week it has plateaued again hopefully reflecting what's going on in the community overall uh the positivity rate uh in relation to those tested remains relatively low at three percent overall and five percent for people who are symptomatic uh and and that's significant 95 of people with symptoms turn out to have something other than covet but this is uh this is the volume trend i thought i'd also share with you um the distribution where people are getting their infections from sources of infection so i apologize the visibility isn't great i just did this this morning as i was collecting our experience over the past couple weeks in july the 58 new positive health care workers broke down as follows the single largest source not surprisingly was household transmission 20 that's in the blue 20 out of 58 people had a known household positive member the next largest was 16 out of 58 in orange had no known exposure and and that also is consistent with uh general community prevalence uh an important point is that uh the gray uh wedge is uh travel mostly domestic travel and that has been emerging as a significant source of uh infection either the the mass transit aspect of the travel itself or more likely the prevalence of the place they traveled to or even more likely what they were doing when they went there because you don't go and stay in a room you go and do something and so family gatherings are a common source of infection out of state and then other sources of notes were mass transit going to the gym or going to mass outing was a source of infection and then also a new source is patient exposures so what are we doing in response to this in occupational health while the majority of this is really outside of our control in terms of household and unknown community exposures uh there are several things that we are doing as an organization to try to increase uh the protection of our workforce uh one is uh the oversight body court has approved the addition of the use of face shields or goggles eye protection for all health care workers in who are patient or patient visitor facing we are still working out exactly how to implement that and what it means but that's a direction that we are going in everyone now with a household known positive member are is being asked to quarantine for 14 days uh all symptomatic persons even though the majority turn out not to have covert anyone with symptoms we are now asking to stay home until their test result comes back the good news is that 95 are negative and can come back to work uh the lab turnaround uh has been uh excellent this week uh thanks for our lab colleagues work on this and now it's a one day uh and then finally we're looking at travel domestic travel as i said it's an emerging source of infection in our healthcare workers new york new jersey connecticut has already mandated a 14-day quarantine this morning stanford university for their own uh campus uh employees have mandated a 14-day a quarantine for travel outside of northern california and so we are looking at our data and we'll be trying to reconcile our policy with the university's policy uh and factoring in uh cdc recommendations and and local recommendations that's the update on ikea for this morning dr chang thank you for everything you're doing and thank you for those updates um so we'll move on now so um i before i talk about our presenter today i just wanted to briefly update you on upcoming ground rounds in the next few weeks next week we have dr sarah rudman she's the assistant public health officer for the santa clara county uh public health department assistant with working with dr sarah cody and she's going to present i kind of left it open to her she's going to kind of present about the various different things talking about contact tracing and really trying to provide some color into the um kind of the insights of what's been going on behind the scenes in the department and really wants to provide an opportunity for you to ask any questions as well to that end you'll see a survey helena is going to send out in the chat here and feel free to answer it's a one question optional survey where you can ask any questions in advance or dr revlon can plan in advance and try to address some of those questions but we'll make sure we have lots of time for you to ask questions for her next week so we're really really looking forward to that the week after that we have covert 19 the effect on homeless population with dr ho and bomb burger burger and then the week after that we have uh dr martin landry as you may know he was the principal investigator for the recovery trial that of course has affected care for covetations worldwide so we're really looking forward to having him join us so some great sessions in the coming weeks um moving on for today though we have a really exciting uh presentation uh dr deborah kasich and she's going to be talking about kevin 19 and mental health care impact on many of our us health care workers dr cason i got her phd in the university of missouri in 2003 she did her internship and fellowship in the university of washington in 2006 and stayed on this faculty there during her time at the university of washington she founded many programs including one that worked to develop and test more accessible interventions for people suffering from mental health health impacts of traumatic events she joined the stanford faculty in 2019 and she has been a very active person both in clinical and research in the focus of post-traumatic stress disorder and related disorders as you might have guessed she's had she's been busy throughout her career but particularly this year and we're really lucky to have her with us today it's a talk that many people have been asking for so again thank you for joining us thank you to dr sheila lahjani for recommending connecting me with that dr cason as well so dr kasich i'm going to stop sharing my slides and let you share yours and uh and while i'm doing that okay i'll go ahead and let you share your slides thank you for being with us i also want to point out one thing i learned about uh dr cason uh she's an expert in another form of that i wasn't aware of cognitive processing therapy and but i understand it's an opportunity to provide treatment in a shorter time period her work was actually highlighted on the radio show this american life where um someone who suffered from uh proportionate stresses or abuse from 30 years ago filmed i recorded all 10 sessions and put them online as part of this radio show so i really encourage you to check that out i'll send the link to this if any of you would like to watch it but it really allows the opportunity to see dr cason in action it's really really powerful dr case and i'll turn it over to you thank you so much for being with us today beautiful thank you so much and thank you for letting me borrow your time i know everyone here is extremely busy i'm going to dive right in and talk about you know covet 19 is a novel type of traumatic stressor and because of that we're learning together about what's likely to work in this context and we're refining what we recommend in terms of mental health protections based on what we learn that being said we're not flying blind there's actually quite a bit that we know from prior epidemics on their effect on health care workers and what can be helpful in buffering them and that's where we're really going to start so you know my the prior speakers i think did a nice job of setting the context the scope of this pandemic is unprecedented both in terms of its global impact and its duration as we know the u.s is one of the hot spots and cases are rising currently in california health care workers pretty consistently in the literature on the mental health effects of epidemics are one of the groups that are most at risk for experiencing mental health impacts from responding to epidemics now i do want to clarify in part because this is coming up quite a bit in popular media the difference between stress and traumatic stress and kovac 19 actually fits into both categories so stress is any kind of uncomfortable emotional experience with physiological and behavioral changes and not all stress is bad stress so for example starting a new job moving having a baby getting married those are all stressors but in most cases those are positive events chronic and persistent stress can have psychological and physical effects though now traumatic stress is more specific it involves exposure to actual or threatened death serious injury sexual violence or repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of traumatic events usually in the course of your job so first responders medics health care workers would fit into the that category and you can think that cloven 19 has certain experiences that fit into that category but it also has more general stressors things like having too much work being isolated boredom being quarantined following the news you know with the doom scrolling and and just seeing all the terrible things happening those would be stressors and and the way we intervene is a little different if something is a traumatic event versus a chronic stressor so when we look a little bit more closely at what we're seeing with healthcare workers with covid19 the mental health impact is is quite evident your prior research on the sars mers and ebola outbreaks found that healthcare workers and recovered patients were particularly high risk for depression anxiety and ptsd both during and after the outbreaks among healthcare workers the individuals who worked more closely with patients who were sars positive mers positive or who had ebola were more likely to experience mental health symptoms especially in the months and years that followed now when we look at some of the data that's coming out globally on the experiences of health care workers this is from a study that was done within the first few months of the outbreak in china among their health care workers when we look at just reporting symptoms most of the healthcare workers were reporting some symptoms consistent with traumatic stress so it's about 74 about half were reporting symptoms of depression a little less than half were reporting symptoms of anxiety and about a third of them were reporting some type of impact on their sleep and sleep disturbance and these rates were the highest among the health care workers who are working most directly with cova positive patients if we drill down into that data though a little bit more closely and look at folks who are at clinical levels of symptoms the rates are much lower um but about a third of the health care workers were reporting symptoms of traumatic stress that were at a clinical level 15 were reporting that in depression about twelve percent with anxiety and about eight percent were reporting clinical levels of insomnia this is actually quite consistent with a survey that was done of healthcare providers in singapore and india with about 30 physician enrollment anxiety was found in about 15 percent of those physicians depression in 10 and traumatic stress in about 5 so fairly consistent although there are some differences we don't have data yet really uh coming from the u.s healthcare workforce so we're still waiting to know how this is impacting our health care workers now there are several risk factors for distress are things that we found that contribute to this so long work hours constantly changing protocols there was a recent paper that came out looking at nurses responding in new york and one of the things that they reported is that the inconsistencies and constant changing and protocols was an additional source of stress um experiences of stigma from others increases risk role conflicts you know there are still folks who are struggling with how do i take care of other people in my family and do my job when both are very high demand media coverage uh one thing i will say is that you if you can limit the amount of consumption that you have of media and social media that actually will be quite good for your mental health the lack of specific treatments is a stressor and then limited supply of ppe so we can think about the stressors as coming in different discernible waves or periods of time so during the pre-trauma period and i'm thinking about the time that we in april and march when we were preparing there's an increased workload there's uncertainty about what kind of equipment is going to be available and there are worries about whether one might get sick or one might infect one's family members as one moves into the surge in the peak trauma period increased workload and staffing issues becomes more of a stressor shortages of ppe and other equipment has come up quite consistently globally as a stressor and as a risk factor for mental health concerns there is increased risk of contracting the infection and of infecting family members and worrying about those and then quarantine has its own mental health risk factors associated with it when we get into the post-trauma phase then factors such as a shortage of health care providers and the economic impact on both the institution itself and on the larger community become stressors or risk factors now i think one of the challenges with covet 19 is that as we are seeing it's not a linear progression from pre to post trauma we're going in and out of phases depending on what case rates are like in our area in a recent survey of emergency room physicians i just want to highlight this point because i think it's essential assurances about safety and security was one of the things that the physicians indicated would most alleviate anxiety for them and that was specifically around adequate ppe knowing that their families would be safe was one of the factors that the physicians reported would be most beneficial in addition we don't come into this situation all in the same place so for folks who are already having a hard time with stress or burnout we're already having some challenges with coping they will be slightly more at risk in part because the gas tank is doesn't have as much fuel in it in looking at stanford's own well md program and the model for how do we take care of our healthcare workforce this is quite consistent with some of the strategies and skills that i'm going to be talking about with all of you today so there's this concept of a culture of wellness of having shared values and behaviors in leadership having compassion for self and others the concept of efficiency of practice of having systems that help people work effectively and having positive patient and colleague interactions and work-life balance and the concept of personal resilience although i'm going to be emphasizing ways to build personal resilience you'll also notice as we're talking together that i'm also going to be talking about things about work-life balance and positive team interactions as well as having compassion for oneself as ways to be more resilient in the face of covet 19. so one of the first things to recognize is that when we're faced with stressors like this there are quite common normal reactions to these sorts of events so the first set of reactions are what are called intrusions or intrusive reactions and these are ways that the event comes back to mind this can be things like thoughts images dreams or emotional or physical reactions to reminders there are also avoidance cues so what happens when we are exposed to something that is a stressor especially a traumatic stressor is we may try to remove ourselves from it or protect ourselves from distress that can be things like avoiding talking about the event thinking about it having feelings about it or avoiding reminders of it many of us as health care providers also will try to push through and that can serve as avoidance as well right because we're compartmentalizing our own emotions or our own feeling thinking about the event but if we keep doing that over time it's avoidance there's also physical arousal so the body reacts as if danger is still present that can be things like being hyper vigilant so looking for danger being easily startled or jumpy being irritable having outbursts of anger or fear or tears trouble sleeping trouble concentrating it also can include monitoring yourself for physical signs of infection or monitoring others with events like this there also can be grief it's in response to the death of loved ones or colleagues this is sadness anger guilt regret missing or longing for the person or having dreams of seeing them and traumatic grief that can focus on how the death could have been prevented who was at fault or to blame and that could make it difficult to adjust to the death and we can have physical reactions these can be things like headaches dizziness muscle aches hyperventilating having a rapid heartbeat and one of the challenges is that some of these acute physical reactions also can look like symptoms of coved 19 and so this can lead to panic attacks or excessive self-monitoring now with regards to guilt what we're seeing among health care workers is that there are multiple potential sources of guilt in the acute phase of the pandemic so this can be guilt about potential transmission of the virus to family members it can be moral distress where we feel like we're being asked to do things that go against our own moral code or professional code can be guilt about lower work efficiency can also be guilt about feeling like you can't be at work carrying out your regular duties if you are sick or quarantined um it can be about not being able to work after you've tested negative but you're still feeling sick and aren't able to perform your normal work and you feel like you're letting your team down and it can also be guilt over mistakes now one thing to stress is that these reactions are not psychopathology these reactions are common they're normal they're expected and they're understandable in the face of stressors the place where you may want to pay more attention is and to actually reach out for help is if these symptoms or reactions are going on for more than two months and if they worsen or if they're impairing or functioning either at home or at work now even though these reactions are common for many people they will improve over time as the stress comes down one thing to remember and i um i'm concerned by the media reports that keep talking about a mental health tsunami that is going to face that is going to face all of us globally because the reality is that humans are resilient resilience means that we adapt well in the face of stress and most of us actually are able to recover naturally from these types of stressors this is common it's not extraordinary that doesn't mean that you're not having a hard time or that you're not distressed and it's not a trait so we can learn to be resilient and actually most of what i'm going to talk about is how can we build resilience it's also important to remember that resilience isn't one size fits all we follow different pathways and trajectories and we rely on different coping strategies to get there and because we may be experiencing different stressors at a given time we're going to have ups and downs in our symptoms and our functioning and in our resilience in the moment so in terms of ways to promote resilience during the peak trauma phase and even in the post-trauma phase um there are things that we can do so promoting safety and restoring calmness normalizing acute reactions that's what i was just doing as we were talking about what are common responses building a sense of self-efficacy i'm going to talk about some strategies about that in just a sec feeling connected and belonging and having mental openness about what's happening all can help build resilience i would also add that clear messaging and communication from leadership is essential feeling part of a cohesive team and giving and receiving support as part of that team is helpful as is feeling listened to and having a space for decompression so i'm going to briefly talk about what can you do in the field right so some of the strategies are things you can do while you're at work while you're in the midst of things other strategies are more things that you can do when you have a break when you're at home or between chefs so in the fielded stuff a lot of people are working at very high rates right now but some things that you can do that can help you cope in the field so taking breaks taking more frequent breaks than usual if you can i'm remembering to breathe and that sounds uh simple but it actually will help bring down your heart rate it'll bring down anxiety so doing three minute breathing breaks can be extremely helpful uh using support resources so one thing that multiple groups have talked about as a helpful strategy is to start shifts with a group coping strategy and to end a shift with group words of support or with a group debriefing about how things went reflecting at the end of the shift about what went well what didn't again offering support and taking rest so using the restroom when you need to taking breaks again as needed some other strategies in the field that groups from new york were reporting were helpful were things like during a shift having a respite area where employees can rest shower get some emotional support grab a snack if they need having soothing music or tv or other de-stressing activities in that space they report it as being extremely helpful the other piece is to remember during your shift that the stress is understandable to have a partner to buddy up with and check in with and staying in contact with people that you care about after your shift and to give yourself permission to pause and recharge and we're going to talk a little bit more about that now so the other thing to build resilience is to lean on coping strategies and to build new ones so when one is stressed often it is easiest to start with strategies that are already familiar to us what's worked well for you in the past during stressful times are there things that you've used in the past that you've stopped using now start those up again by starting with what you already know first of all you're not having to master a new skill or a new habit and it also enhances your sense of self-advocacy okay now it may be that there are skills that you used to use that aren't as effective now and some might not be as effective but they are still working that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you or wrong with the skill it just means that the stressor might need you to shift the strategies a little bit so you might need to add some new adaptive coping actions and you want to be open to troubleshooting either new ways to implement coping strategies or some ones that you might want to try that you haven't used before so in terms of adaptive coping activities these are some ideas this is not an exhaustive list this is intended to be some things to think about and some of them are going to be better for different people or better in different contexts i would emphasize exercise is a wonderful intervention it works for depression and anxiety it works for stress so building in an exercise routine that you can keep up with is great journaling can be very helpful for dealing with some of the hard stuff sometimes it's just focusing in the moment on something practical that you can do right now relaxation methods i'm going to actually show you guys a tool that's available for playing with different relaxation methods whether it's progressive muscle relaxation or meditation or using the breathing strategies but there are multiple different ones to try the other thing i would add around coping before i move into social support is it is important to set up a regular practice schedule around coping sometimes we forget to use our coping strategies until we're in crisis and then we wonder why they don't work it's like trying to learn to use a stick shift you really want to practice it a lot not try it on the hills in san francisco for your first shot do the same thing with the coping strategies so social connections and support are actually one of the most effective agents in preventing traumatic stress responses for helping promote recovery and i know with this event with quarantine social distancing um and high workloads it's very easy to become socially isolated or withdrawn but we know that social connections are one of the most helpful things for humans in being well um and in recovering so there are different kinds of social social support that someone may want or need and it can be helpful to think about these different kinds of connections so it may be material assistance or physical assistance i need someone to help me with something it may be advice it may be someone that you can lean on for emotional support and for those of us who are not so good at asking for social support you can think about which ones might be easier for me to ask for first and start with that so the other thing to think about is that giving social support is also helpful for our emotional well-being so there's the concept of tend and befriend which is taking care of others is often a way of actually reassuring our own sense of self-worth and feeling cared for and valued i would say for health care workers just watch the balance of that many of us are very good at taking care of others not so good at taking care of ourselves and so making sure that there's a good healthy balance in there i think with covet 19 sometimes we have to be more mindful or thoughtful about building this in we have to do a little bit more reaching out because some of these social connections aren't happening in naturalistic ways as they might in other contexts so another thing to think about is how to manage reminders and to just be prepared for these so there may be trauma reminders so if you've gone through something especially distressing either in the workplace or in your own life these are events that evoke the thoughts or feelings related to that event and it can bring up those thoughts and feelings long after the event has ended as well as right in the immediate aftermath there can be loss reminders so for those of us who are grieving these are things that bring to mind the absence of the person that has died and there are change reminders our lives look very different than they did a year ago and so there may be these reminders that hit you about how life has changed and a feeling of grief and loss about that so knowing what might be a reminder for you and having some coping strategies in mind about how to address that or how to be prepared for that can be extremely helpful so it doesn't catch you off guard these can be things like the south sight sounds places smells um the time of day the situation the room it can be physiological reactions you feel your heart start beating faster and that brings up the reminder so planning around these responses can actually help reduce their duration and their intensity okay just a word about sleep health and i know there was a really lovely webinar specifically on sleep so i would encourage those of you who are having sleep problems to listen to that but some brief tips around managing sleep to the extent that you can with your work schedule establishing a regular sleep schedule and limiting daytime naps to no more than 15 minutes and no napping after four reducing your use of alcohol a lot of folks i know go to alcohol as a way to try to manage sleep but it's a terrible medication for sleep structure architecture also eliminating your afternoon or evening caffeine increasing exercise and working on cultivating some relaxation before bedtime or doing something calming if you're finding that worrying is keeping you up you're lying in bed and worrying quite a bit you can use a worry diary um so jotting the thoughts down and then dealing with them in the morning so i want to talk about my favorite group of the strategies which is around how do we talk to ourselves and how can we use that in a different way to manage stress so especially around strong negative emotions like guilt shame or blame using some gentle curious questions can help address the beliefs that feed those emotions and we know that stress changes the way we talk to ourselves so just like when we're stressed we can feel our muscles tighten up in some ways stress can make our thinking overly rigid and unyielding so it may be things like you know this is a terrible time i can't keep myself or my family safe it may be doubts about our own judgment i'm feeling overwhelmed i can't manage this workload self-blame something bad habit it was my fault or esteem the world is unfair other people don't care enough about us those thoughts are probably not accurate so what we do when working on self-talk is first identify what the thought is then ask some questions to test the thought and then work on changing the thought to be more yielding more balanced you can almost think about it as mental yoga you're going for increased flexibility and range of motion so some questions you can ask yourself if you're noticing you're having those kinds of rigid thoughts you can ask some questions to gain perspective what's the evidence that this thought is true is there any evidence it isn't completely true is there another way to look at the situation that might be less distressing or more helpful you know our thoughts influence our feelings so if you're having angry thoughts you're gonna have angry feelings anxious thoughts have anxious feelings and you can think about these as mental pictures that run through your mind so asking these questions helps you really test whether that is completely true another one is to use a compassionate lens to ask yourself is this the thought that i would say to a good friend who's saying this or if i'm in my kindest space what might i say to myself instead often we're better to other people than we are to ourselves and so this is turning that lens on ourselves now for those blame thoughts looking at hindsight bias is quite helpful often we're judging a decision or what we did based on the knowledge we have now so asking yourself questions like did you know this would be the outcome realistically what options did you realistically have at the time and what was your intent that can help for the what-ifs or the kurdish to help bring those down so just briefly running through a couple of examples for someone who's saying i can't manage this work a more flexible thought might be i'm coping the best i can in a really difficult situation that thought is probably more accurate okay and less distressing and so when you find a thought like this that's a bit more balanced you then want to practice saying this to yourself so for safety i can't keep myself safe is that completely true what are the things you're doing what would you say to a good friend i have some specific things that i can do that will be more likely to keep myself and my family safe an example of blame i should have done something differently right some questions did you know this would be the outcome realistically what options did you have at the time and what was your intent more flexible thought might be i did the best i could in a really difficult situation so i wanted to give you guys some resources to think about the covet coach is a free app that was developed by the national centers for ptsd and it has tools around self-care around relaxation and coping it has some light touch self-talk kinds of skills as well it's got meditation and breathing it does not share your data with anyone or do anything with your data so it's a quite safe app and it was pulled together uh from multiple mental health experts um so i strongly recommend that if you're having specific problems with sleep you might want to look at the cbti app it actually has some very nice tools for addressing sleep problems and if you're feeling really overwhelmed with stress and with how do i break down all the stuff that i'm balancing the move forward app is a nice one for teaching problem solving skills for those of you who want some resources these are some references at the ebola psychological first aid manual i think is an especially nice resource for folks and then if you're needing a little bit more support there are actually quite a number of local resources that i've pulled together for all of you um that includes uh that there are trained physician peers that you can speak with the well connect program for trainees and there are some wonderful resources actually at the faculty staff help center space around different types of stressors and the well md program so i wanted to save time for us to be able to talk through this and to do some q a okay so thank you so much for all that information for those links um we will send a follow-up email with that slider or the direct links to those websites for you as well um perfect there's a few questions coming in right now first one dr hopkins asks uh he asked this one a little earlier what is different about the fifty percent of health care providers who are not depressed maybe the characteristic is just of them or what's what's unique about them it's a wonderful question how do we understand who's gonna wind up in that risk group and who's not um so from a data standpoint what we're seeing is that nurses are more at risk for whatever reason women are more at risk potentially because women are also often taking on the lion's share of family responsibilities and stressors as well folks who are already experiencing mental health concerns before this hit also are more likely to wind up in that depressed or anxious group so those are some of the consistent risk factors that we're seeing across samples okay great thank you um dr casey next question here uh how can teams better address psychological safety to those experiencing the pandemic differently and make sure they also have a voice so some groups may be focusing on the loss of social interactions like going to wedding but other groups are focusing on things like family members and friends being infected with kovitz struggling with loss of job or food insecurity yeah no that's a great question and you know i think you also highlight that this event is hitting different people and different groups of people in different ways i think one thing that you can do is actually building in a place that for people to check in right how is everyone doing i've been doing that with my own teams and with my own students for example is making sure that i'm actually rather than just diving into business and we're all so busy it's easy to do that of actually how are you and asking it as a general question and making sure that people don't experience consequences for being upfront about genuinely answering that question i think for folks who are struggling with issues um that are stressors outside of work trying to tap them into the resources that do exist at stanford that we can i know within the psychiatry department we were doing the listening forums which were extremely helpful for a place for people to talk about what was going on for them um and to get some additional resources and support when they needed it so those would be some suggestions i would have okay great thank you um another question here what about if your spouse is more stressed than you are is there help for spouses of employees uh well i can't answer the specifics about what what resources are available but my memory in going through that list of links is i think on the support during difficult times link and i know that in the faculty and staff help center there were actually some specific resources listed for spouses as well okay great thank you can you please comment on the impact of mental health professionals and their workloads the effect of workload you touched on this a little bit earlier maybe elaborate more on how their workload affects the mental well-being yeah um and i think you're i'm assuming that the question is about healthcare workers and workload not the mental health workforce and our workload related but not exactly the same um so in terms of the healthcare workforce you know i think the analogy around fuel in the fuel tank is not a bad one which is that we all need time to recharge as workloads go up it becomes harder to use those coping strategies there's on only so many hours in the day i do think it's a place where carving out that time is important to be able to rest to be able to recharge i think that giving yourself permission to fall apart at times is actually quite helpful um but that is part of the recovery process and the resilience process when we're exhausted um you know we need to be a little more patient with ourselves and others so that's a place where that self compassion and compassion towards others is quite helpful um and i think carving out the break times that you can again is going to make you more resilient great um a quick question here from um how do you ask that the apps reference for healthcare workers uh are they work healthcare workers specific or good for patients too that the websites you share shared with us so this page of resources is more oriented towards us these resources the covet coach the cbti app the move forward place and there's actually a bunch of other resources on that page it's like a cornucopia of good coping strategies those are useful for patients and i didn't focus this talk on the impact on patients but we are finding that specific groups of patients are at high risk for long-term mental health problems related to covet as well specifically icu stays are associated with risks of ptsd and depression patients who may be quarantined can be at risk and individuals who have more severe cases of covid may be more at risk that certainly was true with the ebola outbreak so yes please share these resources with your patients excellent uh dr ewan kim asks for those of us who are working from home or waiting for deployment can we volunteer or get trained to be peer support listeners are there enough of those do you need more can you connect can we get trained and she also says thanks for the excellent talk oh awesome um i love that question so i am uh i am not uh part of the well md program but what i would do is i would actually reach out to them and find out how you can get trained i am sure they would love love to have your help we also created a reserve core basically of mental health providers for doing the the connect and recharge groups right now we're on hold waiting for you guys but if people are also struggling we can set up a one-to-one call with any of the connect and recharge providers so we also have those resources for you all as well great thank you um next question here what if you feel your colleague is not doing well and they absolutely are in denial should it be reported to someone oh that is really hard um that is really hard you know i think the best step and it sounds like you may have already tried that is to talk to them in a caring way about the concerns that you have you know it seems like you're suffering and i'm worried about you and i know you're trying to push through and so trying to do that as a first step i think is useful if that's not working um you know i think talking to somebody's uh supervisor especially if you can do it in a compassionate way about how do we help get this person some support is a good next step whether you should report someone i think you know if somebody's getting to a place where it's impairing patient care then that may be an issue that it has to be escalated dr cason uh has there been and i imagine there's been uh at different levels this type of discussion with leadership so that can be educated and uh i guess the the people who are being led want to know that this all the things you're talking about self-care there are leaders i know our leader for example in department medicine we have many of them that promote this stuff making sure we're taking care of ourselves but this time doing systematically or organizationally this training oh well that is probably above my pay grade my experience in working with the well md group is that this is actually something that has been embraced by stanford leadership and the this is part of an organized program um i do think that there are some groups that are embracing some of these principles and there are are different groups implementing it in different ways um there are probably some better ways to integrate all of what we're doing so we don't uh unnecessarily replicate efforts across teams great um and dr case and i had a question that came in quite earlier through the chat function here anonymous question and it has to do with staff as well so any advice for the hundreds of staff who have had um pivot to remote work even uh even though they're not patient facing they worry about our doctors they worry about their own families and many of them family members who are first responders anything the managers of these staff can do specifically yeah that's a great question you know i think some of the same strategies that we talked about would work with those staff as well so doing check-ins building team meetings where people can connect you can think about those first of all rituals are helpful for people having predictability that's part of what's driving us all nuts with this is there's so much uncertainty so i think as a manager what i might do is seeing if there are ways to build in huddles or those social supports and connections both with staff pre shift and post if that works with people's workflow and checking in with people about whether that is helpful or not i would also say i didn't talk about this so much in the skills part but if you have people who are worrying a lot my favorite strategy for that is to schedule it and i know it sounds really silly but using setting aside 20 minutes a day is scheduled worry time that's the time you get to worry about the doctors the patients whatever it is right when the worry thoughts come up at other times write it down on a list and then put it on the back burner until you get to that worry time so i think there's both there's some individual level strategies about worrying and then there's some manager level strategies about worrying gotcha um yeah next question up uh lala our colleague in the emergency department happy to have colleagues from throughout the school of medicine with us she asked a good question here and she says this is a marathon uh we have many more months of this ahead of us and we must be kind and collegial to each other knowing we are all under some degree of stress to prevent us from adding to each other's stress many of us are filled with pride and purpose some are of our jobs prevent us from email but do optimally perform with coping strategies right now is the institution thinking of a post-trauma plan for the healthcare workers after we are out of this i can't speak to what the institution is doing um but i will say to you i agree with everything that you just said and if the institution wants to put together a post-trauma plan hey i think it's needed and b i would be delighted to be a part of that thinking process great we'll try to get through these last one or two more here as time runs out can you please clarify how to implement not doing quote quote-unquote doom-scrolling in a mindful way is there any important information in the news that many of us do not privilege do not have the privilege to ignore i hear ya um and and i will say that this is one of those physician um what i say versus what i do just listen to what i'm saying not necessarily what i'm always doing um so i think with news what you can do is actually set a time limit on it and there is some data that sort of about 30 minutes of news consumption a day is sufficient and is not associated with mental health impacts and to be honest um there's not that much value added after that right there's not that much new information so set a timer um there are actually productivity tools that you can use or the adult controls to turn it off and then be choosy about what media you're consuming to have it be high quality right um so and and that's consistent with some of the data coming out of 9 11 the news consumption was actually associated with higher risk of traumatic stress symptoms for folks okay great and perhaps there's just one question left at this one and conclude here but any uh comments that you can have any reports on increased harassment of healthcare workers especially women um this uh healthcare worker was saying she's experienced more particularly over televising the last few weeks and obviously there's a role in stress absolutely absolutely and i'm very sorry to hear about that i mean i know in terms of the international media there have been physical attacks on health care workers in some places um in terms of telemedicine attacks that i have not heard of as much but i am sorry that you're experiencing that you know again i think where you can set limits or if there are places where you can get buffers from that that would certainly be better and then having places that you can check in and debrief about that um i think is essential because that is a more extreme stressor got it that's perfect yeah and we'll end on this last uh comment here watch a movie rather than the news yes i agree with that uh dr cason thank you so much for letting your expertise and your time look to us and we really appreciate it i learned a lot thank you again uh thank you to our panelists and to everybody for sticking with us and we'll see you next week ,True,False,True,False

NTFLHCrbKOI,"Mental Health, Suicidal Thoughts and Being A Content Creator ft. Wengie | Find A Way #WithMe",UCFRIAxGTWQ4mllzdkdomAkQ,TEAM NOC,2020-12-20T10:00:06Z,"Joined by one of our favourite YouTubers (and personal friend) Wengie, we dive deep into mental health in the world of content creation. In a time when ...",[Music] hi guys welcome to another episode of team and oc today we have a very special guest reggie from australia hey guys what's up we have been fresh for quite some time i think i think i was your friend before you blew up yeah yeah here and he took me to eat it was so good it was a beach road for me yes i remember yeah so we are here today to talk about stress mental health in our job as content creators in front of us there's two deck of cards we will ask each other questions and let you see and understand more about what we do it's a tough job guys let's let's get into it let's start tell me about the first time you first realized how mentally damaging your work could be for you oh my god wow we're getting deep real quick this is quite quick it is pretty tough being in the position that we're being i think the first time i realized how damaging it was was realizing how everyone has an opinion about you that's probably the first thing i realize and the toughest thing as well because it's easy being popular is easy when people say great things about you but on the flip side if there's people loving you there's also people hating you so it's just like being able to navigate through all the everyone's opinions about you and being able to stand firm in what you believe in no matter what people say about you because it's very easy to get convinced or have what you believe in yourself be moved really quickly by someone else's opinion especially if you're feeling like there's hundreds and hundreds of that same opinion it's very easy to lose yourself it's very easy to lose your own values and what you believe in so that was really tough because in real life like you would agree no one's that mean to you yes yes they usually don't dare to come up to you and tell you face to face exactly so like to have that like so direct like i've never experienced it before in real life yes online is just like wow it's just like being punched in the face all right it's really quite toxic and when they assume things about you that is not true and they make it sound like it's so true it's just very demeaning and the moment you even try to defend yourself other people will start thinking like oh why are you so defensive oh you shouldn't do this you you are way bigger than that but we are humans too that's emotions right and that point you said about like how they want to say it's real yeah even my wikipedia page is wrong i have a sentence in my wikipedia page because i have a sister and i'm like when when was that my whole life i don't remember having a sister but they seem so convincing yes on like the wikipedia page they also say like i have a net worth of uh 20 million dollars but i wish that was true oh okay so where's my big gift by the way you don't have that another thing that is very mentally damaging is also our work-life balance there is none we are like 24 hours working and people expect us to be on our best at all times yeah so people like oh you have so much freedom you know you get to work whenever you want yeah whenever means all the time yes like every like 24 hours yes what was your most destructive way of coping with stress most destructive not the nicest way what's the worst thing you did i smoke a lot when i'm faced with a lot of stress like really a lot and yeah recently i've been trying to stop so i kind of stopped smoking cigarettes for quite some time yeah trying crying keyword keywords trying yeah i do know some of my other creator friends they drink a lot some just cry so yeah crying always feels crying crying yeah i do that sometimes also what about you what do you do well i played a lot of lol game yeah i like to escape into another world with games so i remember the time when i felt the most stressed maybe early on in my career i just quit my job to do youtube full-time oh and it was just the reality of it was really tough because you know how your parents always like stable income and i did my education so i quit everything to do youtube and it was very stressful because i wasn't even making rent so i just disappeared into low games right eight hours a day yeah just an escape oh and it got pretty bad i was like playing from like 9 00 p.m to 4 a.m you get good silver floor okay time before i don't know i feel like if i play games a lot i just ignore everything right right and it's just destructive to just my overall health right right i didn't sleep i didn't go out i didn't do anything basically oh damn this this is really heavy what was your darkest moment ever while working in the industry obviously i think three years ago when i found out that yes my marriage is going to sheets it was obviously very daunting because as a bubbly figure you're not sure how how you're ever going to break out that news it's a very big news at least to me and uh it makes it hard for me to visualize how am i going to move on with life while keeping that part of my life private imagine if i go out to date somebody and keeping my divorce a private thing then people will start to say hey why are you cheating on your wife and everything so that whole overthinking it just cumbered me in that three years of how i need to solve the issue because i need people to know that our marriage is over but i also want my privacy so i can't seem to find the balance and in the end we did a very public video about it and it was like covered on what video on on online articles and everybody start giving their speculation about oh well what and i felt like helpless because i can't i can't do anything about it and before i release the video last year december i was in a very serious cyber phase actually attempt to kill myself three times on the eve of christmas day so that was uh really one of my darkest moments yeah i did watch your video and i loved how authentic it was and it takes so much strength to do that it's not easy i'm so proud of you please don't kill yourself i wouldn't love you here i'm better now i'm better now that's good that's good a lot better now and i would love to hear like what made you kind of stop yourself i don't know i feel like um the only way people are going to know how i feel is if i open up and if i don't know about people they will have all this kind of assumption and they're just adding to the problem in fact after the divorce video i actually felt that the public actually uh respected me a little more i was out eating one day and there was this very excited husband who wanted to take photos with me and the wife was like he already said he wants his privacy don't bother him so they actually just walk away and they just give me a lot so i kind of appreciated that yeah but what is your darkest moment i can't compare this but i feel like my darkest time was also my lightest time so there was a period of time where i was doing really really well my channel was doing well i was hitting so many goals my music was doing well that was always been my dream i'd gotten so many awards but i think you realize after all that like my whole life i was chasing achievement right because i was told that's what you needed to be happy that's what you needed to feel worthy but my darkest time was when i got all that i still didn't feel any different by the time i realized like all the achievements were not giving me the happiness that i wanted i also realized i didn't know what i wanted right yeah so that both hit me at the same time i was like what do i do yeah i don't even know where do we go from now where yeah exactly we already got all this okay but what's next and it's such a first world problem to have and it was really hard to talk to anyone because everyone thinks your life is perfect and everyone thinks everything is going well it makes it even harder to talk to anyone without sounding like arrogant or you know like you don't appreciate anything that you're getting so like that was really tough because i felt alone correct and i felt like i couldn't talk to anyone and it's not a problem a lot of people understand so if you see people very successful and things like that they have their own issues too and it's harder to even talk about them because i feel bad even talking about them i'm very grateful for everything that i've received but it's just it's just a tough thing to think about tell me the most difficult pill to swallow about coping with your mental health being public figures seeking help is really difficult because you might be kind of uh wary about what you say and how it might misconstrue or become gossips and rumors that this came from your mouth so i was very reluctant to even share with any uh anybody in my industry and even in my company my closest friends because all my friends and all my community is in the same industry then all the more i am not comfortable to share how i feel about a lot of things and cooping it up it was just uh like i had to do it so that that came to a breaking point that snapped me into a suicidal phrase so i think the toughest pill to solo is that i really can't talk about it i totally agree i think finding someone you trust is very hard really hard because you know your person is so tied to your work i think the most difficult pill for me to swallow about my mental health is that i'm responsible for it like no matter how many people i share with or who i talk to at the end of day is up to me to really really take those steps and help fix myself it's about taking responsibility i think that is the hardest thing because with everything else in life you just you just want someone to solve it yes you know you just might be like please fix it for me i pay you you fix this but this particular method you you can't so there's no easy way to go about it that's the most difficult pill to swallow what was the most helpful thing someone told you when you were struggling for me honestly it's just there wasn't anything specific but just people around me just saying look i believe in you you're great you're amazing like just reminding me right you know yeah just the support and like i'm here for you and just stuff like if you need me to come over and do something like i'm there just those little things like add up to so much right for me it was uh a friend told me to live in the moment and stop worrying about the future so i was constantly worried like oh are we gonna have enough videos next week or the views are going down or oh our income is not doing so well this year all covered in somebody and i'm just constantly worried about plans and future and everything so my friend told me that uh five years ago you wanted to be here where you are today and you are here so why are you still not happy and then i was thinking about it when she told me that you have to live in a moment like when happiness comes you don't have to be afraid that sadness is just around the corner just live in the moment own your happiness right then and there there was a point of time that i was guilty of being happy like if i'm happy at the moment i was like oh no sadness is just creeping around the corner i can't be too happy someone out there will punish me so i i had this very toxic mentality but yeah my friend kind of changed my perspective i totally understand it's like this anxiety that like this is not gonna last forever something's gonna happen but it's never meant to last forever yeah no it's life is never just happiness all the way or sadness all the way it's just ups and downs so when is up we have to only we have to live on it yeah we have to celebrate right so when the settlers come you know that there's something else to look forward to that's something i'm trying to work on more as well is celebrating your wins because i'm that type of person that like i remember when i get achievements like say for my music my song did really well on billboard and we got a placement and that's like probably a dream that i would have always had for music but like i was just like you know cool yeah and then i was like what do i have to work on next what's the next day you're always looking for the next thing and that's why it's it's texting it's really touching it's really taxing over time my mentality was very toxic yeah it's just like easy we deserve our celebration we deserve to be happy whenever a milestone is met and if we keep looking for the next thing it never ends then it does yeah it never ends oh what's the healthiest way you've learned to cope with stress from work oh this is a good happy it's a good ah it's finally lighter actually i found exercise a very good way back then at the lowest point of my life i read online somebody say that despite feeling like just try to go out there and do some exercise i guarantee you to feel better and i really thought that man that's not gonna work because i don't even feel like going out and then i tried and during that period i actually lost uh 17 kg and it's a healthy loss so from 87 uh 87 kg i dropped to 70 kg and it was true good diet eating clean exercise and my mood lifted up and i felt more energetic when i do things right i strongly recommend exercise though i kind of stop it i stop now i still try to maintain the clean eating yeah i think what you said was really true i think your physical health has so much to do with your mental health i think it's so connected that you can't really like disconnect them me too the healthiest way i've learned to cook from stress is well sent me not healthy eating i feel like when i eat i'm like very relaxed and i love to go to like comfort food right for de-stressing but i think the happiest time in my life was when i did a lot of exercise i used to dance a lot wow and that always lifted my mood up right this is the music it's the beat it's the dancing and you learn as well at the same time when you go to dance class so it's you're engaging every part of yourself so i think that's a really healthy way just find an active hobby that you love you know i think yeah this is a very important aspect and a lot of people underestimate this and actually prioritize everything else over his give us one tip for how we can cook with heavy mental stress get your sleep sleep get your eight hours or whatever you need talking to someone is good so sometimes i actually do this so i put up q and a's in my instagram and i talk to my fans when i start seeing like some of them really have tragic tragic story and they are much more helpless than me it doesn't necessarily make me feel better but it made me appreciate where i am a lot better so that i feel like honestly things are really not that bad i i was much worse like five years back 10 years back it was much worse so i start to appreciate little things i start to be very aware whatever i have and it kind of makes me feel like okay everything is worth it everything is good yeah so that's one way that's a good tip i think i need to do that a lot more thank you for reminding me we all need to be reminded please get like a gratitude buddy to really great things in your life and i also read um when i read my depression book one thing that they mentioned i thought was very interesting getting out there and helping someone right actually helping someone yeah to get over it helping someone actually feels good yeah to see that i kind of impact their life in small ways like this i feel like hey at least i'm doing something good yeah so that kind of made me feel like good yeah and it gets you out of your head yeah you know gets you out of your situation and you can think about someone else which is correct yeah really really helpful okay it seems like we are down to the last okay one choice now what is the one thing that reminds you of why you stay in this industry growing up i relied very much on content to inspire me and to motivate me to do things like whenever i'm down and i need a problem i'll go look for a quote or i'll go watch an uplifting video or or you know i feel like content has always been like my friend it's just a really easy way to either relate to an emotion or get something out of your chest because i always had trouble uh surprisingly or not expressing myself but i can easily express myself through content but if you met me in real life i'm very shy i don't really i don't know how to stay right i'm also shy so it's a little bit but i found like such a great space with content or writing or photography to really share my feelings and music as well and then hearing the other end of people going you know your videos expire inspire me or or uplifted me or like you know save me from a really hard time like that's what content did for me and that's why i love it right i'm making content doing that for them i feel like it's just like passing on something that i've been given you know and it's like a gift so i think that's what makes me keep wanting to be in this industry even if i i'm i'm sick of all the other issues of this industry and you know feel burnt out this thing will keep you going yeah give me like a three weeks and i'll like feel this urge to make content and share it with people again to hopefully inspire them to do something i think like with every other job there is no one perfect job that you would like or aspects of it the one thing that i really do like uh in this industry is the fact that i can create things right cinematography editing those is two of my biggest hobbies like i do that even when i'm bored and i have nothing to do i don't play games i actually read about films and uh study more techniques i think that's the most important thing because there's so many ups and downs in this industry you have to like love it as well like for me like when people ask me i want to be a youtuber give me some tips yeah and i'm just like do something you love do something that if three people watch it you'd still want to get up in the morning and do it because chances are probably three people will watch it at one point in time you know this is a mental health discussion so we are focusing highly on what isn't great because we don't get a lot of chance to share about the negative side there's so many chances to share about the positive side right but of course there's so many great things yes there is there is but i do feel like a lot of people are wanting to be an influencer being a content creator only sees the good side there's so many sites that you guys don't see don't feel and i'm afraid that a lot of people jump into this for the wrong reasons and they will end up very badly hurt they don't know how to cope and they just can't manage the expectation that it's not all about the glitch and glamour so i feel this is something very important to know what we have spoken today to kind of know that what you are coming into if you decide to be an influencer and content creator is really not all sugar and rainbows so if you guys want to be an influencer at one of things you can work on right now is how to deal with your stress and your mental health you need to be able to be best friends with yourself first yeah i think that's one important i used to hate myself until my ex-wife surprisingly is the one who tell me that you have to be best friends with yourself that the only opinion that matters is your own opinion about yourself and that really helped me a lot surprising for my ex-wife thank you for watching and thank you andrew for coming to our show oh thanks for having me guys and this video was created in collaboration with youtube singapore in order to provide resources for mental health for you guys in the description there's a ton of resources a number to call remember if you're having any trouble speak to someone speak to yourself it is the most important thing doesn't have to be anyone you know in real life it could be in the comments yeah like me i speak in like q and a with my family exactly it doesn't matter who you turn to but it's really good to share your troubles there's always someone out there to help we're here to help i hope what we share

XwiGK6w9rxE,Mental health during COVID-19: A chat with Filipino physician and cancer survivor Dr. Gia Sison,UCwWyROjE-mNtGYjNIqERE9Q,AsianScientist,2020-05-29T17:52:39Z,Months into the COVID-19 pandemic and the world could now be on the verge of another health crisis: a mental health crisis. As the death toll and infection rates ...,[Music] hi everyone my name is kami Navarro and I'm a science writer here at the Asian Scientist magazine welcome to today's wild-type media expert opinion webinar and a warm welcome to all of our friends over at Facebook live today I'm joined by dr. Jia CSUN she is the head of the Women's Wellness Center in the McAfee Medical Center in the Philippines she is also the national advisor of the Philippines youth from mental health coalition today she will be discussing kovat nineteen's emotional toll exploring some coping strategies along the way before we begin just a few house rules to ensure that we have a smooth flow firstly all attendees are unless and only mode if you have any questions please place them in the Q&A it can be found at the bottom of your screen alternatively you can also ask your questions live to dr. Jia yourself by raising your hand virtually during the live Q&A round again you should be able to see a raised hand option at the bottom of your screen last but not least just a gentle reminder that this webinar is being recorded and will be made available shortly after it ends now please allow me to introduce our guest today dr. Jia a CSUN is an occupational medical specialist who rose to national prominence in the early 2000s for a frank discussion on her mental health struggles as a breast cancer patient and now survivor as a result of her experience dr. Jia became a staunch mental health advocate and in 2018 she helped lobby for the passage of the Philippines Mental Health Act from one Filipino to another welcome dr. Jia it's our pleasure to have you here hi kami and thank you for inviting me to the Asian scientists there to go wildlife webinar series I'm so happy to be with you all right it's so nice to really have you here to start off dr. Jia I know that but Philippines has lifted some of its quarantine measures can I just quickly check up and ask how your how you are right now not so well but coping coping and arriving during these tough times absolutely so even though you're not feeling so well that's the precise reason why we need this webinar today right that's right I've yes agree before we dive deeper into our discussion I would like to know more about you guys in the audience today so I will be launching a poll asking for your background where are you from all right so what do we see here we have a lot of students we also have some lecturers here and also medical professionals and also significant amount of others so in the chat maybe you can tell us what these others are right so we can get to know more about you guys so before we dive deep into the discussion and I know that dr. Jia would like to just set the context of our mental health discussion here today so she has some slides that she'll be presenting so dr. Jia I'll be turning it over to you Thank You kami and allow me to talk about the mental health situation during the times of Corinne but let's set the tone that the first thing we need to understand is that mental health it's not just about psychiatric conditions they also include psychological neurological and substance abuse and also in terms of interpreting data we have to understand that there are real limitations as we speak so on the next slide this chart is actually from our world in data which reflects our variously the source from the global burden of disease study 2016 and it provides us a picture of the prevalence of mental health problems in a given population so on this slide it just shows that the highest rates are seen in Iran at seventeen point three percent of the population while the lowest is in Vietnam at nine nine point seventy two percent on the next slide we go closer on the Sen and based from this data most of the countries have a prevalence between ten to fourteen percent of the population but we have to take into consideration that population growth should be factored in into this study and in the next slide which shows the picture of the Philippine mental health situation based on the data from WH o year 2017 so the numbers are there we have 3.2 million estimate the present people diagnosed with depression 3 million with anxiety in terms of financing it's a two point 67% only of the budget allotted and to your right that's the actual mental health situation in the Philippines so on the next slide it actually shows that much still has yet to pass we have to be done in terms of mental health in the Philippine context and it has to align with the for transformation ships in the global mental health as published in the Landsat the point as the bullet points here so the nature of the mental health disorders and intervention is important it's it's it's better to adopt a holistic approach then there is the shift from institutional to community care based moving from a treatment focused to prevention and promotion of mental of mental well-being and a more liberal take on who the provider is and lastly I think one of the most important is harnessing power of service users this is where patients get empowered to talk about their illness and suggest ways in how do you think it can improve so take it away kami all right thanks so much for giving up contacts dr. Jia no less than the United Nations has warned us that hope at 19 could spark a global mental health crisis why do you think coop at 19 is speaking such a huge toll on our mental health okay so first of all a pandemic is a stressor in itself and it poses risk both short-term and long-term but as we speak we do not have deeper yet on the studies of the effect of coded with mental health but it's ongoing we also need to understand that mental health problems that we face are not actually new and the numbers are actually existing even before the pandemic has has happened and there's also this factor that those who have coped before may not be coping as effectively now with the multiple stressors that we are all experiencing and I'm not just talking about mental health as a state of anxiety there is also that financial aspect economic aspect so many people have lost their jobs and are living on a day-to-day basis so that in itself is something that we should we are worried about I see dr. Jia so beyond the just the quick question aside from any financial and economic stressors you were talking about could you are there any other stressors if you should be aware of yes there's that fear having the disease that's number one and for the frontline nurse there's this fear bringing the disease home to their families there's a large part of uncertainty in terms of livelihoods at their future Koby banking is a lonely disease so there is social isolation which may lead to deeper feelings of loneliness there is also an increased incidents of domestic abuse and violence because everyone is at home the perpetrators get the chance to to attack and so forth exposure or negative images on media is also there and it may lead to negative coping mechanisms such as increase in tobacco use drugs which we don't want to happen absolutely so thank you so much for laying all of those out very clearly so now that we know why or the reasons behind hope at xix startling effect on our mental health could you now explain to us the hole which groups tend to be most affected by the pandemic psychological impacts so first again there's no data yet comparing the psychological impacts of Kobe 19 to various groups but the following are people which we should be concerned about so number one are the fraud liners why because as a doctor myself we are faced with with patients who are fighting for their lives patients who are uncertain about their condition in fact in the People's Republic of China health care workers reported high rates of depression at 50% anxiety at 45 percent insomnia 34 percent and that's based on the study by lie at all 2020 as cited in the UN older adults are also prone to mental health conditions because of the isolation and comorbidities because there is also a factor of lab or in accessible medical services that are non coded related so take for example a patient who needs dialysis they cannot really just go to a center just to have a day just to get a dialysis like before so there is a process and that in itself is stressful then we have the under descends and young people who are again prone to domestic abuse and they are there's an impact on your future because academic school years have been moved social connections have been disturbed due to suspension of classes dreams may have been tossed polling board exams have been moved as well and also women because some women have to balance between work and household responsibilities as well so domestic violence in this context is real so these are the after 12 firmly these are the top four most of vulnerable during this pandemic I see it so for any of you guys in the audience we do fall under these high-risk groups according to dr. Jia I hope that this webinar will prove useful for you and if you have any insights of your own do take the time to share it with us in the chat and also the Q&A now for the rest of our viewers I want to check up on you guys as well how are you have squibbon 90 and impacted you psychologically or mentally in any way so this is gonna be just a short mental health check so have you been extremely affected have you been slightly affected are you one of those lucky few who hasn't been affected at all then please give us some insight this could be actually you know very insightful for dr. Jia so we see that a significant number of our audience is moderately affected we also see that they're slightly the next one is slightly affected but there are also some who are extremely affected so dr. Jia what do you think of these results we have to realize that negative feelings are expected between these types of a great major stressor like over 90 in the first place it helped us by surprise as far as I recall before the law down we were still doing normal things but after the March 15 things started to change and these abrupt changes may actually lead to short term and long term at mental health conditions that's why some reactions to psychological distress are really varied on the poll that you conducted some are moderately effective so this is something that is subjective but one thing is for sure negative feelings are really expected out of this like and it's okay to acknowledge them because they're real and we have to realize that we are all experiencing our own personal stressor in the time of Cobra absolutely so now that we all know that some of us have been emotionally affected by the pandemic I just wanted to ask you dr. diya for the benefit of everyone in the audience what are some clinical manifestations are psychological distress caused by covet 19 okay so let's start with the physical manifestations a lot have been reaching out because they have been their problems and in terms of sleep sleeping patterns have been affected eating patterns have been affected and we have this term called cabin fever where you are you feel that you are locked up inside a room where you don't you can't even describe how you feel so those are the common there are there's hyper hyper or extra sensitive here you get easily agitated feelings of isolations are there feeling anger anger is part of it because you don't even know what to expect the next day so these are very emotions that we are encountering every day of our lives I see so for everyone in the audience these are the signs that we should look out for just in ourselves but also in our loved ones and our friends and in our family on that note dr. Jia I know you mentioned earlier something about how frontline health care workers are some of the most on high-risk at getting at feeling these psychological distress from Canadian so we have seen recent reports that across Asia frontline health care workers and Cugat 19 patients have been facing social stigma so how can this pigma be managed and address okay there was a the American Psychological Association listed out a number of tips that can actually help in addressing the stigma number one you have to educate the people with facts it's really hard evidence-based facts about Kobe 19 because at the end of the day tracks minimize fear and it also gives people a sense of confidence code and code so if you if you hear some of the myths groomers please speak up and corrective accordingly also now's the time to engage social influencers who can be powerful voices in being in combating stigma and engaging people in preventing discrimination in fact some cities in the Philippines already have adopted local ordinances to prevent discrimination in fact there's a hotline that one can call if he or she feels that he or she has been discriminated and I have heard a lot of stories about front liners being kicked out of their places because of fear of having the tenants get the infection and after me is unacceptable I completely agree so dr. Jia we know that it's not just the Cova 19 patients and the frontline health care workers who are feeling psychological distress right so we're all being acted by this pandemic in different ways so for companies in particular there's been exciting shift to remote work so I myself I've been working from home for the past two months now it's my first time to be here in this office for two months okay so I'm very thrilled to be where I am right now but the thing is remote working is likely here to stay so for employers what are some concrete steps that they can take to ensure that the mental well-being of their employees will be fine in this new normal that we're all facing okay from an occupational medicine standpoint since that's my specialty it's very important for employers to communicate clearly to their employees what path the company is taking because the least that the employees need is uncertainty because we're already being we're already facing something that is uncertain and it's another thing for our employees to be even uncertain about where they are how they're going to earn is it gonna go on so clarity by dialogue whether employees is very important number two it's also important to assure or assure the employees that they are safe there that there are alternatives that they can take aside from physically reporting or at work which is why remote working is still advised even during the general community quarantine even if it's lifted it's their advice and of course you have to also assure that the promote promote a network of support in terms of mental health that is also one help and of course the basic needs like if the employee needs transportation to work it will be a big help if the employer provides where those needs because those are the basic needs that that must be met all right I see so to all of the employers in the audience right now I do hope that you would cook note of everything that dr. Jia said so please be please communicate please engage and dialogue with your employees assure them that they are safe give them alternatives and make sure that their basic needs are met did I miss anything dr. Jia reflect kami and all right yeah and just to add I know it's quite costly but in the in the peering of occupational health safety standards engineering controls is also important so this is where structural changes can be applied so again it's really all about restructuring the workforce and the workplace at the same time through constant communication and engagement of the employees and employers all right so again thanks so all of them Flyers and audience please I hope you're taking notes now moving on to a much larger scale you were a prominent lobbyist for the passage of the Philippines mental health law what do you think governments can do to tackle the impending mental health crisis that could be caused by cope in nineteen for one it will be very helpful to integrate mental health interventions in the pandemic response with specific services to address the needs of people in various stages in the mental health illness spectrum and those populations at risk which I have mentioned earlier number two work with civil society organizations and it has to complement the government programs also for mental health number three make sure that social welfare services are also given efficiently so that the basic needs are met and number four make sure that government is also transparent and it pays to be able to adopt an empathic and clear communication workflow or process flow to be able to decrease at least public anxiety and it's also quite we can also note that you may want to shift the narrative from reporting deaths to the comedies because we are holding on to those little glimmers of Hope stories that we listen to of course it's okay to to report the past is but for me hyping on the hope and the recovery part is very very important in easing that already existing public anxiety because of kovetz absolutely i I really agree with that last point you know at this point I've actually starts looking at the number of cases because it just gives me you know it just gives me like an anxiety attack so I agree that there has to be that shift through maybe reporting some more hopeful news hopeful but accurate news of course right so any government officials or employees and the audience again take know it now before we open up the floor to the Q&A and I can see that there's a lot of very interesting questions that we can get through it I have one last question and this is for the benefit of our audience and also maybe asking for myself what are some ways that we can look after our own mental health during this time so dr. Jia I know you went through some experiences during your time as a breast cancer patient so maybe you have some insights and strategies I could prove useful for the rest of us I remember my journey before to see this similar to this because I I had to undergo quarantine during chemotherapy since being exposed to the public can compromise my immunity so one tip that I can give this maintain your social connections we are advocating for a physical distancing not social distancing so maintain those social connections with loved ones with friends with family also it pays to practice to actu in terms of feelings to express to listen and to reassure I know it sounds so hero but it would really help a lot in terms of easing anxiety take care of yourself also in terms of physical health it's it was very underrated it's quite an irony that we have we have taken for granted hand hygiene for so long but what is the number one practice that we should do now to prevent colon it's hand washing so my point is don't forget also take physically care of yourself which means physical activity the right amount of sleep right amount of the deshaun building up an immunity matters and of course limit exposing overexposure to media that distresses you so we have to learn your limits in terms of where you get your news just ensure that you get it from valid sources so a typical practice is you may want to just choose one agency that you listen to in the morning then get on with your day and end with with something that will update you on what's happening as well so those are some ways that one can look one can take on these are just tips of course I acknowledge that all of us are different we have different ways of coping and we bury in a lot of please absolutely you thank you so much for giving those different it's dr. Jia I think they're widely a bit applicable for the most part but yeah so everyone please take notes and now we have time for the Q&A so we have a lot of pretty interesting questions there's this one by mr. Donavan foo that I find very interesting so mr. Donavan foo if you're there I would like to give you speaking privileges just so you can ask dr. Jia yourself your very interesting question all right can you please give your affiliation and ask your question briefly thank you hi my name is Donovan I'm actually in the marketing sector so thank goodness what has a stopped but at the same time it's really stressful and it's very different kind of working from home so my question really is how can we as individuals or maybe as communities convince organizations and governments to take mental health seriously because it seems like Philippines isn't the only one country right that's kind of underfunded when it comes to middle mental health and at the same time you know raise awareness about importance of mental health from the time that I have lobbied up thank you thank you for the question uh just my take for this well from the time we were lobbying for the mental health app to become the mental health law a big factor on that is to be able to speak up on your needs so I have to see that there's there has been an improvement in terms of that knowledge meant of mental health as as a need but there is also a need for workers to speak on on on what they want this is where dialogue comes in in terms of the workplace so if we need something it's nice that you are able to dialogue with your with your employer and start from within hoping that that will have a ripple effect outside and that that will lead to a program to address mental health wellness all right so thanks for answering that question dr. Jia we have another question I think it's related so if you have anything to add I guess it's from Jillian Kia and she's asking how do we encourage constructive and meaningful conversations surrounding mental health in today's society um okay that I would want to relate that to the stigma that is always with mental health there are a lot a lot of cases have well actually stigma can be best addressed when we openly speak about mental health I think it's about time that we start talking about mental health like in open doors it's not something that we keep so the more we talk about it the more the stigma is busted the more myths are addressed the more it is again the more to be of help to do the question so are you talking about it for me is it's a big factor in being address addressing the stigma if you share this dr. Jia how you talk about that like what outlets do you use to raise more awareness about mental health I use my social media platforms being able to tell my story so uh narratives are very important this is what I was mentioning earlier that patient voices mattered talking about my experience if and when you're ready I'm not saying that it's mandatory that you share but it highly helps in being able to talk about how you felt the journey that you underwear and of course you know that are realistic hope at the end of it so that was that that's how I I always tell my story I see yes just sharing so that's how I know dr. Jia I was able to hear her story lies before and one of the conference we were previously at and I can really attached to the power of narrative and these in shaping these stories about mental health so there's another question that I find very interesting it's from a young Pineda and Mei Yin I would like to give you audio privileges so you can ask it yourself okay I can hear me yep hi um so doctor yeah my question is more of you mentioned earlier that financial issues are a huge problem especially in the Philippine context as a stressor toward someone's mental health are there programs now to make mental health care more accessible to people who could otherwise not afford it especially during this quarantine okay during this quarantine there are a lot of platforms that you can already access in terms of tele telehealth services so this would include online counseling for free so they have a our National Center for mental health has open several lines just for you to be able to reach out and it's also where the convention that some organizations have taken the effort in are taking care of the logistics part you know for those user for those patients in need of medication and because there's a service disruption so particularly fill health is now studying packages that can address mental health as well so hotlines can help because they are actually support system so you can call it anytime 24/7 million I hope I answered your question all right so there's another interesting question actually here and it's from Essos or Jesus Peralta sorry if I pronounce your name wrong but he says that he's an oh Sh practitioner in a multinational company so would like to ask what would you advise us to do to address the stress and fears of other workers when one of their employees is diagnosed positive with kovat 90 and so I think that's a very real situation that a lot of companies maybe are facing so what can you say about that dr. Jia okay so he's a fellow occupational medicine now practitioner like me so we are formed actually our workplace algorithm of how to practice work and safety during Cova 90 so it helps if you have a communication plan in the workplace where the worker can actually seek help both medically and mentally because again I'd like to emphasize that Kobe isn't just about the physical aspect it has a mental health aspect as well assure you the employees that the company will will be able to support his or her basic needs is very very important and also it's not it's worthy to mention that companies might want to take on the idea of being able to train their HR practitioners with mental health first aid so it just in case you don't have to be a doctor to undergo that training because it can help it can help at least address basic issues or the issues that employees feel like the anxiety that that hasis has mentioned if I hope I come you know dr. Jia I actually didn't know there was such a thing as a mental health first aid so thank you for introducing that concept I learned something new today so we have another really interesting question and it's from jello dianora so jello if you're there I'd like to give you the opportunity to ask the question through dr. Jia yourself so please introduce yourself give your affiliation and then you can ask a question hi can you guys hear me yep all right hi dr. Jia hi kami I'm Sheldon aura I am a PR manager and also a writer for different publications I'm actually writing right now a piece on mental health and wellness in the workplace and the discussion has been fruitful but there's also one point I wanted to ask about intergenerational differences and perspectives on mental health especially right now when tensions are high and people might understand mental health quite differently when we're looking at it from different age perspectives and companies sometimes have that structure you have young talent being nurtured by the wisdom of their veterans how do we facilitate that proper conversation and that seamless conversations about mental health with those kind of teams in the workplace so you're talking about moriata it's a it's a cultural issue if I'm not mistaken Jeremy yes okay so we have backpacks of area well it's very valid that we are there is an intergenerational gap when it comes to the understanding of mental health but on the other hand it shouldn't stop us from being able to be able to speak up or you might want to start a mental health session to align them on on the definition of mental health again our mental health isn't all about when you talk about mental health you also have to practice it so with that VOCA see of being able to talk about it in small groups and making them understand and and acting on it I think that's a very important move to be able to make another culture so to speak understand that mental health wellness is really a need that we need to address all right so there's speaking of culture there's this other question in the Q & A which is I guess related so it's from Patricia sim and I think just touching maybe moving on from her question is there any difference in how we approach mental health from the Asian perspective as opposed to you know those in the Western world how can we you know have a uniquely let's say Asian approach to dealing with mental health all out from Kovac nygean um that's a very difficult question but it's I believe it's not really it's morally speaking up and being open about it I think in the Philippines stigma is still there but I guess it's either a worldwide problem that we need to address altogether and aligned as a whole so well on my experience they're more open in the Western world but we're beginning to open up in terms of in the in the Asian countries as well okay that's that's great yeah I do see a lot of the in Twitter especially I do you see that there's been a lot of conversation now on mental health yeah so there's this other question and it's from a student so you know a lot of students have had their studies disrupted I mean my my friends in med school for example like you said they've had their board exams postponed or otherwise disrupted so how can universities strike the balance between supporting the mental health of their students well also I guess ensuring quality education were you able will you be able to give some perspectives on that okay from from a mom's perspective from a mother's perspective I think the schools have to begin exploring how alternative ways of being able to deliver education it can it's it may be different from the physical I mean physical teaching but again I live by the mantra of making do with what you have so schools have to open up and I think it's make it more accommodating also for your students because let's face it not all students have access good access to Internet so that's that's that's one so they have to factor in that consideration also in terms of being able to blend online learning and offline so to speak learning so start from there and be flexible with deadlines as well because we're working under extremely hard times so it will be highly helpful if you know you can flex the grading system accommodations etc so that's my take and that that's how I how I see it in our it's a proactive move but it's much needed mmm I think I am beginning to see some of those approaches not just in the Philippines but also in universities worldwide now I guess just one last question and it's from an ELISA Kia so how can I think and it is related to your previous answers from before for the front liners especially what can we do to protect them dr. Jia from the mental health onslaught that many of them and the stigma that many of them are facing be part of the solution of being able to pass the myths that front liners are the well everyone can be a carrier that's for one follow the guidelines the strict health guidelines because staying at home can help support groups matter also so if there are listeners who are keen on being able to give frontline your support we needed in terms of a support group that really addresses our our our needs and of course this is where family comes in proactively also involve yourself in these types of conversations so and I'm not talking about this front liners as doctors nurses I'm mostly talking about the others the other frontline years were up there serving despite the pandemic so basic needs should also be met so again it's not always about how they feel it's also a balance of what they need as well so find that balance in between and that that can be a starting point for frontline report all right so dr. Jia I just wanted to give you maybe we have it one last but they call to action since mental health really is something you're passionate about right we have anything any last words famous last words to share with us today so number one call be thanking is not a death sentence social distancing doesn't mean physical physical distancing doesn't mean social distancing they keep those tiles connected and at the same time be an advocate of practices that would promote prevention and support in this in this tough times called Colgate 90 so thank you for that dr. Jia and I can see that we have many more questions but unfortunately we don't have all the time in the world to answer them thank you all for your very active participation we have an exciting lineup of speakers waiting ahead so next week June 3 that's a Wednesday we have none other than Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales you heard me Wikipedia founder I'm sure for all the students in the audience and I guess everyone we've all used Wikipedia in one way or another so he will be joining our CEO dr. Giuliana Chang for a conversation on fighting fake news drink Ovid isn't that a very relevant webinar so there should be a link in the chat right now though as registration page for full listing of our upcoming webinars do check out Asian scientists comm slash events again that's Asian scientists calm slash events finally I'd like to take this time to thank you dr. Jia once again for answering our questions today mental health is often an overlooked topic but I think for 45 minutes you were able to push it to the forefront Thank You kami and thank you to the Asian scientists team and to all our viewers and listeners thank you so much so with that good night from Singapore I hope you all apply the mental health tips and tricks that dr. Jia has shared I hope you all learned a lot in the first place please wash your hands please wear a mask please stay safe stay healthy and thank you for joining me today signing off ,True,False,True,False

FlIsB1Kwd1g,‘The Most Anxious I&#39;ve Ever Been’: Students Struggle With Mental Health Amid Pandemic | NBC News NOW,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg,NBC News,2020-09-03T01:15:13Z,NBC News speaks to college students who are struggling to deal with the mental health impact of the coronavirus pandemic. » Subscribe to NBC News: ...,the coronavirus pandemic is forcing college students to adapt to a new normal and while these changes may help keep them safe it could also impact their mental health the nbc news social news gathering team spoke with some mental health professionals and college students coping with these new challenges the pandemic has really like made my mental health a lot worse um i've like this is the most anxious i've ever been i think in my entire life just with everything kind of like school and then managing my time trying to like get things done while i'm also like freaking out about how bad the pandemic is we also have some data that's come out more recently that's suggesting that there's been a particular impact on college students that they're seeing higher levels of depression they're having financial insecurity which is also leading to mental health problems and this is concerning because before the pandemic we knew that college students were increasingly having mental health concerns so now you add the pandemic and we have a population medicine particularly in greater need for mental health services i would say for me before um the whole pandemic you know started i was very i was going through a really tough time personally and you know kind of falling into the whole pandemic i just kind of said you know like i'm done like i give up like why is this happening a lot of just like the stress from my family falls on me because i am basically like the oldest and i i speak the language and my parents help me out with my tuition and so i feel like i i owe them a lot and then they feel like i need to help them a lot many of our students have backgrounds that are fraught with frustrations and challenges and so forth my parents are very staunchly republicans i'm bisexual bipolar i'm also very progressive i had a sociology anthropology minor obviously those are going to come up with some progressive topics and i had to very strategically like buy what i was doing i have to hide the books that i read again it's not nearly as bad as not having food or being abused but it is a stressor our data showed that more than half of students didn't know where to go for mental health services in the onset of the pandemic and 20 of students were experiencing significant negative impacts to their mental health during that time so that's definitely something that's very concerning to us through like the student health services they have counselors that we can like talk to online it was nice to be able to get like to talk to someone about the things that were going on but because i was at home even if i was like home alone it was kind of hard to be like as vulnerable as i was in their office just because there was a different feeling there i think about this group of college students not coming back to college because they're not coming back to anything they're coming into something very new and i like to think of it as them being kind of like unintended or unexpected explorers so i have a lot of hope in this generation and i'm even though i'm concerned about them i'm also excited to see what they do with this moment that's all their own and unlike any that any of us have ever experienced [Music] the cdc is moving to ban evictions nationwide through the end of the year saying increased homelessness would be a national health hazard that could make the coronavirus crisis worse dr bob lahita joins me now dr lahita is the chairman of the department of medicine at st joseph's university hospital in new jersey dr lahita we've seen over the course of this pandemic that poverty puts people at risk for coronavirus what impact could this eviction freeze have on the current situation what's it going to mean if people are kicked out of their homes well if people are kicked out of their homes it could be a problem because homelessness is a major issue in the country in certain cities it's epidemic if you will and the pandemic runs through uh communities where there's a lot of homeless lying on the streets of course it's very difficult for homeless people to keep uh safe distancing and also to wear a mask and and do the things the rest of us do such as wash their hands so this this eviction uh prevention if i read it correctly is is a good thing to keep people safe and at least able to self quarantine and protect themselves from further infection it's a very good thing that i i think i see let's talk vaccines dr fauci said again today we could have a vaccine by the end of the year but a lot of americans are skeptical about the safety of vaccines what are you looking for to know if a coronavirus vaccine is safe to take and also knowing that a lot of us are hearing that there could be this sort of like emergency use thing that happens from the from the fda as it's in these the last stages of trials but before it's really gone through the whole thing or been published in this peer-reviewed journal what does this mean is it safe yes um this has created quite a commotion um first of all let me say savannah that 40 of americans don't want to be vaccinated and that's one thing that's a big problem second thing is that the vaccine once approved via phase three may require two injections that's like a month apart and that's another big issue because you know people aren't going to really like the first shot and if they get a few aches and pains like some people get with the flu vaccine they're certainly not going to line up for the second vaccine so the second shot is to boost the immune system and make sure you have anti-covet antibodies now i can say generally that the vaccines that i've seen developed are superb they're in phase 3 and phase 3 means at least 30 000 people here in the united states to be tested against placebo so placebo means sugar water uh so antibody uh injection or genetic injection depending on which vaccine you use versus sugar water to see the efficacy or the ability of the vaccine to work now around the world there are approximately 50 million people uh 50 000 people will be in phase 3 and then later hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine will be available i think that the the cdc or the fda right now with its emergency use authorization is saying that perhaps people who are at greatest risk such as our elderly with a lot of comorbidities such as people in the health care industry such as doctors nurses and people working in hospitals conductors on trains bus drivers emts paramedics all of those may get this emergency use vaccine meaning it would be given before the phase three efficacy trials are finished savannah all right and dr lahita now let's talk about some of the things that we all miss doing going to restaurants going to gyms and if you think they're safe in your home state of new jersey and the county that i'm in in california indoor dining is partially reopening this week and your view is it's safe to go out to eat right now maybe do you think it's safe specifically inside versus outside what do diners need to know i think diners need to know that if they're in an area where there isn't a spike of infections it's okay to eat inside if you wear a mask when you go to sit down if your waiter or waitress is wearing a mask the mate or d wearing a mask and you keep your distance from the other table and i have been dining outside with my wife and we've noted that tables have been at least six feet apart i don't wear a mask outside neither does she and we're very comfortable and so far knock on wood it's been fairly good we've been fairly safe indoor dining we presume will be the same thing good ventilation good air conditioning is extremely important you don't want to be in a stuffy hot room with a table that's two foot away from you with a crowd of people that are yelling or singing or trading beers or drinks etc that's a prescription for disaster and that's what young people tend to do and that's why we have such a surge of infections between the 20 and 40 year olds right now in the southern part of the country savannah dr lahita thank you so much for your tips on that makes me smile to hear that you and your wife are doing a little bit of that thank you so much and stay safe thank you you too the coronavirus outbreak at the university of alabama is exploding over 1200 cases reported since the semester started nbc news correspondent ellison barber joins me now from tuscaloosa alabama ellison you hear that i know classes have not been going on for very long just a couple weeks or over 1200 cases does not sound good tell us more about this outbreak yeah i mean it's 1200 cases among students at the university of alabama and the crazy thing is that 87 of those cases came in a span of just eight days now school officials they will say when you look at the total number of the student body population here this is a huge school they have over 30 000 uh students here that it's a relatively small percentage but then you look at the rate of how quickly uh these numbers have come i talked to one professor just yesterday who said theoretically at the rate they're going right now you could have a situation if things don't change where almost the entire student body has been in impacted or infected by covet 19 once the fall semester comes around a big concern for a lot of people right now is they're worried you know thankfully no students have had to be hospitalized because of this but they're worried that other people in the community here in tuscaloosa alabama could be impacted by this outbreak especially if the numbers keep going in the direction they're headed right now savannah and ellison how are the students feeling about this how are they reacting are they scared do they feel okay i mean it's obviously good to hear that none of the students have been hospitalized but i mean there's still an outbreak going on on campus what are they telling you i mean it's interesting there's a big mix of reactions here almost everybody will say that they're concerned by the numbers but some people say uh you know they really shouldn't be here on campus they either say the school should have waited a little longer to bring students back or they think that the numbers show that it hasn't worked and that it's time for people to go home some also say other students need to be doing more when they're outside of the classrooms to protect each other some say they are thrilled to be back and they say they see the safety protocols that the school is doing here they've seen the plexiglass in classrooms they see students wearing masks when they're inside and they say they feel pretty safe here and they want to stay here's a little bit more of what we've heard from students as we tried to stop them walking through the campus i think that the university had a well thought out plan and they're still working on it every day with the situational response team as well as the task force that president bell has they look at numbers every day and make sure that it's safe for students to stay on campus i just feel like they're not being very transparent with the thought process behind the scenes they're thinking about you know collecting the tuition making sure all the the dorms are you know paid for and everything bringing us back on campus is like begging for kovich to like come hang out kind of a kind of a big question for students regardless of which side they fall in in the discussion here whether they're they feel like the school is doing a good job or if they feel like it's time to go home no one really knows what will happen next and that's sort of what everyone is kind of waiting to see there's been no indication from the university if there's like a certain number where they would say okay it's time for us to change course for now they say they feel like they're flattening the curve some and moving in the right direction but when you look at those numbers savannah it's hard to see where that's happening so far i like the way that last student put it inviting covid to just come hang out i mean it is kind of crazy thinking about them all being there on campus together the other that's also then impacting the staff faculty what do employees think there it's not just the students on a university campus yeah so we have talked to a lot of faculty members and also staffers teachers teaching assistants and what we're hearing from a lot of them is that they feel like they are being silenced or intimidated into silence by the university when they're trying to speak out about some concerns they have one a teacher that we talked to she said that she and some others had gone to their supervisors to express concern about holding in person classes saying that they felt like it should move more so towards zoom they told me that that supervisor then in their words passive aggressively forwarded an email to all of the other teachers from a parent of an out-of-state student saying my child didn't fly across the country to do classes with zoom other students or other teachers excuse me they've sent us anonymously a number of internal emails they say they have been threatened and warned by deans at this school to not talk about the number of covet cases in their classes even in general non-descript terms and they've been really frustrated about that one teacher that we spoke to he said he was speaking out to us because he felt like he had tenure he was in a position to speak out and not be retaliated against where other teachers teaching assistants feel like they can't do that he said that this plan while it may have been well intentioned to begin with has not worked and he believes it's time for the school to close listen here and i feel like we've been very very transparent in terms of being open and responsive to questions that have come forward and we hope that people will continue to utilize those those avenues to talk to us directly so that we can be responsive and help them to um you know unders better understand our circumstances as we see things from a big picture perspective i think the biggest concern that i have is that once it started breaking down there's a refusal by administrators to admit that it's not working i don't think the university right now is looking out for for the community's best welfare the students best welfare right now it's about keeping it open no matter what so that first person you heard the first person you heard from there is a vice president here at the school and he was responding to questions about those teachers saying that they felt like they were intimidated and not able to speak out uh and criticize some of what's happening here on campus the second person you heard from that is the tenured professor he also told me interestingly he told us that he didn't feel like the school should just close and send everyone home that wouldn't be safe he said what they should do is they should do a staggered departure and then keep students on campus who have been confirmed to have covet 19 or have been in close contact with someone else who has it and keep them here in isolation until they no longer have it and are safe to travel at the university's expense for now though savannah it seems like the university has no plans to kind of change a course or or cancel classes or send uh any students home savannah all right ellison just the ongoing back and forth of what to do about schools thank you so much you bet hey nbc news fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel

Brazil India's overtaking Russia and likewise most of the deaths a US and Brazil at this stage this is the global EPI curve you can see the major contribution in in orange which is the the Americas so that includes the US and Brazil driving most of that the green one the Southeast Asian region contains India and and the one you can hardly see down the bottom as the brown one which is the western Pacific area which is which is where we are and you can see there that what we've got is around 200,000 cases a day now so that gets you up to you 1.3 1.4 million a week deaths are around 5,000 per day so here's just the the five day moving average of the three main countries and you can see as I've shown in previous weeks that the US have done this extraordinary turnaround with 30,000 cases a day coming down to 20,000 and now up to 50,000 and some of these days are actually 60,000 Brazil may be plateauing off in in terms of its cases I'm not sure I'd think schools probably still out on that one but in India as is fairly fairly relentless this is the epic curves by region and particularly you can see Africa is having about 15,000 cases a day with a relatively low death rate the America is still going up with with with their death rate there or two or three thousand per day eastern Mediterranean seems to have flattened off Europe is a story of many different countries obviously and and and this is being maintained now really by by Eastern Europe if you like and as Western Europe as has come down so this is being maintained by by by other countries Southeast Asia this was the Indian catch up in in death reporting this was the China catch up on death reporting so in in the western Pacific region we're running at very very few deaths and in cases in the sort of two thousand three thousand I'm not going to go through every country this week I'm just trying to make it a slightly shorter session in just for the for the scheduling reasons the the big talk of the town is is Australia of course they've been coming out of lockdown for for for a couple of months now never really quite quite got fully back to normal before this this spike and this is this is all happening in Melbourne so Australia's had about 9,000 cases altogether there's there's 106 deaths there's about 160 to 190 cases a day in Victoria and and this is what's prompted prompted a re lockdown but it's a fairly focused one in Melbourne with particular attention to some tower blocks of largely migrant underprivileged people so it's a it's quite similar to a to a dormitory situation I think obviously there's some particular nuances this seems to have started when there was a security guard who was working in one of the quarantine hotels became infected and they or the whole the whole Melbourne cluster seems related to that so it really just takes one infection-control breach and and Milburn's back in lockdown so it's it's quite different across the states and they've even for the first time in 100 years shut the border with New South Wales Philippines is is the other story it's it's at around 42,000 cases with with 1300 deaths this is probably not so real this this coming up they had a testing backlog so they had a lot of samples for for some months and and and they caught up once with that improving testing capacity so I don't think that's a surge in cases most of their cases about half of them are in metropolitan Manila there's a spike in spike in cases and deaths in Cebu City and and hospitals describing being being overwhelmed there's some slum areas I think in in Cebu City and and they're they're really having trouble getting contact tracing and all the conventional outbreak responses happening they're testing positivity rates five point seven so that could be a bit better as well Japan this little spike here is is is now up to 200 cases on some days and and that's that's related to some nightclub outbreaks in in in Tokyo career just doing this nice little rumble along which I've I'm a big fan of I think this is this is your perfect Debbie curve the Korean one so India 675 thousand cases and almost twenty thousand deaths in in total testing positivity rate of 8% so so that this really is just just fairly relentless as I've said before it's it's fairly heterogeneous some some places not so badly affected but but others have got I've got major problems there's a shutdown in in an area of Kerala and as well as that Mumbai was having problems so so but but actually it's not all bad news I this this came I came across this with this place it's called the Dharavi slum and and this whole effort became the the Dharavi mission mission Doral via was called so this is an area and and hello and I know we've got a lot of people from India that the tune in to us so so hello to all of you and I hope I've got this story right but there's about there's about a million people that live in this area which is two square miles and they've had all together you can see this newspaper on June 30th said they had two thousand two hundred and sixty-eight cases in in April they had four hundred and ninety in in May they had about twelve hundred so so June was another thousand but but obviously it's peaked in in in early June and look at these cases in in July so so it's absolutely stunning that they could they could control this outbreak in this setting and and they did it with good old-fashioned outbreak response they took over schools and halls and sports facilities and and develop quarantine areas they were doing about they did about twelve thousand tests in total and with a mobile testing unit so so a good story I mean I guess this is still still dry kindling so it's it it could take off again but nonetheless it's a it's a good story the other area I thought I might just have a look at because we've never really spoken about this is his parts of of Eastern Europe and and and this came came across Greece is is doing remarkably well right three and a half thousand cases a hundred ninety two deaths but you can see that they're rumbling along and about maybe 20 cases a day now and many of those are actually from from Serbia so you can see Greece here Serbia not far away and there's there's been there's problems here you can see this it's got a beautiful second wave shape to it as soon as they unlocked all the the the efforts they had in in May this resurgence came back and apparently this is a media reports are of a poor case and that will under reporting of cases and deaths so so Greece's shut the borders to two to keep out these areas you can see the other areas with North Macedonia and Romania Bulgaria or all the curves are really going the wrong way so but interestingly with Serbia it was one of the ones that is allowed to go to the EU you'll remember they've the EU has declared 15 countries that can go there and UK has also declared countries that are allowed in without the 14 days quarantine and Serbia is one of those so so I think this is something to watch the Serbian testing positivity rates about five just over five percent so and as I said I'm not going to go through all the countries this week I'm just going to be a bit more mindful of time but just to to make the point that we're seeing a lot more focused lock downs now Lester lockdown on June 30 so you can see there there's London those Birmingham so Lester's Lester's here so it's right in the middle of the of the country and and they got to not a lot of thing it was around 500 cases of we're having so so anyway this this got locked down and you can see where we're back to those familiar beer streets what else there's also one in Spain this and if there's anyone that wants to criticize my pronunciation go for it the the Syria region of Li a de lis either and so that's that's over here and this area this is La Marina in in Galicia which is a beach resort so they're both been locked down so you get increasing cases clearly people are looking to have a much smarter shutdown it'll be a better shutdown shouldn't really be in the playbook but unfortunately once you get overwhelmed or you're heading towards overwhelmed hospitals overwhelmed public health systems you can't do the contact tracing anymore you testing capacity is is used up then you then you really got no choice so that's and probably earlier is better if you if you're seeing the trend this is a focus lockdown as I say in Melbourne these are the the blocks and there's though there were about 3,000 people across these blocks that will lock down now they've they've done a lot of testing some of them are are really quite negative so they've unlocked them and just put them on the melbourne lockdown and they've got different scales of lockdown so nonetheless that's what's happening in melbourne and for those of you don't know it's right down the the the southeastern corner of australia and you can see the live lockdown i heard someone on the it's actually all the all the problems are around here much more inner city but i'm not sure how they arrived at where the borderline would be but i know this this people are the people on this side of the water and not as happy as the people on this side of the water who are not on lockdown and of course india and don't even ask me to pronounce that but anyway it's in it's in kerala they've called this a triple lockdown and triple lockdown really it's it's interesting because there's been some other Indian towns sort of lockdowns and and they call it this triple one so so level one is sort of general containment it just stops movement of of all people in the area so you can see the area here and so there are there are checkpoints and there's there's closed roads as there might be an area where there's only one Road in and one Road out and there's barricades and police on on the other roads so so they're really trying to stop total movement then there's the movement of the specific within a specific geographical area and those areas might have had cases they might have contacts there this sort of quarantine zones so there's an extra special sort of lockdown for those areas and then lockdown three is is really at that household level where there might be contacts and there's extra special attention paid to to those so it's it's an interesting concept I certainly don't have any problems with it it's it's I guess a smart lockdown so back over to Singapore now here's out the three curbs I show every week imported cases remain negligible community cases well there's a little blip but we we would have expected that you can see it's still around twenty a day and the dormitory residents are slowly making their way down linked versus unlinked so you can see there's these are the linked cases and these are the the unlinked cases Green being being being gnf work permits so so the yellow ones are the Singaporeans and permanent residents so but the main point is there's been a little blip up I think it's a blip we can definitely tolerate but but where it takes where where it goes is is is the question and we'll have more answers to that over the next weeks and months and the final slide again this is where we sit in Singapore at the moment there's there's one one lost my mouth you know there's there's one case in ICU there's 214 in general Ward's across the country so that's that's been fairly flat in in care facilities or all the isolation facilities that have been built are starting to become underutilized I think we got to 20,000 beds to bed capacity so so that's coming down and the total of total number of deaths we haven't had a death for a little while now so thanks David back to you great deal thanks very much I want to remind you to send you questions in the country where you're watching via the Q&A tool at the bottom of your zoom screen again and it's my honor to have the opportunity to introduce our guest expert tonight dr. Cornelia Qi she is head and senior consultant Department of psychological medicine National University Hospitals senior consultant and director women's emotional health service and head in clinical senior lecturer department of psychological medicine young rule in School of Medicine National University of Singapore the title of our talk this evening is mental health issues surrounding COBIT 19 over to you Cornelia alright hello everybody everybody thank you so much for tuning in today I practice psychiatry at the National University Hospital for the last 20 years so I was here when SAS h1n1 and MERS hits Singapore I remember was a really dark time because as you know many of those who are affected with healthcare workers and you actually had some some of our best and our brightest passed away due to stylist morale was really low and I think our mental health was really affected we learned a lot from that and the other virus outbreaks over the years but it's clear that they haven't completely prepared us for this virus well we've learned a lot about its physical effects on the human body we are only just beginning to see how it affects the mental health of us as individuals and as species but there's so much to mental health during this pandemic that can I can only skim the surface so I decided to divide my talk into four different sections for the direct effects of Kovach 19 our population response to disasters what we can do as a population and personal mental health strategies okay so of course there are direct effects from health anxiety for 1:7 for others and when we it was becoming clear that that this virus was spreading among the population we were asked to reduce the number of cases so that we would have fewer patients coming to the the hospital and we need enough have really worried about that because we had a lot of psychiatric patients who who were deathly scared of coming to the hospital also the if you recall there a lot of fear of unknown aspects of how the virus spread and what its characteristics were and I think I was a lot more of that at the beginning although even now I think that it's still controversial whether or not the virus might be spread by an airborne root so there's still quite a lot of things that we are still learning then we had the effect from the lockdown or circuit breaker measures that they were called in Singapore and indirectly and this is one one of the things that's going to be having great impact on us is the financial and economic implications of unemployment difficulty with with one's business or maintaining one's home okay and then in what happened in Singapore is that Singapore school shifted to full home-based learning for two months well yes for two months first it was home based learning and then they went into school holidays so suddenly parents of young children had to cope with the kids being at home and since some of them were also working from home they had to juggle both the kids homework and supervising them as well as doing they are trying to do that work so I still remember I had a patient come in and the first thing she did the moment she came in was to burst into tears that was awful she had three kids under under nine and it was the rolling all over her and she was trying to do her work and she was she's just in tears okay so there are a lot of things that happens when when we're trying to do things at home and when we have a lot of distractions and there's no no boundaries at all really okay next I wanna shift gears a little bit and talk about direct early effects on people who actually get Kove in nineteen well the majority may well be asymptomatic but we do know now that there's a phenomenon called silent hypoxia where patients can have very low oxygen saturation levels without too much discomfort and for these patients because they're in a constant hypoxic state they could be having direct effects of that on their brains and therefore presenting with confusion or odd behavior so maybe that's something we need to look at also what some of the studies are coming up with is that there appears to be an awesome ear or the inability to smell in a majority of patients and this is something that I think we've got to look out for because it's one of those under rates that disabilities or problems that patients may have which we we don't give as much credit to compared to sales among with blindness or hearing impairment more on that later so it started became becoming quite clear that neurologic features were a part of the the picture when you had a severe infection so for patients who were in the hospital due to a RTS a large proportion of them had agitation some more had confusion and a post discharge about a third was still affected also after the the results of the recent trial that showed that dexamethasone might be helpful for severe infections we do know that steroids are associated with a variety of psychiatric in presenting Asians maybe see insomnia elation depression and once in a while Frank psychosis so that's another thing that we will be looking out for for these patients in terms of late effects I'd like to make a comparison with SARS and MERS because these are the most recent corona viral attacks that we've had so studied by Rogers that came out in May this year showed that during the acute phase of the illness about a third had confusion depression anxiety and but four in ten with insomnia and after infection about three years later about 15 to 15 percent had depressed mood or anxiety about a third had traumatic memories but the good news was that you know maybe about 77% were back at work after three years so there is some lingering morbidity but some ability to get back to a level of function okay in terms of the direct and involvement of the brain this is this is something that is becoming pretty obvious a very recent study has shown that there's a definite neuronal damage in severe and post-mortem cases of Kovac 90 and that is something that we really need to look out for so perhaps what we do need to do is to follow up with non-coated 19 sufferers over the long term especially those who had a RDS or and into ICU to make sure that they are not having long-term effects more on their nightmares talking about about 50% of patients even if they are having very mild symptoms may have anosmia they may not actually notice it but on a sniff test actually most of them will have complete anosmia or a reduced ability to smell food and if this is long-lasting then this is really going to impact the ability to to enjoy one's food and that's something that's you do three times a day or so and more so that would really impact one's quality of life okay so in terms of very late effects it's likely that we need to look up for late neuropsychiatry syndromes and another thing which kind of made me think about is that in psychiatry where we know that schizophrenia is associated with viral illness viral exposure in utero and this was an early article in 1988 that showed that an unfinished birth cohorts we had a higher rate of individuals developing schizophrenia during the 1957 a to type a to influenza epidemic so I'm not saying that this is definitely going to happen about this it's for sure something that we need to watch out for especially given that the number of patients getting covered 19 is so high across the world okay now a little bit about health care workers so based on our experience in Singapore with previous viral epidemics we are much better prepared this time so this is a study that was done by Benjamin Town at all in Singapore surveyed early during the pandemic and showed that there was about 8% with depression 11 percent anxiety and about 6 percent pts symptoms and this compares well with 21 percent morbidity for those health care workers who were surveyed during sauce and a PDS symptoms which were higher okay almost interesting about this current paper is that if you were medical which they defined as a doctor or a nurse then your chances of having anxiety is actually half that then compared if you were non-medical so executives or perhaps the the cleaning staff or airline health so this is an interesting finding so we really should look into into this and just bear in mind that perhaps even though we make they may be frontline there are maybe other reasons for this increased anxiety okay what do we know we know that the health mental health of healthcare workers is much much worse when healthcare systems are overwhelmed and especially when they have to make distressing ethical choices such as do we admit a 40 year old or the 70 year old to our last date in Nice you what if that 40 year olds a drug addict versus if the 70 oh is a recently retired eminent professor of economics let's see so you know going back to philosophy and the trolley bus problem that they're just so many combinations and it's really difficult to have to make these these life and death decisions okay so for healthcare start had to had to do this in Italy during the height of their pandemic you can see that the pts symptoms are so much higher so much so many more post-traumatic symptoms and a higher rate of depressed mood and anxiety now going on to migrant workers so we have 300 23,000 migrant workers which are housed in dormitories so it's almost as if there are like a lower middle-income country house within a high-income country for the most part they live apart and socialized apart and of course with the with increase in numbers that exploded in Singapore they have had to be housed in CCF's and and special dormitories to try and contain the virus so how is it different for them of course they have to fear losing their jobs being deported having language barriers being separated from their family in some cases overcrowding and with it misinformation some of them actually very early on even thought that they were going to be shepherded onto a ship to be killed so the think to note that is that a lot of these studies actually may have been in some ways a convenient sampling or particularly special groups that that might have been easier to sample and they may not be representative of the poor and marginalized groups especially so groups that may not have access to social media or the internet or a stuck at home and we also have to think of social and economic health as being very closely related to mental health so for those who are abused the poor and those are special needs I think we do need to really look out for them next in terms of the population response to disasters this is a very well-known chart that shows that when there is a impact due to a disaster at first there is a heroic response and there is a honeymoon where there's a lot of community cohesion but what is clear is that inevitably there is a period of disillusionment especially if they are trigger events and this can happen for for quite a while so after a single event such as a flood let's say or an earthquake the disillusionment phase can come in months after and lasts for up to a year and then after the anniversary some reconstruction occurs however what happens is that with with this virus we are seeing repeater waves so what we are going to see probably is a prolonged disaster not a single event and it's going to have a very long mental health tale okay this is a little bit of a switch and this is it's been very interesting really just noticing how how on on one hand people get together and they really pull through but at the same time there's a lot of tribalism that it's constantly rearing its ugly it and I think this is for me as a psychiatrist not surprising at all it's no it's no coincidence that as children we are brought up learning about good versus bad and and and that there's always a black is a white an evil stepmother and a good princess and that's because we think in terms of black and white it's also well ingrained in the human psyche to think in terms of tribes so as an in-group it promotes bonding and it helps us to perform better with our in-group and to you know sort of be a bit suspicious of potentially hostile out groups and when that happens then it's very easy especially when we're stressed to move in this tribalism mode it's really important though to bear in mind that oftentimes when tribalism is rearing its head it's our limbic system or emotional brains that are coming in rather than a more rational neocortex so if you find yourself thinking very clearly that this I am I am right and you are wrong and try and put it push it through your down cortex okay we're going to mental health strategies for the population so this is Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs it's right for me little lots of people basically it's a it's a pyramid we're starting from the bottom you look at physiological needs such as food water shelter and sleep and then you move up along the knee the the levels of needs and finally becomes self actualized I just want to concentrate on the bottom three physiological needs they're unique because we have to keep returning to them followed by safety and security needs and then love and belonging okay so very importantly one must meet basic needs and I would include maybe the internet in in terms of physiological needs almost all right so what happened is on February 7th we all know that it's Singapore das kann Orange was declared and then suddenly everybody kind of rushed to the supermarkets and started hoarding on things such as daily necessities and toilet paper and this is really the panic that the basic needs were not going to be met yeah so I saw that two days later our prime minister actually had to come and reassure the population that there was really no need to worry about the basic needs and I think this was a very good step recognizing that there were these needs that really need to be reassured so in terms of tribalism it's often about fight or flight but in terms of what else we can do as a population the other coping that we can do is to tend and befriend and I'm so glad to see that in nationally a national care hotline has been set up such that if you are worried or stressed during this time you can actually call for help in the NHS we also have hotlines and support groups for healthcare workers and as well as for for staff just like to bring a little bit of a detour to this little town called Rosetta and the Rosetta effect so what happened was in the 1960s it was noticed that this little Italian town Italian American town rather and much lower cardiovascular mortality rates compared to the nearby towns and they realized that actually there's a very high social cohesion they shared the festivals and had a lot of informal networks those were often open the houses were closely spaced and neighbors would often pop over to each other and share food and gossip well what happened is that and they were followed up over 50 years and as the population and became more Americanized as I said well social cohesion went down and mortality rate started approaching those of the rest of the neighbor towns so I mean it's not just about physical health but I think in terms of the mental health of the town it also sort of went along the same way hmm so this is what a new HS has been doing for for the migrant workers looking after their basic needs as well as their social social needs as well and connecting with them and giving them information largely though in the dorms this this has been taken up by the NGOs so for example Health Service got a Tele friending service where volunteers who can speak the local language of the migrant workers will speak to the will speak to the the patients but at the same time getting supervision from volunteer psychiatrists so this is the paper on recommendations for improving the mental health of healthcare workers it's it's really not rocket science clear communications important adequate PPE so this was not not provided in some countries likely Singapore is not one of them adequate rest and practical and psychological support okay finally into the mental health strategies these are the things that we are prone to misinformation unpredictability social isolation and a lack of control so in terms of misinformation obviously we should have accurate information and I would just say why not go for the Goldilocks effect basically if you want your information make sure it is not too little not too much not too hot and not too cold okay next for mindfulness what is mindfulness meditation it can be defined as the focused awareness on the present in a non-judgmental way and if you remember this dramatic Thai boys who are stuck in a cave in 2018 with their soccer coach for I think it was for 18 days before they were all rescued and I think part of the reason they actually managed to survive was really because their coach taught them how to meditate and therefore they stayed calm they used up less oxygen and they were not panicking or you know just just losing it so this is a very important thing I think when we are facing situations where things are very uncertain and we can't really control things I mean what else can you do focus on the present so this reminds me oh yes so there is actually increasing evidence space for this being able to actually change our brains this reminds me of a birthday card I got some time ago forget about the past you can't change it forget about the future it's not here yet forget about the present I didn't get you one but seriously this is what I tell my patients if you have a very active brain that's really overthinking and worrying too much about the future all the time then you're prone to anxiety likewise if you're thinking too much about the past and really preoccupy all the time then you're going to be more likely to develop depression and this is where mindfulness comes in because now you can there's a tool for you to focus more on the present and change your neuronal networks to not overthink either into the future not the past finally oh not finally third thing social isolation so finding new ways to connect this is an interesting paper I found where they studied different regions in Italy and they found that the regions which had the highest spread of Kovac 19 also had the smallest household size and a higher number of nursing homes so in fact social connectedness was not a risk factor for spreading kovat 19 in fact it was the opposite okay lots of control so you generally for high-functioning adults we're used to a high level of control and now in this pandemic of the fields that we can't control many things so the best thing to do then is to focus on what you can control and in self-determination theory I found this good when you're choosing things that you can control think of things that you feel competent in that you can feel that you have some freedom in and which helps you feel related having said that if you're introvert then chances are you'll be happier with with hobbies that don't require so much relatedness so actually there are a lot of things that can be done and it's up to you to pick and choose something that actually makes you happy my other advice also would be to have as many tools in your toolbox as you can if you only rely on exercise for example and you're not allowed to exercise or you develop an injury and you have nothing else to fall back on then it becomes a problem so develop more Skills more hobbies and more ways of coping finally I think that there's another thing we can do and that's to choose gratitude so focusing on the things that we can be grateful for and there's there's more evidence coming in now that actually changes our brains as well so looking at the silver linings I think it's been very helpful my patients teach me a lot and actually I was quite surprised when I to feel my patients didn't actually feel that kovat 19 was a big deal they said well I'm at home now and I've always liked to be at home and now I'm actually normal and others were saying you know I can spend more time with my family or I can actually focus on the important things in life and that ends my talk thank you very much Thank You Cornelia we very much appreciate that time is short we do want you to send in your questions we're going to try to get to as many as we can let me start off with the question from Tana Lee hoon who states that lockdown measures have seen mothers having to juggle work from home and organizing their children's schooling from home what words of advice do you have for us yes I think we need to involve fathers more now a recent study that came out from the center for family and population research in NUS that showed that working mothers spend twice as much time than compared to fathers on weekdays so you know I think men can step up more excellent and there's a follow-up question do not I mean don't children benefit from having a loving parents at home with them during these trying times there's a lot of stress it's better than them being in a place where maybe people are a bit more impersonal such as where school oh yeah but you know schools an important place to socialize as well especially for teens yeah okay Kenneth you asks what's your professional opinion is to the ministerial task force decision to classify psychological services as non-essential during the circuit breaker period I got phone calls from my psychologist friends in private practice the night it happened is it what we're non-essential oh I had so many patients we're not doing well because they could not see that their counselors and their mental health practitioners in private I think that was a misstep policy okay I assume the the organisation the professional organizations in Singapore able to convey that message was sephorus lee and that's why that that was eventually reversed how do we in to bill individualize the message regarding the availability of mental health screening and mental health care to be more acceptable in light of the cultural religious and or ethnic group differences in how mental health issues are perceived this is gonna be a tough one it has to be a whole of society thing and you know I was just chatting with my foot my patient today and she's saying that can I get insurance if I if I if I apply for it now cuz I was I was denied it when I when I was hospitalized three years ago and I said you know honestly our local insurers are not really very enlightened and that is a tragedy it's it's got to be not just not just mental health advocates I think visions that keep on pushing the envelope so what is the what is the baseline rate of mental health issues in Singapore I know in the United States is around 17 to 20 percent and I know after after Katrina it went up to 55 percent the hurricane so what is our baseline rate baseline rate according to our single Singapore mental health study that was done a few years ago what depression anxiety if I'm not wrong at around five percent but that's not lifetime prevalence that was quite prevalence okay how would you compare the efficacy of face-to-face delivery of mental health mental health care versus virtual delivery well their pros and cons both ways if you if it's compared with no mental health delivery then it's definitely ideal but there are problems with mental health delivery via you know tele consult or video consult I think some of the nuances don't quite come across and suddenly if the patient might be at risk for self-harm or suicide then that could be a problem so we always have to make sure that the patient is likely to be safe before we start the console most countries do not have adequate mental health personnel to meet everyone's needs and as such the primary caregivers are often providing screening and mental health care you have a few simple tips for primary care providers who may be in a poly clinic with only 5 to 15 minutes with each patient certain minutes this is asking a lot I think that's a tough one I think sometimes it's about relationship and it's just showing that you care as a person and you're listening actually not not enough people listen so if you're able to listen I think that was that's a great help already we're doing more telling and incorporating that into our lives is there a looming crisis from social media reliance you mentioned earlier that that one of the basic necessities is the internet but does the reliance on social media cause us to have disintegration and socialization well I think this is a complex one human beings are are generally meant to be social and I think that the early studies generally showed that if you spend more time on social media than it was correlated with more mental health problems I think it's actually much more complex than that I think for some people it can be a real lifeline and I think society is evolving to to socialize and to reach out and to find very positive things using social media ething has asked what are the top three silver linings you see arising from kovat 19 for the mental healthcare sector if you can firstly the chance to simplify one's life so I used to travel very often and when I couldn't do that anymore I had to find books and then now I'm happily traveling to you know 18th century Russia or Japan in my mind that's one so simplifying I think the other thing is to get back to nature one of the things I really really enjoyed about the last day of the circuit breaker was how blue the skies were so I think getting back to nature is another one and the last one is I think on if you can connecting with the people in your house I've got two teenage girls and we taught that my husband I taught them mahjong and we had many happy evenings playing mahjong nice Joyce tio has asked a doctor Qi what stage of the disaster response chart is Singapore at now what can we expect in the delusion Minh stage so that chart is for a single event so what we're really doing is very uncharted - really and I think the disillusionment is just gonna go up and down with time and it's gonna be dragged out quite a bit mm-hmm okay and just last question is looking back in the last six months if you could have two wishes for mental health services or support in Singapore what what would you have in place now that maybe we don't I think maybe more more of a set up for for tele visits or tele consulting and the other thing would be just less stigma yeah thank you so much we're gonna where time is short over to you Dale that's quick okay so it's a slightly truncated version tonight David because I we predicted that we might might run out of time so I've just got got a couple tonight the first one the and Cornelia actually mentioned that does this whole business about is it airborne and and I've got a little story about drones in South Korea after that so so I think it will remember this picture this was in in the outbreak movie when Dustin Hoffman looked up at a at an event and said it's gone airborne and I think it's a hallmark moment in the movie and and I think that's what a lot of people think about but it's obviously a lot more complicated than that when so when we are considering whether something's airborne it comes down to the the size of the particle but as a rule of thumb if it's if it's under five microns in size that's five thousandth of a millimeter then it's capable of being suspended in air but but bigger ones bigger particles tend to be droplets that fall to the ground and that's whether the one to two meters comes from and it relates to the precautions we take when we say one to two meters when we say surgical mask is is adequate most of the time then then this is really the the presumption so so it is quite important to understand whether it is airborne or not so as I think most people would know there was a an article published in CID during the week and a letter also to the New York Times by the same authors claiming 239 people that had were wanting to put pressure on WH o to admit that it was that it was airborne so let me just take you through that the the people that wrote the letter though there were a few epidemiologists and public health people but but by and large they were their ventilation experts their aero engineers they work in laboratories and and look at air flow and and droplets and and suspended particles in the air and things like that so we're trying to work out if these particles can can spread long distances so you can see in this little graphic that obviously with generally a movement if it was suspended in the air that it could go really tens of meters so so they're in how do you prove it and you can do this two ways you can do this by epidemiologically and you can also do it viral aaja Klee now let's let's start with the epidemiologic side so we know that the vast majority of people that get covert get it from close contact and the and the reproductive number is generally around 2.5 now measles and chickenpox are the two famous viruses for for being airborne their reproductive number is you know 10 12 15 and that's because it's airborne it can go long distances and people can get the disease without having any close contact with someone with the disease so already that reproductive number is starting to give us some hints that that it's it's mostly droplet spread now there are there any examples of people that have got the disease with no contact now that's possible there's there's some publications of restaurants and singing events where where so many people got it indeed even super spreading events where you might argue that it must be airborne because it was a super spreader event and so many so many people got the disease and maybe singing does have the capacity to create these very small aerosols but unfortunately you can't remove the concept of fomites being contaminated so this is the environment so this is where we say when we're when we're deciding is on trans on transmission based precautions is it contact is a droplet is it airborne and we we generally go with the theory that it's contact and droplet therefore wash your hands keep your distance wear a mask particularly if you can't keep that distance so um did some of these super spreading events restaurants and singing events did they have environmental contamination and that's how the transmission happened and that we can't be a hundred percent sure of but this is one of the pieces of evidence cited by the the the airborne protagonists so so that would be be the first thing now we know it's never been cultured from an aerosol okay with the found PCR positive but it's never been cultured as opposed to other viruses which you can culture from the aerosols so therefore is it just fragments of the virus in in the in the aerosol we know that when we swab throats towards that the the end of the illness that we can't culture it but we can detect that the PCR can be positive and we can detect we can detect viral RNA so um that's an important point to know that it's actually never been cultured despite a lot of efforts having said that it's not easy to culture era sauce so so so that again is not a definite no it can't be aerosol spread so on so the the w-h-o has basically always said that we believe that it's mostly contact and and droplet spread we won't exclude that it could be aerosol spread but with that R naught and with that epidemiology and with the fact that we can't culture it or at least can culture it easily then then at best I would argue that that airborne precaution is is unlikely or is is a lower driver of the outbreak we know there's aerosol generating procedures so if you're having a tube put down your throat or dental work or something like that then that can generate aerosols um but outside of the hospital we really don't don't see it as a as a big driver although that what that's what all the fuss is about with with a school of thought being that it is a big driver it's definitely the arguments definitely not over yet but but that's where we stand and I hope that explanation helps people out there I just wanted to to go to to a video now so this is a very neat video that that I came across during the week it's it's in South Korea these are drones choreographed amazingly the the actual video is a little bit longer so thank you Joe for editing it to just capture the the key bits but I'll I'll hand over to you now Joe to show the video please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some things just make you speechless right yeah anyway the whole video takes 11 minutes the way they moved through all the the virus on the front of the masks and the the social distancing moving the two heads away on the hand-washing and then the thanks to health care workers apparently no one in Seoul knew that was happening they just they just did it so anyway I don't know I've turned into the video guy we've that's three in a row wasn't supposed to be it but I don't know what's gonna happen from one week to the next but anyway back to you David thanks alright thank you very much do that's superb yeah let me just provide a brief summary of tonight the key points we learned that there'll be a long mental health tale as consequences of Koba 19 due to the biologic effects of the viruses the virus and the drugs are used to treat it as well as social isolation and the economic impact this is having on us there should be more discussion an action to alleviate the disproportionate responsibilities of working mothers are experiencing compared to the working father's during this pandemic we learned that and finally foreign workers and health care workers are vulnerable to allay fear we should provide clear routine repeated messaging which is critical to their mental well-being adequate supplies whether it's PPE food or etc adequate rest and teaching encouraging mindfulness and self-determination it leads me now to thank our two speakers Dale as usual an excellent job and Cornelia we're so glad that you joined us tonight our speaker next

stricter measures to protect workers in the highest risk zone a locally developed breath test that can detect copy 19 in 60 seconds is ready for trials and the woman from this viral video appears in court on another charge welcome to the big story coming to you live from the streets times newsroom i'm olivia quay and i'm harviyan today you can subscribe to the street signs channel so you never miss a single episode 24 new covet 19 community cases were confirmed today two are currently unlinked the other 22 are connected to previous cases with 12 detected while in quarantine and 10 identified through surveillance meanwhile 12 imported cases were also reported today including five returning singaporeans or prs more details will be released later tonight with singapore's largest active cluster still growing at changi airport its 14 000 workers will be segregated into three risk-based zones these new measures are being introduced progressively and will be fully in place when terminals one and three as well as dual reopen to the public on june 13th 4 400 workers will be in zone 1 the highest risk zone there will be strict measures there to protect them from kovite 19 as well as isolate them from other staff and the public now zone 1 comprises the terminal piers a rival immigration hall and baggage claim areas airport workers deployed there will have to don ppe plus a face mask and face shield they'll also have to keep within their zone at all times and use designated dining and rest areas and toilets the next higher risk area is zone 2 where workers must wear a mask shield and gloves public meeting areas in the airport will be considered zone 3 the lowest risk workers only need to wear a mask there we now know clearly where the primary zone of infection emanated from so together with our airport partners we are working to reinvent our operational processes and operating model so that we can enhance the safety protocol by june 13 so that we can decisively segment and ring fence the entire zone serving our rival passengers and in so doing will safeguard the safety of airport workers as well as the rest of singapore journalists called iphone was at changi airport earlier today and he saw the title measures first hand what were the main differences you observed in the new stepped-up measures versus what was in place before i think the what what uh changing airport is doing is quite a fundamental change in their operating process so um previously the airport's transit area was quite a contiguous area so you know that there was no uh strict separation between the various parts of the transit area uh what triangle is doing now is to create three uh separate distinct segregated zones for for workers so that uh workers within each zone do not intermingle with each other so these zones are sort of risk based the lowest risk zone is zone three and that's the public area so for example uh the meeting area the rival departure halls so this is outside of immigration uh the second zone is you know the immigration area as well as the central transit area where you enter um you know from the departure immigration you oh it's a big hall you know that the area is the central transit area where it's all the shops and everything that's a zone just what they're saying is it's slightly i mean there's not a difference between zone two and zone two because you're just entering from singapore so the risk of uh you carrying kovit is about the same as you being outside of zone two so those are the two sort of safer zones uh zone one is the highest so this is uh places where uh workers this is uh for example the the uh arrival in departure gates where passengers come through uh as well as the arrival immigration hall as well as arrival baggage claims hall so uh what changing airport is doing is basically to sort of ring fence uh their workers even further uh so it's prevent uh you know cross coordination between different groups of workers and i think the biggest uh interesting thing about this is that what they're doing is basically uh doing a very you know conservative and prudent approach because what they're saying is that um you know previously uh what they what they assumed was that that you know lower risk uh travelers from countries to lower risk of coming 19 you know having transient contact with each other is not very high risk but you know given the infectiousness of the new b1617 variant i think they're taking a very cautious approach and trying to make sure that even tangent contact is seen as risky and needs to be predicted against so that that's the biggest change that uh is doing um also uh they're stepping up testing regimes for their workers so for the highest risk workers working zone one instead of being tested uh every 14 days they're being tested every seven days so this is the pcr test on the swap uh on top of that every third day of the testing cycle uh you know they will be uh subject to anti-nt uh sorry rapid antigen test which is another test on top of that and uh is saying that in the future they'll institute a daily testing regime uh a non-investment or non-invasive test for example a possibility could be a breathalyzer test for example uh where workers are tested every day at the end of shift so when they go home they know when not they have had contracted the virus and if they are not negative they have some sort of peace of mind when they go home so that and that's the biggest changes uh that airport is putting in place starting from juice 13. right well so segregated zones increased testing that's all great to hear but we understand cag said the terminals will also have cleaner air so you found can you tell us more about that uh yes so in response to recent reports uh regarding the possible spreading of the antivirus via airborne transmission i think uh what recognizing is that um you know in places with prolonged contact uh you know without masks uh you know with poor ventilation those are places where there's a higher risk of workers contracting or people are conducting the virus so therefore i mean they already have put in place certain measures to uh increase the frequency of air recycling and for example toilets or another piece of airport but in order to make it even more enhanced what they're doing is they're putting in portable um high efficiency particular air filters uh or hepa filters uh in these areas examples like staff rest areas of places where parcels just like congregate so as to you know further filter out and sort of prevent um possibility of apple transmission of virus it seems like today's measures only affect airport workers even is there anything in place for passengers or visitors to the terminals and even the shopping center jewel okay so i think right now the measures are meant to protect workers because uh as you know the cluster of uh 100 cases that are linked to the airport uh you know emerged after some workers that contracted the virus uh you know interacting with uh arriving passengers so i i think uh what what changing point is saying that actually currently uh there are already three measures in place to ensure that passengers uh arriving from high-risk areas uh are already uh segregated from the general you know traveling a passenger population so uh when they come to the airport you know they're immediately exported to uh the testing center at the airport uh you know they wait there to get a test result and then um they're immediately taken to uh their quality facility via dedicated transport so already there are measures in place to ensure that there's no cost contamination between high-risk travelers versus low-risk travelers so uh right now and even now with lowest travelers they're not allowed to linger around the transit area or to hang around for too long so i think what this is doing is not really it's not i mean there's nothing much change to uh passengers but more helping to protect workers who are interacting with these passengers um but i will say that there's one other precaution that they're putting in which is for countries that are very high risk i mean the china doesn't really say uh what was the definition of very high risk but from these countries pestilence countries will have to land at a separate gate uh it's called a remote gate at terminal 2 which is currently closed but they're opening up several gates in that terminal to handle these super high risk of very high risk uh passengers so these passengers will go to the gate clear immigration at the gate and then be transported from the gate to their coordination so that will pass through any of the terminals that operating right now so i think this is one of the measures that are putting in place for passengers to ensure that there's even greater segregation between you know high risk and uh very high risk uh passages from their workers like basically that's that's uh what they're doing yeah uh as for jewel uh um my understanding is the first airport as well as the more uh you know it's being closed until june 13th which is the end of the uh alert period uh changing airport is offering a rental waiver for the tenants uh and i think they're also looking at uh possibly providing some support for workers uh at airport as well because you know they're going through a tough time right now so i think those announcements will come out maybe later uh you know in the next coming weeks some months all right well thank you so much for joining us today you fung that was cocky fun journalist for the streets times and from changi airport to tua's checkpoint where a breath test that can accurately detect kobe 19 within a minute will soon be trialled it will screen incoming travelers and be carried out alongside the current compulsory antigen rapid test those screened positive on the breathalyzer will need to take a confirmatory pcr swap test developed by a spinoff from the national university of singapore the breath test has been provisionally authorized by the health sciences authority after undergoing clinical trials now the woman seen in this viral clip refusing to wear a mask at mbs is contesting a charge for an alleged offense last year under the covet 19 temporary measures act appearing in court today she was seen approaching the state court's building without a mask on only putting one on when she was near the entrance she also tried to remove her mask before addressing the court but the judge ordered her to keep it on throughout the proceedings it's been just over a week since we haven't been allowed to dine in at f b premises harry anto how has this affected your plans to eat out it has definitely because i've had plans to eat out with my friends but now we can't do that and we actually wanted to eat at a friend's place because it just opened uh a restaurant but then you know now everything has gone to take away it's quite saddening because you know it goes without saying that fmb is among the worst hit sectors and even when businesses were able to pivot quickly having learned from last year's circuit breaker business is not as brisk well that's for sure our colleague anjali raghuraman spoke to several restaurant owners she joins us now to share more so anjali according to the business owners whom you spoke to how different is it for them to pivot their business this time around given that you know they've been through this before yeah definitely this this time around it was uh slightly easier to you know get their delivery and take away models up and running because they already have had a bit of experience doing it during the circuit breaker last year but the issue this time around mainly was the fact that they only had one and a half days essentially to do it and the announcement that a phase two heightened alert was coming into play um came out on a friday and most suppliers are closed on saturday so a lot of them had to scramble for not only packaging take away packaging and food stocks to to you know last a week and then also have to pivot their menus to a takeaway friendly model yeah they were they were definitely a bunch of challenges the moment the announcement came out the two main profiles in your story are owners who opened second businesses barely two weeks ago anjali did they say why they decided to start new ventures especially in these volatile times yeah they're two very different cases but yeah their stories are quite parallel so in the case of asador the owners also run nexo spanish cafe in in siegler and they opened just slightly before the circuit breaker last year and went through the the worst the most challenging times but they came out of it and they built their core audience very strongly and then they decided that you know what we have a captive audience in singapore let's take advantage of it so that's why they they sped up moved along with uh opening after door in another spanish restaurant in juchet and they opened like like we mentioned two weeks ago and now they're back under lockdown conditions as for low tide which is run by the same people behind sego house which is a dive bar in chinatown it was a case of the location becoming available low tide is located at the corner of club street in where this from beaujolais used to be they just wanted to to again sort of take advantage of the situation but also um build on their brand and expand to a whole new audience in the club street area but then again the pandemic came in i mean not the pandemic the pandemic restrictions came in and they're two weeks in they barely had time to get their name out but already they're facing um massive challenges trying to get the people not only on board with what they're doing for takeaway and delivery but also just getting the name out right well maybe a bit of a silver lining of sorts because you know under the job support scheme fmb businesses they get increased wage subsidies of 50 but aside from that and of course in short of a lifting of restrictions what actions are these businesses calling for okay so the the main issue a lot of them have is their fixed costs so stuff like rental especially rental is a huge burden on a lot of these restaurants and so a lot of them are hoping for rental reliefs because on top of that they have to look after overhead they have to look after labor they have to look after utilities because the restaurants are still open and running and they cost money to keep open but you know if they could get help besides the jss support which which is yeah like i mentioned 50 the rental reliefs and understanding from landlords is what a lot of them are seeking at the moment now i've seen ground up efforts on social media encouraging people to keep buying from hawkers especially the older ones you know to help them tide over this period actually what are the hawkers saying how can they survive okay among the hawkers the ones that are the worst affected are the elderly ones and who don't have access necessarily to you know a marketing team or social media presence or even that some of them don't even know how to get on delivery platforms so there have been a lot of ground up efforts like on instagram pages even facebook pages where people are consolidating um you know like their favorite hawker stalls that with run by elderly people even kfcto is doing uh his is like singapore tour of some of his favorite hawker stalls so i it's it's going to be an uphill climb i mean we're not they're going to be people who fall through the cracks for sure but it's quite encouraging to see how people are rallying behind them well thank you anjali we've been speaking with journalists for the straits times anjali raguraman [Music] taking a quick look at what else is making headlines in a facebook post today education minister chandran singh said singapore's autonomous universities will be able to admit more students this year but that doesn't mean admissions will be made easier last year the education ministry said the six autonomous universities would make about 2 000 more offers

pXeTFpQ2Be8,Telling My Family About My Mental Health Condition,UCFRIAxGTWQ4mllzdkdomAkQ,TEAM NOC,2020-10-06T07:01:01Z,We asked four people about their mental health and family relationships. What they didn't know is that their family members were listening in. If you are ...,[Music] welcome to another episode on team noc since mental health awareness day is around the corner we are going to be sharing a little bit about ourselves as you know some of us have faced mental conditions and are under different kinds of stress so today we are going to share what kind of fears and challenges that we face and how we overcome these difficulties before we begin hit that subscribe button below and let's go what would you say has been your biggest source of worry or stress in life i have been diagnosed with mdd when i was 21 and that stands for major depressive disorder i guess a majority of my worry and stress comes from not falling back to the state that i was in previously because when i was first diagnosed with mdd it was a really dark period for me yeah because i don't have much memory of the period but all i know it was that i lost a lot of friends i think it's the responsibility that i put on myself and the expectations that i put on myself to want to always do better and want to be able to one day can let my parents retire and not worry about me and also for me to be able to kill them if anything happens in the future well you're stuck straight away it's so deep huh um one of the biggest sources of worry and stress is primarily for people around me yeah i think that this year as a company as friends we've like been through a lot so i'm also like a leader in my church and like there's a there's a bunch of people that that i'm sort of looking out for and so i genuinely worry for a lot of other people on top of getting my work done so as you all know i disappeared from the media scene for quite some time it's because i had depression and the cost of it is probably from work stress and family worries that i have for me tell me more about the kinds of worries that you face because of this the things i remember when i was going through the lowest point in my life really included a lot of seclusion from the world like hiding by myself in my room like it got to the point where i was actually suicidal and then like every single day i really felt like today i really want to go and i spend a lot of time combating these thoughts in my head actually because i have anxiety right so usually at night when i have like a very very long day or when i have anxiety that acts up this is how it happens so whenever i go to sleep everything on that day or like maybe some other day it will just look in my head and i also always feel like i am not on par with like my parents capability because they do like a small business so i will always compare myself like i will always hope that i can earn enough or like maybe more than them so i can like give them money more i always feel like i will compare myself with all this like i don't really compare myself with other people but i will always give like very i would say like unrealistic expectations towards myself so yeah i think this was particularly challenging because i saw my position as like the middle person a lot i felt like i was constantly in between a lot of unpleasant situations or difficult social situations that i needed to be in there were like times where i would be like in between shoots or going for a meeting and i would just like burst into tears in the car and i didn't expect it i guess i just didn't even have time to process those emotions so i bottled it up and it all like came out yeah first thing when you wake up it's like everything is okay you can be normal you can laugh but when it comes to the night time i tell you it's terrible it's not as easy as you can't sleep but a lot of nonsensical thoughts will linger in your mind and it makes you just want to go crazy and so how how did you end up coping with all of this on your own this is a really bad method whenever i was going to get super like depressed and suicidal right like my body will start to black out like collapse on itself and then i would find that i will have panic attacks at home my anxiety takes over and i find myself like self-harming in a way but i feel it's because there's so much going on inside that my body doesn't know how to process it and it tries to bring the pain outwards you know what i mean yeah which um i guess that's the start of the worrying points because it slowly became from once a few months and then it became like once a week and eventually like every single day i had to do this to cope with all the feelings i felt inside yeah so after self-harming every single day i think the bruises start to show up on your body and that's when the people around me knew that it was a worrying point because i have this uh i don't know whether or not you would say like an illness or like a sickness or what but with fibromyalgia sometimes when it acts up you get like anxiety or like depression but the last time i was diagnosed the anxiety was high but depression is no more that's why i freelance for so many years is because i know that whenever i need a break right i really need a break all this always takes a toll on me because i feel like because of all this i i'm just like not normal or not i don't have that strength like everybody else to like be normal okay so i've never shared this publicly before but um i actually studied psychology growing up right and so um i do see so much value in taking care of my mental health and because of that i've actually been seeing a counsellor for the last two years i always just needed a safe space and a safe outlet right where i could share and process like very difficult things in my life and every time i go for a counseling session right i always leave a better person it's very beneficial for me to take care of my mental health basically i took a few months off from work and from everything basically everything i just spent a good three to four months at home with my family during my while like my hobbies you know bring my kid to for walks and all that in which i was unable to laugh when i was at work so all this made me feel a lot better who are you closest to in your family i would say my mom is the closest person to me in my family yeah my mom sometimes you know like moms and dads they don't really understand like mental illness even though my mom have gone through it but she still feel like sometimes it's just me over thinking so i will share with like my cousin who i grew up with because she's like around the same age as me so i'm definitely closest to my mom i remember there was this particular night where uh ah now i'm gonna cry i remember there was this particular night where i was so overwhelmed at work and the situations that we were dealing with right and i was just so tired and like when i came home and i saw my mom right i just felt so relieved yeah i felt so relieved because i remembered like um that i have a place of like love and support and i have a place of comfort yeah so i'm definitely closest to my mom closest would be almost everybody in the family because back then it's like i just don't talk to any of the family members as i grew up older then you know it's like easier to open up to them hey bro you want this or not hey bro you don't do that it's okay you know it's so it became easier when i grow older and so what is your relationship like um from when you were growing up um i can see that we have faced like um lots of like turbulent times in our life we've been through two marriages you know with my father and eventually with a stepfather and the it didn't go too well as well during those period i wasn't as close with my mom as i wish i was going through a lot in school i was going through bullying i've been bullied for the way i look bullied for the way i act and then at the same time i was struggling with internal relationships in my family so it really felt like i had no one at that time ever since my mom has single-handedly taken care of her family right we started getting closer yeah because we grew up together so she used to stay at my house when we were younger and usually she knows when there's something that is happening and she'll just ask me out for a drink then we'll like just talk to like thai thing soon i would say growing up right we actually have very turbulent relationship like a lot of fights i was very rebellious she was working out a lot of issues on her own um but towards like the 20s i think like we both changed a lot and that's where our relationship really strengthened better because she's just so fierce the moment she called me so where is there where is that one why you never do something when i do i want who is that just bad but personal um different the different side of her come up like she'll talk to you nicely hey my house got cooked this morning my mid cool is not very nice you wanna come and eat a very big change so it's good and bad balance thing now so speaking of being close um your mom's actually here like right now oh no no wait okay wait what oh my god i overhear everything and she looks like a million bucks you know when you tell her hi do i just stand here so silvia what has segen told you so far about his depression his worries so far actually i think his depression came as a shock to me because uh i think like he said at work i'm a very work person and he has after work then he just go back malaysia right so we never really talked but then i think one day we were in a company van it just so happened that he drove me to a shoot and then i think after the shoot he suddenly told me uh said i think i have depression well i was shocked i was very shocked but i thought wow uh it must have taken him a lot to show that self him that i don't think any of my family members have seen each other quiet right so that was the first time and i was shocked but i was happy that while he actually shared something like this yeah i didn't know until one day one day he approached me and then at that time then i decided i think he needs help which is why i approached i think a society first right so after that we had we went for counseling and the counselor asked me to bring him to a professional psychiatrist that brought him to polyclinic in order to get the subsidy and they brought us to kutipawa from there we went to i mean imh at that time they wanted to order you right and he cried he didn't want to go to be watered and he told me mom if you leave me there i would die so decided not to want him i registered for psychiatrist counselling yeah usually she would just say that like she's very stressed then she would she was saying like 4c like saying hey all this i feel is part of the anxiety as well they always complain like is it's abnormal when you are normal so the worries he would talk to me about mostly his church works and the church made and if the workload is too much for him too heavy for him he was stressed out he would tend to worry and at times he tell me he couldn't sleep so he don't really talk to me much about his worries only those very like severe ones yeah how did you feel knowing that he was going through all of this so yeah i felt a bit offended that what made offenders we've done so much for mental health and you know i'm like the mental health advocate in public and then in private my brother took so long to actually open up which also shocked me like i can say you know to you guys you know open up to your family members and everything but then i realized in reality it's quite hard and i say a lot the last thing i mean the last feeling i feel was i'm actually touched to be honest i think a lot of people don't dare to open up to your family members and also we're not close so i was very touched because i think because of depression we got a bit closer and i think today i invited him to come to mooncake festival play lantern right which is something that i never invite you to do because you have your own life and you are gross and i have my own life and i'm great very sad suiciding doesn't solve any problem it might solve for him because he'd be gone but he will leave the problem to the people who are still around so i told him no matter what i still love him i will call her i will come out the relief a bit that kind maybe can spook me more like talk to me more about it so she can relieve her stress as well well of course as a mom it will affect me a little when you know when your son comes to you and share with you about his stress his workload and to the extent that he cannot sleep of course i will also feel worried for him but usually i'm just sure are there any things that the other person has done to make you feel supported this was quite interesting because if you guys don't know i have depression maybe like 10 over years ago and that time right and their time was not a awareness kind of thing right from what i know my family probably had a lot of difficulty when i had depression but i think because they dealt with a difficult me it was easier for me to deal with him so i think it was really just reminding my parents hey remember the time what you did for me i think you just have to do that for him just be there for him and then you know don't stress him out can already it's really hard for us to burn up to each other about this kind of like emotions i mean i know that my mom is now more open as compared to the past yeah which i feel like is the only thing i could ever ask for like at this point in my life right now because knowing that she's there for me to talk to her if i really ever go through something right now i think that support is all i need right now she will just like text me she knows that when i'm feeling down that time she will always be there for me also she will randomly just text me although i find sometimes it's irritating right but end of the day right all the texts right it still feels like someone is there for me so my mom always says this line when do i say no to you every time i ask for help whether it's to take a photo or be in the photo or to cook something right she always says yes so i feel like without maybe knowing she really really has shown me that she's supporting me and also she always tells me like i'm praying for you and she will encourage me uh and i really really appreciate that yeah okay thank you guys for sharing okay so i've passed you guys a beyond the label pin yeah so what you're gonna do for me is pin it on each other okay pin it on my shoulder the beyond the label pain wait i pray for you oh my god okay like it's not the first time she put things in my clothes you know ding ding ding ding ding yeah now she wants to know if she can keep this okay pins nobody is i'm like really shocked that you turn up and all my secrets are exposed then how mommy you pin the whole thing you must take out this thing lah oh is it what the heck just this let's see how i do it yeah i don't need this one you never tell me okay mommy do you know what this pin means yeah no yeah no so basically right um there are a lot of people who are living with mental health conditions and there are bad labels attached to these conditions so what we want to do is to encourage everybody out there you know that it's okay to share with somebody it's okay to confide it's okay to have that safe space to process and to find your support system you know what i mean so we are looking beyond those bad labels you know what i'm saying yeah because both of us are wearing this right it means we are mental health ambassadors no do you know you are a mental health ambassador so good yes yes yes you have good mental health yes so now you're gonna write down one thing that you all wish you could do for each other in the future three two one go spend more time and help her out when she's facing problems so my one says join more family activities okay so um what i wrote is that we should see each other more and spend time talking like just quality time because we haven't really had like a nice family dinner for very long i will try to be there more like a friend than a family and for me i would try to be more patient with her okay so i wrote fruitfulness and purpose because ross is in her retirement days already so i wish her not just like you know to be aimless or bored but to have fruitfulness in her life and purpose my the most important one is because i want him to be healthy all the time i want to see him joyful always happy what's the last one get married wow everyone everyone including you yes i pray god i always pray to god to send him uh a wife thank you for watching our story i hope that um through this video you guys see the importance of being there for one another especially for your loved ones and your

Experts Speak Out,UCYPvAwZP8pZhSMW8qs7cVCw,India Today,2021-04-28T09:56:13Z,"With so many changes happening around the kids, coupled with isolation, loneliness, and physical distancing from their friends and closed ones can certainly ...",hello and welcome this is a special broadcast i'm chaiti narula we're talking about psychology of kids in this lockdown you're going to be hearing on this broadcast from a young mother simone kambata who's very vocal about looking after the mental health of your children she's also very vocal about mental health at large so we're going to be hearing from her on what her impairments really look like when it comes to her kids and of course top doctors on our show today dr varka julani and dr sameer parikh going to be walking you and guiding you through how to look after the psychology of your kids through this entire lockdown but first up let's look at the lay of the land mental health issues are real not just in adults but in kids too posted simone kambata a mother of two on instagram she went on to elaborate the kind of anxiety kids face the lockdown has been tough for kids as well the current times are causing us grave stress and anxiety and it's doing the exact same thing to our children only differences our kids can't vocalize how they feel their stress comes out in temper tantrums in throwing things and hitting and behaving out of order but as parents it's our responsibility to be mindful of their mental health and take action when required the quality and magnitude of impact on minors depends on their age their parenting patterns whether or not they have been quarantined due to infection amongst many other factors [Music] the times are tough and it's taking its toll on the kids people the kids are not eating enough are unable to concentrate and focus on what they're expected to do they're finding interpersonal interactions extremely rare this is leading to some sort of isolation and alienation everybody needs to ensure that we give children the best stimulation and maintain a positive environment at home so that they continue with their optimistic positive outlook and the long-term impacts on their well-being would not be negative from kids turning violent with siblings to behavioral regression speech regression mood swings aggressive behavior there are some signs that you need to watch out for to look after the mental health of your kids help is available visit a qualified mental health care practitioner if your child is acting up regardless of that there is some hygiene that one can follow at home if you have kids experts say spending more time with kids talking to them with empathy encouraging them to play games at home allowing them to enjoy themselves and not get very strict seeking therapy for yourselves as parents as well are some of the things that you can do to keep your kids mentally healthy but whatever happens remember mental health matters even for kids in new delhi chaiti narula for india today all right let's begin this discussion today i want to straight go across to a young mother who joins me she's also a very prominent social media influencer simone kombata simone you just put out a post just recently talking about the mental health in kids the problems that you were going through with your kids as well you're a mother of two why didn't you tell our viewers that how these problems are real and what is it that your kids are facing and what have you identified thank you for having me here um i do think addressing what's happening to our children right now is of utmost importance um as adults we all know what we're going through as far as stress and anxiety goes with the lockdown and the second wave what's happening to our children is something we have to really try very hard to understand because they're not able to vocalize it yeah but as a mother i can see what's happening to them right i can see my son is anxious he's stressed he does not understand why he can't go down and play he doesn't understand why his friends can't come over that is leading to all kinds of aggressive behavior in him he's screaming he's sad he's angry it's a variety of emotions that is happening you know to him and um of course it affects me i'm his mother you know um and i do understand how important it is to pinpoint those signs of mental health in my child while he's young um so that i can rectify whatever is needed to rectify because there's nothing that uh you can't kind of um you know cure and handle uh if you're mindful about what's really happening and if you can accept it right uh if you can also simone tell us some symptoms uh that you have noticed within your kids or kids of your friends or when you talk to your friends as well you must be hearing from other mothers what the kids are facing through in the lockdown so what are these symptoms that you feel that as mothers one needs to be vigilant about in identifying children and these are real ones because you you all have kids who are facing these absolutely so i think um some of the issues are most definitely uh you know extreme tantrums are no understanding of what the tantrum is because normally a tantrum is because they're hungry or because they're tired but these tantrums are coming out of nowhere they're a lot more frequent um you know there's a lot of aggressiveness that's coming in where they're throwing things and they are biting and they're doing all kinds of things you know my children are toddlers and they're obviously just learning how to speak so they can't explain to me what's going on um and they do it through their actions you know so that's really what's happening right now and that seems to be happening to every mother i talk to even on instagram you know all facing similar struggles um and it's heartbreaking it's heartbreaking to see your child who has barely been on earth for a couple of years going through this kind of stress and anxiety it's it's definitely not normal you know absolutely varkar chaulani she's a clinical psychologist doctor why don't you tell us a little about how this can be handled amongst kids so this is a common consensus i'm picking up two mothers like from simone and many other mothers that i've been speaking to over the past one week saying you know sometimes my child is getting very volatile emotionally or getting aggressive or there is some sort of behavioral regression uh these are things that did not exist pre-locked down they were out and about they were going through their normal lives probably they were but in few and far between kids but this is now becoming more prominent how does one deal with kids who are showing these symptoms yeah thank you chaiti for having me on i think a very important uh kind of a karma for children today is the presence of a parent and when i say presence i mean an active presence in the child's life what has happened is because work from home we all hold up in our respective rooms with our respective laptops with our gadgets we are constantly cued on online and the child using simon's example a toddler doesn't have the ability to be queued on on the phone or on the laptop or an ipad pad the way we have so i think the first thing that we as parents need to do is quality parenting which means sitting with the child holding the child explaining to the child hugging cuddling kissing reassuring the child that there is at least one person available for him or her what has also happened in the past before the pandemic hit i did see a lot of us outsourcing our parenting so the children would be sent to classes the children would be sent to play dates the children would be sent and there would be real no emotional attachment and interpersonal connect between parent and the family members with the child so what has happened suddenly it's 24 7 with the kids the kids haven't really gotten used to us we haven't really gotten used to them and this gap the emotional gap of reassurance look we are all scared as adults we are also facing our own anxieties and it's palpable the environment is a kind of you know one of doom gloom and there are people who unfortunately lost jobs so there's financial angst it's a whole tragic uh condition in these last couple of months or actually more than a couple of months in this last year so a reassuring parent is a very important factor for an anxious child and what simon described as tantrums is nothing but what we call agitated anxiety where it is demonstrated as aggression but it's actually real fear and what does it only teach us therefore that as mature adults it is our responsibility to be available not really physically to be available available for your uh children is the takeaway i'm picking up from dr varkar cholani be there for them uh ensure that you're emotionally available as well validate their feelings too and i'm going to come back to you warka on how one can really help children with therapy too but first i want to go straight across to dr sameer parikh and i was speaking to him uh just a couple of days ago and dr parikh was of a very strong opinion that it is the parents of young children who need therapy more than the children themselves dr parikh i'm very very uh curious to know more about this part as well now see let's understand this we are in an absolutely unprepared unprecedented situation worldwide you me parents teachers children nobody has been trained we've been you know taken aback so we are all struggling to find our ways i still believe children probably have dealt with this far better than most other populations but having said that what happens to a young child you know pre-primary primary what they need is stimulation they need consistent constant stimulation and a conducive comfortable environment well let's also accept that we also have our limitations yeah no patients have their limitations work from home is a challenge there are various things which have changed suddenly we are all adapted into it while we adapt to it a parent is obviously trying their best they just need to continue to also accept the fact that in these situations children will have a little more of tantrums a little bit more of aggression because it's more like you know that that bottled up not being able to do things not being able to have the kind of fun the children like that comes out in various behaviors yeah and be very clear these are transient experiences especially for young children if the environment the milieu of the home is going to absorb this and we as parents don't let our anxieties which are natural and a lot there not to reflect on them and stimulate them play board games music movement lots of physical activity giving them more space for rule breaking also giving them more space for their tantrums also which is fine and at this time whatever makes the child more comfortable and happy prioritize over everything else than any mental illness because you mentioned that i have to say this the other day dr samir just turned around and told me uh that you know when your kids in a locked town are being a little difficult allow them to be do not be very strict to which i was very very surprised so dr parikh what was that do you tell of the parents who are listening in do they have to be less strict with their kids can the kids have all the ice creams and the chocolates in the world possible it's gonna be so happy for the kids to hear this within the framework of keeping safety and all covered appropriate behavior uh our only goal needs to be the children should be enjoying children should be having a blast we need to make children happy that's the best thing we can do forget for a time other academics forget for a time other aspects just stimulate and that's why i'm again saying physical activity music creative arts board games lots of time more importantly lots of space to break a few rules here and there and like all people like me have been saying for the past several years the doors do not stop parenting forget them right now there's only one do of parenting keep the child happy whatever it takes simone do you agree just keep the child happy is what dr parikh is saying what have you noticed in your parenting which is different in the lockdown than pre-lockdown simone you know what um i dr parekh i uh thank you for sharing that i actually have noticed that when i am taking household objects and creating like an obstacle track for the children and doing things that keep them physically occupied the tantrums definitely decrease uh you know the happiness and the ability to counter see so yes when i do focus on music and when i do focus on um you know physical activities with the children which unfortunately of course i as a working mom i can't do through the day but i definitely do a lot that time to them um i do see an absolute change you know they are so engrossed they love all of it and it definitely does make a difference um so yes i absolutely absolutely agree and i'm going to try and take back everything i've heard from both of you and implement it more and more every day i want to take this across to dr varkachelani as well dr varka are you increasingly seeing more parents speak up and come for therapy as well because here the parents also somewhere require therapy it is not just the kids but the parents help seeking behavior that matters a lot because somewhere uh they are increasingly passing on their anxieties whether it is financial emotional or whatever is going on around them on to their kids and that's a matter of bigger concern dr chulani oh yes absolutely and we must understand uh that these are trying circumstances so uh an emotionally equipped individual will obviously be a much much a more competent uh parent and i've always looked at a parent in two ways a parent is also a noun and a parent is also a verb okay when i actively parent okay i am actively participating in the process of immersive active engagement with the child which i think is extremely important as simon just mentioned when she is able to devote some time to them being actively engaged with them they are more reassured please understand at the end of the day a child is a child and these last year has unfortunately made us believe that the child has to also grow up and think in similar ways as we think they don't they are still cognitively in a certain stage of development and therefore it is up to us as parents who are hopefully more sensible mature and are able to cope with our own challenges so that we don't use our children as in a way our sounding boats so definitely i do believe that it is important for parents to heal themselves first to try and become problem solvers to manage to cope with all the distress that is unfortunately maybe surrounding them at ease with themselves it makes parenting much much much more easier and more importantly actually it's a beautiful distraction because it takes us away from the real day-to-day problems because children can be so beautifully loving they can be extremely endearing they can really take away our pain that all of us seem to be going through at this time right dr parrik just a quick word from you on uh the atmosphere at homes does that matter a lot because with the lockdown uh you know certain households are emotionally very highly strung i mean so many parents are going through so much financially emotionally they're fighting with each other how does that augur down on children and what would your advice be to parents at this point of time to maintain some level of sanity within themselves so the kids stop getting disturbed by what is happening between the two parents and at that young age of say simone's kids or other kids they probably do not even understand what is happening i think it starts from understanding that we are all humans we will all have our ups and downs and we will not get 100 result and we'll have our own failures as well as parents as well because you might have a very very bad day at work and it will reflect on you what we try to do right now or what we all need to do is all of us need to bring as much calmness in the environment where children are that we can it's a single-minded goal the children should be as happy as they can be rules and regulations don't matter right now children being comfortable enjoying and happy is what matters you may have little time and i understand that whatever time you have use that time to the maximum from creative and physical activities these are also time for storytelling these are also time to go back to our roots get them a lot more connected with their grandparents and uncles and aunts because this is going to build their future you know the punch tantra the rama that's a lot of opportunity for all of us to use teaching moments you know help children develop values both social and cognitive yeah and all of this is an opportunity as well but remember we are humans you will snap occasionally because you are a human but at the same time don't push children for more don't expect the best behavior that you would have wanted and if they are throwing a tantrum see that also a form of play right now by them an expression and let it be i think that's what you need to do let children be just right let them think that this is an extended vacation where they are here to have fun okay i have very little time left on the broadcast but i just want to take this across to simone simone when your child was acting up uh did you know what did you do differently to ensure that the child feels better because you're such a big uh vociferous advocate for mental health to simone you know uh chinese he actually uh 14 days approximately precise my nanny tested positive before and what that did is it caused obviously a lot of anxiety for us as fell because she had slept with the kids the night before and all of that plus the children are very very attached to her now we had to isolate her and the children were looking for her everywhere and obviously they didn't understand what was going on they didn't understand why their parents were so stressed and um at that very point um husband and i actually sat down and we realized that you know what right now is the time for us to be mindful it's not about what we can do for the child right now it's first about what we need to do for ourselves because if we are going to freak out the kids are gonna freak out and and i'm pretty aware of that um and so i think it all starts with self when it comes to parents um and and i know that i mean it's easier said than done because when you're caught in that moment you know you're human and you kind of lose it sometimes or you get angry a bit upset but i think to just be mindful at all times um is key i i so i think really right now um as both the doctors so rightfully said it's so important for us as parents to be focusing on ourselves instead of putting all that pressure and focus onto the child right um so i think focus so the focus has to be inwards uh to towards parents and that's the big takeaway that is coming out of this discussion dr varka on a very very separate note a lot of parents have the tendency to just give their kids iphones and ipads and put the tv on and say you know what just sit in front of the tv please do not bother me because i'm working i'm working from home so they're just cooped up in one bedroom watching tv all day what do you have to say about screen time when it comes to these young children at formative years of their existence i do believe that we are headed towards a very alienated isolated schizoid generation this last year where everybody has only been attached to their digital screens has tremendously reduced the ability to form and develop interpersonal connects and i'm worried i'm worried about these kids who when they go out into the world hopefully when the pandemic ends and real life kind of gets back to normal will they have the social skills i'm not so sure so therefore participative parenting engaging so a lit a little different uh you know in the foreign world as compared to india is that india relies a lot on house health in the in the foreign countries in the western world children are participative in the process of picking up their plates helping in the kitchen picking up the table folding the laundry etc etc so even though they look like chores i would recommend that every parent gives every child in his or her house something to contribute as a unit because right now we are all in it together and we have to see that if we can get our children to participate in household duties we'll actually kill two birds with one stone one we will teach them life skills which i think our indian kids terribly lack and two we will be uniting together and have fun in doing something which is otherwise quite mundane and quite regular so i i think i'm a bit worried about a schizoid generation evolving from this pandemic and hence it's very important to talk about the mental health when it comes to kids i appreciate all of you taking the time out and joining us on this broadcast today uh simone of course for talking about your ordeal about the impairments you face with kids and giving the viewers tips as a mother dr varchar chalani about uh really going out there and showing the way to most parents as to how to manage their kids and dr sameer parikh who also by the way runs one of the largest mental health mentorship programs to come take the time out and speak about mental health in children on that note i just want to say one thing this is chaiti narula signing off but before that if your child is going through any of these symptoms do not hesitate seek therapy through qualified mental health care practitioners

CNA speaks to two Singaporeans who have recovered from the virus. Subscribe to ...,it's nearly a month since Singapore recorded its first kovat 19 case in this CNA exclusive links east with two Singaporean survivors from a local cluster who talk about their fight with the virus they are among the nearly 50 patients who have fully recovered so far employing day by day and salute you already be able to open eyes and talk to us this voice recording was made by loved ones of case 33 to cheer her on as she lay unconscious on a hospital bed linked to a local kovat 19 cluster from Life Church admissions and discharged earlier this week case 33 and her sister shed the eye experience exclusively with CNE it began around 3 weeks ago when as the 9 year old woman was admitted at first doctor said this hospital treated her for suspected pneumonia but her fever kept coming back in fact she started to become more and more breathless before being built into the ICU the doctor also had difficulty making her oxygenation good so they paralyze her with the medication to totally knock her out so that they can take over her own work of breathing hoping that that can rest her lung on February the 7th she was finally diagnosed with cook at 19 I was very stunned because I thought the lady who was no but they were pretty sure the who they was quite a madness because soon because of the sensitivity of this issue very student a lot of people called me from the authorities starting from first hospital fighting to save her life doctors gave case 33 medications typically used to treat HIV in the hopes that that would work by this time many her family and friends had also been quarantined still they rally around her a church friend sent a portable speaker to play Christian wounds by her bedside when I started to gain consciousness I can see that like there are nurses around me I have a chip connected to my mouth something that actually made me feel more comfortable is that there's actually teams playing at the background that actually give me a bit more comfort she was eventually voter of the ICU measure made a full recovery also in the same cluster is case 38 for her she had a different experience with the infection at her worst breeding became a troll but what was most challenging was the isolation in this ward doctors had to mostly speak to her through the phone even her temperature was monitored by an RFID tag while her food was sent through a secured hatch people joke about being on a spender trend on a island it does few that we I think the during this time when I had a sense of loneliness he was my faith that sustained me it was also how she cooked when some upset of her as they had to be quarantined but there were also other inspiring moments throughout the whole isolation one of the most amazing and beautiful thing that I took of it was really seem love in action I don't love in action from friends who are quarantine and how they encouraged me through messaging and I saw a low connection through the medical team how even the way the MOH officer spoke to me these women who survived the battle with the DDC there is hope if you are sick because of coroner virus I think you are the most important patient in Singapore right now and it is didn't kill my sister this tool will come to pass we have survived us today we are in the process of surviving commit 19 as well ,True,True,False,False

the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) talked about the costs of Covid-19 inpatient medical bills in Singapore, being on track to ...",good afternoon everyone welcome to the multi-ministerial task force press conference on our panel today we have minister for health mr ghan kim yong minister for education mr laurence wong director for medical services professor kenneth mark are some ground rules before the press conference begins contents of the press conference are strictly embargoed until after the end of the conference i will be announcing the exact time later for the embargo to be lifted please do not take screenshots or record this session we will disseminate press materials video footage and photographs to you separately if you wish to ask a question later please use the raised hand function on zoom may i now invite the ministers to begin with a few words ministers please thank you good afternoon in recent weeks the number of new cases in the community has remained low among our linked community cases about half were close contacts of confirmed cases and had already been quarantined the rest were detected through our and proactive screening or picked up from our enhanced testing of individuals with acute respiratory infection or ari symptoms the number of unlinked cases in the community is of greater concern and it has also remained low on the dormitories front we are either final stages of clearing the dormitories and testing the workers who have been isolated the case count will likely remain quite volatile in the coming days before tapering down thereafter as we complete the clearance exercise elsewhere in the world the pandemic continues to accelerate in many countries and regions some which manage to control an initial wave are now facing a resurgence of cases in asia they have been worrying uptick in some areas including hong kong india japan and vietnam many singaporeans are understandably concerned about imported cases indeed we are keeping a very close watch but but keeping our borders sealed is not a sustainable strategy as many countries have also come to realize we have therefore taken a cautious approach to facilitate the return of singaporeans permanent residents and work past holders who are employed in singapore as well as long-term past holders to mitigate the risk of importation of cases we impose stay home notices on travelers upon their arrival in singapore and test them before the end of their shn all of our recent imported cases so far have been isolated or placed on shn the risk of transmission to the community therefore continues to be very low but we will continue to monitor the imported cases very closely as well as the global situation and adjust and update our border measures accordingly as we gradually allow essential travel through the various schemes we have reviewed our charging policy for kobe 19 treatment for travelers currently the government bears the cost of inpatient medical bills for singaporeans prs and long-term pass holders who require treatment for kobit 19 at our public healthcare institutions except those who breach our travel advisories from 7 august all outbound singaporeans prs and long-term pass holders who travel abroad under the permitted travel arrangement such as that under the bilateral arrangements with malaysia and china will be able to tap on the regular healthcare financing arrangements for their inpatient medical bills should they have onset of symptoms within 14 days of their return to singapore and require hospital admission for suspected kovit-19 infection this means that singaporeans and prs will be eligible for government subsidies and medishield life integrated shield plan coverage and long-term pass holders may tap on their prevailing financing arrangements such as the foreign worker insurance but any remaining co-payment will continue to be paid by the patient those who are not under the permitted travel arrangements and instead travel in breach of the travel advisories will continue to pay for their covet 19 inpatient medical bills in full in addition short-term pass holders entering singapore under the permitted travel arrangements will remain responsible for their medical bills should they test positive for kobe 19 within 14 days of arrival in singapore while our community numbers have remained low we must continue to be vigilant many singaporeans are anxious to resume some of the activities but we must balance that with the risk of transmission learning from the experience of many countries that have seen a second wave or some even third wave after restrictions are lifted the multi-ministry task force has adopted a cautious approach towards easing of restrictions the same time we have heard from many singaporeans about the activities that you hope to resume and we understand why some of these activities are important and that is why we recently eased restrictions on two significant live events weddings and wake and funerals we recognize that these are key milestones in life that singaporeans hope to commemorate and that memories of these events will stay precious long after kobe 19 pandemic is over we will continue to assess the situation and allow the gradual resumption of other events including wedding receptions and some religious rights but on the whole most other events should continue to remain virtual for now these include large gatherings and festivities surrounding national and community occasions this does not mean that we can no longer celebrate these occasions but that we will need to find new ways to do so take this year's national day celebration for example singaporeans are a resourceful people and many have found new and creative ways to commemorate our nation's independence while adhering to the safe management measures with the right mindset and attitude we can adapt and make the best of the situation even if we need to continue with safe distancing measures on this note let me wish all singaporeans a happy national day and a healthy national day as we commemorate our 55th year of independence this weekend thank you very much now ask my director of medical services professor kenneth mark to give a quick update on today's medical situation thank you very much minister as of the 6th of august 2020 the ministry of health has preliminarily confirmed an additional 301 cases of kovin-19 infection in singapore and the vast majority continue to be work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories and based on our investigation so far there are four cases in the community of which three are singaporeans or permanent residents one is a work pass holder in addition there are four imported cases all of whom were tested while being on a stay home notice after their arrival in singapore from these four important cases there is no risk of spread to the community we continue to aggressively test in that final batch of dormitory residence and as minister has alluded to before we continue to be on track to clear all the dormitories in time uh less a few standalone blocks in dormitories that serve as quarantine facilities uh because the prevalence of cov19 infection in these geometry is uh varies and we are testing various doms over the next few days the numbers that arise and will be reported in our press releases every day will vary from day to day this volatility will continue for the next few days before it tapers down as we complete our dom testing as part of the dom clearance strategy overall the number of new cases and the committee has continued to decrease as minister has alluded to from an average of four cases per day in the week before to an average of two per day in the past week the number of unlinked cases in the community continues to decrease from an average of two cases per day in the week before to an average of one per day in the past week we continue to monitor these numbers but these numbers can only stay down with the cooperation of all of us in the community and as we come into a stage where we are in a celebratory mood for the celebration of national day we asked all singaporeans to maintain their discipline grant their mass continuing with their safe distancing measures and to do their bid to keep singapore safe during this time when covet 19 continues to be a concern we are still working through the details of the cases that we've just reported today and further updates will be shared via the moh press release that will be issued later tonight good evening we had earlier shared that the task force was aiming to complete the clearance of workers in the dormitories by the first week of august and i'm happy to report that the team has indeed been able to complete the testing of all workers in the dormitories and will do so by tomorrow seven of august so what remains are the workers who are in isolation right they have been cleared from the dormitories but they are remaining in isolation in quarantine facilities this final batch of workers who are in isolation will stay in isolation complete their isolation period and will be tested before they exit from their quarantine facilities and that's why as you've heard from the director of medical services you will still see volatile case numbers over the coming days perhaps over the next two weeks because as these workers complete their isolation and we subject them to a test we don't know how many will be testing positive or negative right it may be that very high numbers test negative and then we will have very few case counts but it may also be that quite a large number test positive and then on occasion you may see spikes in the cases but we expect that to continue only for the next two weeks because we are dealing with the final batch of workers who are in isolation thereafter we do expect the number of cases to taper down significantly because we would have cleared all the workers by then the other issue that we are dealing with is to try and expedite the process for these cleared or recovered workers to get back to work as soon as possible and we've shared before that we are working with all the contractors and employers engaging them very closely to start preparing now do not wait for the workers to be cleared start preparing now so that they can meet all the safety safe distancing safe management measures and can resume work as soon as possible so that work is in process we are continuing this engagement efforts with all the employers especially for the construction contractors and we are confident with this expedited processes that the vast majority of workers who are cleared or recovered will be able to resume work by the end of this month so we are not only clearing the workers in the dormitories and making sure that they are safe but we want them to get back to work as soon as possible and we do expect the vast majority to be able to do so by the end of this month which means that many construction activities and many construction projects should be able to resume soon finally i should add that just because we are we have covet cleared dormitories doesn't mean that we should assume these are permanently covet safe dormitories because we all know that the virus can flare up again and that's why we are putting in place safeguards particularly to ensure that all the workers in the dormitories will still be taking routine and regular tests once every 14 days so that process and that regime on top of all the safe management practices that are in place will continue and we will ensure and do our very best working with the employers and the contractors to make sure that construction activities that all of these activities that are of a higher risk nature will be done in a safer manner going forward in order to minimize the chances of large clusters forming in this sector again so we will do all we can to put in place these additional precautions at the same time for all of us in the community we again must not be complacent by about the second half of august as i said with the work dorm cases tailing off we should see the total number of cases in singapore coming down not just the cases in the community but the total number of new cases every day should come down significantly by end august but that is not reason that is not a reason for us to be complacent or to let our guard down we have seen the experiences everywhere in the world where even if there is a very low level of underlying transmission very low level um cryptic you know silent transmission uh happening and so long as there is a lapse in the community or people do not observe the safe management practices carefully these low levels of infection can suddenly flare up into large clusters anywhere anytime so we all just need to be mindful of this risk which still remains and we all have to do our part to be socially responsible and do every everything we can to comply with the safe distancing measures that are in place so we encourage everyone to um stay vigilant we know it's not easy because it has been a long fight for the past seven months we have been dealing with this virus but we are making good progress we are able to keep our community infection rates low and we can if we maintain that attitude that mindset and discipline we can continue to reopen and resume more activities in a safe manner and on that note let me join my colleague mr gun in wishing all singaporeans a very happy national day in advance thank you thank you ministers we will now begin the q a segment media agencies please remember to use the raise hand function on zoom if you would like to ask a question and a reminder to keep to one question please may we have the first question from timothy from straits times please speak after you have been unmuted thank you ministers dms now as a minister gone earlier mentioned important cases are concerned on many singaporeans minds so i'd like to ask why are returning malaysian workers only given seven days of stay home notice while we are not stopping travelers upon their arrival into singapore it seems like these two policies are a little inconsistent with one another given our understanding about the incubation period of the virus thank you thank you we adopt a risk management approach taking into account the assessment of risk profile of the source where travelers coming from in this case particularly malaysia we also take into account the uh mitigating measures that the other country in this case malaysia has put in place so we take a holistic assessment of the risk of travelers coming to singapore and on that on the basis of that risk we will then determine what are the precautionary measures that we need to put in place specifically on the estrogen period i'll ask that dms to explain on them from a professional point of view yes as far as the say home notice is concerned we have taken efforts originally to isolate people who come from other countries into singapore for fixed duration of of 14 days originally on the basis that this was the incubation period the maximum incubation period that the case of kovi-19 infection could have and then on the balance on that abundance of caution that was the period that we had defined we then adjusted our regime to include testing because of a concern that there would be asymptomatic but infected travelers are coming to singapore and this would allow us not to miss those individuals who are asymptomatic but still remain both infected and infectious despite finishing up the shn period we have since done several reviews we've noted for example that when it came to countries with visitors coming to singapore the majority of visitors who were symptomatic would in fact have their symptoms within five to six days of their entry into singapore while those were asymptomatic obviously would continue to need to be tested in this period of time and that allowed us then to think about considering a shortening of the duration of shn for countries where the original prevalence in that country was low therefore on the balance of risk that we assess the risk then of missing a traveler coming in despite a shortened sh and then manifesting with symptoms becomes even uh quite low in the in that setting of these countries where the prevalence is in fact lower than in singapore so we think on the balance of race we think we may be able to offer a shortened period of isolation uh notwithstanding the fact that we'll continue to test travelers who come out from the isolation period of shn and the seven days for these selected travelers would not be unreasonable however in countries where the prevalence rate of kobe 19 remains high we think on the balance of that risk we will still keep to 14 days for that category of travelers from those countries so it's on the balance of the risk assessment uh the number of anticipated cases coming in um that we then decided for selected countries we could then lower that sdg requirement to seven days thank you minister dms can we have the next question from sun kit from sao paulo good evening ministers and dms my question is really somewhat related to timothy's um just like to ask because with the upcoming implementation of the pca between singapore and malaysia we notice that there appears to be a difference in the treatment to malaysian citizens who are singapore pass holders and malaysian citizens who hold singapore pr status in terms of the number of days of shn and the number of required pcr tests you would like to find out the reason behind that and also whether there's any possibility for the cost of a pcr test to be reduced further in the near future i'll take the final question first and that's a issue concerning the cost of tests this is something that we will be reviewing on a regular basis not just for the cost of tests with regard to the singapore malaysia agreement arrangement but also the cost of tests in other settings as well at this point in time the cost would vary depending on which lab does it it roughly hovers around the 200 mark but as tests become more available as the labs find it in fact easier to offer the tests at a lower price point on the basis of optimizing the test protocols as the cost of test kits comes down because of availability of these tests i am confident that the current price point would not be a permanent one it will be continually reviewed and i look forward to an opportunity to announce in future that that cost will also come down and that would obviously benefit all visitors and travelers who require a testing either or as a pre-departure arrangement or an on arrival arrangement we did a look at the arrangement between single citizens permanent residents and other visitors in the part of the arrangements are differences in part also relate to whether or not these workers would be able to have controlled itineraries whether or not they the responsibility for this control drug itineraries could be enforced by companies and there are also other secondary arrangements considerations that have led to some differences that are present as we announce further details some of these distinctions would be explained as well thank you dms can you have the next question from cheryl from cna hi good evening um i just want to confirm that the middle asians entering singapore under the green lane agreements if they test positive they will be considered important cases and how are we going to mitigate the risks from this potential group thanks yes the malaysians who come into singapore and who developed an infection within 14 days and we believe that this is in part as a result travel would be regarded as important cases we do have various mitigating arrangements even in the setting of these green lane arrangements the itinerary for for these people coming in on these arrangements is strictly controlled the companies uh in fact sponsor them on these green lane arrangements they take on the responsibility to make sure that uh where they visit where they go there are fixed itineraries to allow to mitigate that risk of exposure and then of spread as well when they come back into singapore there are testing regimes allow us to pick up cases as they arise and then substantially quickly isolate them we think uh while there is obviously a risk with every visitor coming to singapore even under greenlee enrichment of of importation of kovit19 we think that risk is uh mitigated and we will be monitoring this situation quite closely we are working closely with our malaysian counterparts who themselves are uh putting in various measures to control covet-19 infection in their own country so uh rather than look at this as a unilateral arrangement in in singapore to manage covet 19 we should also see this as an opportunity for both countries to come together each of us managing and mitigating covet 19 spread in our own countries and as we open up our borders we would then be working cooperatively to keep the kovit 19 rates low in both our countries i should explain that the starting point actually is when we decide on this measures we have to look at the risk assessment in a holistic way first malaysians prevalence rate is significantly similar to singapore and in some cases lower than singapore's prevalence rate and therefore the risk of infection is quite similar to uh fellow singaporeans who are in singapore so therefore many of these measures that we have imposed are additional precaution so as to mitigate the potential risk just that we have even within singapore we have our safe distancing measures to continue to reduce the risk of local transmission and similarly as malaysians come over there are various measures put in place like a testing uh shn and so on these are additional measures that we want to put in place to further minimize the risk of transmission but the starting point is that we have to assess the risk level even in the source country itself for countries with a very high prevalence rate we are we will not be able to enter into such arrangements and we will have to have a lot more stringent requirements if there are national nationals to come back even for singaporeans or prs or long-term pass holders who need to return to singapore from these countries with high prevalence rates we will have to have additional precaution in place to allow them to return safely so is at the end it's a balance of risk and managing the risk profile of different source countries and different individuals and different profiles of visitors and we will tailor our measures accordingly thank you dms minister may we have the next question from philip from bloomberg please hi uh ministers i i wanted to just quickly ask just to clarify mr wong your point from earlier that you've said they have already indeed finished the testing it's done as of now um just wanted to clarify that real quick and and just regarding uh work from home arrangements uh for people like myself is there any a idea about when we might be able to return back to the offices or what you're advising now thank you um so on the completion of testing what we mean is that all of the workers in the dormitories have been tested but there are after testing a group of workers who still have to be isolated and after the isolation we still subject them to a further round of testing so so the clarification basically means we've completed the testing of all the workers in the dormitories but one final group remains in isolation in quarantine and that group in quarantine before they exit from quarantine we will still test them one more time and because we are testing them one final time we may pick up cases from this group and that's why we said that in the next two weeks or so um you know numbers may be volatile because depending on what we see from the final test results you may see a sudden spike we may see nothing we don't know it really depends uh and so the uh aside from that the rest of the workers have been we've cleared the dorms we've cleared the workers and um over the next few weeks for the majority of the workers including the ones even on you know still serving their last final stretch of quarantine we think that certainly around 90 percent of workers in the dormitories would be able to get back to work by the end of this month right that's what we expect to be able to achieve working together with the employers and contractors on the question of what was the other question ah work from home we we would like to encourage employers certainly to continue to continue with work from home as the default arrangement the current rules are quite um basically uh you know to require that employers can only have their employees come back to the office if there is a demonstrable need to do so particularly requiring specialized equipment we indeed have heard appeals from both employers and as well as from individuals some employers say that they would like more flexibility and some individuals too say that while working from home is good in fact they are more productive if they are able to get back at the workplace even if there is no need for specialized equipment and for a whole range of reasons sometimes they say that the in the home environment is not so conducive and perhaps in the workplace with the you know when you are together with your colleagues you can be more productive as well so we've received these appeals we are still studying the matter and to see if there may be some change or some modification to the work from home requirement that's something that we are reviewing but i should say that even if we were to allow some modification or adjustments we would still like to see as far as possible as far as possible um a high degree of people working from home because i think that helps to on on many fronts right it helps to reduce um congestion at the public transport it helps to reduce the number of people coming together at the work environment which can be a source of risk so we still think that having a high level of commuting and working from home is desirable for quite some time but having heard the feedback we are in the process of reviewing these rules to add to mr wong's reply to philip's question the first question as well at this time we are continuing to finish up our testing for the workers in the main dormitories and we are still on track to be able to complete that by the end of tomorrow but the results from those tests may take a few days before they come out and therefore the subsequent reports we have for the next few days after the 7th of august may still reflect that testing that took place for workers in the dormitories we will continue also to be testing workers that finish their period of isolation in quarantine in those quarantine facilities and uh and that testing is necessary to assure us that they are safe to return into the general community of workers in the main dormitories so that period of testing may continue well after the 7th of august and when we refer to the possibility of a high numbers still being reported it's on the basis of testing those remaining workers in those quarantine facilities but we remain committed to finishing up our testing of the workers in the main dormitories we believe that we will be able to complete that by the end of tomorrow and that would be based on the plans we have we're on track in this regard just to uh add on hopefully not add on to the confusion and just add on to clarify i think even today there are workers who are already in the quarantine facilities because they were close contacts of confirmed cases previously so they will not be finishing they are quarantined by tomorrow's this ongoing process and if you would appreciate that these are the workers that have been in contact with confirmed cases and therefore they are in a way higher risk of exposure and higher risk of being tested positive and as we test them when they finish the quarantine first period we are likely to pick up more cases because these are basically workers who have been exposed to positive cases as to how many it's very difficult to to to predict because it depends on the extent of exposure and depends on whether they are positive or not and in some days it may go up because we just happened that this batch of workers who are finishing their quarantine period happen to have a high prevalence rate and some days may be very low because these workers are generally uninfected so you may see volatility in the numbers so it's not a steady state number so just bear in mind that most of this number will come from the quarantine facilities and we will try to explain as we report these numbers so as to give the context of how these numbers arise thank you ministers dms may we have the next question now from evgeny from itatas thank you good evening now many countries are on alert or the second way for of kovids because of upcoming autumn and winter which will be seasons of flu uh i would like to ask is there any research has been conducted in singapore about how the spread of khalid can be dependent on these seasons thank you i asked dms to talk about the scientific aspect but singapore as you know don't really have a season i think kobe 19 as we have seen over the last six months has been here and continue to be here i don't think the season has a lot of effect on singapore in other countries perhaps maybe dms can elaborate further yes in the early days of this outbreak you may remember in january february there were experts who were predicting that kovi 19 could die off by this period of time because it was coming into the warmer months of the year that was a theory that had quite a bit of attraction for some there was some work that people had done on the basis of previous other viral infections but we haven't seen this bearing out as you know we've got large outbreaks occurring in different countries both in the northern and southern hemispheres so you have different extremes of the seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres and we do have large outbreaks occurring in in both hemispheres so i i think at this point in time most of us in the public health community in the infectious disease committee are not too fixated about whether or not the seasons have an impact on the the prevalence the spread of covet 19. we continue to emphasize the need to disrupt potential chains of transmission uh based on our understanding of how cov19 spreads early detection is important getting the community in any country in any society to cooperate in making sure that they reduce that risk of transmission is important and we'll continue to work at this um if certainly uh the seasons play a role and if it turns out that in fact this is something that leads to a lower uh incidence of kovit 19 in the future would be happy with that but i think at this point in time the evidence does not support a very strong seasonal effect on kovit 19. but i should add that for singapore i think it's better for us to focus on safe distancing measures we can't bank on the weather to help us and if you look back during our circuit breaker period the number of cases went down to very low levels almost zero and as we open up and we see a number of cases picking up and fortunately we are still keeping it at a low number and this is by to a large extent uh we must thank singaporeans for cooperating with us helping us doing their part in maintaining the safe distancing measures and as we move further into a phase two some of the measures are being relaxed including some of the events that we mentioned earlier and we hope singaporeans will continue to exercise common sense to exercise safe distancing measures uh as they didn't fit i think this will help and we talk about back to work we'll talk about work from home we are reviewing but it is still important for us to bear in mind that we should in any case reduce and minimize the number of contacts we have every day and minimize the duration of the contacts we have with people every day this will help us to reduce the risk of transmission overall i think that's the most important part about safe distancing measures thank you minister dms can we have painting from today to ask a question uh yes hi hi ministers uh so my question is about the number of uh recent suicide and attempted suicide incidents involving workers living in dormitories right um so my questions uh are what uh you know what is the mts assessment of the anxiety and unhappiness of workers especially those in the more um badly affected uh dorms and how had their welfare been looked after mentally and also whether uh is a mental health increasingly an area that the mtf is looking into by formulating a more comprehensive plan to address these budding issues thank you thank you very much for the question we're indeed concerned about the fact that our migrant workers have been accommodated in in facilities uh under vetted regimes they have not been allowed to come out of the dormitories into the community freely and that prolonged period of isolation will obviously have a potential adverse effects on any individual not just the micro workers but anyone who in fact has to be cooped up in isolation with very limited opportunities for social interaction so this is a concern for us the in inter-agency taskforce working with mom and various private stakeholders partners have in fact been looking at how to support the welfare of these migrant workers in a variety of different ways they've taken pains to help the migrant workers to celebrate holidays to make their stay within the lockdown dormitories as meaningful as is possible albeit within the the lockdown regime that they are in they've also offered help through a variety of ways with an opportunity for them to call in hotlines for help there are staff that come down and encourage workers to step forward if necessary for counselling so mental health has been a concern for that particular task force uh for quite a while ever since they started work in the dormitories we continue to work on this piece and they have the task force has a work group looking very specifically at mental health issues and they have involved various partners across many domains including counselors social workers psychiatrists psychologists uh to see how to better improve the support that can be provided to men to migrant workers in this regard we are aware also of incidents of self-harm or attempted self-harm through suicide uh in uh some of the individuals in the dormitories this is a cause of concern and uh task force continues to look at it to see how to reach out to support migrant workers who have needs that have to be addressed in this regard and they're looking at ways to to reach out and support them further this continues to be a work in progress so i do not pretend that that work is completed that we have a very comprehensive system of support but the task force is committed to making sure that the mental health needs of the migrant workers are looked into supported not just now but as a sustainable framework that would continue in the dormitories even after the outbreak is comes under control within the dormitories thank you dms can we have the next question from refund from tnp please hi thank you ministers uh dms i think uh dms comments just segues nicely into my question which is i wanted to find out what is the new normal for the dorms after they have been cleared so i'm wondering if there's another outbreak of infections in the partner dorm what happens how long will the fast teams be stationed there in the long term i mean why do you see that happening so the as we highlighted just now um the worksite the housing arrangements are likely to be different we want there is a process of housing the workers differently so that um instead of having workers from one employer dispersed across different blocks we're trying to consolidate them together for better management that's one secondly we are looking at you know now a whole range of safe management practices within the dorms and in the worksites in the transportation so that all of this can be done safely and then thirdly we have routine testing of the workers once every 14 days if through routine testing we pick up one case the intention is to go in very quickly isolate the workers perhaps within the room or perhaps within the entire floor even so that the you can pull out the workers who are at risk without having to you know have all of the workers in the block or potentially even in the entire dormitory um subject to a lockdown again right so the idea of a routine and regular testing is to be able to pick up early together with other other methods like you know detecting of a waste water so we have a range of surveillance surveillance methods that allow us to do early detection when we spot the case we again do the contact tracing potentially all the roommates within the room all the everyone in the floor perhaps if they have come into contact with one another we pull them aside into quarantine and then we do a sweep test all the workers and if they are safe they can continue to work right so that's the the the so-called protocols that the new protocols that we will put in place um to reduce the risk of large clusters uh forming in the dormitories again and and with all these new measures we hope we can preempt we can identify early and we can allow construction work in particular to resume safely without this risk of large clusters forming we're also discussing with mom very closely on how to continue to support migrant workers their health and their welfare even after we bring the kofi 19 outbreak in the dormitories under control many of the best practices that we have put in place now are likely to continue we continue to have discussions about how best to keep these these innovations and measures in place in a sustainable way so we innovated telemedicine for many of the dormitories this is likely to continue as is tele monitoring using telecos and various fighter science monitoring devices that we had deployed into the dormitories we will be looking towards establishing more long-term medical facilities dedicated to supporting the health of american workers these may include a combination of medical posts or medical centers either on site or close by to the dormitories to provide some for regional support they would be tasked not just to look after acute needs for example respiratory infections but once they have a more long-term presence they will be able to do much more than what we are doing now and that may include looking after the long-term chronic disease needs for american workers and also their mental health support so this would be some of the areas we're looking at jointly with the ministry of manpower and we look towards creating a more sustainable structure to provide the support to safeguard the health and welfare for these migrant workers even after the dormitory operations are complete i think it's it's important to bear in mind that we are not to look at individual measures in its own from its own perspective because it is all the measures putting together that will help to mitigate the risk of transmission in particular safe distancing is very crucial plays a very crucial part even if we are able to keep the dorms clear you have to bear in mind that we have to also make sure that the workplace is safe otherwise they infect each other in the workplace and bring back to the dom then we have another outbreak again it's quite similar to the household cases that we see from time to time including the tampanes street 111 case where we see many members in the household gets infected that's because the nature of a household interaction within the same household and it is not possible for us to tell the household members who say you know please stay away from one another because we don't know which household is infected in the beginning and we can't stop every member from interacting with one another so household cases are difficult to prevent once there's a case in the household there's a risk to the rest of the household members but what is important therefore is to prevent the case from happening in the household in the first place and that is so safe distancing in the community then if you are able to exercise safe distance in the community reduce the risk of infection in the community then the risk of bringing back an infection to the household will be significantly reduced then the household infection cases will as a result be reduced so we have to look at the all the whole package of measures in its totality and by working all these measures working together that will be able to effectively reduce the risk of transmission so sometimes we may need to allow some of the measures to be relaxed to be rolled back like a working from home and so on we we will need to review to make sure that you continue to be sustainable and effective and productive but even as we relax some of the rules we need to continue to be tight on the other rules in fact in some areas we may need to tighten further some of the rules so that overall the wrist balance is maintained so as to keep the risk of transmission as low as possible in the community so as to reduce a number of infection and reduce the risk of clusters forming thank you ministers dms we have time now for the last three questions can john from roy's reuters ask your question please uh thank you ministers and dms um i just wanted to to follow up on the the border uh issue and reopening borders um i'm just trying to get a sense of what the the game plan for for singapore is here i mean would you hope that if cases drop as expected in the community and you clear the dormitories that you would at one stage become virus free or is that not feasible given your commitment to reopen the borders thank you um i don't think that we are likely to be able to achieve a status of being completely virus free or you know even eradicating the virus completely the you know even after the circuit breaker you know reducing activities to a very large degree we continue to see new cases right um and you know on the daily you know you you may have zero one but there was still underlying transmission today our community infection rate is very low and we have a whole host of uh um you know surveillance uh mechanisms in place now because anyone who has a cough and cold acute respiratory illness you go to see a doctor at first presentation we already test the person we are testing waste water we are putting in all these mechanisms in place but we still think today that there is some underlying rate of infection it's very very low but it is there and it's quite likely that this was the case in many other countries where you saw a resurgence of cases many other places where you saw very low case counts on a daily basis for many many days or even weeks sometimes zero for many days and then suddenly a thing spikes up and the reason why there is a resurgence is because that very low underlying infection rate uh hit and reached a spot where safe management practices were not complied with it might have been a labs it might have been somebody being careless and that particular labs or that particular incident ended up in you know being a super spreader person or super spreader event then that one lapse not only impacts one or two people it ends up with a large cluster that's how we see resurgence happening elsewhere so i think for us in singapore we are quite realistic that it may not be possible to get to a virus free status it may not be possible to eradicate the virus but the key is to learn how to live with covid19 it will be with us for quite some time and we have to adjust our way of life we have to put in place new measures to manage through this period recognizing that the virus is with us but it doesn't mean that we stop living you know or we all live in perpetual circuit breaker it's not possible right so we have to resume our activities we have to get on with life but we do so in a different way we find new ways of celebration as was it just now for national day we find new ways of interacting with one another and even if we have to resume travel we do so in a way that's safe with all the necessary safety measures be it testing or shn so that's how we uh see the you know this this phase and we are likely to be in this phase for quite some time and as long as we are able to put in place the necessary measures as long as singaporeans and residents of singapore comply with the safe distancing measures we think we can progressively resume more activities while keeping the infection under control that's our objective i think several weeks ago i explained that as we begin to embark on phase two we do expect number of cases to go up i'm referring to the community cases to start to go up because as you have more interaction more uh encounters more context you're likely to have more transmission so far we have been able to keep the number low but the risk remains there the key objective really is not to totally eradicate the virus because it's not possible until maybe you have a vaccine so you will continue to see these cases but the key really is to prevent these cases to become a cluster and to prevent a cluster become becoming a big cluster or multiple cluster and the strategy is really to find effective ways to terminate the transmission even after cases emerge so therefore over the last few weeks you see sometimes we have a handful of cases sometimes we have ten cases in the community but we need to move very quickly to slow down or to even truncate the transmission as fast as possible so our ai testing is very important now we go as minister wong mentioned we try to test them on the first day they turn up in our doctors and therefore we want to take this opportunity to also remind singaporeans to please go and see a doctor when you are not well it doesn't matter when you feel that oh it's a small matter it doesn't i will just take two panadol maybe slip it off i'll be all right so please go and see a doctor have you tested so that we are able to arrest the transmission at the early stage this will prevent from the one case to become many cases and to form a cluster and to eventually become many clusters so if we are able to do that then we will be able to keep the number of cases low in the community and that will allow us to continue to see how we can ease the restrictions to allow more activities to resume more interaction to happen while continuing to exercise safe distancing so i think the key is not really to aim for zero case and that will many months to come until vaccine is available the key is to keep the numbers small and keep the transmission short if there are cases that occur try to stop it as early as possible and as quickly as possible thank you ministers can we have the next question from claudia from bt hi good evening so my question is regarding the impact on the property sector so i mean it made the government specific for the property sector um in areas such as project completion and this was in response to the covenant 19 pandemic sorry mentioned earlier that the task force hi claudia sorry to interrupt could you start your question again because we lost as part of your question earlier thank you sure so my question is regarding the impact on the property sector so in may the government announced much reprieve for the property sector and this was in areas such as project completion um and it was introduced in response to the impact of covert 19 and when it's so long just now you mentioned that the task force is confident that the majority of workers sorry claudia hey sorry to interrupt i have to ask you to repeat again please oh just the last part okay um yeah so you mentioned that um the majority of workers can resume work by the end of this month but even then it would still take some time for the resumption of what because of the new safety measures and also the supply chain disruptions so with the government consider a longer than six month reprieve for the developers and also the contractors i will answer even though i'm no longer in mnd but basically the earlier extension of the project completion period and the period for developers to sell their properties already was quite generous taking into account the fact that we recognized even at that time that it would take some time for the construction sector to resume activities and so we had allowed for some buffer at that stage obviously we will have to continue to monitor the situation going forward the we do expect as we said just now most of the activities to resume quite soon majority of workers will be able to do so by the end of this month and we do expect most projects to get going this month and certainly by next month um you know the almost all of the projects should be able to get going by then but um we will continue the government agencies bca mnd will continue to monitor the progress and and then continue to discuss with stakeholders in the built environment sector to see if this or any other measures might be necessary to help the industry progress along and you know overcome this particularly difficult period so i'm sure the agencies are all very mindful that this is a very difficult period for contractors for developers and they will continue to engage them closely to see what we can do to work with the private sector and overcome this particular hump beyond this i think once projects get going once the activities get going we will need to help the contractors get used to the new normal of what construction activities are like it there will be more measures in place more protocols there will be more testing of the workers so it will be a completely different environment for the entire sector so we are quite mindful that it really goes beyond just the resumption of activity the entire sector has to transform itself restructure transform itself be more productive and this is an all i think it's a long journey that um the government agencies are is they are committed to working closely with the private sector to bring this about thank you minister we will now take the final question can we have the final question from nicholas from yahoo all right uh so i would want to follow on uh payton's question just now so uh does given in life especially in since then the dawns are going to be clear by tomorrow will the you have to repeat sorry just give us a moment could you repeat your question please nicholas so on to the follow-up on painting's question with regard to the mental health of the workers and what has been done for them so well the mta considered losing some of the restrictions on their movements especially a lot of the fact that the dorms will be cleared by tomorrow for example letting the healthy workers go in batches for recreation or to socialize a little bit and at what point do you think the workers will be allowed to move about freely again those are certainly things that we are very mindful of and we are monitoring very carefully even when the workers are within the dormitories now it's not as though there is no provision for them uh to come down have some you know opportunity to go out of their rooms uh we already provide for that but they are still confined within the premises that they are in the dormitories the question of whether or not they will be allowed to go beyond that i think that's something that we are considering very carefully and then you know when we talk about allowing them rest days uh where do they go beyond the outside of the dormitories that's also something that we are studying very carefully um we will have to as i mentioned earlier monitor the situation because after clearing such a high viral load environment where the dormitory clusters are after clearing through that we often find that there are residual cases even continuing for weeks remember this was the case for the workers construction workers in the community right we had tested them we had cleared them but even as we con subject them to regular testing we still see quite a number of workers testing positive despite them serving two terms to uh 28 days of isolation 28 days nearly one month but after that when we test them we still pick up positive cases so the reality is that there have been large clusters amongst migrant workers in the dormitories we have cleared them they are resuming work but we need to monitor the situation we need to put them through a routine and regular testing for a while more to be assured that we are indeed clear uh clearing uh and testing every worker and that they are indeed free from the virus at some point certainly then we will also look at you know how if as we have assurance that the testing process is done and the workers are free from the virus we will also look at expanding um you know the the provision for them to go out be it to recreational centers or to the community at large on the rest days so those are considerations that we do have in mind and we will plan and stage that step by step to ensure that this is done in a safe manner for the workers themselves and also for the community at large thank you ministers dms for your time and thank you everyone for joining us today ,True,True,False,False

A counselling hotline by ...,an interagency government group has urged employers to support the mental health of their workers during the covert 19 pandemic it added the disruptions and changes in work arrangements may result in workers feeling anxious socially isolated and stressed and to mitigate this it suggests that employers keep their workers updated about their salary and leave arrangements during the suspension of work the group also advises supervisors to check in with the staff on a weekly basis through videoconferencing or phone calls it suggests more flexible work schedules and regular breaks for parents of children in order to ensure that they can balance both duties effectively now a list of external counseling services is also available for employees now even as the authorities urge employers to pay more attention to their staffs mental health there could be a shortfall in the number of clinics or organizations that can provide such help psychological services are not listed as essential during the circuit breaker period and only some have been allowed to continue having patients in person the rest may continue but digitally a counseling hotline by the Singapore Association for mental health has seen 50 percent more cost in the last two months than the usual it says most involved stress and anxiety caused by financial uncertainty as well as fear have been infected by covert 19 as of the middle of this month those who needed more in-depth help were able to visit only 66 psychological service providers these had the exemptions request approved by the authorities all those who have been rejected are able to hold their clients and that can totally help or kind of lines down weight you know a few weeks who knows right to be able to be seen again some of these clients who are unstable or risky yourself or towards others and also will be answerable for how we help in a sense where some of their diagnosis could be very difficult to assess over screen so for example either having a panic attack you know / screening I wouldn't be able to be there to to ground them okay save even as concerns mount over the mental health effects of the coronavirus a psychologist worries about those not in this category like those with developmental disorders such as autism some of them cannot actually sit there and actually talk to me just over the screen as well so it's just like a few days back when I had when I did one of the teleconference with them and the client actually just showed me a blank blank wall he is listening and talking to me but he just can't face it so without all the nonverbals I just can't observe that at all the Health Ministry says the emphasis on tele consultation is down to heightened safe distancing measures and is meant to reduce the risk of kovat 19 infections but in allowing exemptions it says it recognizes that such consults may not be appropriate for all types of conditions the authorities have also published resources to help type people through difficult times these include virtual charts and help lines meant by the Institute of Mental Health and other welfare organizations nominated MP Anthea all who has championed mental health issues in Parliament says more needs to be done especially if new disorders are diagnosed and existing ones are aggravated psychological treatments should be part of essential services and then mo age could issue a very clear and stream advisory to all the psychology psychologists and psychological practices to exercise their professional judgment if a client or a case warrants a face-to-face consultation so by doing so I feel we are then first and foremost recognizing that mental health is a priority ,True,False,True,False

constraints but the speed of vaccinations should pick up once there are adequate continuous supplies of approved vaccines [Music] a study has found that women were less satisfied with their marriages during and after the circuit breaker i can relate because you know this could be due to you know they had to take on more right when it comes to you know their fair share of housework on top of other stresses that the pandemic has brought to daily life the study by the lee kuan yew school of public policy at nus examined the roles men and women played when it came to child care and housework during the pandemic last year it also looked at the difference in the time men and women spent on such tasks 290 married women who have at least one child each were part of the study the gender gap in terms of who does the household chores rose during the circuit breaker now let's take a look before that period women spend an average of 68 minutes a day on chores while men spent 43 minutes a day during the circuit breaker this rose to 112 minutes for women nearly twice the amount of time men spent on housework after the circuit breaker women did drones for an average of 108 minutes each day and men spend just over an hour on them let's take this further with dr tan earn sir he's a sociologist with the national university of singapore welcome back doctor so do you think the circuit breaker has changed entrance stereotypical power dynamics between husband and wife like the husband makes the money while the wife you know takes care of the home and kids well let me begin by saying that i think with the recent times you know with a greater affluence with modernization there's in fact a move a shift towards a greater gender equality and more equality among family members and also what we are seeing now is that it is not quite the kind of family that we used to have before but it's a lot more symmetrical a lot more egalitarian but having said that let me also add on to say that you know i think with the the circuit breaker may actually present a lot of challenges and thereby more conflict but it could also present more opportunities for understanding and collaboration i believe that if the couple could come to a point of understanding each other's job priorities and that of the priority of the family as well then you'll be all for the better but i was also add that having said that you know it doesn't mean that equal involvement necessarily means uh equal division of labor in terms of involvement in terms of effort doctor we're essentially in another situation where working from home is the default do you reckon these patterns will re-emerge or are they actually continuing from last year's circuit breaker well my view is that i think people would have learned from the experience last year i mean the circuit breaker last year was in april right now we are already in may almost going to june uh in 2021 so i reckon they will learn something over the past one year and uh essentially i would say that they if the couple really want the best for each other and for the family they would have made some adaptation and the necessary adjustment over that period of time i see well um dr tan you know the study found that the gender gap in terms of housework rose during the circuit breaker and persisted for all families regardless of their income women spent almost twice the amount doing housework compared with men during and after the circuit break up so how can men be more involved in that aspect well i think to begin with right men must see housework as a joint responsibility if they have not already done so so frontier basis segment decide on the best arrangement in terms of workload and division of labor the domestic division of labor and i think the domestic division of labor must not be based on gender but on what they do they each what they each do best to complement one another's effort so in other words i'm saying that it's not a gender division of labor but a division of labor based on what they do best for one another and for the family well thank you so much for your insights dr tan we've been speaking with dr tan unser an associate professor with the new s's sociology department also making headlines the decline in receipts for the services sector eased further in the first quarter with a dip of 1.5 year on

cluster of infections in melbourne detected earlier this week has swelled to 26 cases and the number of virus exposed locations crossed 150. facebook and instagram are giving all users the option to hide public likes on their posts this potentially up ends a core dynamic of these platforms where light counts are seen as a sign of a person's influence but it comes amid mounting criticism that these can be harmful to the well-being of users and society now if you opt out of sharing public like counts others can see a list of who like the post but not the number of likes [Music] rachel ross monica chandler joey and phoebe you've guessed it right all back together at apartment 20 and central park the friends reunion premiered earlier today on hbo go at 3 p.m in singapore and could we be more excited let's bring in journalist jen lee who has seen the reunion episode and is here to share more about it but no spoilers please jan fans will rather disappointed that the reunion was more of a chat show games etc rather than a special episode checking in on the characters nearly 20 years on your thoughts on this uh jen you know did the format end up working um so because right from the beginning when it was announced it was always announced as an unscripted special so i didn't really feel disappointed in the sense that i didn't expect it to be anything else so it was always gonna be you know them reminiscing about their time on the show which i guess some people felt like then what's the point you know they wanted to see a story but for me i sort of understood and there's a part of me that doesn't really want to um want to see them now like i don't really want to see the characters now because there's a part of me that's like you know it ended on a very nice note and let's just leave it as that you know um and if you start it up you're gonna have to have new storylines you're gonna have to have conflicts and the producers always said you know friends is about that time in your life when you're friends with your family and at the end of the show all the friends um at least most of them started to have their own families with kids you know with partners and spouses so i can understand why they didn't come back for a scripted special i think um the special this time around the format kinda works um there are definitely like i definitely cry like as a fan who grew up watching the show and it's you know it's my comfort show it's the kind of show that you can put on when you're eating dinner and you just need something to watch um so that's great but um there were definitely parts where i cried as a fan they were definitely passed they were very very touching there were parts that um i learned new things about the show that i didn't know about before there were clips that i've never seen before which is quite surprising because i feel like i've seen a lot of clips but in any case um those parts really worked um there were a lot of gas stars which sometimes i think took attention away from the main cast of friends right and the executive producers um kevin bryant mother kaufman david crane who really had the most interesting acne notes and stories but i understand why they wanted to bring more people to sort of show you like the impact that friends have had has had on people you know there was like bts coming in there was like kit harington but there were definitely parts where i was like this celebrity does not need to be here right now i don't know why they're here so well you know the reunion has been promoted heavily so did it live up to you know all the hype um i think it really depends on how hyped up you were about it i mean i had my expectations kind of very tempered by the fact that it was unscripted so i didn't really expect anything um you know to come out of it that was like oh we're doing a new episode news story you know i didn't expect any big announcements i um just sort of wanted to see them together in the same space and get together and talk about their time which is exactly what they did so that was quite fun um there were some games that uh you know i think if you're a fan you might find it quite interesting there were also a lot of anecdotes about behind the scenes filming that i think a lot of fans would find quite uh satisfying to listen to but if you're looking for like you know big announcements or like something you know breaking news there's no breaking news here let's there's something that um i think will be in the headlines tomorrow i won't spoil it but um it's not really breaking news it's just sort of like oh i didn't know that happened that's interesting you know that's about it really um and i think if you are a fan who's watched the show a long time and has been with you a long time of course you will be happy to watch them get back together in the same space just watching them go into the set itself is quite touching because they actually like recreated the set like the monikers apartment central park uh chandler and joey's apartment so it is quite touching to see them back there and walking through the space that they walked and you can tell the cast themselves they were very very touched and i think just that touch of nostalgia is what we all want well thanks very much jan if you're a fan remember you can watch the friends reunion special on hbo go save the elderly hawkers where to tap out while you may have come across these social media accounts encouraging people to buy from hawker stalls amid this round of tighter measures how useful have they been let's find out from food correspondent eunice quick so eunice have you been able to see the effects yet of these initiatives you know have they managed to translate to tangible sales for these hawker stalls um so i was chatting with some of the hawkers earlier today and they didn't seem to be at least aware of what was going on you know they knew that young people were kind of helping to uh post on social media and all that um but honestly as to how much it actually translates into tangible sales i think that's still um a bit hard to tell because um they do know that people are still cautious um about going out and the hawker centers in the cbd have been quite hard-hit and are quieter than usual that's for sure um however one of the hawkers that i spoke to today at armoire street food center he did say that last year circuit breaker was worse was meaning that because um biscuit people were not coming out at all so he could only sell maybe up to like 50 cups of drinks in a day um whereas now he said that he can do maybe about 100 cups um obviously not not great not what i used to be but at least better than last year there's a risk that as the pandemic drags on it will further erode our hawker culture units how likely is that and what more can be done to help our hawkers and the hawker ecosystem itself well i certainly hope that that is not going to happen anytime soon um but when i was walking through some of the hawker centers just now i was in the cbd area you do see quite a number of shuttered stalls so um when i was talking to some of the hawkers they were saying that it is a mix of some of the of hawkers that are taking this month to kind of take a break some of them are also uncertain as to whether they will return um and that is really depending on how the pandemic situation uh evolves so if this really does drag on you could see some retiring earlier than they planned to because they are already in their 60s 70s and it may also i hope not but you know the younger ones might also think um carefully about joining the industry um to help them obviously things like rental waivers subsidies will definitely go a long way and of course you know all the help on social media can help to boost support and i mean personally for for all of us you know if you are working at home um you can you know take away from the coffee shop hawker near you the the hawker centers nearby if you have the means to you can do a quick run to the cbd if it is convenient and i think what also helps a lot is that if you are going out to buy a meal you know a chicken rice something along those lines um you know maybe try and add on you know a curry puff a drink or two maybe some desserts because um these are the the cheaper items in a sense that um are unlikely to be on delivery platforms um and you know you're not gonna pay like a dollar for you know someone to deliver you're not going to pay a delivery fee for a dollar a one dollar copy for example right so you know if you are going already going out you know try to add on a little bit here and there to support you know as many hawkers as you can great points there thank you so

Subscribe to our channel here: ...",now with the calibrated reopening dining inn will be allowed from monday but only for groups of two people isabel dim joins us from singapore's holland village that is a neighborhood known for its eating spots isabel first what can fmb establishments uh expect with this new calibrated reopening right so like you said uh dining in will be you know re-established this monday of course the group sizes are down to two instead of the previously announced five but for fnb establishments they have a couple of additional measures that they need to look out for so for example uh restaurants are not going to be able to play any recorded music on their premises and the rationale given for that this afternoon by authorities was that for recorded music when it's playing they didn't want diners to be speaking above the level of the music or trying to and you know increasing the risk of transmission now other things that they have to adhere to are the safe management measures those are going to be the main measures they have to adhere to and these include the safe distancing within the premises one meter apart between diners and of course the fast and easy testing process so this means that employees of f b establishments will have to be tested every 14 days this will be via self-administered cobit 19 tests and authorities have said that in order to kind of support this process they are providing training for supervisors who will oversee this testing regime as well as providing free of charge test kits for the first three months now of course this mandatory testing will come into will be compulsory in the middle of july but before that they've also said that they recognize that for smaller businesses they may not be able to establish this regime for themselves and so they're coming up also with quick test centers where employees can go and get tested there the first two will be opened in tikka and ishun this coming monday the same day that dining in resumes and they will be operational then with more on the way now all of this is building up to the next phase of reopening that will happen sometime in mid-july minister lawrence wong sketched out a picture of what that would look like this afternoon during the conference the second stage will happen around mid-july by then we expect that the system of regular testing will be in place across these higher risk settings we expect that our vaccination rates will be higher and then we can allow group sizes to increase to five persons with this phased approach we recognize that some businesses will be impacted and therefore the ministry of finance will continue to extend the support measures isabel how have fnb outlets many of whom have been struggling been reacting [Applause] right so you know one of the reasons why i'm in holland village tonight is not just because it's a very popular eating spot among singaporeans but also because f b establishments there are a lot of varied kinds over here so from the hawkers that are in the hawker center that i'm standing in right now to across the street you actually have some restaurants down the road you have pubs and bars all of them have very you know slightly different business models and depending on that they have different reactions to this dining in uh group size being cut down to two so for the hawkers that i spoke to this afternoon you know they said they were largely welcoming of it you know they said that with the high turnover the communal dining area they expected a lot more walk-in customers to come in buy their food sit down eat and then leave and so they expected business to go up but for the restaurants that i spoke to you know for those that are reliant on more of a communal dining experience those that are selling foods like you know barbecue or steamboat that uh generally larger groups of people eat or perhaps bars that rely on the kind of atmosphere to draw customers in they had a very different reaction so let's hear what they had to say [Applause] average customers is four four or five so uh if only two is very big difference for us yeah so it's lower than our uh sales uh right now we check it's 42 42 packs 21 tables last time you could fit uh about 50 or 60 because one one table can do five packs [Applause] now foreign you know all of these concerns all of the restaurants and f b establishments that i spoke to today said that they are making preparations to get ready for that dining in uh to be allowed on monday now the restaurant association of singapore have also said that they are happy that this dining inn will be gradually resumed and that they are working closely with authorities to make sure that the safe management measures are implemented thank you isabelle reporting from singapore's holland village ,True,True,False,False

On the Red Dot meets five Singaporeans who ...",everything changed when kovit happened i was on my way to work and i received an email from my boss i've been revenge that's it wouldn't use the word burden but i just didn't want to get my parents worried [Music] because i've covert when i'm about to pass away what do i want to look back on most of the teams are all family breadwinners so it's important that they keep the job we did talk around with the idea that it's totally different from what we have been doing [Music] so much effort and then we are not earning much of profiting out of it how do we move things forward from this and become better my name is [Music] i hate going to the market i'll try to avoid it since young i don't really like the smell the hustle the slippery floors of the market [Music] but things have changed now i probably visited the market more than i ever visited in the past 30 plus years [Applause] freelancers here are feeling the heat as the covet 19 situation works before the pandemic mom conduct a lot of cooking classes students will come to our house and learn dishes and they will pay a fee for it that is a property agent my wife xiaomi and i shoot wedding videos and corporate videos for our clients [Music] the freelancers live isn't easy for two years we kind of have sufficient jobs coming in month to month but this time during the circuit breaker mom can't host her regular classes that she have been doing for years when government announced a circuit breaker only essential worker can go out to work we have to stay home it's bad for everybody when we didn't have any income coming in we started to worry about how how long can our savings last us that is really stressful actually course there's the utility bills and stuff we have to service our mortgage for this house so our cpf got wiped out now [Music] layoffs in the second quarter of this year more than doubled from pre-covert 19 levels to over 8 000 even as total employment continued to fall by around 104 000 in the same period we first heard about the news of the plan shutting down and letting go of staff around april i was not that overly worried because i was in that company for seven and a half years but of course reality comes and hits me my name is muhammad nasir jafar i'm 47 years old i was a city quality engineer from an oil and gas mnc i still can remember very vividly when my managers say that jay i'm sorry we have to let you go [Music] i was lost for that 5-10 minutes when you hear it itself from your boss right yeah that is when it hits you really hard for four months i submitted more than 60 applications i tried semiconductor pharmaceutical electronics industry as well chemicals but still nothing never in my life that i feel unwanted why is it happening why is it me [Laughter] i'm doing the easiest part like cutting potatoes my mom is in charge of the curry chicken portion and charmaine is doing the bread portion growing up every friends gathering birthdays family gathering my mom will always prepare a pot of delicious curry for everyone to share it's everyone's favorite during the circuit breakers a lot of our peers do facebook live cooking shows and mom kind of felt pressurized to step up to to do it online as well we wonder what could interest singaporeans her customer base she thought of curry bands [Music] it was purely just to demonstrate how to cook it but by chance we gave some of the buns too to our neighbors and friends and sales started coming in [Music] it started out with just two of us mom and i running all over looking for ingredients making the bands delivering the vans ourselves [Music] and then as more orders came in we couldn't handle it alone so lester and dad stepped in to help [Music] at that point of time we didn't think of it as a business we were just happy that someone wants to buy yeah [Music] in the beginning of the year kovit happened and everything changed [Music] there was this fear like oh okay i'm unable to find a job wouldn't use the word burden but i just didn't want to get my parents worried my name is chiven i'm a third year student in smu 23rd april was when my exam ended i thought my whole summer is ahead of me what am i going to do i wanted to get internship in a company in singapore unfortunately when kovit happened i couldn't get an internship yeah so that's when i started to look for other things to spend my time so today i'm actually going to be filming a tip talk it's something that i've started doing circuit breaker so i usually connect it to my laptop over here and then this other setup was where i'll put my phone and that's where the whole creation begins many like me were feeling bored they wanted an outlet to just laugh a bit when i seen so many singaporean families dancing together with their kid i think it's really cute that's when i learned a dance a very famous tik tok dance when i posted it there was barely even one or two likes i knew it wouldn't get viral because a lot of people do that [Music] i started to experiment with new ideas and that's when i found that video that worked you again people like relatable content people like funny content so when i started to do more so of that that's when i think people had positive response the video got viral and i think it's garnered about 200 000 views in one night i was quite shocked at that i think a lot of girls found it funny and relatable because they too had unshaped eyebrows because of circuit breaker your first time do facial is it okay yeah i see you got a bit of black hair right here so this one also kind of was went viral in the temple community because it's true right how many people liked it about like four thousand like four thousand from india not from india local singaporeans because i was making people laugh i was making people smile made me want to create more to date i have about 58 000 followers really never expected any of this mischa can i get back my phone don't ever let me catch you using the phone again is that clear it was well received especially my school content because people can relate to it like oh my god yeah i remember that don't ever let me catch you using your phone in the class again is that clear yes i promise i won't use it again and that's a wrap so now comes the editing and all that so this is this takes a bit of time social media can be toxic at times and i think i've experienced a fair share of that as well [Music] i told him right from the start there are definitely be haters because he's seeing it on the lighter side maybe some may not you must be strong to accept it some of the mean or nasty comments that i've received is like you know he's not funny he can't sting a little bit you know took the smiles off people's face like literally i just wanted to make people smile i just want to make people happy [Music] my name is kelvin i'm the general manager here since 2002 it's already close to 18 years that i've been working here we are right now in the printing room where we have our large format printers uh here we were making mainly large springs for clients [Music] 2019 has been a very very good year uh actually we expected 2020 to be even better but things take a sudden change when circuit breaker was announced the closure of workplaces will take effect from next tuesday we had to shut down the whole operation for the next two three months and we totally had zero revenue from that point onwards in business theory with that kind of results we should be cutting off manpower it's difficult for us to actually say hey you know the business is no good and we want to lay you off the team has good for me for some of them even before i joined the company some of them joined us for 10 years five years and so on most of them are all family breadwinners so it's important that they keep the job while preparing for the shutdown we also had difficulty to purchase masks and we did toy around with the idea that we may be bringing in the mass production capability into our place to support singapore's needs for mass it's totally different from what we have been doing [Music] this is our first machine that we imported in we actually went to china to procure the machines and all the supplies we did all the installation and training through video conferencing and messaging we could do about 100 000 masks a day if we run 24 hours this will become a challenge because our team actually needs a different set of skills [Music] previously my role was a fine art print maker it switched overnight and now i'm doing face masks doing the quality control and also to check packing so totally no experience brand new uncharted waters [Music] hi chung how is the adjustment to the machine after we decided that the earlobes and all the things are not attached properly are you looking into it when we brought in these machines they cost us a couple hundred thousand dollars we throw in almost uh close to one million dollars of cash along the way we failed at a certain part the year loop attachment the distance between the tick and the joint uh when we actually browse them together is quite challenging because just a little difference after movement will actually affect the whole attachment we need to resolve this since of urgency those who place the pre-orders are all calling ourselves to make sure that they get their deliveries done everyone knows that they have to deliver it's just like a war time where everybody puts themselves into the front line to help fight the war [Music] during kobe i had the time to like slow down and think about the end of the road when i'm about to pass away what do i want to look back on i think what's meaningful in life is being able to give back to the society that has given you a lot of course like you know i'm just one person i cannot do it alone [Music] before covet i was living and working in new york around march the cases suddenly exposed to the thousands the city went into lockdown my parents were very anxious and very worried and that's when i decided to return to singapore i actually got quite a bad sore throat but i didn't have any fever so i still took the flight home because i was doing my parents i'm very worried that i'll pass it to them then i actually took myself to the gp clinic to get a referral to go to a e for the covet test and it was positive [Music] she told me about how the other elderlies that were in other words were suffering and she was really worried for them yeah singapore is an aging population we see more elderly who are living alone who are isolated within the community they could be astray from their children their spouses has passed on as well or their siblings are also generally very elderly as well i think as humans we crave for social support and a sense of belonging [Music] [Music] which i recently started after recovering from kobe 19 with two other friends the idea of kapong takis and getting more volunteers in the community to help their own neighbours that's what keeps me going i'm trying to reach more and more people kampunkakis is a platform that matches volunteers to a neighboring need [Music] today we try to match kakis within a 20 minutes walking distance we want to make sure that they are neighbors who can check in on each other regularly [Music] we are a non-profit organization we recruit our volunteers through social media giving out flyers in the neighborhood right now we have close to about a thousand volunteers of course it hasn't been growing as quickly as when we first started anymore since you know most people are starting to go back to work some of our neighbor khakis they have to support more than one neighbor and certain areas we don't really have enough neighbor volunteers as well if this initiative is stopped four elderlies will really fall through the gaps [Music] because of the pandemic for the very first time i'm jobless you were looking for a job via online job portals right no response from the applications that i submitted it was really zero i was more than eager to actually start work because it was already about four months that i've been staying at home right my original resume was about six pages long yes yes i remember it was quite a long resume the first thing is to work on improving his resume to better highlight his technical skills and knowledge so after jay has worked on his resume my colleague actually shared his profile with 3d metal forge and he was invited for interview and within three days right yeah he received a job offer [Music] 3d printing is exactly the opposite of what i did previously which is a conventional machining process so it's more to my own personal worry on whether i will be able to keep up with the expectations from my colleagues and also from the company i am in charge of the inspection of the products to ensure that it complies to the engineering drawing which specifies all the requirements of the products this tolerance is basically referring to a surface finish tolerance yes there is a surface phase yeah i think that was the mistake that i did which resulted in some delay in the world engineering drawings can be very complicated so jay might not have seen or exposed to all these new symbols if let's say we ship this out to the customer eventually they might not be able to use these parts because it might not fit into whatever they need to actually assemble this component to i do feel very bad actually because it is an unacceptable mistake for a quality engineer to do to commit i'm still under probation for treatment of forge i do not know whether i have done enough up to the expectations of the company for me to be confirmed [Applause] this is this is concerns we are smu students i actually wanted to get an internship in a company related to marketing unfortunately when kovit happened i couldn't get an internship that's when i stumbled on tick-tock types of students in morning assembly son four years in school helped me time my time actually i've seen some people posting his stories on their story and those are people that don't know him and that's how i knew how big given switch has become [Music] mechanical pencil you every time kid asks me it's just that the week maybe surprised me because i didn't expect him to have that a week ever since i started tiptoe and gaining more traction it's when like brands will reach out to me i still am using social media for the purpose of connecting talking to my friends seeing what's happening in their life the small change would be that now i'm using social media and this influence to share about a brand to my friends could it be maybe that i have a sizeable following then they see that maybe i cater a bit more to the younger demographic so they reached out the clients are okay with the setting of the scene but they want me to drop the female corrector because they don't encourage cross-dressing yeah your first time do facial is that i do tend to take on the persona of a girl and i'll wear a wig you gotta take it now working your brains has been bittersweet can be challenging sometimes when a brain tells you okay do this and then you're like oh how can i make it funny you know how can i make it funny it's definitely not easy tik tok life is a new feature it was launched in the singapore market two months ago okay i think it's good i actually can be quite nervous before i go live so people who are currently on the app scrolling on tiktok they can actually watch your live broadcast so there are 13 13 000 people active right now so i'm gonna go live let's do it in three in two and one yay hi guys hello hello hi everyone watching uh steven tiktok live helps me to interact those people who follow my content now more people are more than ever looking at their phones so i think that's where you capture their attention so someone sent one diamond so these can be translated into cash there's also this cool feature where people who have actually been following you for some time right they can actually reward you with certain coins i would say one coin maybe is two cents sometimes they may give you five coins so that is uh that's like 10 cents [Music] i was glad that there was still job opportunities in the midst of kovit i've been receiving some offers from brands to collab and to promote their merchandise or their brand so most of them would really be less than 500 so i would say on average i do like four for a month i still have two more years before i graduate that money will go into helping me pay off my school fees [Applause] so it's hard to motivate yourself to wake up early in the morning when the sky is still dark but to deliver the orders we have to wake up like at 5 00 am 4 30 am sometimes our brand name is in my curry bun in short it's it my cb which is a reference to circuit breaker there's of course people who really dislike the name but as a home-based business starting in circuit breaker we have to take certain creative risks we sell our curry runs on instagram our customers direct message us and we'll follow up with their orders through there we started this business with no business plan we're just selling one kariban at a time to survive this pandemic none of us studied business none of us studied culinary customers all around singapore wanted to try our curry bun so we deliver island white with zero delivery costs [Music] and then the end of the day we realized that we are making such a loss i remember feeling very disappointed after all this hustle all these efforts ultimately could not support us so i thought how do we move things forward from this and become better saturday yeah the delivery route so my dad will just follow accordingly to the house number one number two number three etc i am designing the packaging i put on a little doodle something personalized for our customers [Music] mom did a lot of groundwork for refining the recipes my brother is very good with numbers and help us to calculate all the ingredients cost packaging cost that helps us with all the delivery [Music] we have to also pick up some side hustles so i'm editing a wedding video right now we had to juggle between both the caribou business and the video business which is a challenge because xiamen is very much involved in the kitchen process if we stop doing the curry buns then what will happen to our parents mom and dad have been freelancers all their lives and they are not of age to redraw from their cpf anyway so they really needed to rely on their job to provide for themselves so with the khariban business they are able to get an income at least [Music] this is your cat i'll rescue them so you feed them every day [Music] i was actually inspired by my own parents my parents would prepare food to help my stay alone senior neighbour so that kind of you know sharing and giving spirit is something that really inspired me to start kampung kakis [Music] so this is the map of all our gucky volunteers as well as aoka keys in meat the purple and the blue are volunteers and the brown is our beneficiary salkakis in need one of the things we realized is that actually a lot of the elderly were not very tech savvy and therefore they felt more isolated so my team decided to start a new initiative called digital car keys where we use our network of kaki volunteers to become sort of the tech support xinten a woman chessy zoom [Music] bye if kobe didn't happen i probably would still be quite busy with my daily life and work and maybe didn't put so much thought into how we can do more to help the community i had the chance to really slow down and reflect upon my life and how i was leaving it if i was to continue in new york i wouldn't be able to do all that after i came back to singapore i still had my job in the u.s so i would work late hours from eight pm to about seven am the next day it was quite difficult because i would start working on khakis in the afternoon before i you know commenced my work in the evening i actually did go back to the us from july it was very hard trying to manage kaponkakis from the u.s because of time zone differences i wanted to come back and see it you know continue to grow [Music] [Applause] [Music] we have 25 to 30 employees most of them are all family breadwinners during the pandemic our printing pieces were all shut we should be cutting off manpower but we chose the face mask manufacturing to actually help to save the jobs even up to today we still have a full team with us [Music] okay we had some issues on the yellow customers are complaining so we took the feedbacks we put in more stringent checks it took us some time before we will come and get a better product out there to the market the pandemic actually forces us to think out of the box to really move ourselves from our comfort zone to actually protect everyone's likelihood to evolve the business to change it to bring ourselves online and to expand to different portfolios to make sure that we are still relevant during the difficult times we thought that it was a good mix to actually expand the whole product line with hand sanitizer [Music] june is where we started back our printing production after the three months stopped right now i'm back to doing my previous role as a fine art print maker i oversee the printing from the color editing to the quality control so back to normal i would say happy to be doing something that i'm familiar with okay so this is safe [Music] now everybody is trying to do promotions so the activities are rolling back in quickly but the production of the face mask still continues [Music] we believe that holding this capability for future safety net is actually important so we decided to keep the the mass manufacturing business uh alive um as long as we can [Music] machine level pandemic has actually brought us stronger together we have learned to think in all the different perspectives don't just keep looking at what they are doing right now and you should be able to find the other part of goal what else you have to do preparation for tomorrow okay we tried juggling our videography business and the caribon business but that also means that we don't have any rest day at all it's difficult and it's really draining sometimes but i think it's worth it [Music] honestly if we were to stop this curry bun tomorrow we would just go out and work harder in our respective jobs but what's keeping us together now it's the chance to work together as a family and to earn together as a family sometimes we also wonder whether the very generous support we get from our customers and friends is this one is this thing gonna last and is there future in the caribbean business we don't really know as well do you want to continue doing it if we can if people still want to eat our curry buns we'll make them we will make it hey jay hi matt are you doing i'm doing good thank you have a seat my appropriation period is three months if they think that

silver lining for me was me starting tick tock yeah and i'm thankful for it and that's why i still hope to do even the coming years to continue creating content just do that just to friendship [Music] expect the older one first because you already know i think it's a good choice to come home after going through this pandemic i do want to do more for singapore and for the community singapore is always home in the past it felt very difficult to make a change but when you hang around people who are all change makers i think you are more hopeful that yeah we can make a difference in singapore together [Music] this pandemic has taught me to be okay with change we just have to adapt and work even harder when we are out of our comfort zone because life is always going to be unpredictable [Music] i'm day dreaming about traveling shamin and i can drive a van and then we can make curry buns around the world [Music] ,True,True,True,True
SmxwIxumKII,Mental Health In The Era Of Covid-19 | Dr Ganesh Kudva,UC1hp0pDwWzZPeKqq4K0LoeQ,Brahm Centre,2020-08-05T14:21:35Z,"For the third year in a row, Brahm Centre Singapore is the proud host and organiser of Asia's largest mindfulness conference, the Singapore Mindfulness ...",thank you everyone for tuning in uh today on this sunday afternoon um allow me to share screen um so that i'm able to show you my slide okay so um i'll be taking you through um the body of work uh that has been done exploring uh the various themes of mental health in the era of covet 19 and i think as as angie has mentioned um kovitt 19 is really an unprecedented crisis a year ago even seven eight months ago we would never have foreseen ourselves in the situation in which we now are uh but well here we are we are now about seven months in and um humanity as a whole is facing many challenges uh and this is uh these challenges are not just confined to the virus itself but also the various ways in which the virus is changing our lives i mean the very fact that we're having this uh conversation over this platform i think uh says it all about how these how these viruses changed our lives um so the facets of today's talk are basically threefold first of all i'll be looking at the effect of illness contagion illness spread on the broader public's mental health so i've termed this the worried well number two the effect of quarantine on mental health and number three it would be the mental health in the post kobe 19 world um before i go on let me just qualify that a lot of the data i've brought together is global uh doesn't really specifically pertain to singapore i think so far in singapore we've done a very good job in terms of being able to control our community spread and with the various stimulus packages and so on they have been released somewhat being able to cushion the economic impact of the virus so far but we are highly plugged into the rest of the world and we see unchecked viral spread in so many countries you know in india brazil the us uh that it does make one wonder whether these issues might someday come to affect us a little bit more it's good to talk about it now hence the talk today so part one would be the effects of illness contagion and the public's mental health so i termed this the worried well people who do not yet have the virus but are naturally worried by what it means so this is from a paper that's published in the asian journal of psychiatry earlier this year it basically theorizes that for every single spike of cobit 19 cases and it's likely that we will have multiple spikes of covet 19 cases around the world uh that you have two uh peaks of mental health problems the first peak happens soon after the virus makes its presence felt and cases rise and so there's understandably a lot of fear a lot of anxiety people that will be struggling to adjust to the new normal we call this the adjustment disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders as well but then humanity where a resilient bunch and so eventually societal resilience will kick in and people will adjust to the new normal but then unfortunately we know that the virus does lead to a loss of life but not only that loss of jobs and various other things and so eventually over time people may then develop a second peak of mental health problems and this would be more related to loss and grief so it's nothing but grief post-traumatic stress disorder depression and suicide and i think one of the concerns that was articulated in this paper was that the number of cases of people who may suffer from mental health problems may be far in excess of the number of actual cobit 19 cases in a population and this may go beyond what a mental healthcare system is able to manage so covet 19 and distress so i think as we have mentioned it is an unexpected unprecedented unknown we still don't know all that much about the virus there is a lot of uncertainty still about the rate and mode of transmission and there's unparalleled spread no definitive treatment at this point and there is a greater psychological fear than during sars i mean a substantial available impact about more than half of respondents from a study in china actually reported moderate to severe psychological impact and the fear of phobic 19 increases levels of stress depression and anxiety and in turn reduces the level of life satisfaction so why might this be happening part of it of course is related to the virus and the nature of the virus and its spread but also the fact that today we live in a very polarized world if not singapore at least in the rest of the world you look at the u.s for example and so media coverage may actually amplify anxiety there may be a lot of distrust towards governments and healthcare authorities to control the spread i mean if you watch the u.s news you would see that this is very much in play uh there may be a lot of stigma and blame towards individuals who are deemed to be spreading the disease and also a concept which i shall go on to explain called the behavioral immune system which i'm going to talk about a little bit because i feel it explains a lot of things that we are seeing today so the behavioral immune system we know that we all have an immune system so this is what kind of kicks in if we get infected by any bug a body mouse and immune response but it isn't just the cells in our body that produce this response it's also something that's seen in our behavior and what this immune system is meant to do is it's meant to protect us against potentially getting infected and so to reduce the work that our uh body's immune system then has to do so and the degree to which we activate this immune system this behavioral immune system really depends on how vulnerable we feel to the disease um coming back to the to a point that we see across the world you might see a lot of young people congregating at bars and going to malls and queuing up at you know restaurants you don't necessarily see people who are more elderly doing that and that might be because the elderly might perceive themselves to be more vulnerable to the disease and they take steps to protect themselves far more than younger people who view themselves as being innately immune might you know might might adopt these steps so what are the benefits well first of all it creates vigilance of one's external environment and it creates it values conformity and obedience over eccentricity and rebellion so these days if let's say there is a lockdown or you know there are restrictions social distancing and so on we tend to follow because we are worried about the virus and sickness behavior in itself when someone is sick they don't go out as much generally they adopt social withdrawal and a loss of energy may actually help to limit the spread of the disease and that's a behavior in itself too and so and also distancing behaviors from those are potentially unwell may reduce the probability of catching the infection and this actually lessens the work that needs to be done by the cylinder immune system however uh there are a number of downsides so first of all of course is the fact that avoidant behaviors may actually come at the expense of interpersonal relationships and daily activities we might go out less when i talk to people less we might not meet our colleagues or our friends as much and we get more distant it is stressful so that taxes our metabolic system we're always in a state of stress uh and and chronic anxiety and stress can lead to problems we might stigmatize certain communities we know of reports for example in the uk of asians being attacked and um the greater disgust greater activation of aversive cognitions with the working memory and greater motivation for behavioral avoidance so basically we view the world then as a more threatening place we start to adopt behaviors to keep ourselves safe it might help to keep ourselves safe but it's not necessarily something that's good for the long term or in excess so what are the groups that report higher distress levels and this is from a collection of papers from around the world so uh female gender it's been shown in a number of papers to actually uh be a group that is associated with higher distress levels um respondents age 18 to 30 and above 60. so above 60 i think it's you know perhaps because they perceive themselves as being more vulnerable to their disease and for respondents age 18 to 30 remember these are young people their studies may have been disrupted entry into the workforce they have been disrupted they're just about earning their first paycheck they'll be struggling to support themselves so this is a very stressful time for them students and migrant workers not surprising that they would be under a fair bit of stress there is higher distress in places with inadequate public health resources and limited containment measures if the virus is spreading everywhere and there isn't a hospital that you can go to then you are going to be very distressed by the fact the virus is there those with poorer self-rated health status and with medical problems will have higher distress because they'll perceive themselves to be more vulnerable and having an acquaintance a family member who is infected especially a family members infected with kobit 19 can be stressful as well you might worry that you might catch the infection there's caregiving responsibilities that you one might have to take up and of course there's that worry what might happen to my family member so part two uh focuses on the effect of quarantine on mental health i'd first of all like to qualify that it's very hard to exactly differentiate which aspects of mental health distress are due to the virus and which aspects are due exactly to quarantine because the two are so closely interlinked but nonetheless i've tried to look through the data to to kind of provide an overview on it so the effect of quarantine so i mean it's needless to say i think we're all aware now that the distress from pandemics not only stems from the fear of the disease but also from the effects of quarantine quarantine measures may worsen anxiety it can cause boredom anger and loneliness we might feel cut off from our social contacts and this can be stressful when you're at home all day perhaps not able to further one studies or do the things that one might normally do it might affect your self-esteem boredom and stress might affect one's ability to exercise self-control uh it affects sleep quality if you're in the house all day and it increases the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder there was an article in the guardian newspaper in the uk that actually said that one-fifth of vulnerable adults in the uk actually considered self-harm during their coronavirus lockdown distress related to quarantine is associated with inadequate information inadequate supplies and a longer duration of quarantine i think during our circuit breaker period you may have heard of minister lawrence wong talking about why it was important to time the onset of the circuit breaker properly and not have it for too long because you're worried about population fatigue and that's a very real thing and the longer longer you keep a population locked down that can have a lot of problems in and of itself quarantine and national lockdowns actually have a profound economic impact as well and this may actually cause a rise in unemployment and financial stress which in turn may increase the risk of suicide so with that i've actually kind of collated the literature to talk about some of the pathways from quarantine to suicide now i must emphasize that not everyone who is quarantined uh is at risk of suicide and it certainly is not something that happens you know it's not an inevitable progression but it is a concern and i think we need to bear it in mind because it's best to prepare for a problem rather than react to it so um first of all it's important to remember that there are certain groups that are at higher risk of you know suicide mental health distress and suicide when under quality so they're basically people who endorse being lonely those are living alone those are single and certain behaviors that might increase one's distress so more time exposed to news and kobit 19. if one has fewer positive emotions you have less perceived self-efficacy so you don't feel you're capable of doing things and you feel almost you know vulnerable to this to the quarantine uh lower quality of sleep and negative self-perceptions upon aging so these are some of the risk factors and some of the pathways so basically quarantine is a very isolating experience and this can result in a sense of thwarted belongingness so this is from the interpersonal theory of suicide so the person may feel separated from the group to which they normally belong so for example if they feel they belong to a certain church congregation for example or a certain group of friends now they're not meeting them anymore so they lose this sense of belongingness there's also that loss of social interaction and with that there is a sense of diminished mental health well-being there's also the very real problem of poorer sleep abuse is a problem i think the world health organization issued a an advisory about the fact that global rates of domestic abuse were going up during the period of quarantine so this is a very real concern victims of abuse are likely to manifest diminished mental health well-being there also may be a feeling of being trapped and the economic consequences which will be stressful so all of these things together may potentially increase the risk of suicide and the reason i'm bringing this up is because proactive interventions are needed to assist those under quarantine so things to uh to counteract the effects of social isolation to shelter those who are at risk of abuse to um you know to basically reduce the economic consequences of quantities so these are things that need to be looked at so approach and therapy i think i'm just talking about this uh more because later on i'm going to talk about the importance of self therapy but these are some of the cognitive processes that i think we can have in mind uh in order to kind of buffer ourselves against the mental health impact of quarantine and of the virus so first of all it's important to realize that virtual modalities are more practical and present yes face to face would have been good you know it would have been nice to meet your friends would it be nice to meet your therapist but right now that may not be all that possible and not be the safest it's important to address the reality that we live in extraordinary time it's also important to reassure the patient in the event of a therapist so how one would a friend that there will always be the person will always be there regardless of the crisis it's important to maintain eye contact um and you know basically to suggest using virtual platforms uh like zoom or facetime to maintain contact with one social contact so have a zoom dinner for example uh it doesn't mean just because you cannot meet that social gatherings have to stop um and for those in therapy it's perhaps perhaps important to bear in mind now may not be the best time to terminate therapy it may be good to continue it at least till this crisis is a bit better and to reframe to look at the pandemic not as the end of one's old life and the you know kind of the end of everything but as a role transition a change in which the person yes mourns the loss of old roles but then you adaptively restructure activities and relationships in this new novel so use it as an opportunity to start a new and to to adjust and to adjust other interventions so i talked about digital technologies and how important they are places of congregation should actually replicate their activities via online platform so this is like places of worship gyms employers should actually create a buddy system and ensure a daily reach out to employees routine creation is essential especially for children not in school to kind of give them the rhythm and routine mechanisms for surveillance and decisive intervention in cases of abuse must be created basically so that the victims of abuse were now back in their homes often with you know their abuses partners must have places of help and shelter um and that really leads me to my next point these shelters in and of themselves must be safe must have social distancing so that this vulnerable group doesn't itself become infected mental health system actually needs to be bolstered in anticipation of a surge of cases which may happen and telehealth may need to be expanded and communities should be encouraged to create informal support networks amongst themselves to provide support to each other how to help to help us well basically i've talked about this because uh i think we all recognize that um you know i'm not sure i think many of many of us may be therapists we may be caregivers um and it's it's a stressful role at this time to care for others um so how does one help the helpers so you know basically it's important to have a proper diet regular exercise and sufficient sleep clear communication uh basically providing the psychological and financial support to those who are on caregiving roles uh and psychological first aid which is um the main reason why i'm actually talking about this so if you look at that that box to your right you'll see that these are the themes of psychological first aid it's something very simple and basically the main focus is to emphasize to the person to whom you're giving this first aid that number one um they're safe uh number two that they're not alone someone is there to link them up with supports so that there can be more support in the days to weeks moving forward and to provide them with information about how to cope and how to manage their distress it's useful because it's very applicable in this time and psychological first aid is certainly something that i think is a good tool for a lot of people to learn much as we learn uh medical first aid to deal with people you know who are going through a medical crisis psychological first stage should be something that should be taught to help people who are going through a psychological and since this is a mindfulness workshop i thought that include something about mindfulness as well and there are some studies that have talked about mindfulness in a pandemic so focused attention mindfulness based cognitive therapy and mindfulness based stress reduction have been shown to reduce anxiety depression post-traumatic stress disorder and the physiological markers of stress they basically offer a helpful way to cope with this constant change over pandemic rising cases lockdowns and so on daily mindfulness practice actually improved sleep duration and reduced anxiety amongst the population of quarantined individuals in gohan as compared to those who just had mind wandering so basically just kind of unfocused attention and rumination qualitative study of nurses in china actually showed that they endorsed mindfulness as a helpful way of reducing stress we know that nurses are under immense stress uh these days in a lot of countries where the cases are you know you know surging uh and meditation and mindfulness apps may actually be helpful uh to in order to deliver this this mindfulness to to the broader community um and mindfulness micro practices can be used to promote wellness and reduce burnout example whilst performing hand hygiene so now you may have heard a lot about washing your hands and uh and so on so whilst washing your hands how about practicing using that moment to focus on one's breath once uh center one's mind and body and visualize the kind of calmness and and presence that one would want to have at that moment in time so while cleaning your hands how about also kind of focusing on cleaning some of your thoughts and kind of promoting that wellness and peace i know it's abstract but it's perhaps something that can be um you know elaborated on further by you know other speakers or maybe even during a conference itself about how these micro moments can be used to promote wellness so part three is about mental health in the post-covet world and i think that that really is um a question that's foremost on many people's minds so we talked about the kovitz cycle um so covet cycle i think as we are all familiar you have a rise in case numbers there's a lockdown case numbers drop and then there is a gradual reopening of society but unfortunately then case numbers rise again and whilst not linked in the ebola crisis in west africa in liberia and sierra leone they actually talked about the presence of a fear apathy cycle so when ebola cases rise there's a lot of fear but then ebola becomes a new normal and then there's activity and then cases rise again and they talked about this in terms of how aid agencies may sometimes render support to uh or government they render support to people affected by the ebola virus there is somewhat a similar trend seen with kobit at least in quite a number of other countries overseas uh and this is from the economist that basically kind of sums up uh this whole covet cycle and how there is this pattern of re-engagement followed by a spike of cases and then unfortunately shut down again so what are the possible social economic scenarios that provide 19 might have so first of all of course borders may actually remain far more tightly controlled than before you may have countries that they have as an aspirational goal suppression a mere suppression of the virus so some level of spread but uh but fairly low versus countries that may say well we want to eliminate the virus so countries like new zealand or taiwan or south korea and is it likely that a country having taken all that effort to eliminate the virus may then open its borders readily to countries that merely state as a goal their desire to suppress so this is a question that that might be seen in the months to years ahead uh there's also a concern that you know jobs is short-term contracts they become more commonplace as employers are unable to plan for the long term and this might result in a transient workforce and governments may need to institute a series of stimulus packages to support the most needy uh but this may be associated with an increase in spending and so tax rates might go up uh and you will wonder future generations might actually have to put the bill of all the stimulus packages in the present day please and quite a number of other countries that don't really have the reserves in singapore do this is a particular concern uh there may also be sizable disruptions educational progress i think school closures and online learning is is important but can it really substitute actually going to school um financial strains actually force younger people to forego higher education in favor of earlier work communal activities and large scale social events may not occur as freely as before and unfortunately as we know is human nature certain entities mister feelings of ill will towards certain countries and communities and as we know if history is any guide the ensuing friction may lead to global conflict we hope it doesn't but if past pandemics and crises have shown us anything it's that for every good reaction that mankind seems to do there is also an unfortunately a negative reaction as well so what are the mental health consequences and i've divided this really looking at the spectrum across the lifespan so um i talked about the increase in domestic abuse so this is likely to affect the young and the elderly the most but there may be other issues as well in the young so i think uh uh prof daniel fung we're talking more about the mental health impacts of the young uh so i'll be brief here but basically there may be a rise in adolescent mood and anxiety disorders you know due to stall educational progress dim prospects unemployment and the lack of social interaction and that may result in an increase in adolescent suicide and an increase in delinquency in the elderly we know that many elder care centers have had shuts and so this is you know because you do need to keep the elderly safe from the virus but then that creates increased social isolation and many people the younger folks may be familiar with zoom and online platforms but our elderly may not be so familiar and so they might really really be cut off uh and it as was seen actually uh post-sas there was actually an increase in elderly suicide driven by disconnectedness and fear of contracting the illness and this was seen actually in hong kong post stars so this is something that we need to bear in mind across all ages we are still finding out more and more about the direct impact that the virus has on the brain uh we still don't know all that much but there is a concern that it may be causing some behavioral changes in and in people who are infected um there may be adjustment disorders depressive disorders grief um ocd and post-traumatic stress disorder may rise across the board and anxiety disorders may as well may become more common and as was seen in west africa after ebola there was actually an increase in the rates of addiction especially the alcohol so this is something that we also need to think about and plan for in the future and so for the mental health care system uh i suppose it's it's more it's important for us to look at um the groups yeah so i've divided it based on the various um groups at risk so for the worry well those who are worried about contracting the virus but do not yet have any mental health illness mental illnesses at this point uh you may want to talk about increasing the outreach or mental health apps familiarizing oneself with their youth so this would be self-help cognitive behavior therapy or mindfulness we want to integrate mental health advice into pre-existing social media networks so maybe remind us on facebook or instagram in order to kind of ensure that they're well or checking on their friends to make sure that they're well and also having support groups in the workplace as we've talked about before for those who have mental health illness symptoms or some stress but do not yet meet the threshold for an actual disorder or illness then they may help from counseling services and increase in the scope of telecounseling services that might be helpful for those who have mild to moderate mental illness then i suppose having easier access to psychiatric services or scoping out your tele psychiatry services may be helpful and for the very ill i suppose it's the one major thing we need to think about is how do we get back get them back on their feet uh as soon as possible after they've had a period of illness especially given the silent employment prospects that would would be there as a result of this virus so my reflection and this is my my last slide is you know much has been said about hand hygiene washing your hands wearing a mask to stem the spreader of the illness but what about psychological hygiene to stem this emotional contagion the spread of of stress and of distress mental health effects of covet 19 are likely to linger within society long after the virus is suppressed because the economic after effects will not just go away the day a vaccine is found it will be there and talking about the vaccine much as a vaccine will inoculate or protect people against the virus perhaps you also need to think about a vaccine for emotional wellness perhaps this will involve teaching people how to practice mindfulness or cognitive behavior therapy on their own to manage stress teaching them how to have proper sleep hygiene for example or how to talk about their feelings how to recognize mental illness that's important too and telemodalities will be important in this way so if that will allow people to reach out to each other and eventually once the whole of society is aware of what mental illness is is aware of how to help oneself and how to help those around us then perhaps we would have built up heard pandemic related stress and uh and that's perhaps something that we need to to um build ourselves towards uh also it's important to remember that societies do have a responsibility to act collaboratively and manage the spread of hate and division which may happen but we must actively work to prevent this from happening so with that that brings me to the end of my presentation thank you for listening you

Ko-Lh4nm_wU,5 COVID-19 cases in Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster have Indian variant of virus,UC83jt4dlz1Gjl58fzQrrKZg,CNA,2021-05-04T12:44:45Z,"Singapore has identified 29 variant infections that are of concern. Seven cases have the more infectious Indian strain, with five linked to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.",singapore has identified 29 variant infections that are of concern seven are of the more infectious indian strain five are linked to tantoxine hospital that's one of the reasons why medical authorities say the cluster is larger than usual grenachio joins us from outside tantoxing hospital now gweneth should we be concerned about these variants of the virus i mean definitely globally i think there's concern over infectious more infectious types of the virus in particular 29 local cases have been linked to these variants and in particular 10 of them have been linked to what we call indian variants of the virus and seven of those are of the b16172 type of the virus and it's spread out over three clusters in singapore which the health ministry has updated today are genetically not linked so there is one point of concern that these clusters are in a way not linked epidemiologically uh one other point of concern is that five of these seven cases are linked only to the tantoxine hospital cluster and as you said that is one reason the more infectious strain is one reason why this cluster now has 40 cases and is singapore's largest active cluster of cases however the task force did say that they are looking into other possible reasons why the virus has spread so quickly within tantok singh hospital and in particular one word ward 9d but we did note that there was a uh clustering of cases really around one single wall or 90 and we are exploring the possibility that there are the local influences particularly related to the ward they may have also influenced to a super spreading event occurring leading to these cases so we are studying the possibility that there may be issues with the air flow and ventilation in the ward among various other hypotheses that we're entertaining so until the studies are complete we will not be able to give a definitive response but we are exploring all possibilities well the task force also gave an update on their contact tracing and testing efforts they've tested all uh 1 000 over 1000 inpatients in the hospital and so far they've all written negative test results which is definitely good news and they will be embarking on a second round of testing they're also testing 10 000 staff and will give that update when that's ready now in order to uh help with the manpower the health ministry has also asked other hospitals to send a manpower to tantoxin hospital to care for the patients there and therefore they're also all hospitals are going to defer non-urgent surgeries and admissions and also will shift to telemedicine and medical delivery or other medicine delivery services for more stable cases in order to consolidate resources to help tun toxin hospital through this time grant there have also been reports of staycations being cancelled by hotels supporting the current pandemic effort what can you tell us one of those reasons is because um healthcare workers especially those at time tossing hospital have requested for some help with accommodation to give their family members some peace of mind so that after they leave the workplace they can go to a hotel to stay and do not have to be too overly concerned about the safety of their family members for instance although they did say that this is sort of an abundance of caution not because of any heightened risk to these healthcare workers all to their family members however the health ministry also did say that they have heard some cases of discrimination against healthcare workers which concerns them there have been some reports we had here of uh healthcare workers uh uh being told that they're not welcome after the landlord found that they're working in turntalk saying this is a concern for us because these workers are well and they've committed a lot of time and energy to us looking after patients in tan toxin hospital at this stage so we endeavor also to support them another reason why hotels are actually turning away some customers is also because of the lengthened 21 day stay home notice period for travelers coming in from higher risk countries leading to higher occupancy in these hotels and that's why they're also consolidating their resources and turning some people away all right may thanks for that grenadier reporting to us live from outside the tantoxing hospital in singapore ,True,True,False,False
