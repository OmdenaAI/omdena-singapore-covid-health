"60,000 subsidised outpatients seek treatment for mental disorders each year: Gan Kim Yong", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/60-000-subsidised-outpatients-seek-treatment-mental-disorders-12240990,Jalelah Abu Baker,07 Jan 2020 07:47PM,"SINGAPORE: Public healthcare providers treated an average of about 60,000 subsidised outpatients for mental disorders each year over the last three years, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Monday (Jan 6). In a written answer to a Parliament question from Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Walter Theseira, Mr Gan also said that an average of 6,900 subsidised patients were hospitalised for mental health conditions each year between 2016 and 2018. Their average length of stay was 21 days per admission. The five most common mental health conditions seen at public hospitals were schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and substance abuse.  At the polyclinics, depression, anxiety and insomnia were the most common mental health conditions. Schizophrenia and depression were also common conditions seen by community intervention teams funded under the Ministry of Health, he said.  Associate Professor Theseira had asked Mr Gan for the demographics of patients receiving psychiatric treatment and mental health support at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), polyclinics, specialist outpatient clinics at restructured hospitals and under government-funded programmes in the last three years. He had also asked for a break down on the number of patients, duration of inpatient stay or treatment length, types of mental health condition, age, income and time taken between the onset of symptoms and treatment. For the whole public healthcare system, the average age of subsidised patients for the different mental health conditions seen was between 40 to 50 years old, Mr Gan said.  MOH does not track data on income or the time between onset of symptoms and treatment. However, he referred to the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, a self-reported survey, in which respondents cited 11 years as the median time between when they first experienced symptoms and when they sought help for obsessive compulsive disorder.  The median time was four years for bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse, two years for generalised anxiety disorder and one year for major depressive disorder.  “Stigma and lack of mental health literacy may be contributory factors to the delay,” said Mr Gan. “We have community outreach teams to educate the public on mental health conditions and dementia, and refer those with such conditions to the appropriate health and/ or social services,” Mr Gan said. In a separate response to NMP Anthea Ong on waiting times for outpatient appointments at IMH, specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and government-funded programmes, Mr Gan said that a new subsidised patient would have waited an average median time of 27 days to see a psychiatrist and 28 days to see a psychologist across the public hospitals in 2018.  Ms Ong had also asked for data on the professional-to-patient ratio and measures taken to reduce waiting times. On this, Mr Gan said that there are around 248 psychiatrists and 473 psychologists practising in Singapore. This translates into 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.36 psychologists per 100,000 population. Mr Gan also said that within the public health sector, the number of psychiatrists and psychologists has increased by 8 per cent to 182 and 7 per cent to 171, respectively, over the last three years.  “MOH does not have specific numbers on counsellors practising in Singapore as many healthcare professionals and social workers provide counselling as part of their work,” he said.  Mr Gan said that anyone requiring urgent mental health assistance or who wishes to see a psychiatrist, may contact the IMH's 24-hour mental health helpline or visit its 24-hour emergency services.  For cases requiring community support, patients can be referred to community outreach teams and community intervention teams. These cases are usually contacted within two weeks, he said.  To reduce waiting time, hospitals have implemented measures such as reviewing work processes to optimise appointment slots and efficiency of clinical operations and tiering services to the appropriate level of care, he said.  As of March 2019, the Government has 41 community outreach teams and 21 allied health-led community intervention teams providing mental health support, said.  “MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to ensure that we provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare Needs,” Mr Gan said."
It isn’t all about mental disorders — the little-known casework done in IMH’s emergency room, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/mental-disorders-casework-imh-emergency-room-services-department-13245596,Desmond Ng,10 Oct 2020 06:30AM,"SINGAPORE: The number of patients seeking help this year from the Institute of Mental Health’s (IMH’s) 24-hour Emergency Services has gone up as more people became stressed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these patients face adjustment disorders due to the pandemic, presenting anxiety and depressive symptoms, said Adjunct Associate Professor Lee Cheng, senior consultant and vice-chairman (clinical) of the IMH Medical Board. “Some can’t get used to being retrenched from work; some (have) monetary problems,” said Lee, who also heads the Emergency Services department. The “circuit breaker” had also affected people in different ways, he added. One patient, for example, had a phobia about getting the coronavirus and refused to leave home; another could not tolerate being cooped up in the house. The latter, fed up with the social restrictions, would take a “bus to nowhere” and travel round the island. “Sometimes people get irritated or frustrated. It may not be a psychiatric disorder,” said Lee. “But (for some), these symptoms are too distressing, so they end up coming to the emergency room.” For those with mild symptoms, his team would approach the patients’ loved ones or even family service centres (FSCs) and counsellors for help. “We don’t want to over-medicate them … (We) try to draw on their strengths and their coping skills,” he said, adding that those with financial problems would be linked up with social workers. But there are also suicidal cases — and a lot more that goes on in the IMH Emergency Services department that little is known about, CNA Insider finds out ahead of World Mental Health Day today. Situated near the entrance of the IMH, the department sees 50 to 60 patients a day, compared with a daily turnover of a few hundred patients at the accident and emergency departments in public hospitals. The cases are mainly those facing acute stress, said Lee. There are also cases of relapse among those suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or recurrent depression. “We don’t call it A & E because the ‘A’ stands for accidents. We don’t have accident cases here,” he said. “We definitely have overdose (patients). But we call it ‘services ’… rather than a department.” The waiting time to see a doctor is typically under an hour for patients who are given high priority, and about two hours or less for other patients. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. It is as such because the clinical staff must screen for patients at high risk, and must also link up with community partners and the family members to ascertain the patient’s medical and personal history, said Lee. “The easy way out is to admit (the patient), but we need to be patient-centric, (find out) what the patient requires (clinically), and we fulfil their requirements,” he added. Patients with no mental illness or acute stress would be discharged without an outpatient appointment, depending on the doctor’s assessment. Sometimes they would be referred to an FSC if they encounter relationship problems. Patients found to have a psychiatric condition, however, are usually warded or given an outpatient appointment at a later date. On average, 30 to 40 per cent of walk-ins at the Emergency Services — about 20 patients a day — are warded. The department, manned by a team of consultants, junior doctors, nurses, social workers and pharmacists, saw a five per cent increase in cases last year compared with 2018, partly due to increased awareness of mental health, said Lee. There has been another increase this year, although the figure will be known only once the year is over, according to the IMH. Emergency Services staff typically attend to acute cases first, who are divided into two groups: Those who require admission and those who do not. Those suffering from schizophrenia or assessed as “very psychotic or very unwell”, said Lee, are admitted straight to the ward. The other group of patients are placed in an observation ward, an open area with six beds. “The staff will take care of the patient and … observe the patient’s behaviour because sometimes the patient may not tell us the truth or they’re very guarded,” he added. Patients can be kept in the observation ward for up to 23 hours, and the clinical team assessing them would contact the family members to ascertain the patient’s background, situation and medical history. “After 23 hours, if we still feel that their condition isn’t well … then they’d be admitted,” said Lee. “If we assess that the acute risk is over, we’d discharge them.” Most patients under observation are “adjustment cases”. This means they face some form of acute pressure, such as a child who refuses to go to school, a couple quarrelling or a conscript unable to cope with military life. “We also don’t want to put them in a psychiatric ward,” said Lee. “We don't know what the … psychiatric diagnosis is either. We have to be fair … (as) these are mainly acute stresses.” Where patients are warded immediately, some of them may have been brought in by the police and “assessed by the attending doctor (as) an acute danger to himself or even to others”. “(If) the patient refuses to be admitted, then we’d use what we call a formalised admission … whereby the patient is admitted against (his or her) wish,” added Lee. Usually, patients escorted by the police or sent by the courts — for example to determine if they have any psychiatric condition — must enter Emergency Services via a separate entrance and are housed in a different area. This is necessary as other patients “may be traumatised by those in handcuffs”, Lee said. “We don’t want patients who are coming for treatment (to) get worried, seeing this patient … screaming away or intoxicated.” The staff also work with the police in regard to patients who had been suicidal and were brought to Emergency Services. In these cases, the clinical staff must determine the suicide risk by, for example, ascertaining whether it is the first suicide attempt or there have been other attempts. Those with a pre-existing psychiatric condition, such as depression and schizophrenia, would be taken more seriously, cited Lee, as with those who have written a suicide note or made a will, or perhaps those with poor family support. Where the suicide risk is high, the patient is typically kept for observation or warded immediately. “We take it in a holistic manner. A lot depends on the clinical judgement,” said Lee. His team act as gatekeepers, determining the relevant cases for admission. Patients who do not require tertiary psychiatric care can be channelled back into the community, where they can find support at various FSCs. The misconception many people have, he said, is that those who suffer from a severe mental disorder must be admitted. “The diagnosis may be severe, but currently (the condition) may be mild,” he pointed out. “A lot of patients with schizophrenia are functioning in the community, contributing to the workforce. They aren’t a danger to others or to themselves.” He advised patients with minor psychiatric conditions to seek help from general practitioners with psychiatric knowledge, instead of waiting at the IMH’s Emergency Services. The department also has a Mobile Crisis Team, who can be despatched to an existing IMH patient’s home to provide support when needed. Moving forward, telemedicine may play a bigger role in reducing travel among both existing and new patients, especially during this pandemic, said Lee. This has already started for some IMH patients from nursing homes — they can be screened in situ, which saves on the travel time too. “Tele-psychiatry is the best way to prevent unnecessary movement of staff in the community and reduce exposure to the virus,” said Lee. “It can also reduce the stigma (attached to patients visiting the IMH).”"
MOH reviewing community support for people with mental health conditions, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-moh-reviewing-community-support-13210776,Tang See Kit,06 Oct 2020 01:59PM,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is reviewing the community support available for people with mental health conditions or suspected of having them, including “current legislative levers”. It has been working with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to develop such services but noted the need for better support. “MOH recognises that there is a need to better support persons with or suspected with mental health needs and displaying challenging behaviours in the community,” Parliamentary Secretary at the ministry, Rahayu Mahzam, said in Parliament on Tuesday (Oct 6). “MOH is currently reviewing the enablers for the community support required, which include the current legislative levers,” she added. Currently, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (MHCTA) allows the state to intervene for persons with or suspected to have mental health illnesses, and who may be a risk to themselves or others. The police can apprehend the person and take him or her to a doctor for an assessment or to a psychiatric institution for treatment. The processes empowered under MHCTA apply even if treatment is declined by the person or the person’s relatives, said Mdm Rahayu. MOH’s approach, however, is to “intervene early” before the need to enforce mandatory psychiatric evaluation and treatment, by reaching out to persons facing mental health issues and their families to encourage them to seek help voluntarily. She said the ministry has worked with AIC to develop support services under the Community Mental Health Masterplan. The agency has set up 43 community outreach teams as of end-2019. These teams have reached out to more than 300,000 persons and provided assistance to over 23,000 people at risk of developing mental health conditions or dementia, Mdm Rahayu told the House. The AIC has also trained over 24,000 frontline staff from government agencies and community partners across Singapore, she added. Mdm Rahayu was responding to a parliamentary question from People's Action Party (PAP) Member of Parliament Murali Pillai on whether the powers of MHCTA can be expanded to allow intervention when a mentally disordered person being cared for by relatives is not allowed psychiatric treatment even when there is no ill treatment or neglect. Mr Murali, MP for Bukit Batok SMC, said he had filed the parliamentary question based on a case in his constituency. “The case involved a mentally disordered young man whose parents refuse to allow him to be treated by IMH (Institute of Mental Health) as they believe in religious and spiritual intervention. ""The final report from AIC was that if the family refuses to cooperate, there cannot be any intervention under the current legislative landscape because he is physically well taken care of and he doesn't pose a safety risk,” said Mr Murali. “I was advised to tell the neighbors to file a complaint with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal, as the young man screams very loudly in the middle of the night from time to time,” he added. “Respectfully, I don't think this advice … is useful.” While he is glad to hear of a review, Mr Murali asked if MOH would be prepared to direct agencies to engage and work collaboratively with spiritual and religious healers in the meantime. He cited previous researches done by the IMH, which noted “a significant treatment gap” in Singapore with more than three-quarter of mentally disordered people not seeking professional help. Among those who seek some form of help, 24 per cent turned to religious and spiritual healers. Mdm Rahayu replied that MOH is aware of the case raised by Mr Murali. She noted that improving support for people with mental health conditions in the community remains “a work in progress”, even though much has been done over the years. The Community Mental Health Masterplan was launched in 2012. The Government also said in 2017 that it would further enhance and expand mental health services over the next few years. Among the initiatives, mental health and dementia services have been made available in more than half of the polyclinics here. More than 210 General Practitioner partners have also been trained to diagnose and support persons with mental health conditions. “A lot has been done and a lot will continue to have to be done, and it is indeed important to enhance these efforts,” said Mdm Rahayu, adding that MOH is also working closely with healthcare institutions, community health partners, other agencies like the Police, and grassroots organisations to build up community networks. “So the suggestion that the member has raised – working with religious partners – is something that we can definitely look into.” “As mentioned, MOH is already reviewing the enablers for the community support. We will take members’ feedback and input in consideration during this review and assess the appropriate approaches and recourse that we can take to address such cases in the community,” she added. A separate parliamentary question from Radin Mas SMC PAP MP Melvin Yong wanted to know when the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Health will be published and whether it could be expedited to better support workers suffering from mental health related issues arising from the workplace. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had said earlier this year during its Committee of Supply that an advisory will be issued to help employers improve mental well-being in the workplace. The advisory will highlight initiatives companies should emulate, and that could include access to anonymised external counselling service, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early. Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said on Tuesday that the ministry is “on track” to publish the advisory in the fourth quarter, with consultation ongoing with employers, unions, mental health professionals and civil society groups. In the meantime, an inter-agency advisory published in April on how to support mental health well-being of workers under COVID-19 work arrangements can serve as a useful reference, he said. The advisory has a list of external resources that employers can consider engaging to provide support for their workers’ mental health. Employers can also initiate support to help their workers, said Mr Zaqy. For instance, supervisors can check in regularly with their workers, talk to them to find out if they are facing any problems and refer them to external help if needed."
Commentary: What good is doing push-ups for mental health?, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/push-up-challenge-for-mental-health-singapore-suicides-covid-19-13238174,Anthea Ong,10 Oct 2020 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: Remember the Ice Bucket Challenge which soaked the world in 2014? It was specific, accessible and fun, but also empathetic. The act of pouring ice over oneself simulates the experience of muscle stiffness that people diagnosed with ALS - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - feel. If you could not meet the challenge, you were asked to donate US$100 to the ALS Association.   Beyond awareness, the viral challenge also helped create a scientific breakthrough. It raised US$115 million - five times more funds than the previous year - allowing the Association to speed up research.  This in turn identified a new gene, NEK1, which contributes to the rare neurodegenerative disease. This opportunity for real impact may be what is missing from the well-intentioned 25-day #pushupchallenge currently making its rounds in Singapore.  Aiming to “build awareness for anyone who is suffering through mental illness”, the challenge asks the participant to record doing 25 push-ups everyday for 25 days, and to nominate a different person each day.  Unfortunately, the very people that it attempts to support are not clear about how exactly it will help them or the larger mental health community.  A colleague from Hush TeaBar who lives with anxiety and depression told me she “cannot see the link at all.”  “So what if people can do push-ups? Does that make me feel less alone? No, it doesn't. Does it reduce suicide numbers? No, it doesn't. It just shows me that they're capable of toning their arms”, she said.  Another colleague from A Good Space, who attempted suicide a few years ago, was concerned that the challenge could trivialise the real work needed to create a more inclusive society for mental health.  He said: “What if people think, ‘oh after I do my push-ups, I have done my part’?""    In other words, the push-up challenge might be, as a friend who had an episode last year with depression put it pointedly, “well-meaning but tone deaf”.  This is especially since COVID-19 has illuminated long-existing mental health issues that demand urgent attention and concrete actions.  It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.   The affordability of mental healthcare is now further challenged in light of the economic crisis, with more affected, and for longer.  A single mother I know who has to care for her young boy and elderly mother has had her salary first cut by 50 per cent and another recent reduction that left her with only 25 per cent of her original salary.  Her anxiety is protracted and intensifying yet she cannot afford to seek help.  Affordability also stood out as a predominant concern for two-thirds of the respondents to a public consultation my team of volunteers and I did in preparation for my Budget 2020 debates.  But the issues long predate the pandemic.  In 2016, a survey of 6,126 Singaporeans with mental health conditions by the Institute of Mental Health revealed 78.6 per cent had not sought treatment in the past 12 months, with 74.6 per cent of such respondents citing high costs as a reason.  Suicides are another alarming mental health issue that may be exacerbated by COVID-19.  Last year, Singapore recorded 400 suicides - more than one a day. According to the World Health Organisation, there are as many as 20 suicide attempts for every suicide and many times more suicide ideation per attempt.  A mother in her mid-40s jumped to her death from the top of the block next to mine two months ago. The tragedy happened fifty days after her only son died by suicide from the same spot on the first day of school re-opening in June.  I understand from an informal suicide support group that there were four deaths by suicide of young people within the first week of June alone.  These problems are only too real, affecting people with mental health conditions. A viral challenge should be an excellent opportunity to - quite literally - “push up” actions that directly support such individuals, and make a real impact on the mental health community. This is especially the case when the challenge counts people of influence, including Members of Parliament and celebrities, among its participants.  For example, we might mimic the success of the Ice Bucket Challenge and ask participants to push up or donate directly to community mental healthcare agencies, so they can expand their capacity as well as provide subsidised or free treatment and support for those who are unwell.  For those keen to see structural changes, they could use the challenge as a platform to call for an upward adjustment of Medisave and MediShield to be used for psychiatric treatments, to be on par with other medical treatments.   We could also take a leaf from other push-up challenges around the world to break the silence on suicides here in Singapore.  In 2013, a viral challenge called #22KILL saw celebrities like Dwayne Johnson, Chris Pratt and Chris Evans posting videos of themselves doing 22 push-ups every day for 22 consecutive days. It highlighted an alarming statistic of 22 veteran suicides everyday and was a call to honour the sacrifices of those who have served and yet returned mentally broken.   In fact, I believe this was the first-ever viral push-up challenge for mental health which might assure my colleague from Hush that push-ups were appropriate and intuitive for this specific challenge, given the symbol for health and the military context.  Unfortunately, this link between push-ups and mental health certainly got lost along the way.  Similarly, Australia launched a #pushforbetter national challenge for 21 days from May 11-31 this year.  The aim was for individuals and teams to complete 3,046 push ups to highlight the devastating number of Australian lives lost to suicide in 2018. The challenge also raised over A$5 million for headspace, a National Youth Mental Health Foundation.  Apart from highlighting the alarming number of suicides, many suicide-related groups, such as Caring for Life and Samaritans of Singapore, do important work and could benefit from direct support from participants of the challenge.  Or the Please Stay Movement, an advocacy group of suicide-bereaved parents, who recently urged the Government to establish a national suicide prevention office.  This follows a similar call I made in Parliament for a national strategy towards zero suicides, so as to give the cause a national profile and adequate resourcing.  Beyond calling for changes to the affordability of mental healthcare or advocating for suicide prevention, one of the most important things one can do is to start with oneself.  After all, we must be the change that we want to see in the world, as Mahatma Gandhi so wisely put it.    I had my own brush with depression 14 years ago from a broken heart, a broken marriage and a broken business leaving me with only S$16.  That night, awash with shame and despair, I even contemplated the distance between the windows of my 18th floor apartment and the ground below.  It seemed impossible then to get out of that deep dark place. I only managed to emerge because of the strong support system and inner resources I had, and still have.  Everybody deserves them but not everyone has them.   We are responsible for each other’s mental well-being. Studies have found that social support plays an important role in mental health or substance use problems.  For example, people who are clinically depressed report lower levels of social support than people who are not currently depressed. And the opposite is true: People who feel more connected to others have lower levels of anxiety and depression. What personal change or action can we also commit to in order to make a difference?  How can we nudge each other through this viral challenge to reach out, to listen and to hold space for difficult conversations to support those who are struggling with mental health challenges?  What concrete steps can we take to provide the social support that could save someone we know from that downward slippery slope? Can we relate to how it feels to have mental health difficulties, without pouring ice over ourselves?  Like all viral challenges, this 25-day #pushupchallenge will pass one day. Sadly, the same cannot be said with certainty of the challenges of those who have to live with mental health conditions - and these numbers are increasing.  But we can make use of its current popularity far more effectively and intentionally, to ease the difficulties faced by the latter.  These specific calls to action improve affordability of mental healthcare, supporting suicide prevention as well as making that personal change for a more mental health-friendly and inclusive society.  With these aims, perhaps the person doing it would then make each push-up count, and truly uplift those who are actually struggling. "
Commentary: Will you hire and retain persons with mental health conditions?, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/discriminatory-hiring-persons-with-mental-health-12530752,Anthea Ong,15 Mar 2020 06:04AM,"SINGAPORE: The problem of mental health among employees in Singapore is real. Four in 10 Singaporeans had gross misconceptions and therefore prejudices about persons with mental health conditions. These were but some of the findings in the Attitudes Study on Persons with Mental Health conditions by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2018. The same study also found that nearly one in two Singaporeans are unwilling to work with colleagues facing mental health issues. The Singapore Mental Health Survey 2016 revealed that the rate of unemployment among those with at least one mental disorder was 8.3 per cent which was significantly higher than the 4.8 per cent rate of unemployment in those without mental illness. In December 2019, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices announced (TAFEP) updated its guidelines to employers that asking job applications to declare their mental health conditions without good reason is discriminatory - a move that many had advocated for many years, which I also echoed in my maiden speech in Parliament in November 2018.  Last week at the Committee of Supply debate, in response to my and other MPs’ questions, the Ministry of Manpower announced that a tripartite advisory on mental well-being will be issued in the second half of this year to educate employers on what could be done. Despite these steps in the right direction, many have asked me to talk about the elephant in the room: Are these efforts and measures enough to make employers hire and retain persons with mental health issues? Yes, because there are real benefits to doing so. Today, evidence shows that investing in workplace mental well-being is not only the right thing but also the smart thing to do as it improves productivity and long-term business sustainability. A 2017 survey of 505 companies by NCSS found that for every S$1 invested in workplace adjustment (like flexible work arrangements, job redesign, peer training) to support persons recovering from mental health conditions, it generated an average return of S$5.60 through a reduction in absenteeism and medical claims as well as an increase in productivity. In fact, I think the real elephant in the room is this: With one in seven people in Singapore experiencing a mental health condition in their lifetime, employers know they cannot pretend that mental health and well-being is someone else’s problem because part of our workforce will have to grapple with mental health conditions while under employment. With young adults most at risk of suffering from mental disorders in Singapore as reported in the Singapore Mental Health Study, hiring and talent retention practices must clearly evolve now to support these millennial employees so that businesses can thrive in the future economy. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. There has been a groundswell of community efforts in recent years to raise and promote awareness of mental health. Beyond the Label, an anti-stigma campaign launched by NCSS in 2018, helped start a much needed national conversation on mental health. Recognising that leaders play a key role in integrating well-being in their company because they shape the company’s culture, 25 C-suite leaders from public and private sectors joined me to start the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup (WLW) in May 2018 to share, discuss and co-create fair and inclusive practices to support employee mental health as a strategic priority. Many wonder how employers would view them if they come forward to share their mental health challenges. I think there is nothing more powerful in creating a safe and destigmatising environment than bosses and leaders taking the first step to share their own mental health journeys. Accenture, a WLW leader, is a trailblazer in creating such psychological safety in their workplaces. Sharing his own story of coping with anxiety, Senior Partner Pavan Sethi certainly led by example and helped create a space of trust for his team members to understand that should they face mental health difficulties, they aren’t any less valued. Here are some examples from a handful of our WLW leaders on how they employ and support persons with mental health conditions: At Johnson & Johnson, “mental health diplomats” are employees with lived experiences of mental conditions and allies who encourage peer-to-peer conversations about mental health and well-being. At Aviva and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), they have in place necessary coaching, counselling and peer support structures alongside flexible work arrangement policies for employees who live with mental health conditions. NCSS is a pioneer in Singapore with training 22 wellness warriors in mental health first aid to be “first respondents” for distressed colleagues. It has also produced a Mental Health Toolkit for Employers. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be, in my view, even more progressive and adaptive in their attraction and retention strategies, given the local talent war with larger employers and reducing dependence on foreign manpower. Hush TeaBar was founded to promote mental wellness and empathy with silence and tea in workplaces, out of my own brush with depression when my world collapsed around me 13 years ago. The team is made up entirely of seven differently-abled employees - Deaf persons and persons who live with mental health conditions and learning difficulties. For almost two years now, the team has been running all projects for large MNCs and schools, even creating our current campaign to distribute our specially designed self-care kits to healthcare workers, completely on their own. Yes, we have had to make many workplace adjustments and job redesign but I see that as precious lessons in adaptability and innovation as Hush continues to thrive with these dedicated and resilient employees who are able to fulfill their true potential.  Minister of State for Manpower and National Development Zaqy Mohamad mentioned in parliament last week pilots and police officers as professions in which good mental health is important. Some may even say that for jobs like doctors, teachers and bus drivers we must surely insist on good mental health as a prerequisite. Yet this is the paradigm shift we need to make. Mental health is not just good or bad, nor now or never - it is a continuum because our environment and life events play a significant role in our mental wellbeing.  We mustn’t forget that “human” comes first when we talk about   resources or  capital. Former CEO of the HSBC Group John Flint started a very progressive conversation with the bank’s 238,000 employees across 55 countries on how to be the best version of themselves. Among those who have gone through mental health conditions, John learnt that “they are the ones who often possess a resilience, a resourcefulness, an empathy and an EQ that the rest do not possess”. I cannot agree more. Resilient companies are built from resilient employees, and every employee is a member of our society."
COVID-19: Worries about pandemic see more calls to mental health helplines, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-fear-toll-mental-health-hotline-anxiety-singapore-12631710,Rachel Phua,15 Apr 2020 06:03AM,"SINGAPORE: With so much news circulating about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, freelance yoga teacher Lim Lishan feels more anxious than usual. While she does not usually have anxiety, she has been experiencing a faster heart rate and shallow breathing more often these days.  Ms Lim, who was previously diagnosed with type one bipolar disorder and bulimia nervosa, said: “You keep seeing a lot of news and you hear people around you always talking about it, so it does make you feel anxious.  “And there are a lot of fears in people. I feel like this virus has triggered a sense of uncertainty and insecurity, and made people panic more. I'm more sensitive in nature so I feel that it increases my anxiety level.”  Ms Lim is just one of the Singaporeans whose mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 situation, feeling anxious and uncertain about the future.  Calls from new clients to mental health hotlines have gone up, while existing clients have expressed fresh worries about their health and the economic fallout, according to mental health organisations and counsellors CNA spoke to.  Worldwide, the number of calls made to mental health hotlines has jumped as well, according to news reports. Calls to US federal crisis hotline Disaster Distress Helpline spiked 891 per cent in March year-on-year, CNN reported. In China, hotlines that sprung up in response to the COVID-19 outbreak were inundated by callers, Reuters said.  For digital marketing freelancer Vivien Yap, 24, who experiences depressive symptoms, she did not feel as anxious about the situation as much as she thought she would at first.  “When it happened, I felt slightly better because it felt like the whole world was on my level … And it really just felt like the whole world was depressed as well, everyone was going through the same uncertainty.” However, she started feeling more anxious when she received a notice from her employer informing her that her pay would be cut by 25 to 30 per cent, shortly after the circuit breaker measures were announced on Apr 3.  Ms Yap, who is also a local musician, is in the middle of producing her next music release, and was worried about her expenses.  “My pay is being cut by 25 to 30 per cent, that’s quite a lot of money, but I still need to support and pay the people who are helping me (with my music).  “And I don’t want to tell them, ‘hey we’re in tough times can we slow down the payment?’ because I know (for the arts freelancers) it’s really far worse. So that’s when the anxiety kicked in for me.”  Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore’s (SOS) chief executive Gasper Tan said that they received an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019. The Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) observed an increase in phone calls to several services as well. The SAMH Insight Centre, which provides counselling services, saw an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020, it said.  Sessions on Fei Yue Community Services’ online counselling portal eC2.sg surged last month, a spokesperson said. The number of chats more than doubled in March this year to 85, after averaging about 40 chats a month in 2018 and 2019.  According to the various organisations, callers have brought up a range of issues, from their employment prospects - some have lost their jobs, while others will graduate to a potentially bleak employment market - to their increasing fear of catching the invisible pathogen, especially if they were to pass it to their loved ones unknowingly.  With schools and workplaces shutting down, and restrictions on movements in play, individuals may start to feel a lack of control over their situation as well, leading to more stress that gets harder to manage, said the Fei Yue spokesperson.  “The fear, anxiety and the loss of a sense of control over a prolonged period of time can be detrimental to one’s mental health,” added Mr Tan.  “Being exposed to prolonged stress may be overwhelming to an individual with intense feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness.” Attendance at some counselling services has been consistent, but some existing clients have been raising issues related to the virus, they say.  Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist from Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic, said that the nature of the content within the appointments has “shifted drastically”.  “The pandemic has affected people in different ways: For some it has given increased anxiety, for others it has created a hyper-vigilance over health-related issues.” Individuals that are accustomed to a routine and a specific level of socialisation may find it hard to shift their lifestyle patterns, she said, adding that pressure levels among those with mental health conditions may compound as they struggle to adapt to the crisis while dealing with already-present stressors. Given that the virus is invisible to the human eye, some people have become paranoid about their safety, she added, producing “an attitude of hypervigilance and overthinking where prolonged fear can negatively impact their mental well-being”. Youth mental health non-profit Limitless has similarly not seen an uptick in people asking for help, its founder Asher Low said, but their beneficiaries have been expressing unease over factors stemming from COVID-19.  “Some are genuinely concerned about not being able to get jobs, some are concerned about money, some are concerned about losing family members, quite a few are just very affected by the isolation,” he said.  To be mentally healthy during this period, be committed about staying connected with friends and family members, the mental health advocates said.  “Maintaining a strong social connection, either through social media, texts or calls, is as important as prioritising a healthy diet and sleep pattern,” SOS’ Mr Tan said. “This period is also an opportunity to catch up and engage in meaningful conversations with family members.” And for those who need someone to confide in - there is no shame in reaching out, the counsellors said. There are hotlines to call - including a national one rolled out on Friday - and mental well-being webinars to join. For example, Brahm Centre has launched daily workout sessions and mindfulness workshops that participants can join either via Facebook Live or Zoom.  Instead of harping on the constraints, view the ‘circuit breaker’ as a chance to do something meaningful as well, they said, like signing up for a course online, gardening or learning a new recipe. “Focus on things that are within your control,” Dr Lazaroo said. “It is important to acknowledge your own limits, and do small activities that can improve your self-care and strengthen your resilience.”  “Practise mindfulness, gratitude, self-compassion and living in the moment.”"
Commentary: There is rarely a right time to talk about your mental health when you’re dating – but do it anyway, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/talking-about-mental-health-dating-sites-relationship-lovenn-13272542,Grace Yeoh,16 Oct 2020 06:04AM,"SINGAPORE: To gauge the temperature of a body of water, dip your toes in or run your fingers over the surface before you take the plunge. Just like you would usually look before you leap, it is generally ill-advised to reveal more personal details about one’s life before you get to know someone better.  Such details, unfortunately, include the condition of one’s mental health. It’s important to normalise talk about mental health, but discussing yours so early in the dating process seems akin to throwing the other party overboard into the sea without warning – then expecting them to swim. Not only might you face a range of unwanted reactions, from pity to uneasiness, ironically you might even end up having to comfort the person you’re disclosing yourself to.   But if the last half a year of unprecedented uncertainty revealed anything, it’s the urgent need to start talking about our mental health, from daily anxieties to more severe diagnoses.    In Singapore, national helplines were set up for anyone needing assistance with mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing economic recession, so they could speak to trained personnel. In addition, Beyond the Label’s mental health awareness month from Sep 19 to Oct 30 has ignited an increase in social media conversations. Some public figures discussed their own mental health, while others participated in the 25-day #pushupchallenge to raise awareness about mental illness. On Oct 10, we celebrated World Mental Health Day – a day that felt extra significant amidst unparalleled anxiety about our future.   But our discourse around mental health progresses when we can move beyond discussing it at a policy level, and begin talking about it casually and candidly in our everyday interactions and relationships. In the dating scene, however, this can feel particularly nerve wracking. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Those of us who’ve had the fortune, or misfortune, of using a dating app understand the dating industry is propped up by a cycle of approval and rejection, only fuelling our insecurities and, in some cases, affecting our mental health. Figuring out when to touch on vulnerable issues, like a complicated family background or a previous abusive relationship, remains one of the most crucial milestones in any relationship.  But faced with potential commitment to a shared future that requires intimate conversations, some might choose to bail. That is the reason a new local dating app that’s launching later in the year, Lovenn, aims to foster an “honest” dating culture through a premise that encourages users to “share their criteria, deal-breakers and imperfections right at the start before matching”. I have my doubts, but as many say, a cynic is just a disappointed romantic. Speaking with founder and CEO Vernice Yap, she shares that the app allows users to “appreciate mutual fundamental compatibility beyond just physical attraction” and normalises sharing imperfections, resulting in “an environment that’s safer for everyone’s mental health”. This might seem ideal to weed out the ones who would take issue with the state of your mental health eventually. But being more vulnerable than usual before you even know the other person requires radical courage and faith.  It’s like diving into the deep end not knowing if you’d sink or swim. The average person probably doesn’t discuss mental health upfront because they don’t want to be pitied, patronised, dismissed or discriminated against, thanks to the stigma attached even to more “common” conditions like depression. Yet, if we foresee a future with the other party, we must risk diving deep before it’s catastrophically too late. The trick is having the tools to navigate the choppy seas, lest it doesn’t pay off. Basic trust is the most essential tool, but it requires time and shared experiences.  The danger of discussing vulnerable topics from the start is that some might use these issues as a way to create that trust, inadvertently conflating emotional intimacy with emotional intensity. The latter forces a connection that is “too fast, too soon”, potentially making others feel extra uncomfortable. Violet Lim, co-founder of Lunch Actually, likens building trust to filling an emotional bank account.  “When we first meet someone, the emotional bank account is at zero. As you share positive things, you build up the account. When the account is full enough, you can start drawing from it,” she explains. “You don’t want to empty it at the start. You need to build a strong foundation – let someone know your other personality traits. Eventually, when you start sharing about your mental health, there’s a higher chance they’d say, ‘It’s okay, I already know you.’” In this case, mutual trust is necessary to ensure you’re seen as a multidimensional human being, who won’t be reduced to your mental health condition if you decide to open up.  Once basic trust is established, and you sense that you and your partner might be ready to get more serious, the first step is to test the waters. “The bottom five per cent of our lives are things you’d reveal only to those closest to you. Share the bottom 20 per cent, see how they react, then go deeper if their reaction is okay,” says Lim. Alternatively, try disclosing mental conditions by sharing how specific symptoms manifest, such as having a depressed mood makes it hard to feel enthusiastic about activities sometimes, rather than using the label or diagnosis to begin the conversation.  This can be even more important if your symptoms might not present themselves explicitly.  “For example, people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) might find it less helpful to use the label because people tend to have a certain negative impression of BPD,” says Andrea Chong, a senior clinical psychologist from the Institute of Mental Health. Instead, reveal your condition by sharing the things that you might struggle with in relationships, such as fear of abandonment or heightened insecurity in certain situations, she suggests.   If all else fails, my personal favourite is opting for self-deprecating humour.  A viral tweet goes: “I love when guys on dating apps ask, ‘How is a gorgeous girl like you single?’ I’m mentally ill, Brandon.” I, for one, have saved a screenshot for future purposes.  Once you’ve laid your cards on the table, however, the other party might call it quits. While rejection might sting, it’s a better outcome than keeping significant information under wraps, especially if your condition tends to reveal itself over time.  For example, explains Chong, someone with social anxiety would have difficulty in social settings and someone on long-term medication might show visible side effects. If the other party doesn’t know how to respond initially, it shouldn’t be an indication of how much they value you.  “Many people aren’t equipped to handle these situations. Just because they can’t offer the emotional support we want at first, doesn’t mean they don’t love us,” says Lim. If they appear to be overwhelmed, Chong recommends checking in with them, asking if it’s too much information, letting them know you’re ready to answer any questions or that you can revisit the issue at a later date.  It’s also helpful to let them know they’re not expected to ‘fix’ you or be their pseudo-therapist.  The most important thing isn’t that they offer unconditional acceptance and understanding from the start, but that they’re willing to try getting there.  This effort doesn’t just indicate support, but reflects open-mindedness – a trait that’s crucial in building a long-term relationship regardless of mental health.   Even though the deep end might be occasionally frightening, having someone tread water with you keeps you from drowning. One day, you might even learn to swim. "
"Jobs, mental health and the environment: What MPs said in the debate on Singapore's post-pandemic strategy ", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jobs-mental-health-environment-parliament-debate-covid-19-13282354,Rachel Phua,14 Oct 2020 07:02PM,"SINGAPORE: A total of 22 Members of Parliament (MPs) spoke on Wednesday (Oct 14) in response to Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s ministerial statement last week when he laid out a roadmap for Singapore’s post-COVID-19 economy. They touched on a range of issues, from improving job security to supporting vulnerable groups and the challenges faced by residents working from home. Here is what some members of the House said about how the country can better respond to the COVID-19 crisis:  “It is heartening that amidst depressing news of mass retrenchments and job losses, there are still many job openings to be filled … but perhaps MOM (Ministry of Manpower) could share more about … what are the targets set for successful job matches and how will the various agencies measure the effectiveness of outreach efforts.”  “Why are Singaporeans losing out in the job market in our own country? Employers repeatedly cite the lack of creativity and risk-taking, not to mention poor communication skills as reasons for this. Our grade-centric education system was also cited as a contributory factor. In addition to facing competition for jobs from foreigners, we are increasingly facing competition from machines as well … with digitalisation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is even greater urgency to hasten the pace of education reform as old methods of teaching and learning become obsolete.”  “An effort to improve mental health is not only good for the self but good for our country. Psychological defence is an underlying key pillar of our total defence and it will serve Singapore well when any Singaporean - even at their most mentally vulnerable - can trust that society at large will also have their back.”  “In recent parliamentary sittings, I have repeatedly highlighted the challenges faced by our workers who telecommute. They must juggle multiple responsibilities, such as looking after children, taking care of elderly parents, and trying to remain productive at work. To make matters worse, because they work from home, their bosses think that it is easier for them to answer work-related calls and emails, at any time of the day, even after office hours. Workplace burnout has become an issue, as many employees are not well-rested.”  “The S$500 to S$1000 top-up in SkillsFuture credit is useful to enable Singaporeans to take up new courses and for them to pick up new skills. However, there always remains groups of individuals like the low-wage workers and special needs communities who, even before COVID-19, have been unable to take up courses for personal upgrade. Their reasons for not doing so are varied. Some because they have to balance multiple jobs, others - caregiving duties, lack of funds, or lack of suitable courses catered to them in language or academic qualifications. They are left out from being able to upgrade not due to lack of will, but more a lack of time and the need to first survive.”  “I appeal to the Government and its agencies to make an additional effort to provide a better living and learning environment for the underprivileged children. In a knowledge-intensive future, these children will not stand a chance if they live in overcrowded flats with access to borrowed equipment, limited or slow connectivity, and minimal adult supervision and guidance. We may need to tighten our collaboration with the volunteer groups and private companies which are willing to sponsor and mentor these children as well.”  “They are often left on their own to deal with their unemployment and its many associated adverse effects. This is unlike those in lower-paying jobs who have benefited from the many government schemes. Specifically, many in this age group have high mortgages to pay, schooling children and elderly to look after. The challenge for them is not just to get any job, but one that gives them a minimal sustenance income. ""It is well and good to say: 'Go for training, upgrade your skills.' But realistically when you are in your 50s, 60s, with mounting bills and financial commitments, you don’t have the luxury of time and resources to pursue a new career. To them, such exhortations are meaningless slogans.” “We want to make sure that Singaporeans and businesses who need help would not need to jump through hoops or wade through red tape to qualify for funding. For example, many staying in property with an annual value of more than S$21,000 but do not own the property and yet need some help, could not qualify for many of the COVID-19 support grants. Could MOF consider relaxing the criteria?”  “Here I would like to be very clear that I am not for their own during of resources built up by the blood, sweat and tears of the generations who came before us. In fact just as DPM has mentioned, I believe in the need to exercise prudence when planning for the future. However, we need to acknowledge that the current weak economic environment requires sufficiently accommodative fiscal policy instead of contractionary fiscal policies such as raising taxes on consumption, which might in turn lower consumer spending. We should be focusing on policies that aim to stimulate and boost domestic demand and keep our economy growing.”  “Sustainability at the forefront of economic recovery should not be underestimated. The World Economic Forum has in fact called on all countries to pursue, and I quote, 'a great reset. A great commitment to build a fairer, more sustainable and more resilient future following the COVID crisis.' I can’t agree more - may I take the opportunity to ask the Government for an update on our efforts in the past seven to eight months since unity budget and for an assurance that Singapore is on track to meet our goals and timelines for the Paris Agreement (to cut emissions intensity by 36 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels).”  - "
New task force set up to improve support for migrant workers' mental health, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mom-task-force-improve-support-migrant-workers-mental-health-13479636,Chew Hui Min,06 Nov 2020 09:28PM,"SINGAPORE: A task force has been set up to improve awareness of mental health issues among migrant workers and to provide better support for those who need such care, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Friday (Nov 6).  Named Project Dawn, the 10-member task force involves representatives from the MOM, government psychologists, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), as well as the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) and HealthServe - two non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that help migrant workers. Some mental health support initiatives have been put into place, and HealthServe has been providing tele-counselling services, conducted via Zoom or on the phone with the workers in their native languages. HealthServe said that it had noticed a gap in this area before the COVID-19 pandemic and was able to quickly extend its nascent mental health programme during the circuit breaker, when coronavirus cases surged among migrant workers and many were quarantined in their dormitories. MOM has also started training Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) officers, who are stationed at dormitories to help migrant workers, in psychological first aid, and will extend such training to all new and existing FAST officers. Psychological first aid is often used to support people in the aftermath of a crisis and involves giving both emotional support and practical help to them. More initiatives will be rolled out and the task force aims to implement them by end-2022, said Dr Lam Meng Chon, director (medical) of MOM's Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group as he outlined the task force's implementation plan at a media briefing on Friday. ""We see the implementation of Project Dawn as building blocks - we are first looking at raising awareness in good mental health practices as the base layer ... (then) strengthening primary care to improve access to mental health services,"" he said. A third layer of prevention would be to ensure that those who need specialist care get help and continued support for recovery.  For a start, NGOs such as MWC will include mental health education in its programme to help new migrant workers settle in from next year, while more frontline officers, dormitory operators and employers will be trained to better detect at-risk workers and refer them for care, if necessary. Social well-being activities such as excursions with managed itineraries will also be organised in the dormitories, MOM added. ""We are working with our frontline teams and NGOs to ... establish peer support networks that can (be) the first line of defence within the dormitories and offer para-counselling,"" said Dr Lam. The task force will work with MWC's ambassador network to identify ""peer support leaders"", as well as recruit recovered workers who are willing to act as intermediaries for their peers. Mr Bava Sahib, an MWC ambassador for five years and deputy property officer at The Leo dormitory, said that the ambassadors have been helping migrant workers with their issues, such as disputes with employers. During the pandemic, they monitored workers for depression and helped them seek help. Mr Bava and a fellow MWC ambassador told CNA that the workers faced various stressful challenges during the pandemic. Besides not being able to go out and meet their friends, some have lost their jobs, some have not been paid their salaries and some have faced difficulty going home despite having urgent family issues.  ""We have a large number of ambassadors in the dormitories of different nationalities ... If any workers have any mental pressure or depression, anything ... immediately our ambassadors refer them to us,"" he said. Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng told reporters that moving forward, such mental health support for migrant workers will not just be a permanent feature, but also a ""work in progress"". ""We're committed to making sure that we're not focused on just the physical wellness but also the mental well-being of the migrant workers. I think that's most important. ""Obviously, this is an ecosystem that is evolving rapidly,"" said Dr Tan, who added that many organisations, in particular NGOs, have come forward to make this possible, and he hopes more will come forward. He also said that he hopes people will become more accepting of mental health issues, such as depression, which can happen to anyone due to stressful situations."
"The Big Read: With youths more open about mental health, it’s time others learn to listen", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-youths-suicide-depression-listen-11994612,Janice Lim,14 Oct 2019 06:20AM,"SINGAPORE: Three weeks into depression, 27-year-old Clement (not his real name) was told to “get over it”. When Rachel (not her real name), 26, suffered from psychosis, she was told to ""think about children dying in Africa"". After a suicide attempt, Ms Nawira Baig was told that she did not know how to appreciate life. The 27-year-old has been living with bipolar disorder for the past 10 years, which causes her to experience bouts of depression. The words uttered might seem innocuous enough to those around them and may be well-intended, but for people with mental health conditions like Clement, Rachel and Ms Baig, hearing them from their family and close friends made them feel worse. “For people who want to end their life, it’s because it’s very painful. We don’t know how to deal with this and we cannot bear this any longer. It doesn’t help when people don’t understand and there is no support,” said Ms Baig, 27, who is working in the mental health sector. While hurt, Clement, Rachel and Ms Baig did not blame the people who made those remarks, attributing them to a lack of awareness and understanding.  But as the global community observed World Mental Health Day on Thursday (Oct 10), those interviewed by TODAY — including mental health professionals and advocates, bereaved parents and youths who have mental illness — believed that there is much scope for Singaporean youths to be taught emotional and mental literacy, in order to bring about greater mental wellness in society. Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong, for example, has been advocating for mental health education to be made mandatory in schools. A more preventive approach to the issue is needed, she said.  A study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in December last year found that young adults are most at risk of suffering from mental disorders in Singapore. Those aged between 18 and 34 are more likely to have experienced bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, alcohol abuse, and obsessive compulsive disorder. For years, mental health awareness campaigns have focused on the social stigma surrounding mental illness, and efforts to change people’s perceptions have borne fruit. According to the experts and observers interviewed, Singaporeans’ attitudes towards mental illness and their knowledge of it have vastly improved compared with a decade ago. However, mental health professionals say that preventive work needs to be done alongside destigmatisation efforts, and that includes learning the appropriate language to use when speaking to a family or a friend who has a mental health condition, and what actions to take when they are in severe distress. According to a Forbes article published earlier this week, more and more schools in the United States are adding social-emotional learning to their curriculum. The United Kingdom has also unveiled plans to make wellbeing education universal in schools by 2020. Several young Singaporeans told TODAY that they simply do not know what to do when they find themselves or their friend emotionally distressed.  When a friend confided in 20-year-old Dai Zhuxuan that he had depression, the university student said she was not sure what she could say to make him feel better. “I was scared I might say something wrong… I tried to tell him that it was not as bad as he thought, like everything would be okay. But I don’t think it really helped,” she said. Part of that preventive approach also includes building up emotional resilience among the young, which teaches them how to manage their emotions, what are the signs and symptoms when they are emotionally distressed, and how to seek help. “Whenever there is a report on suicide statistics, then everyone starts talking about it… ‘We need a focus group on this or that, start funding for this or that’. But these things have been happening all the time,” said Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of Silver Ribbon, a non-profit organisation focusing on mental health issues. “Why don’t we focus on the wellness and not the illness? Learn to take care of yourself and manage stress well. Rather than wait until you’re being diagnosed, and then we go ‘okay we have such a programme for you’,” she added. According to IMH, those aged between 19 and 35 make up about 45 per cent of new patients diagnosed with a mental illness each year. The figure, however, does not include those younger than 19 years old, as they would be seen at the child guidance clinic.    The number of 19 to 35-year-olds diagnosed with a mental illness has averaged at about 2,500 annually over the past three years.    IMH’s statistics are not representative of the whole country, as patients may seek help at other hospitals, with psychiatrists at private clinics or with community agencies.    Still, previous news reports have shown that more young people are seeking help for mental health issues. The number of young Singaporeans between the ages of 16 and 30 who sought help from IMH’s Community Health Assessment Team (Chat) from 2015 to 2017 had jumped by 190 per cent.    Meanwhile, over the past five years, the number of 10- to 29-year-olds who died every year due to suicide was between 73 and 106 — making up around 22 per cent of the total number of deaths by suicide in the same period, based on data from the report on registration of births and deaths by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).    Suicide still remains the leading cause of death for youths aged between 10 and 29, said Ms Wong Lai Chun, the senior assistant director of Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), the only suicide prevention agency here that offers a 24-hour hotline.    The prevalence of suicide mortality among youths and males is a “significant societal concern”, she said.    Of particular concern is the fact that male teenage suicide in 2018 was at its highest since 1991, a 170 per cent increase from seven deaths in 2017, according to the latest SOS report released in July.    While mental health conditions are risk factors for suicide, not everyone with suicidal ideations have mental health conditions, said Ms Lee Yiping, a youth support worker at Chat, a programme which allows 16 to 30-year-olds to get a free and confidential mental health check.    A person suffering from a mental illness may feel suicidal after a prolonged period of feeling worthless and helpless. But there are some who choose to end their lives after experiencing unforeseen circumstances, such as losing one’s job suddenly, said Ms Lee. The stressors among youth mainly revolve around family or intimate partner relationships, friendships, concerns about academic or work performance, financial worries and stress resulting from life transitions, said mental health professionals, and these have remained pretty much the same over the years. When Luke (not his real name) was 17, the pressure of wanting to meet his parents’ expectations led him to switch to a junior college, even though he was very much well-adjusted and enjoying his time at his polytechnic. Now 32, Luke told TODAY that he was under such stress during the transition period between schools that he started developing hallucinations and almost jumped from his apartment building. For Clement, not being able to get into his dream school after his O-level examinations was the trigger for his depression, which he was officially diagnosed with when he was 17. “I believed deeply that I would only be worthy as a person if I had an accomplishment of note and therefore, this 'failure' not only shattered all the confidence I had in my abilities, it left me in a place wondering ‘If I cannot achieve, then what worth do I have?’” he said. According to Ms Wong, youths may not have yet developed adequate positive coping mechanisms, and may not be aware of the available resources that can help them. “The combination of different stressors may lead youths to feel overwhelmed and not able to cope positively. Maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as self-harm and suicide ideation, then become a possible alternative for youths as a means of coping with overwhelming psychological and emotional pain,” she added. Biologically, the part of the brain that deals with emotions is not as developed among the young, and hence they tend to experience more mood swings compared to adults, said Ms Lee. Due to a lack of life experience, young people may not be able to pick themselves up after facing a failure, believing that it is a reflection that they are not good enough. Apart from the common stressors faced by youths, Ms Lee also pointed out that previously taboo topics — such as struggles over one’s sexual orientation — are beginning to surface. “When we do assessment and young people say they have depression, when we try to find out why, young people in the past may not say it’s because of their sexual orientation. But now increasingly they will say they are queer, or they are homosexual, but they don’t want to speak to their family,” she said.  For 23-year-old Peter (not his real name), a gay individual raised in a Catholic environment, the inability to reconcile his sexual orientation with his religious beliefs was a major factor that added to the mental distress with which he has had to struggle since primary school. While he experienced other traumatic incidents as well, such as growing up in an abusive family, tensions surrounding his sexuality was his most difficult struggle. “You cannot be yourself. (It’s) the pain that comes along with this identity,” said the undergraduate.  Another form of stressor that has emerged recently, said several mental health professionals, is cyberbullying — the result of increased use of technology and social media, especially among the young. “The way they express and call for help have changed as well. In the past, you can spot someone with cutting marks on their arms. Now through social media, they may post such photos also,” said Ms Lee. Mental health professionals generally see social media as a double-edged sword. With several mental health organisations and also government agencies posting their mental health awareness campaigns and resources online, social media can be an avenue for youths to receive positive messages, or find out how and where they can seek help. However, the type of content that youths are exposed to on social media is also largely a result of what is trending. The issue then is whether youths are able to navigate through the social media maze and limit exposure to content that may add to their distress, said Ms Wong Ying Li, the head of youth division at Fei Yue Family Service Centre. Similarly, the debate over whether people should share their mental health struggles on social media drew mixed reactions from the experts interviewed. Such posts could be their own way of calling for help and mental health professionals agree that even a simple checking in from friends on how they are doing would help. But there is a danger that youths are also opening up themselves to online bullying. “No matter what you post, you should be keeping an open mind to get both negative and positive comments. You can’t expect everyone to agree with what you share,” said Ms Poh from Silver Ribbon.  Most youths TODAY spoke to are wary about sharing something as personal as a mental health struggle on social media, well aware of the vitriol that exists in the online space. Those who post about their mental health struggles may end up being accused of trying to attract attention or playing the victim card, said Ms Erica Tay, a 22-year-old university student. However, some of them have seen a few of their friends posting cryptic messages that may imply that they are going through some form of mental distress. Simple messages like “I feel tired” or “I wanna quit school” are things that Ms Tay has seen on her Instagram feed. Though not clinically diagnosed, Joseph (not his real name), 26, who has been experiencing some symptoms of mental health conditions such as restlessness and severe fatigue for more than five years, uses Instagram as an “emotional outlet” and posts song lyrics that reflect his thoughts on mental health and suicide “Taxi driver, be my shrink for the hour, leave the meter running” — the first three verses of the song Bad Religion by singer Frank Ocean — is one example. Jaren Ong, 18, who is currently serving National Service and went through a bout of depression during his junior college days, writes about his experience with depression and anxiety on Instagram. But he does it through an account where he is friends with only 15 people, all of whom are his close associates. As a mother who lost her son to suicide due to depression, Ms Elaine Lek, 55, is exasperated about the role of social media among youth. Before her son, Zen Dylan Koh, passed away in October 2018 when he was almost 18 years old, Ms Lek said he posted about his suicidal ideation and photos of the cuts on his hand on Instagram. “People that follow him, what did they do? They like it. How can they like it? And there was a comment: ‘Oh wait for me, let’s do it together,’” said Ms Lek, who is heading the global brand team at tableware firm Luzerne.  Mental health professionals generally agree that the stigma attached to people with mental illness has lessened, evidenced by the growing number of recovery stories shared by people with mental illness, greater interest among students in the issues of mental health, and increasing number of young people seeking help. According to an online poll last year by the National Youth Council, mental health was among the top 10 concerns among youth. It also found that they generally had positive attitudes towards people with mental health issues. The problem, however, is that youths do not feel equipped to support their friends who are living with a mental health condition. Through TODAY's interviews with several young people who are still living with or have had a mental illness, there were numerous examples of how they felt dismissed and their pain trivialised due to remarks made by people around them. When Rachel first started hallucinating four years ago — a symptom of psychosis — the then-university student was feeling very upset and confided in a close friend. His reaction? “Can you don’t feel like this? You know how many people in Africa are dying?” “That’s when I realise you can’t tell someone in depression to get up and go,” said Rachel, who is a civil servant. Another way people usually respond is by making comparisons, said SOS’ Ms Wong. “Comparisons to the self, or others who may have had it worse may act to invalidate one’s struggles to cope. These comparisons often do not serve as encouragements, but instead reinforces the perception that “you just don’t understand me,’” she added. For Peter, the hurt also comes when people are being too politically correct around him after learning about his history of mental illness. “It’s like ‘that guy has mental health issues, must be careful towards him’. It reduces me to the lowest common denominator, it’s like my entire life is whether or not I will kill myself,” he added. Ms Lee pointed out that people with mental illness should not be made to feel that their identity is defined solely by their mental health. “If I were to tell someone I have been diagnosed with depression, their immediate reaction is ‘how are you feeling today?’ They immediately think that you must be feeling sad and that you are affected by it,” she added. So, what do people with mental health conditions like to see more from the people around them? Just being there, some told TODAY. For Peter, a simple message asking him to go for coffee is more than enough. “The ones who are genuine will relate to you. Not those who make proclamations about how strong I am, saying stuff like ‘wah you went through this, you strong man’, when they are just putting my suffering on a pedestal, thereby eliminating any personal obligation to relate further,"" he said. During the times when Ms Baig was hospitalised, she remembers her friends giving her chocolate cake or painting her nails in the hospital, among other things. “To them, I am still who I am. That never changes. I really value that they did not treat me differently, they didn’t tread cautiously or treat me as fragile,” she said. It is the little things that matter, said Cheryl (not her real name), 21, who has been experiencing anxiety since she was 13. “Trying to regulate my breathing with me while I’m having an anxiety attack, accompanying me to a counselling appointment, or simply sitting with me while I cry to get all the overwhelming emotions out. These things give me strength when I can’t carry on,” she added. It is human nature to offer quick solutions, said the experts. But what is more important is to just listen and validate the feelings of those with mental health conditions, they added. This is especially so for those who are living with chronic mental health issues which could possibly last for a lifetime.  “For them it is not about 'I get cured', but 'I learn to cope with it',” said Fei Yue’s Ms Wong. While these may seem common sense, the experts said these are skill sets that need to be taught. “When you see an old lady crossing the road, you know what to do. These things we take for granted, but we actually learned it… You will never have a 9-year-old boy who have a toothache and not know what to do about it. But you would have a 9-year-old boy who is feeling distressed and despair, and not know what to do and therefore think jumping is an option,” said Ms Ong, the NMP. Such skill sets are missing even among adults. Sometimes, parents themselves can unwittingly hurt their children with mental health conditions.   After seeing his son in a prolonged state of sadness for three months, Clement’s father told him to “get better or get out of the house” in a fit of anger and despair. While Clement recognises that it was tough for his father as well, that incident was “deeply traumatic” for him, causing him to have trust issues till this day. Majority of the youths TODAY spoke to shared that they would not choose to share with their parents any struggles they may be going through, or talk about mental health with them. For some, it is their own parents who were the source of their distress and for others, mental health is an issue that Asian families do not seem to be comfortable talking about. Mental health advocates believe that there is also a need to teach young people, especially those who are still in school, how to build emotional resilience. Ms Lee said that one way to teach young people to be resilient is to let them encounter failures and mistakes, but provide a nurturing environment for them to bounce back from the setbacks. “The support structure, (from parents and friends) is important. Young people need a lot of guidance. Not necessarily teaching them what to do, but to help them process their thoughts,” she added. Besides learning from failures, young people can also build emotional resilience by learning how to regulate their emotions, and by equipping themselves with the tools they can use to soothe themselves when they sense an anxiety episode coming, said mental health professionals. Finding healthier coping mechanisms to manage their stress levels is also one way to build resilience. For some of the young people with mental health conditions interviewed by TODAY, acquiring healthier coping mechanisms is very much a trial-and-error process. Ms Baig, who was initially not aware of how to process the internal pain from her bipolar disorder, resorted to cutting herself and trying to end her own life. Through her recovery process, she realised that journaling and dancing helped her release some of her internal tensions. For Rachel, reading up on mental illness and developing a routine set of activities for the weekend that were focused on herself, such as going to the gym or facial, helped her to overcome the difficult side effects brought about by the cocktail of medication she had to ingest daily. A perspective shift also has helped some of them overcome the inadequacies they feel about themselves. Instead of subscribing to society’s conventional definitions of success, Peter said he learned to “lower his expectations” and find joy in the simplest things, such as being able to make someone else smile. Whenever Cheryl starts to struggle with feelings of guilt and worthlessness, she has learned how to comfort herself by reassuring herself that “it’s okay, because I’m trying my best”. “I continuously work on building my self-love, because to me, the greatest affirmation is the one that comes from within,” she added. With a larger emphasis on mental health and higher incidences of people going through mental distress today, there are those who argue that it may be that young Singaporeans — viewed as part of the “strawberry generation” —  are weak. Mental health professionals disagree, believing it to be an unfair assertion. Ms Lee said: “It’s easy for the older generation to make statements like that. They are speaking from their age now. If we spoke to them in their younger days, if we catch them when they were feeling stressed at that point in time, I do think they will have suicidal thoughts in their mind.” The challenges that youths face today are more complex and nuanced, said Ms Lee. While older generations of Singaporeans did face stresses in the past as well, especially relating to survival matters, young Singaporeans have their own set of challenges. For one, competition is more intense now, with the job market being more globalised. Ms Wong from Fei Yue also pointed out that younger Singaporeans are living in a more connected world with social media. As a result, they are not comparing themselves with just their peers around them, but also with people overseas. She reiterated that negative comments about younger generation may end up reinforcing the stigma associated with mental health conditions. In their bid to not be seen as weak, some youths may end up isolating themselves more, she said. For individuals to learn emotional resilience and how to provide better support to those with mental illness, the experts and youths interviewed say there should be more structured mental health education in schools. “We may be given scientific literacy and numeracy in school. But we are never given emotional and mental help literacy,” said Ms Ong, the NMP. Having experienced the feeling of loss and doubt when his friend had depression, 17-year-old Gabriel Ong said a “more holistic approach” to mental health education would be helpful. His school’s current module on mental health provides just very basic knowledge about remembering to take breaks while studying, for example.  “It is hard for us to discern what would be the right thing to do for our friend. How do we know what is good for him? There are a lot of doubts in ourselves,” he said. In response to TODAY’s queries, Madam Choy Wai Yin, director of guidance and student development curriculum at the Ministry of Education (MOE), said that schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) adopt an individualised approach given that at-risk students often have to deal with multiple factors and unique circumstances. She added that MOE provides a “supportive environment in all schools and IHLs”, where students are taught resilience-building and how to reframe perceptions. All schools have at least one to two school counsellors, while all IHLs have at least two to three. The counsellors provide individualised social and emotional support. “Where necessary, the counsellors will refer students to medical professionals for further help,” said Mdm Wong. Ms Poh revealed that in 2006 when she started Silver Ribbon, she began talking to the authorities about a more structured mental health education in schools. But she faced pushback from school principals and teachers. “They had concerns about educating children (about mental health issues) at such a young age, (being) afraid they may have stereotypes and all,” said Ms Poh. To overcome the concerns, a pilot programme can be implemented and assessed later, she suggested. The need to start a conversation on mental health and suicide in schools is something close to the hearts of Ms Lek and Ms Doreen Kho, who also lost her son to suicide. They are part of a support group of bereaved parents called Please Stay, which will officially launch next month.  Ms Kho, 44, lost her son Evan in November 2017, when he jumped from the 16th floor of a condominium. He was 11 years old. The entrepreneur believes that mental health education programmes in school need to teach children how to identify others in pain and how to offer help. “The curriculum could include social skills as well — how to communicate and how to be sensitive to each other,” she added. As for Ms Lek, she feels there should be more dialogue on mental health issues and suicide. “There isn’t enough coverage because they are afraid of copycat suicides, afraid it will trigger something in kids. But let’s be real. All of these are available online, on social media,” she said. “Kids are already exposed, so why can’t we address it in school?” While mental health has become less of a taboo topic, the experts and youths said it remains a topic that some people dance around, which prevents more open and honest discussions about it.  To achieve that, mental health advocates said that Singaporeans need to be more comfortable talking about their emotions and simply start asking people around them, “how are you feeling?” This article was written in partnership with the National Youth Council (NYC).

"Commentary: Facing disrupted futures, Singapore’s youth must put their mental health first", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/disruption-prioritise-mental-health-impact-youths-singapore-11987948,Ng Chia Wee,17 Oct 2019 06:13AM,"SINGAPORE: The first Singapore Mental Health Study, published in 2010, revealed that one in eight in Singapore had experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime. Just six years later, that number had risen to one in seven. These statistics have concerned many Singaporeans and forced us to reflect on the reasons behind the reported increase. Concerns are likely highest among youths. Youth, after all, is the “peak period” where the majority of mental disorders emerge, according to Dr Swapna Verma from the Institute of Mental Health. Mental health was also a top concern reflected in the 2018 Youth Conversation online poll, carried out by the National Youth Council. In recent years, youth discourse on mental health has increased significantly, coupled with a greater awareness of World Mental Health Day, observed annually on Oct 10. According to the World Health Organization, World Mental Health Day is observed with the main objective of raising awareness of mental health issues around the world and shoring up efforts in support of mental health. However, it is also a timely opportunity for youths like myself to reflect on our own mental health in the broader context of the challenges we face – in a world of disruption. The relationship between mental health and the notion of a disrupted future is not often explicitly discussed in-depth, but it should be. As famed historian Yuval Noah Harari questioned in his bestseller 21 Lessons for the 21st Century:  Change is always stressful, and the hectic world of the early 21st century has produced a global epidemic of stress. As the volatility of the job market and of individual careers increase, would people be able to cope? In the context of Singapore’s youth, some recent statistics may clue us in to this relationship. Youths in Singapore are among the most pessimistic in Southeast Asia about the impact of technology on their employment prospects and earning potential according to a 2018 World Economic Forum, though this can be partially explained by higher education levels and age. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Separately, according to the latest available National Youth Survey (2016), “future uncertainty” ranked as the biggest source of stress among the youth surveyed; they were also not entirely confident about their own ability to respond to challenges. These nascent statistics suggest that youths may not be coping as well as they should with the pressures of a disrupted future. So what precise mental pressures does disruption bring? Consider what psychologist Sara-Ann Lee wrote in a   earlier this year:  “Employees are encouraged to hustle and work relentlessly to strive for ‘more’, but this is a tantalising fiction; once reached, one inevitably finds that there is ‘even more’ to work towards.” The pervasiveness of this sense of “never enough” is keenly felt by youths who have yet to enter the workforce. If the future is so uncertain, you can never know if you’ve done enough to secure that disrupted future. Indeed, “never enough” is something I see playing out among my peers, as they seek to juggle multiple commitments while keeping their grades up, sacrificing sleep and rest to secure a disrupted future. While my generation is rightly concerned about mental health as an issue in and of itself, I would argue that there is still an ironic tendency for us to see our own individual mental health as a “good to have”, rather than a “must have”. As we strive for success, we may still feel that self-care and rest is something which can be put off for some future time, without fully realising the detriment to our mental health.   And unfortunately, such a myopic view of mental health cannot be sustainable. Indeed, such a view cannot be sustainable because this is only the beginning of our lifelong dance with disruption, something we may not have fully grasped. Rather than neglect our mental health so we can come first in a race that never ends, it would be wiser to put our mental health first so we can keep running this marathon. In this regard, I have three suggestions on how we can all chart a more mentally sustainable path and prioritise our mental wellbeing in an age of disruption. First, if we have too much on our plate, the most logical response must to be to remove some of what’s on the plate, doing so in a gradual, responsible manner. But, some may ask, with less to show for ourselves, will this affect future employability? Not quite. In the future economy, employers look out for the ability to create, not just add, value. But value-creation needs time and effort to hone specific skills and engage in deep learning for deep mastery. Focusing on a few manageable commitments in greater depth will paradoxically give us the time and space needed to do just that, possibly making us more employable. Second, we need to shift from the mindset of “never enough” to a mindset of “good enough for now”. Writing in the New York Times earlier this year, author Avram Alpert talks about the “good-enough life”, and how the desire for greatness can be an obstacle to our own potential. But if “good enough” seems too much like “settling for less”, consider “good enough for now”. This mindset suggests it is perfectly okay if we can’t do as much as others at the moment. In an age of disruption, teeming with disruptive openings, the future truly holds more opportunities for us to try again. Third, individual efforts can only go so far without community support. It is in all our interests to actively participate in de-stigmatising mental disorders and talking about mental health, starting with friends and family. Of course, there’s a lot more to the issue of mental health, and individual efforts to improve it must be complemented by feasible societal changes, such as re-looking at institutional arrangements which give rise to excessive competition. But that’s another commentary for another day. For now, it would be sufficient to remember to put our mental health first to give ourselves the best chances to face a disrupted future. Envisioning the decades ahead, I believe my generation can still make the best of disruption, and chart our own futures. But that’s only if we can put our mental health first."
Commentary: We declare a goal of ending mental health stigma yet viciously mock the woman at Shunfu Market, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/woman-shunfu-market-sovereign-mental-health-illness-stigma-covid-12723756,Anthea Ong,12 May 2020 04:47PM,"SINGAPORE: At 8pm on Thursday (May 7), 33 key Singapore landmarks across the island lit up in blue as part of the  . It was a heartening sight to see action taken to highlight the importance of mental well-being during this difficult period of COVID-19 and raise awareness for mental health. The nationwide light show will run every Thursday at 8pm until the end of the circuit breaker on Jun 1, as a display of solidarity. Yet, just the day before, a musical video on YouTube made by a local artist went viral, mocking the   who uttered the word “sovereign” when asked why she wasn’t wearing one. No one would disagree the woman should be taken to task for posing a threat to public health and  . Swift action was taken. She was charged   after the incident on one count of being a nuisance and three counts of violating the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) rules. But where the court had decided she   at the Institute of Mental Health to assess if she is fit to plea, the video made by the artist and the praises heaped by scores of people who shared it widely on social media now sit awkwardly. If anything, it speaks volume of the prejudice and ignorance of mental health we still have as a society. “End the stigma of mental illness” is a phrase we have heard numerous times in recent years as Singapore awakens to the discrimination and disadvantages people with mental health conditions face. Underlying problematic public attitudes have been exposed by surveys conducted by the National Council of Social Services (NCSS). We have made big strides to tackle mental health at the national level. An anti-mental health stigma campaign Beyond the Label was launched by NCSS in 2018 to combat these sentiments. Prominent figures have come forward to lend their voice. Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan Jin addressed this issue at the Beyond the Label Fest in September last year. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Singapore was also the first country in Asia to host the Together Against Stigma Global Conference in October 2019 where President Halimah Yacob stressed more must be done to support those with mental health issues. Negative attitudes towards mental health conditions are ""sad"" and reflect a ""gross ignorance about what this illness is all about"", she had said. The word stigma means a mark of shame. In the mental health sector, this typically refers to the unfair mark of shame others assigned to those who live with different mental health conditions. There’s also self-stigma, the shame people with such conditions assign to themselves when they feel there’s something “wrong” with how their brains work. This goal of “ending the stigma” may only be scratching the surface of the real shame, acts of discrimination and microaggressions people who live with mental conditions still face on a daily basis. Yet circle back to the YouTube video, which ridiculed the woman with words like “lunatic”, “thick in the head” and “crazy”, and you cannot help but go away with the sense that this is the type of bigotry that perpetuates misguided perceptions and peddles the narrative that those with poor mental health are ""crazy people"" who act out. This is sadly turning the other way from our national vision of going beyond the label endorsed by our leaders and Singaporeans. Those who live with mental health conditions have expressed their fear and anxiety regarding this insensitive act of public shaming, made many times worse by the complicit chorus of compliments to the talent and entertainment value of this public shaming. One of them shared with me: “If I ever had a public breakdown, I would be absolutely mortified if my episode was plastered all over social media, and turned into fodder for further public amusement by an artist.” Another also shared with me in anguish: “This perpetuates a false association between mental health and social irresponsibility/deviancy ... It has justified public shaming of mental health as fair game, and even as a kind of moral righteousness.” The COVID-19 crisis has turned every aspect of normal life upside down with strict safe distancing and circuit breaker measures to protect life. With no end in sight, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 are starting to manifest – fuelled by the devastating mix of uncertainty, isolation, grief and economic despair. We cannot pretend to know how these consequences will manifest in each individual, including those with no pre-existing mental health conditions. Spending time in isolation and following safe distancing measures may slow the spread of the disease, but it may also be linked to an increase in depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child abuse, according to many recent studies including the highly-regarded journal The Lancet Report. We think of the coronavirus as a physical health threat but forget this is also a mental health crisis needing attention, a concern I have raised repeatedly in Parliament recently, given that one in seven of Singaporeans already live with a mental health condition before COVID-19.  We have underestimated the silent toll on our mental health COVID-19 is taking on us because such stories have remained behind closed doors for fear of stigma. A senior business leader recently shared her mounting mental and emotional struggles with having to support her young children with their home-based learning (and now on holiday) as well as her employees with their own challenges remotely. An acquaintance almost killed himself after losing all gigs as an event emcee some weeks back, while he could not have his weekly sessions with his therapist until recently. A 20-year-old man hung himself in his room in mid-April due to challenging family circumstances. A 15-year-old marriage is now on the brink of a complete breakdown just five weeks into the circuit breaker. These are just but a small sample of stories of mental struggles I have come to know of personally.  Even before the pandemic, two-thirds of adults with mental health conditions did not seek treatment in Singapore, according to the NCSS Public Attitudes Survey in 2017. Public shaming will exacerbate poor mental health for those already struggling. Experts have long cautioned against public shaming, warning that it can have a lasting and negative psychological impact on those who are singled out. At first glance, we might fall into the trap of thinking being shamed on social media is an experience anyone can easily shrug off and recover from. However, many who have been the target of Internet shaming face lasting and damaging consequences. The mental health curve from COVID-19 is going to have a very long tail. So leave errant individuals to the authorities, that’s the rule of law order that we are proud of. Let’s channel our influence, talents and energies during this trying time towards looking out for each other, and our mental well-being - and not perpetuate the stigmatisation of mental health.  We must go beyond merely a display of solidarity to truly walk the talk of empathy and inclusion when the next sea of blue light shines from our gleaming skyscrapers."
Commentary: Our approach to mental health needs to change. COVID-19 will force us to, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-may-worsen-mental-health-in-singapore-12703566,Xiangyun Lim,06 May 2020 06:17AM,"SINGAPORE: Suicide rates in Singapore were reported to be 8.36 deaths per 100,000 Singapore residents last year. According to the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), this is the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 to 29.  This is a 10 per cent increase from 2017. There is a high chance that the figures will continue to rise. While the effects of COVID-19 on the collective mental health have yet to be studied systematically, psychosocial repercussions of the pandemic are already felt worldwide. The US saw a 338 per cent increase in call volume to the Disaster Distress Helpline, a sub-network of America’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, in March compared to the previous month. Researchers Lu Dong and Jennifer Bouey from the RAND Corporation found that China has reported “a heightened public mental health crisis” sparked by the outbreak despite emergency psychological crisis interventions proposed by the National Health Commission of China. In Singapore, organisations such as SOS, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and Fei Yue Community Services have seen spikes in the number of people calling in the last month seeking assistance for distress.   The SOS reported that it received 3,826 calls in March, 23 per cent more than it received during the same month last year. And yet our response to mental health remains inadequate. Gaps in our mental healthcare system were brought up even before COVID-19 led to the circuit breaker period. Accessibility, affordability and inclusiveness of professional services were particularly highlighted during the Parliamentary debate on the Ministry of Health’s budget in March. We also face a lack of trained professionals. The national average of 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists for every 100,000 people in Singapore is lower than the 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 recorded by most OECD countries. Mental health support offered at the national level did not seem to keep up in tandem with the increasing numbers of those seeking help. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Singapore’s total expenditure on mental health made up only 3 per cent of the Ministry of Health’s operating expenditure for 2017, according to latest data shared by the Health Minister in Parliament in 2019. The insufficient level of resources ploughed into mental health in the past could come back to haunt us.  Neither the Resilience Budget nor the Solidarity Budget allocated any resources towards mental healthcare support or research. It also took three full weeks after the circuit breaker first started to declare allied health services - including private counselling and social work - as essential services, thus allowing them to remain open. Even if slightly late, this move shows that the Government recognises the impact this pandemic could have on mental health, as does its establishment of the National Care Hotline. More than 6,600 people have already called the hotline within two weeks of its launch on Apr 10. According to media reports, there were also a few callers with suicidal tendencies, with police dispatched to tend to two cases. But the same shortage of resources can be seen with how the 24-hour hotline is currently run, with about 500 volunteers from government agencies, registered mental health professionals, Social Service Agency-nominated psychologists, counsellors/social workers or personnel who are trained in psychological first aid.  From the 500, about 20 to 25 of them are rostered daily to provide emotional and psychological support to callers. This small group of trained professionals daily may not be able to keep up with an increasing volume of people seeking mental health assistance. Perhaps, rather than point out the shortcomings of our system, we need to develop an approach where all of us can play a part in protecting the mental health of our society. As an editor of a book consolidating perspectives from across the ground - from academics, organisational leaders and practising professionals, to individuals with lived experiences and supporting figures - I have found strong commonality in the belief that addressing mental health should go beyond the confines of the social services and government. We have to take steps to give mental health as much priority as physical health for ourselves and those around us. This can help shift mental healthcare into a more preventive approach, thus alleviating some of the burden on the thin level of resources we can access. Rethinking the role of mental health in our lives will enable us to work hand-in-hand with those on the policy front to forge ways to create and maintain mental health support - similar to a community-based care for medical treatment recommended by medical journal The Lancet, with “psychosocial treatments such as talking therapies being offered not just by medical professionals but also by community health workers, peers, teachers and the clergy”. Everyone has a stake in the state of our collective mental health. For this to happen, mental health issues have to first be more normalised. For starters, we need to openly talk about the challenges we may be currently facing. It is a traumatic period with a protracted disruption to life for every individual. Social isolation offers no relief from uncertainty, fear and anxiety, and can in fact be a contributing factor. For some, it is a strain on family ties and relationships.  For those in abusive domestic conditions, it can be a matter of life and death. For those susceptible to mental health issues, COVID-19 can have serious effects on their health and recovery. It is not the time to downplay feelings of fear and anxiety. It is the time to ensure you have a support system and find coping mechanisms. It is the time to reach out to others without shame when you find yourself unable to cope. It is also not the time to call out on anyone who is experiencing mental distress or conditions in any form. Be careful about your language when speaking to others. It is easy to project personal distress upon others unconsciously, even if it is not your intention. That is easier said than done. Despite national campaigns to create awareness, the stigma against mental health is still a large hindrance to tackling the issue.  Various studies conducted in Singapore capture a pervasive negative attitude towards mental health conditions.  One such survey by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2018 found that six in 10 people believe such conditions are caused by a lack of self-discipline and will-power, while up to 50 per cent of respondents would not give people with mental health conditions any responsibility. There is also evidence of the impact stigma has on seeking treatment and recovery.  Statistics show a treatment gap of up to nine years for those experiencing mood disorders while 78.4 per cent choose not to even seek help for what they experience. Reasons vary from the fear of being judged and being seen as weak, to losing autonomy and control over their lives. Unlike physical ailments, mental health conditions are not visible. What is visible - the behavioural manifestations of disorders leaning towards severity - tend to break established social norms.  Those who do not know what is happening may then internalise the behaviour as threats. Mental health conditions are complex, individualistic and heterogeneous in nature. They also don’t have to be permanent. There are actions we can take to support others. We can proactively question labels. We can have more discourse around mental health issues. We can learn to listen without putting forth our own judgements or offer solutions. We can also remember that we are all susceptible to it, if we do not take steps towards mental resilience. There is an urgency to start. We may not feel the strain on our already thinning mental health resources until it’s too late. While the mental toll of COVID-19 has yet to be recorded or tracked, there is enough evidence of the profound and pervasive impact all around the world. That includes us. If we do not step up now to take mental health seriously, we will be looking at another health crisis sooner than we expect."
Mental health a challenging issue at Jakarta temporary COVID-19 hospital, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid-19-jakarta-mental-struggle-athlete-village-indonesia-12748260,Kiki Siregar,24 May 2020 06:02AM,"JAKARTA: Former COVID-19 patient Indah, not her real name, still remembers the moments when she thought about jumping out of a window. When she was tested positive in late April, the 30-year-old Indonesian was warded at Jakarta’s 2018 Asian Games athlete’s village. The facility was converted into an  for COVID-19 cases that have been assessed to be less serious. Separated from her three children, the youngest being just two-years-old, Indah missed them badly. She tried to connect with them daily through video calls and messaging apps. When her children told her that their neighbours had stopped them from leaving home, for fear that they would spread the virus, she felt angry and helpless. “I didn’t dare to look at a window because I would suddenly think of committing suicide,” she said when interviewed by CNA. She added: “My room had a window and was on the 27  floor. When I looked down, I felt I wanted to jump out of the window, I just felt I wanted to end my life. “I have never felt like that. Far away from my little children and my neighbours were saying bad things about them. I was stressed out.” Fortunately, she quickly realised ending her own life was not a solution, as there would be no one to take care of her children. “I don’t want them to receive a lack of love just like my experience when I was young. I don’t want them to not have a mother,” she recounted. Indah claimed that she was not alone in having suicidal thoughts. During her 18 days of hospitalisation, she encountered other patients who also had suicidal thoughts or displayed other symptoms of stress such as crying for the entire day. She said some were stressed out because they had been hospitalised for over a month and felt bored and helpless, a state she also experienced. Dr Stefanus Dony, the operational coordinator of the athlete’s village told CNA that when the makeshift hospital was newly launched in March and the psychological teams had not yet started work, they had a patient who tried to jump out of the window and attack the medical workers. They quickly referred the patient to a psychiatric hospital in Jakarta as the person seemed to be suicidal.   “But now we have a psychological team and programmes so hopefully this will prevent unwanted things from happening and reduce the stress levels of our patients, including our health workers.” Captain Didon Permadi, the head of the psychology team at the athlete’s village added that since he joined the hospital in mid-April, no one there has tried to commit suicide.  The suicidal thoughts were actually manifestations of the stress they experienced, he explained. The psychologist said the emotional state of patients were caused by various factors. “To some people the source is family problems, losing a family member but unable to witness the funeral, thinking of their children, thinking of their jobs, and mainly   to be out,” he said. Permadi added: “Another stressor is how people in their neighbourhood are treating their family (while they are warded at the athlete’s village) … They (feel like they) are ostracised, isolated, and don’t receive social support. “Even when they have tested negative, some are anxious about going home."" All these are manifested in different behaviours, said the psychologist. ”Since I’ve joined, according to the reports of several nurses, the uncontrollable behaviours some patients display include being angry and scolding the nurses, among others. “There was also a patient who urinated anywhere he wanted and entered the rooms of other patients. But upon further examination, that person had suffered from a massive stroke and his memory is a bit impaired.”  Permadi also noted that some were already suffering from psychotic problems prior to their hospitalisation. In such a case, they would refer them to a different hospital that would be able to handle such patients, he said.  Five psychologists, five assistant psychologists and one psychiatrist have been on duty since early April. They take care of the mental health of about 800 patients, most of whom have mild COVID-19 symptoms. While there are no exact statistics on how many coronavirus patients in Indonesia have experienced mental problems, a woman suspected of contracting COVID-19 died last Sunday (May 17) after jumping out of the hospital window where she was warded. Local media reported that the patient had made several requests to be discharged. The psychologists have come up with preventive programmes to keep the patients and also the nurses mentally healthy. Psychoeducation and positive messages are broadcast through messaging apps and loudspeakers twice a day. There are also group activities that are organised in adherence to social distancing principles so that they can support each other and won’t feel lonely. One-to-one counselling sessions and a hotline service are also available, Permadi said, while visits to the patients are also done regularly every Tuesday and Friday. “We believe the patients here encounter problems which can disrupt them psychologically because they don’t really suffer from major problems physically but their activities are limited. “And while waiting for the test result, they develop negative thoughts which disturb their sleep patterns and later their physical condition which could affect their immunity,” he noted. The athlete’s village is meant for COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms and suspected cases, some of whom are also anxious that they could catch the virus while being hospitalised there. It is the only hospital in Jakarta which is entirely focused on treating COVID-19 patients. Indah said the psychologists and their programmes have helped her overcome her suicidal thoughts. Knowing that she had a support system at the makeshift hospital was also beneficial and important. “We give each other support and share food with one another if someone had leftovers. We also pray for each other,” she said. Now that she is back home, she is still upset every time she perceives that her family may have been ostracised. She would sometimes send messages to the psychologists at the athlete’s village to pour her heart out.  ""I just want people not to stigmatise and ostracise us."" "
"Rise in firms offering mental health support for staff but more can be done, say experts", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-workplace-staff-support-counselling-12970064,Rachel Phua,08 Aug 2020 06:08AM,"SINGAPORE: After graduating from university in 2015, Ann (not her real name) joined a non-governmental organisation (NGO) as an events executive.   Her supervisor, she claimed, was prone to mood swings.   “One moment she can be very upbeat and jolly with you, and the next moment she will scold you and be very moody - once or twice she shouted at me in front of everybody. So you have to adapt to her mood, which is very stressful and toxic,” said Ann, who is now 27. “When I first joined I thought it was because I had done something wrong that's why she was treating me like that.” Towards the end of her four-month stint, Ann started to see a counsellor.  ""When you’re in your job from nine to six, it's the biggest part of your life, so whoever you interact with most would definitely affect you,” said Ann, who left the company because she was beginning to feel depressed. Communications executive Mary, 27, who has depression, generalised anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, is somewhat in a better position as she can be open about her conditions at her workplace. But she feels this is only because her condition does not affect her work output and she is able to look after herself. Even then, Mary sometimes faces what she calls “colour-blind” comments - words that are hurtful, considering that her colleagues know about her illnesses. Once, during a review, her boss told her “you need to learn to relax”. “And I have to tell them, ‘well, it’s because I have an anxiety disorder’,” Mary said. “They make such remarks often so you have to remind them constantly.” Both Ann and Mary declined to reveal their identities for fear of reprisal. In recent years, awareness about mental health at the workplace has grown, both in the public and private sector. Mental health advocate Anthea Ong said she has seen more large organisations taking workplace mental wellbeing seriously in the last two years. Citing the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup which she is part of, Ms Ong said that the group has grown from having 25 C-suite professionals to more than 40 today. The circle, which includes executives from DBS, Aviva and the public service, meets quarterly to discuss inclusive practices and the need for mental health insurance.  The group published an e-guide in May that offers companies and workers tips on adjusting to work-from-home arrangements that could take a toll on some people due to the change and social isolation.  More companies have also adopted an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) as part of their welfare benefits. This typically involves access to individual counselling sessions that employees can claim for, as well as other services such as mental health workshops. Two EAP providers said there has been an uptick in the number of companies signing up to offer counselling to their employees.  Counselling and Care Centre, for instance, has seen the number of client organisations double from 10 in 2017 to 20 in 2019, said the centre's partnerships manager Anu Cherian. Meanwhile the Singapore Anglican Community Services (SACS) has seen a tenfold increase in the number of client organisations since it launched the EAP in late 2017, a spokesperson said.  Sometimes an individual has family and grief issues to talk through. Very often, employees want to deal with what is happening in the workplace such as the long hours, stress or when the company undergoes restructuring, said Ms Cherian. Companies which have adopted EAP know that social and psychological wellbeing affects productivity, said the service providers.  A National Council of Social Service (NCSS) study in 2017 found that for every S$1 invested in a ""workplace adjustment"" like flexi-work arrangements and means to get counselling, a company is able to generate an average of S$5.60 in returns as workers were more productive and made fewer medical claims.  In the public service, some of the latest efforts to address mental health include iWorkHealth, an online tool that allows employers and workers to identify factors of workplace stress. It was piloted last October and the aim is to launch the programme later this year.  In January, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices announced that people with mental health conditions no longer need to declare this information in job application forms.  And in March, the Ministry of Manpower said it will be issuing an advisory to help employers take steps to improve mental wellbeing in the workplace by the end of 2020.  The advisory will lay out what companies can do, which could include access to anonymised external counselling services, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early. While observers in this field lauded the progress made, they said there is still room for improvement in changing mindsets. “Mental healthcare in Singapore is not culturally supported and integrated into communities as with other developed nations,” said Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist at Inner Light. “Our main goal should be to develop a more open and accepting culture.” She noted that despite the initiatives, most of her clients who struggle with work-related burnout said that their firms do not prioritise mental health.  The stigma against mental health issues creates a belief that they will be judged as weak if they were to voice their distress openly, Dr Lazaroo added. What needs to be done, she said, is to create a “mental health-friendly culture”, where employers go for mental health awareness training, conduct workshops to manage burnout, provide avenues for workers to seek help, as well as create non-discriminatory policies.  They could also look at improving the office environment, for instance, by having a well-stocked pantry and rooms where employees can use for work discussions or for time-outs, said Yvonne Low, the head of Singapore Association for Mental Health’s MINDSET Learning Hub.  Companies stand to lose much from neglecting employee mental healthcare, Dr Lazaroo added, as it could result in negative behaviour in the office like resentment between colleagues, shouting matches and unnecessary tension. These could lead to early resignations.   Similarly, Ms Ong listed other actions employers can take, such as allaying fears that career progression and performance are linked to one’s mental health, or have managers share their struggles so that it normalises mental distress. Ann, for one, wished she had access to mental health services like the EAP at her previous company. “I think it's a top thing,” she said. “If the person on top actually understands what mental wellbeing at work is, makes it known and introduces official policies as evidence, then I actually feel like it is a safe place. “Rather than say, harping on the fact that you are so mental health-oriented when you don’t have procedures in place for people to talk about workplace mental health issues in confidence.” One company that has put in place measures to deal with mental health is social enterprise The Social Space, which operates two lifestyle stores at Chinatown and Marina One. It decided to make flexible work hours a given when it started in 2018.  “We knew the individuals we hired came with their own unique set of challenges that would require flexibility,” said co-owner Daniel Yeow. The cafe it runs has 15 employees, five of whom have mental health illnesses. The medication they take to manage their conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and bipolar disorder makes them tired easily and impossible to work regular working hours, he said.  Workplace policies aside, Mr Yeow said he has had to spend time reaching out to his employee’s support network - family members, doctors and social workers - to make sure they are taken care of.  Once, they closed for half a day on a Saturday - their busiest day of the week - to let employees resolve disputes they had among themselves.  These measures have affected productivity and consequently profits, he said. But Mr Yeow believes that “by doing the right thing, we will attract customers that appreciate what we stand for and … continue to support us"". More policies that normalise mental wellness should be legislated, said observers.  Ms Ong pointed to laws in other countries that Singapore could follow. In Germany, employers are legally required to carry out workplace risk assessments - with countermeasures in place - that account for psychosocial hazards, not just physical ones.  In Australia, workers can make claims for psychological injuries or mental disorders that are work-related. In Singapore, mental illnesses are covered under the Work Injury Compensation Act if they are linked to a work accident, according to Mr Zaqy Mohamad in Parliament last year during the debate on the Work Injury Compensation Bill. The Government could also provide grants for companies to carry out mental health programmes and present awards to those who promote mental wellness at the workplace, said Porsche Poh, the executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore). The COVID-19 crisis has made the need to address mental health struggles all the more pertinent, added Ms Ong.  She referenced a study done by Qualtrics between end-March and early-April across Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK and the US, which found that 41.6 per cent of more than 2,000 respondents said that their mental health has declined since the outbreak. In Singapore, EAP providers also said they saw interest in their programme go up at the start of the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"". SACS saw a 67 per cent rise in enquires on the EAP service in April, it said. “Presumably (with) the work-from-home situation and the changes a lot of employees had to get adapted to … more employers might be looking at taking care of their employees,” said Ms Cherian. Ms Ong said it is urgent for employers and government leaders to prioritise mental health, especially during the time of pandemic. The United Nations had warned in May of a global mental health crisis due to COVID-19, as millions of people face death, disease, isolation, poverty and anxiety, and urged governments to put the issue front and centre as they tackle the pandemic.  “Social isolation, employment uncertainty, and the virus itself have combined to shock the health and wellbeing of employees around the world,” she said.  “In a time of COVID-19, mental health is (what) contributes to our social and psychological resilience as a people.”"
"The Big Read: Amid the crisis of a generation, losing one’s job takes a heavy emotional and mental toll", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-covid-19-job-loss-retrenchment-mental-health-13125706,Low Youjin,21 Sep 2020 06:05AM,"SINGAPORE: For seven years, Ms Sook Tan was living the life she had long sought: A stint in Malaysia’s capital Kuala Lumpur, followed by the neon lights of Japan’s Tokyo and finally the buzz of cosmopolitan Hong Kong where she worked as a business coordinator for a coworking operator. But around February, the 32-year-old made plans to return to Singapore after her 63-year-old mother, who was diagnosed with lupus around mid-2019, experienced a flare-up of the autoimmune disease. As the only child of a single-parent family, Ms Tan used to fly back regularly to accompany her mother for her medical appointments. But with the older woman’s condition worsening, Ms Tan put on hold her dreams of continuing to live and work abroad to take care of her mother. Rather than letting her resign, Ms Tan said her employers were kind enough to open a position for her in Singapore, and she was back home in March with her mother. It seemed like an ideal arrangement, but Singapore, like much of the world, was just beginning its tussle with the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from being a global health crisis that has infected more than 29.7 million people and caused at least 937,000 fatalities to date, the coronavirus also has had a devastating effect on economies worldwide and Ms Tan’s company was not spared. The writing was on the wall, with her company’s five international branches being shut one after another. In August, Ms Tan was told she was being laid off from the company’s Singapore headquarters. Ms Tan took the retrenchment in her stride; bolstered by her overseas experience, she felt assured that she would quickly land a new job. What she was not counting on was competing against thousands of other Singaporeans who had been similarly laid off as the Republic’s COVID-19-battered economy entered its worst recession since independence. According to the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) latest labour market report, a total of 11,350 workers were laid off for the first half of 2020. This is higher than that seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, when there were 10,120 job cuts in the first half of 2003, but lower than other past recessionary peaks, MOM said. Ms Tan said her confidence took a hit as it shattered the image she had of herself. “Friends will be supportive and say ‘Your CV (curriculum vitae) is fine, you are wonderful’.” But the reality is, headhunters she spoke to rarely got back to her despite saying how interesting her profile is. With little savings, she also found herself in the unusual position of basing all her decisions around her finances — something she did not do previously. “There were days where I woke up just worried about what’s going to happen,” said Ms Tan, who started working when she was 20 with few breaks in between. “The stress of not having a job was very new to me.” Since she lost her job, she has been going through an emotional rollercoaster. There are days when she is kind to herself, but far more days when she wallows in self-doubt. “There is always a lot of self-doubt going on in my head,” she said. “I might think that I'm trying my best, but is that the actual best or just what I think is best?” Ms Tan is not alone in feeling that the loss of a livelihood has taken a toll on her mental health. Psychologists and social workers spoken to said they are seeing more distressed individuals seeking help due to retrenchment or imminent job loss. Mr Praveen Nair, a psychologist at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, said there is a psychological theory that the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the mental health of the retrenched. “Anything that reminds people of their mortality or death will cause anxiety,” he said. “Imagine if a person is retrenched, they're already feeling anxiety. At the same time, you're surrounded by a global pandemic that reinforces that economies are crashing, jobs are less, and that you could even die. “So you can imagine how that would heighten any existing levels of anxiety.” Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters, noted that social distancing restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 — especially those in place during the circuit breaker — have inadvertently impaired the social support that one would normally receive. ""While online alternatives to seeking professional and social support exist, many do not feel as comfortable with such tools and by default would remain isolated,"" he said. TODAY reported earlier this week that calls to Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), a non-profit suicide prevention centre, went up by 36 per cent during the circuit breaker period compared to the same period last year. A total of 10,671 calls were made between April and June, compared with 7,844 calls made in that period in 2019. That was the circuit breaker period when Singapore imposed stay-home curbs and shut down most activities to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, with restrictions lifted at the start of June. Separately, SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said from March to August, it has received an average of 144 calls per month with issues pertaining to job loss or unemployment — a slight increase from the average of 141 over the same period last year. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the National Care Hotline had managed over 27,900 calls as of Aug 21. Most of the callers were adults above 21, and their top concerns pertained to mental health, marital and family disputes. “Many needed emotional support,” said an MSF spokesperson. The hotline was set up in April to provide psychological and emotional support to people amid the coronavirus pandemic. Ms Audrey Chin, a volunteer duty care officer with the hotline, said most callers do not articulate their emotions when they call. Instead, they enquire about financial schemes available. “In Asian culture, generally people are not as articulate about their emotions as compared to Western culture,” said Ms Chin, who is also an associate psychologist with MSF. She said that when the volunteers delve deeper during their conversations, they discover that the callers have been retrenched and are concerned about being able to provide for their families. She added that it is quite common for these callers to reveal that being put in such a situation has caused a lot of anxiety. “Sometimes (they say), ‘I feel very depressed and I feel like a failure’,” she said. Ms Lydia Tan, the principal social worker for voluntary welfare organisation Care Corner, said regardless of circumstances, retrenchment can have a negative psychological impact on any person. However, with the national and global economies depressed by COVID-19, she said it makes it harder for retrenched people to predict when or how they can get employment. “The challenges of being retrenched during COVID-19 are amplified due to the uncertainties, limitations and restrictions which directly or indirectly perpetuate isolation and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,” she added. To get through this difficult phase, a different type of resilience is needed, she pointed out. Many of her clients who have struggled with financial situations for a long time are very familiar with the resources available for them, she noted. “It is this new poor, who are not familiar with the resources that are available,” she said, referring to those who have just lost their jobs. For a 50-year-old permanent resident, he never expected to be retrenched as he was the only employee in the purchasing department of an aviation repair and overhaul company where he had worked for over five years. The Filipino, who declined to be named, said despite having his pay reduced, he was eventually let go in early-August. Among his co-workers who were retrenched was a man who had been with the company for 15 years. “It puts you in a perspective that loyalty is nothing. You're just part of a statistical number within the company,” he said. He admitted to being “a bit bitter” with the situation as it was his second time being retrenched in his career. He added: “The situation really sucks and while there is no point in dwelling on the past, it is a bit disheartening.” He described his financial situation as “good for now”, but said that if he were to remain jobless for another two or three months, it would be a problem for his family of five — three sons aged 12, 20 and 24, and his 45-year-old wife. Adding that he has been having trouble sleeping, he said: “I think I might be depressed ... Without the support of my family (my mental health is) not going to be good … I would be drinking (to cope).” Mr Wee Toon Hee, 59, has been similarly losing sleep over worries about his livelihood. As a busker who does juggling acts and freelances as a tour guide on the side, he has been without income since March when tighter social-distancing measures were imposed by the authorities to limit the spread of the coronavirus. His 50-year-old wife, who also worked as a tour guide, is not bringing home the bacon either. Together, the husband and wife had applied for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), which provides eligible freelancers with three quarterly cash payouts of S$3,000 each to tide over the COVID-19 crisis. But Mr Wee said that their applications have been in vain, despite appealing twice. This has been a point of stress and frustration for him as he worries about how to cope with the overheads for his family, which includes two boys, aged 14 and 17. Mr Wee said being able to receive the SIRS payout would not help him totally, but it would be a great relief and he would not feel “so distressed”. “We’ve saved for the rainy days, but little did we know that the rainy days would be (so) long,” said Mr Wee, adding that he is panicking over his family's finances. “My savings are actually at a very dangerous level now. As a matter of fact, I took a loan from my insurance policy just two weeks ago.” Mr Wee did not look for an alternative source of income earlier, as he was still harbouring hope that the pandemic would end soon. “Never in anybody's imagination that something could happen and bring the whole world down to its knees,” said Mr Wee, who is currently helping his wife with her home-based baking business. He is now resigned to the fact that he will have to give up his passion for busking to look for another source of income. “My chips are all down and I don’t have a choice,” said Mr Wee, though he concedes that it will not be easy for someone his age to find another job. For former aerospace engineer Tang Meng Kit, the hunt for a new job has left him feeling anxious and aimless because “you’re just searching for something”. “When you’re waiting, hoping for something … the application you sent a week ago, can feel like two months (ago),” he said. The 33-year-old has a 17-month-old toddler and a 33-year-old wife who does casual work. He said that he is feeling scared as he is getting the keys to his matrimonial home next week, and is concerned about paying off the mortgage. He added it has been frustrating when he gets told by potential employers that he is overqualified for a job. “How can someone way overqualified don’t qualify for the work?” he said. As for Ms Sook Tan, she has taken on two temporary jobs in a bid to ensure that she can still provide her mother with the same level of care and comfort as before. In the day, she does marketing support for an events production company under a two-month contract role that ends in mid-October. At night, she works as a waitress at a Spanish restaurant. As she has been working every day for three weeks, she feels that she may be close to a burnout. Still, she tries to maintain a strong front for her mother, who has been asking her to take a break. She has avoided sharing her problems with her friends since they may be going through their own set of challenges. “Sometimes it does eat me up inside,” she said. Some social workers said job losses have also resulted in strained familial relationships and even thoughts of suicide. Care Corner’s Ms Lydia Tan said she encountered a young client who had lost her job in the tourism industry. As the client could not find a related job, she accepted a call centre job working from home. “However, it was challenging as she needed a quiet home environment but she lived with many family members,” Ms Tan said.  “It created a lot of conflict in the family and it was stressful for her. She was depressed over her lower take-home pay and strained relationships with family.” Ms Joyz Tan, a senior social worker at the Fei Yue Family Service Centre, said she and her colleagues have come across cases where thoughts of suicide were triggered by the loss of a job. “Emotional health can be affected when we strongly associate our self-worth to our job or job security,” she said. Ms Lydia Tan added that when an individual’s sense of self-worth is challenged, they may feel aggrieved at their inability to provide for the family, especially if they are the sole breadwinner. She said: “This could result in feelings of high pressure and stress which may affect the marital and parental relationships. In the extreme case, it may result in family violence.” Dr Yang said there is a high take-up rate for the counselling support under Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that his clinic provides for outgoing staff at some organisations. “COVID-19 has impacted individuals psychologically at work and we need to recognise that these effects will continue to linger and it is essential to be watchful over our colleagues and ourselves,” he added. Dr Cherie Chan, president of Singapore Psychological Society (SPS), said that some telltale signs that someone’s mental health may be affected include increased anxiety, social withdrawal and isolation, and increased use of substances such as alcohol and drugs. She said that individuals might also show increased expressions of anger and worry about providing for their family or themselves. “This may lead to increased suicide risk should unemployment continue… unemployment and job loss often bring a great sense of hopelessness, uncertainty and perceived threats which studies have shown lead to greater risks of developing mental health problems,” she added. As many workers — especially older ones — tie their identity to their jobs, Mr Tony Leong, who also volunteers at the National Care Hotline, said that the loved ones or friends of individuals who have been retrenched should give them time to grief. “The loss of a job is still a loss,” said Mr Leong, who is also the director of youth work at a charity organisation CampusImpact. “It is important to empathise and acknowledge this loss and recognise it is a difficult time for them and that their functioning and activities could be affected.” Mr Nair, the psychologist, agreed that it is possible for people who have been retrenched to go through stages that are similar to bereavement. “In essence, it may be as follows: Shock, anger, depression, guilt and acceptance. This trajectory, and its impact, needs to perhaps be understood first,” he said. Mr Nair said there are two forms of coping strategies that could be used by individuals: emotion-focused coping (focusing on one’s own internal state) or problem-focused coping (finding a solution for an external issue). An example of being emotion-focused, he said, can be giving a pep talk to oneself or carrying out meditation or breathing exercises. As for being problem-focused, it could just be asking for support or even creating a to-do list. For those who have been retrenched, Mr Nair suggested: - Taking time to find out what their real passion is, and preparing themselves for a new working life -Volunteering in the community - Taking on any job until something better arrives - Looking out for opportunities to try things such as starting on a fitness regime, or a new business - Setting aside time to actively look for a job - Gaining knowledge in a topic of interest, or an area relevant to building a career - Being mindful of one’s diet, as foods affect mood Dr Yang said affected individuals should also try to recognise that what they are going through is “merely a moment of time in (their) life”, and they should try to shift focus on what they can do moving forward. “In any crisis, there is opportunity, and you want to make a list of all the possibilities ahead of you,” he said. “For many, they may have been in a job or career that was comfortable but not exciting or fulfilling. If not for our current situation, they may never have spent time to think of what truly matters for them.” He added that affected individuals should use this time to refocus their priorities too. “For many, it would be family and loved ones, and also oneself. Practise mindful living and use this time to reset and live by design, rather than default,” he said. Just as important is being able to talk to someone about their emotions, said SOS’ Mr Tan. “The fear of being a disappointment and embarrassment may lead individuals to hide their struggles and put on a facade that they may be coping well,” he added. “However, when we are able to openly talk about our emotions and thoughts, it helps to put things into perspective and manage the anxiety one may be feeling (before) it gets too overwhelming.” For friends or loved ones of those who have been retrenched, Mr Nair cautioned them from treating the subject as taboo, as it could make the affected individual feel worse. Similarly, he said they should avoid dishing out meaningless platitudes such as “don’t worry, I’m sure you will find a new job soon” or “it is what it is”. Instead, friends and family should be empathetic and try to understand the retrenched worker as he goes through the grieving process of losing his or her job. Dr Chan said having friends and loved ones checking in on the affected individuals regularly could help prevent their social isolation and withdrawal as well. She noted that having conversations with or engaging the unemployed in activities could help increase their “life pie chart” to help them see that their lives are made up of more than just work. Dr Yang said that many retrenched workers are able to cope with support from family and friends. However, “if their challenges are acute, encourage them to seek professional help”, he advised. On a national level, Mr Nair believes that Singapore could afford to streamline its processes for granting financial assistance to those who need it. “The feedback from my clients is … that they don't get assistance not because there isn't any, but because they (the processes) are over-bureaucratised,” he said. An example which he cited is the household income criteria, which could mean a couple being ineligible for financial assistance even though one of them lost his or her job. In response to queries, MSF reiterated that it provides ComCare assistance to low-income households to meet their basic living expenses, and household income is one qualifying criterion because it is a proxy for family support and wealth. “However, it is not the sole criterion. When low-income households apply to our Social Service Offices (SSOs) for ComCare assistance, their needs are assessed holistically,” said the MSF spokesperson. The spokesperson added that ComCare beneficiaries receive comprehensive support, which may include monthly cash assistance for living expenses, assistance with household bills, and assistance with medical bills. In addition, they may receive employment assistance and referrals to other government agencies and community partners for case work and counselling. If their circumstances have changed, existing ComCare clients can approach their SSOs to request a review of their current support, said the spokesperson. “SSOs will increase their current level of ComCare support if needed. If the individual or family comes forward with urgent needs, our SSOs will also provide them with ComCare Interim Assistance (cash), while reviewing their assistance package,” said the spokesperson. Mr Nair noted that apart from being unemployed, another situation that can severely impact mental health is under-employment, where people work at jobs that do not recognise their trained or existing competencies. However, this is an issue which cannot be easily resolved amid an economic slump. Dr Yang believes that EAPs should be mandated for firms in Singapore. This will mean that organisations have to ensure adequate psychological or emotional support for outgoing and existing staff, he said. Within the community, he suggested having counselling support — similar to peer support groups in organisations or schools — made more readily available for the public, such as at the community centres. Apart from seeking assistance at the various family service centres, the National Care Hotline or SOS, MSF said individuals can also find out about available government support at https://www.supportgowhere.gov.sg/ On its part, the SPS has started the “One Psych Community” initiative which puts together a list of psychologists who have stepped forward to help specifically with the COVID-19 situation, by offering their services either pro bono or at reduced rates. “Mental health should not be considered a good-to-have or a bonus. Taking care of ourselves and being open to addressing our mental health issues is fundamental to our ability as humans to connect, engage and live meaningfully,” said SPS’ Dr Chan. Amid the pandemic, “prioritising our mental health should be at the forefront together with physical health, given its insidious and invisible nature”, she reiterated."
"Mental health, job opportunities among issues raised by youths in engagement sessions ", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/youth-engagement-mental-health-jobs-sg-youth-action-plan-12779532,Goh Chiew Tong,29 May 2020 02:04PM,"SINGAPORE: Mental health, future job opportunities and environmental sustainability were among the issues in focus among youths who participated in engagement sessions as part of the SG Youth Action Plan. The initiative, started by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) in May 2019, involves a panel of 14 youth leaders, plus the co-chairs Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Sim Ann and Mr Edward Chia, CEO of Timbre Group. The aim is to engage young Singaporeans in shaping their vision for the country, and developing plans for youth, community organisations and businesses. “We reached out to more than 400,000 youths and we've engaged more than 70,000 youths,” said Ms Sim. “We're very excited because we've had very good participation and ideas from our young people.” Speaking to the media on Wednesday (May 27), Ms Sim outlined the progress that the SG Youth Action plan has made in the past year. This will culminate in a Youth Action Challenge digital summit that will be held from Jul 13 to 19. Twelve teams will present their ground-up initiatives, which are guided by the key themes that have emerged from the engagement sessions. While the summit was supposed to be held in April – it was postponed due to COVID-19 circuit breaker measures - Ms Sim said this gave the youths the chance to update their projects in light of coronavirus situation.  “Much of the themes are evergreen - like sustainability, helping the vulnerable in society and the economy. But in terms of the execution, there's bound to be some aspects which they need to update because of our ongoing fight against a pandemic,” she explained. “The pandemic is really a test of preparedness … (the SG Youth Action Plan) helps to get them ready to play a very proactive role.” On the topic of mental health, Mr Chia said that the panel managed to make “good headway” in championing support for the issue, for instance, by working on providing peer support training. “When youths have issues, they tend to want to talk to their friends first, rather than knock on the doors of the school counsellor. (But) sometimes their friends might not also know how to react effectively and know what is the quick first response,” he added. Ms Sim noted that mental health ranked second in terms of participants’ concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the top concern being interaction with friends. “We are glad that we started keeping tabs on this issue early,” she said.  The SG Youth Action Plan will have a new dedicated website, which includes a special COVID-19 subpage, said Mr Chia. “We have come up with a depository - how youths can take action for themselves and if they require additional help, there are also links that we have provided for.” “It's important firstly to let the youths know that they are not alone in this situation.” Another area that SG Youth Action Plan is focusing on is promoting mentorship as a way to empower youths to fulfil their potential. This is done through matching youths to mentors, industry professional and job opportunities. It’s an area that has come to the fore given that “traditional methods” of job search have changed with the coronavirus outbreak, said Ms Sim. “You're not going to have in-person job fairs and networking sessions, so it's all the more important to provide that assurance to young people,” she explained. For example, SG Youth Action Plan panelist Ms Swedha Rajaram, who is also part of Advisory Singapore, started the   to match students with industry mentors amidst concerns due to COVID-19. Mr Chia added that there would be a heightened level of “urgency” faced by the youths who are graduating and entering the workforce this year. “We hope to resource more of such organisations that will provide such mentorship,” he told reporters. To empower youths to do more in this time of crisis, the National Youth Council (NYC) has introduced a COVID-19 edition of the Young ChangeMakers Grant, to provide seed funding for ground-up initiatives related to the coronavirus situation. Singaporeans and permanent residents aged between 15 and 35 can apply, and their projects should benefit the Singapore community in line with national objectives around COVID-19. There are three priority areas for projects – jobs, supporting vulnerable groups and mental wellbeing. The funding criteria has been relaxed, said Ms Sim to make it easier for young people to implement plans and help the vulnerable. For instance, applicants can now tap the grant for fundraising projects for local beneficiaries. “In the past, we’ve been focusing the funding on the operational aspect (of projects), but we also recognise that we are in a very different time right now and the needs are acute,” said Ms Sim. Approvals and disbursements will be faster, she added. Upon approval, up to 50 per cent of the approved grant will be disbursed within seven working days, compared to two to three weeks previously. Additionally, S$30 million from the National Youth Fund has been set aside over the next five years for partnerships with youths to champion ground-up initiatives that are in line with the SG Youth Action Plan. “This serves as an encouragement,” said Ms Sim. “As long as there are good ideas, we are very prepared to listen and we're very prepared to support.” One project that received funding from the National Youth Fund last year is the Happiness Initiative, a social enterprise that takes a preventive approach towards mental health by equipping youth with “the science of happiness”. Based on positive psychology, the Happiness Initiative works with schools and corporations to promote practical ways in which one can “flourish” and “find their purpose”, said its co-founder Sherman Ho. ""We try to run activities that are engaging and interesting rather than just throwing out jargon."" One example is the Happiness Film Festival held last year, with the support of the National Youth Fund. “People relate very much to stories, so we use all these films to facilitate conversations,” the 31-year-old added. Since they can no longer hold physical events, the social enterprise has moved online and is now compiling a four-week webinar series that discusses “resilience and resolve”. Despite the ongoing pandemic, Ms Sim remains positive about the various ideas, adding that youths can be “pathfinders”. “We hope that many of them will feel equipped and empowered to put their ideas into action, help themselves, and also help others and help us navigate this post COVID-19 world,” she said."
"Justice, mercy and a long road to recovery: An in-depth look at criminals with mental illness in Singapore", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/criminals-mental-health-singapore-courts-prisons-11535486,Lydia Lam,15 Jun 2019 06:03AM,"SINGAPORE: When he was 18, Ng Say Tiong started taking heroin, egged on by bad company in the Tanjong Rhu area where he lived with his parents and two younger brothers.  The son of a coolie and a hawker was arrested and sentenced to three years in a Reformative Training Centre for taking drugs. He continued to commit crimes after his release from the reformative training centre. For this, Say Tiong was jailed on more than 10 occasions, mostly for drug offences but also for hurting others. He would take drugs, drink alcohol and attack others with weapons when he felt enraged by what they said.  “I would feel frustrated,” Say Tiong, now 61, told CNA in a mix of Mandarin and Hokkien. “When I’m frustrated, I cannot think (straight).” The repeated heroin use, revolving door experience with prison and a brother with developmental problems weighed heavily on him. He said he felt sad and depressed. In 2002, at the age of 44, he was diagnosed with depression by psychiatrists at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) while serving a 10-year prison sentence. There are others like Say Tiong, whose troubles and mental conditions form a backdrop against which they commit crime. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) told CNA that about 10 per cent of prisoners here are diagnosed with mental disorders, the most common being insomnia, adjustment disorder and depressive episodes. Criminal defence lawyers told CNA that depression is perhaps the most common mental illness they have seen among accused persons. Lawyer Sunil Sudheesan, who has handled about a thousand cases in his 14 years of practice, said about 300 to 400 of his clients had some sort of psychiatric issue, with depression being the most common. “The core of depression is that it results in a person behaving in a way which they would not normally behave because you can’t deal with your problems and therefore your ability to control your reactions sometimes is affected significantly,” he said.  While mild depression may not excuse a person from criminal liability, lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said severe or moderate depression can impair a person’s judgment and become a mitigating factor in sentencing. Mr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said: “Ultimately, there is also the issue of whether the mental illness has any causal link to the offence. For many persons, the mental illness is merely a condition which may not have a determining effect on the criminal act.” Inmates with mental illnesses receive treatment for their conditions by a team of psychiatrists and medical officers while they are incarcerated. A team of correctional rehabilitation specialists and psychologists also give them counselling and therapy. According to Dr Christopher Cheok, senior consultant at IMH’s department of forensic psychiatry, the process in prison is no different from hospital clinics. “Patients are assessed, given medication as needed and provided with psychotherapy and occupational therapy. The only difference is that they are seen in a secure setting,” he said. He added that the goals of treatment are the same - to reduce psychological suffering and manage the mental illness. Despite their condition, most will be assessed to be well enough to mingle with the general prison population and can be put through work and rehabilitation programmes. Only those with severe mental conditions are separated from the general population. They are treated for their condition by a team of IMH psychiatrists, psychologists, and occupational therapists who work closely with SPS’ psychologists. The aim is to help these inmates understand and manage their mental disorders and prepare to reintegrate them into the general inmate population.  While the law accords the same rights to people with mental illnesses as any other person, there are special provisions for those whom the court finds unfit to plead because they are of unsound mind, said a Ministry of Law (MinLaw) spokesman. Their plea will not be taken and the court will order the person to be examined by a medical practitioner or remanded for observation in a psychiatric institution for up to a month. If the medical practitioner certifies that the person is incapable of making his defence, the court may release him if it is certain that he will receive proper care and would not harm himself or others. The alternative is for the matter to be referred to the Minister for Law, who may order the person to be confined in a psychiatric institution or any place of safe custody for treatment, said the spokesman. Their mental state will be reviewed by independent experts at least once every six months and they may be discharged on the minister's order following a review, said MinLaw. Ex-convicts may continue their treatment with IMH after their release from jail. The institute began the Forensic Psychiatry Community Service in 2012 to provide continued treatment and service to ex-convicts with a psychotic, affective or anxiety disorder diagnosis, supported by case managers and medical social workers. More than 460 patients who are ex-convicts have completed this voluntary one-year programme. After this one year period. they could either be transferred to IMH care teams handling the general patient population for treatment and support or receive care from community partners if their conditions are less complex and have stabilised. Accused people could be given non-jail sentences that focus on rehabilitation. Singapore's community court, which has a problem-solving approach and an emphasis on rehabilitation, was set up in 2006 for special cases including offenders with mental conditions. It can now impose mandatory treatment orders (MTOs) for up to three years, where offenders must undergo psychiatric treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. Other than MTOs, the community court could impose community service orders; day reporting orders where offenders must present themselves to a reporting centre for monitoring, counselling and rehabilitation programmes; or short detention orders. Following recent changes to the Criminal Justice Reform Act, MTOs can be imposed on offenders convicted of a prescribed list of more serious offences, which are punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment, up from offences punishable with up to three years’ jail. Each case is unique and is dealt with on its own set of circumstances, lawyers and psychiatrists told CNA. Criminal defence lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said mental illness can come into play at two other stages in the court process, with the first in considering some defences in certain types of crime. For example, having a mental condition could allow a person accused of murder to argue for the defence of diminished responsibility, he said. The second is in sentencing, where the courts could give a reduced punishment if an accused person’s mental illness is shown to have played a part in his commission of the offence.  But just because an accused person has a mental illness does not mean he gets a reduced sentence or a community-based sentence, and not all types of mental illnesses are given weight as a mitigating factor, they said. For example, an accused person suffering from paedophilic disorder may not succeed in using that in mitigation, said Mr Thuraisingam as “it’s not the type of offence which affects your judgment”.  “A paedophile is predisposed in a particular way but there’s nothing affecting his judgment as to whether to do something right or wrong. It must in a way affect your ability to resist (committing the crime),” he explained. “It is different for someone with impulse control (disorders) which affects his judgment on whether to do something or not,” he said.  “In the event that the suspect is diagnosed with a mental disorder, the psychiatrists will further assess if this has impaired the suspect’s judgement at the point of committing the act,” said IMH’s Dr Cheok. Private psychiatrist Dr Munidasa Winslow, who was previously with IMH, said beyond making the assessment, he would also make recommendations to prevent the person from reoffending. The judge will look at the psychiatric reports tendered by the prosecution and defence in coming to a decision on how much mitigating weight to give, if at all, to the offender’s mental condition. Jail time may not necessarily be the best option for accused persons with mental conditions, said lawyers. Lawyer Mr Thuraisingam said: ""(For) a normal person, you jail him once, he will think - I don't want to do this again, because I don't want to go to prison. But a person who has mental illness may not think that way."" Criminal lawyer Sunil Sudheesan said jail is too ""short-term"". ""Because you come out and there's nothing,"" he said. ""You're left in the wilderness."" Jail will not work ""all the more"" for recalcitrant offenders with mental conditions, as ""there needs to be a more interventionist sort of MTO"" which could involve a stay in a psychiatric institution, said Mr Sudheesan. He cited the case of Goh Lee Yin, a woman diagnosed with kleptomania who committed suicide in 2017 after repeatedly being convicted of shoplifting. ""You know the entire stigmatisation of the criminal justice process and the trauma involved there, sometimes it’s clearly too much for people to bear,” he said. Psychiatrist Dr Winslow who was involved in the case, said he knew she needed ""a lot more help for her mental condition"", adding that the legal criteria for how a condition contributes to a crime and mental health criteria ""are not exactly aligned all the time"". But Dr Winslow said he sees progress. “If they have committed a crime, they want to be able to punish them for the crime, but there’s a greater emphasis overall than when I first started in the 1980s towards restorative justice, they want to see that people who have mental health conditions get the help for those mental health conditions and that is something that I see a lot more strongly than before,” he said.  Mr Nathan said family members can also help by being more open about those with mental illnesses. ""Pretending that a condition doesn't exist or sweeping it under the carpet could ultimately cause more harm to the offender. Ultimately, we all have to remove the stigma attached to mental illnesses,"" he said. Dr Winslow added that there seems to be a greater awareness of mental health conditions that makes people more willing to talk about them to their lawyers or doctors.  He said the solution is for people to recognise if they have got issues, to persistently seek help and be aware that, sometimes, it takes time. “After you restore hope, and tell people you actually have a condition that can be treated, life can change,” he said. “Maybe I’m a little bit more of an optimist, but I think that even judges like to see lives saved rather than just putting people into prison.” For Say Tiong, salvation came after a long journey and near-death experiences.  While he was in IMH after a referral there by the court, one of his ward mates asked him to join him in killing himself. His ward mate died, but Say Tiong was saved by a nurse and was later told that his mother had died the night before.  He had tried committing suicide seven or eight times in various ways over his lifetime - but was not fully cognisant that he suffered from depression until he was admitted to IMH on a court order. “I would think - I should die. Living has no meaning. I felt very sad,” he said. “I asked myself why did I become like this - I kept taking heroin, why did no one save me? Why was my mother in a wheelchair, and my brother had brain problems. I would drink and drink and drink, before smoking heroin.” Looking back on his life, Say Tiong said he took drugs as a form of escape each time. Say Tiong, who still visits IMH from time to time, has managed in recent years to cut down the dosage of the medication he takes for his depression. He no longer leads a life of crime since his release from prison in 2012, after meeting a fellow inmate who introduced him to Christianity. “I took drugs because I felt frustrated - why would I take drugs, why did I take this road? I knew it was wrong, but I kept doing it. I couldn't help myself,” he said. ""Now I don't need to escape anymore. Now I am happy."""
Commentary: Linking mental illness to gun violence is problematic, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/texas-el-paso-shooting-mental-illness-gun-violence-donald-trump-11787914,Arash Javanbakht,08 Aug 2019 06:29AM,"DETROIT, Michigan: President Donald Trump called for reform of mental health laws on the heels of two deadly shootings that claimed the lives of at least 31 people and left a grief-stricken country in disbelief. The president, saying that “hatred and mental illness pulls the trigger, not the gun,” also called for better identification of people with mental illness and, in some cases, “involuntary confinement” of them. These sentiments are similar to comments that Trump and a number of other politicians have made previously.  For example, after the  , which claimed the lives of 17, of whom 14 were students, Trump said he thought due process for mentally ill people was not as important as making sure that they do not have guns. “I don’t want mentally ill people to be having guns. Take the guns first, go through due process second,” Trump said. In the past, mental illness has been scapegoated to deflect public outrage about access to assault rifles that can kill tens of people in a matter of minutes.  During these heated debates, words such as “crazy,” “nuts” and “maniac” are used to describe the person who committed the act of violence, even before a medical diagnosis is released. In this debate, many questions arise that those discussing mental illness and gun violence may not even think about: What do we mean by mental illness? Which mental illness?  What would be the policies to keep guns away from the potentially dangerous mentally ill? Most of these questions remain unanswered during these discussions. Specifically, no one suggests who will decide whether a patient with mental illness should not have access to firearms – would it be a psychiatrist, an independent forensic psychiatrist, a committee of psychiatrists or a judge?  How about those who do not seek psychiatric evaluation and treatment? Should a psychiatric examination be integrated into the background check process for each person who wants to purchase a gun?  As severe mental illness can start at any point in life, will gun owners need periodic psychiatric assessment (like a vision exam for renewing a driver’s license)? Who will pay for the visits? It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. The term “mental illness” covers a wide range of psychiatric conditions that are addressed and treated by mental health professionals. You may be surprised to know there are more than 200 diagnoses listed in the most recent version of Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is released by the American Psychiatric Association.  This includes conditions such as anxiety disorders like spider phobia, social phobia, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, hair-picking, pathological gambling, schizophrenia, dementia, different forms of depression and personality disorders, such as anti-social personality disorder commonly known as psychopathy. Mental illnesses are also very common: Nearly one in five people experience clinical depression during their lives; one in five experiences an anxiety disorder; one in 100 experience schizophrenia; and nearly 8 per cent of the general population experience PTSD. People who have had higher exposure to trauma, violence and warfare, such as veterans, have higher rates of PTSD (up to 30 per cent). Now, when one suggests that gun access should be restricted for people with mental illness, do they mean all of these conditions? Or just some, or some in defined circumstances?  For example, should guns be removed guns all veterans with PTSD, or all people with social anxiety, or those who habitually pick their skin? Needless to say that diagnosing these conditions mostly relies on the person’s report and the physician’s observation, and the ability to rely on their report is important. Not all mental illness may be a risk of harm to others.  In the majority of cases when a patient is involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit, it is not because the person is a risk to others.  Rather, it is more often the case that the person is at risk of harming himself, as in the case of a depressed, suicidal patient. In psychiatric disorders, concerns about harm to others typically arise in acutely psychotic patients with paranoid delusions that convince them to harm others. This may happen in, but is not limited to schizophrenia, dementia, severe psychotic depression or psychotic bipolar illness. Substance use, which can increase the risk of crime or psychosis, can also lead to intentions to harm others.  Other situations, when a person could be a risk of harm to others, are personality disorders with a high level of impulsivity or lack of remorse, such as anti-social personality disorder. But the reality is that most people with personality disorders do not seek treatment and are not known to mental health providers. Those with diagnosed serious mental illness, who are determined by a psychiatrist to be a serious risk of harm to themselves or others, already get admitted to acute or long-term inpatient care and are kept there until they are deemed not dangerous.  Of course this happens only if they are brought in for psychiatric evaluation by others or law enforcement. Even among the 1 per cent of the US population with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is rare to find people who are a risk of harm to others or at risk of acting violently.  Despite the widespread belief that a person with serious mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia can be dangerous, only 3 per cent to 4 per cent of allviolent acts in a given year in the US are committed by people diagnosed with commonly cited mental illness of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression. Also, these conditions are rather strongly associated with increased risk of suicide, not homicide.  Furthermore, risk of violence among severely mentally ill declines in the absence of substance use. In other words, prevention and treatment of substance use can decrease the risk of violence in this population. Also, the prevalence of severe mental illnesses, is relatively similar across different countries, including those with much lower rates of mass murder than the US. Finally, the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis in a murderer, does not necessarily justify causality, as much as the weapon the person carries.  In other words, because mental illness is so prevalent, a percentage of crimes are, statistically, going to be committed by people with a mental illness. Every time mental illness is linked to acts of violence by the media or politicians, the highly charged emotions of the moment can impact those with mental illness and their families. When “mental illness” is so vaguely addressed in gun debates, those with a mental illness without an increased risk of violence or impairment in judgment (such as anxiety or phobia) may avoid seeking treatment.  I have often had patients who were worried that their diagnosis of depression or anxiety, although well-treated, might be used against them in court regarding child custody. I have repeatedly had to explain to them that their disorder does not provide grounds for justification of impaired judgment. I personally believe it is common sense to limit everyone’s access to weapons with the potential of killing tens of people in a matter of minutes. Choosing who may or may not have access to them based on mental illness is, as I’ve outlined, very hard indeed."
COVID-19: One-stop mental health platform launched to match users with resources and helplines, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-mental-health-platform-launched-mindline-sg-12909640,Christy Yip,07 Jul 2020 07:03PM,"SINGAPORE: A website with various resources on mental health was launched on Tuesday (Jul 7) to help users assess their wellbeing and match them with forms of assistance if needed.  The website, called mindline.sg, was developed by teams from the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). In a press release, they said the platform consolidates access to many resources and tools to help people ""access and navigate care, with an emphasis on stress and coping”. It comes at a time when COVID-19 has brought about more sources of stress for many, said experts.  “In the early days, it was just anxiety over what the disease meant,” said Dr Loke Wai Chiong, clinical director (programmes) and head of integrated health promotion at MOHT. He noted that when Singapore entered the “circuit breaker”, stress factors like isolation, working from home or home-based learning, as well as domestic abuse surfaced.   “We want to enable everyone in Singapore to get the help that they really need easily and conveniently,” Dr Loke said.  Resources available on the platform include helplines and counselling by phone, employment support, financial assistance, family and caregiving support, volunteer opportunities, as well as health and fitness tips.  Users can also learn more about their emotional wellbeing through self-assessment based on a “clinically validated” tool.  A series of questions are put to users, for instance, whether they felt nervous, anxious or on edge over the last two weeks. Depending on the answers, users will be guided to the appropriate channels of intervention and support.  Stressing that the platform allows users to remain anonymous, Dr Loke said: “We want to … empower individuals to take care of their holistic wellbeing in a safe way … they don’t have to feel embarrassed or shame that they are seeking help.” There is a need to shift towards self-care and self-management of stress and coping issues, in the same way that physical health is promoted through being active and having a healthy lifestyle, said Dr Loke.  “In MOHT, we think about chronic diseases and for many years we talk about diabetes and hypertension,” he added. “There’s no health or physical health without mental health … without mental health, seriously, your physical health will also suffer.” In future iterations of the platform, the team is thinking of adding more personalised features to direct users to the help they need, emotionally intelligent chat bots, as well as phone therapy services linked to counselling networks in Singapore.  The user experience could also be customised to different segments of users such as youth, elderly and healthcare workers, Dr Loke said. “We hope more people will use this. We will over time be able to analyse how the needs change in the community,"" he said. ""That could help us as a whole as providers, as government, as non-profit sectors to support the needs and resource these services accurately and correctly over time.” "
Public service committed to provide 'inclusive and mental health-friendly' workplace: Chan Chun Sing, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/public-service-committed-to-provide-inclusive-and-mental-health-12389904,Rachel Phua,04 Feb 2020 04:36PM,"SINGAPORE: Public agencies do not require job applicants to declare their medical health history, said Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 4). This includes the individual's mental health condition, said the Public Service Division (PSD). Since May 1, 2017, the PSD has removed all declaration questions on medical health from job application forms, Mr Chan said in response to a question from Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong. She had asked for the public service's response to the latest guidelines by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) which states that it is discriminatory to ask job applicants to declare their mental health condition without good reason. The guidelines, which was revised in December, also called for all declarations on mental health condition be removed from job application forms. Ms Ong also asked for the number of applicants who declared their mental health condition and joined the public service. Mr Chan said that the Government does not track those figures. Mr Chan said the public service is committed to providing its officers with “an inclusive and mental health-friendly workplace”. This includes access to counselling and alternative work arrangements for those with mental health conditions to better manage their condition or recovery, as well as getting the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to teach managers how to detect early signs of distress. More than 500 public officers have taken part in HPB’s workshop so far. Ms Ong also brought up the case of an individual who applied as a relief teacher but was rejected due to a history of depression. In reply, Mr Chan said Ms Ong could follow up with the Ministry of Education or the PSD on this specific case. She also wanted to know if the Government allows its employees to apply for mental health leave and make medical claims for psychiatric treatment.  The public service does not have ""mental health"" leave at this point in time, Mr Chan said in reply. “But I am sure if somebody for medical exigencies needs extra care they can contact their respective supervisors and we can work out the appropriate arrangements,"" he added."
Government to publish advisory to help improve mental wellbeing in the workplace, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-wellbeing-workplace-singapore-mom-12495426,Rachel Phua,03 Mar 2020 06:46PM,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will soon be issuing an advisory to help employers take steps to improve mental wellbeing in the workplace. In his Committee of Supply speech on Tuesday (Mar 3), Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said that the ministry will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on mental wellbeing to educate employers on what can be done.  The advisory will highlight initiatives companies should emulate, and that could include access to anonymised external counselling service, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early.  MOM aims to finalise the advisory in the second half of this year.  The ministry is also piloting iWorkHealth, a web-based psychosocial assessment tool to help employers and their employees identify workplace stressors, while recommending ways to improve mental well-being. The tool is expected to launch later this year.   National Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong separately announced in his speech that the union will work with the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council and the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) to promote mental wellbeing at workplaces.  The group will profile inclusive employers “who have gone the extra mile to put in place robust mental wellness programmes to help employees stay mentally healthy and resilient”, Mr Yong said, with the aim of having them as industry role models. In response to Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong’s question whether sick leave entitlements can be used for both physical and mental health conditions, Mr Zaqy said that this is already the case. When issuing medical certificates, a doctor should not indicate to the employer the nature of the patient’s medical condition unless the patient has consented to it, he said.  Employers are expected to practise fair employment practices laid out in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, Mr Zaqy pointed out. Discrimination on grounds of a person’s mental health condition will be penalised. However, he noted that for certain occupations such as pilots and police officers, some mental health conditions may affect their ability to perform their job roles effectively.  ""In these cases, it is reasonable for employers to ask applicants for more information to make a holistic assessment of their wellbeing,"" he said. ""Otherwise, employers should not be asking for information on the applicant’s mental health."" "
Schools to offer mental health lessons from 2021; more trips to Asian countries, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/schools-mental-health-lessons-2021-more-trips-asia-moe-12499088,Cindy Co,04 Mar 2020 12:36PM,"SINGAPORE: Mental wellness and peer support will be given more focus in schools soon, as the Ministry of Education refreshes the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum for 2021. “One key challenge our youths face today is mental well-being,” said Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah in Parliament on Wednesday (Mar 4). As such, mental health will be part of the new CCE curriculum in secondary schools, “to help students to understand common mental health issues and their symptoms, know when and how to seek help for themselves and others, and develop empathy and care towards persons with mental health issues”, said Ms Indranee, during her ministry’s Committee of Supply debate. Similarly, polytechnics and the Institute for Technical Education (ITE) have also worked with the Health Promotion Board to develop mental health resources for students. Other than educating students, teachers will also create “a positive school learning environment”. Teachers are taught to create a “positive classroom culture” as part of their training, and “positive teacher-students relationships are strongly emphasised”, said Ms Indranee. The ministry will develop teachers’ capabilities through SkillsFuture for Educators. Building on that, schools will have to teach students how to overcome setbacks. “To help students face challenges confidently, we will help students develop the resilience mindset of ‘I am, I have, I can’,” said Ms Indranee. This mindset will teach students to appreciate their strengths, harness positive beliefs about themselves, tap on peer and family support and equip them with skills such as emotional regulation, problem-solving and managing relationships and conflicts. As peer support can contribute to students’ well-being, MOE will also establish peer support structures in every school by 2022. “Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter, forming a strong network of support in their class, CCA (co-curricular activity) or peer group, where they can look out for each other and seek guidance from teachers or counsellors where necessary,” said Ms Indranee. Despite these measures, students who still struggle with mental health issues will require more support, she added. Teachers in schools and Institute of Higher Learnings’ class advisors will be trained to pick up signs of distress, reach out to these students and refer them to mental health professionals if needed. As part of the refreshed CCE curriculum, primary schools will emphasise the teaching of moral values, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung during his Committee of Supply speech on Wednesday. “As the Chinese saying goes … values before academics,” said Mr Ong. The bulk of CCE lessons for Primary 1 to 3 students will be devoted to character and values, while CCE and mother tongue lessons for all primary school students will be better aligned, as many character and values lessons are taught during mother tongue lessons, he said. National education and citizenship, currently part of the CCE curriculum, will be taught during the Form Teacher Guidance Period instead. This will apply to Primary 4 to 6 students. MOE will also increase efforts to engage secondary school students on contemporary issues through CCE lessons, covering topics such as climate change, government policies and race and religion. “(Some of these topics) may be sensitive to discuss, but they are important to help our students better understand the complexities of our country and our life,” said Mr Ong. “Teachers will guide students to listen attentively, converse respectfully and be open to differing perspectives.”  As specialised skills may be needed to facilitate discussion of complex or sensitive topics, every secondary school will have specialised CCE teachers by 2022. Outside the classroom, CCE will be integrated into activities such as CCAs, camps, cohort learning journeys and Values-in-Action.  Three new models of CCA allocation will be piloted at several primary schools in 2020, aimed at eliminating CCA selection trials. The ministry is also looking into expanding a pilot that allows students to participate in CCAs not offered in their schools, while some schools will trial combined teams for CCAs with small enrolment. The new CCE curriculum will be progressively implemented in all primary and secondary schools from 2021, said Mr Ong. To allow students to engage Southeast Asia better, the humanities curriculum will place more emphasis on studying Asia, said Mr Ong. “It must provide students with a deeper appreciation of the geographies, histories, cultures, languages and economies of our regional countries,” he said. More overseas trips will also be organised to Asian countries. Singaporean students should experience Asia, as it is “our own backyard” and where Singaporeans “have a natural competitive advantage”, added Mr Ong. These measures will go towards the 70-70 goal announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Sweet Keat in his Budget statement. Under this goal, Institutes of Higher Learning will aim for 70 per cent of their students to have overseas exposure, with a further 70 per cent of these students to have exposure to ASEAN, China or India. MOE will also teach conversational ASEAN languages starting with Vietnamese and Thai.  This will be offered to students from primary to pre-university levels and it will be a 10-hour language and cultural exposure component. “Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. Together with China, India, Japan, Korea, they all form part of our natural hinterland. “Singapore-based enterprises need to be able to venture out to the region, and Singaporeans must be able to play a part in it. To do so, we need to be equipped with the relevant knowledge, language and cultural skills,” said Mr Ong."
Mental health support service for at-risk youths to be launched this year: MOH , https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/integrated-youth-service-lam-pin-min-cos-12504846,Ang Hwee Min,05 Mar 2020 03:52PM,"SINGAPORE: A new initiative offering mental health support and awareness to at-risk youths will be launched this year, Senior Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min announced on Thursday (Mar 5). Speaking in Parliament during the Committee of Supply debate, Dr Lam noted that recent engagements with youths showed ""mental well-being continues to be a top concern"", indicating that more needs to be done.  The Integrated Youth Service, jointly developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Institute of Mental Health, Agency for Integrated Care and Care Corner, is described in an MOH press release as a ""one-stop service where at-risk youths can access coordinated mental health and support services such as individualised basic emotional support, needs identification and befriending services"".  It will be launched in the second half of 2020.  Care Corner will reach out to youths in a series of outreach events, beginning in Woodlands.  Dr Lam said that MOH will continue to take a ""whole-of-society approach"" and work with other ministries to address youth mental health needs. In addition, the ministry will work with the National Youth Council on the Youth Mental Well-being Network, he added.  The network aims to ""bring together (the) diverse perspectives and views"" of those who have reached out to the Government with ideas for improving youth mental well-being, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee in a Facebook post on Feb 27.  MOH will also be piloting a “structured system of support” for caregivers of persons with mental health conditions, announced Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor on Thursday.  “We must also not forget that the well-being of persons with mental health conditions often rests on the caregivers and the caregivers are at risk of burnout,” she said.  Hospitals and community partners will provide caregivers with information such as disease progression and expected care needs, and link them up with the necessary health, financial and social support services upon the first diagnosis of their loved ones, said Dr Khor.  “With this, we hope that caregivers will know upfront that they are not alone, that there is an entire network of support for them.”  In a separate press release, MOH said that the system will allow caregivers early access to community support, and be equipped with the skills and knowledge to care for their loved ones at home.  Dr Khor noted that MOH has set up 43 community outreach teams and trained more than 24,000 frontline workers to identify people with mental health needs and refer them to the appropriate support.  As of December, the ministry has reached out to more than 300,000 people and provided assistance to more than 23,000 who were at risk of developing mental health conditions or dementia, she added.  “Like a migraine or backache, we should seek help for mental health issues early, so as to avoid problems that are more challenging to address later on.” "
'A necessary investment': Why firms choose to cover employees for mental health services, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/employee-workplace-mental-health-insurance-tripartite-advisory-13586244,Cheryl Lin,19 Nov 2020 06:14AM,"SINGAPORE: Companies that have expanded employee benefits to cover mental health services said the move sends a crucial signal to workers that they take the issue seriously, adding that it makes business sense as well. Such benefits are among the recommendations issued by a tripartite advisory on Tuesday (Nov 17) promoting mental wellness in the workforce. It comes amid growing attention on the added stress workers may face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  “For companies with flexible employee benefits (e.g. medical benefits), consider extending the scope of coverage to include mental well-being programmes, mental health consultations and treatments,” the advisory said. ""This signals the company’s desire to support its employees in overcoming their mental health challenges."" It is a sentiment shared by companies who have implemented measures to support their employees' mental well-being. Calling employee benefits the “most visible” part of a company’s stance, Accenture’s head of human resources for Southeast Asia Grace Yip said: “When a company does make a change in their benefits, it’s a firm and clear signal to the workforce that we take it very seriously. ""It is seen as skin in the game."" The consulting firm incorporated mental health coverage into its employee health benefits in 2018, when it allowed claims for related treatments to be made under its specialist outpatient insurance, but only with a referral letter. In 2019, it did away with the need for referrals.  The move was a part of larger efforts to promote inclusion within the company, with other initiatives targeting awareness and education about mental health, for example. “You can put in benefits, but if you’re not changing the other stuff, you’re not moving the needle,"" Ms Yip told CNA on Wednesday. “We need to create, in a holistic way, an environment that is safe and encourage people to think about mental well-being and care about others."" The efforts have paid off, according to Accenture. Internal surveys have shown a 75.4 per cent increase in employees who feel safe expressing mental health challenges to their supervisors. There has also been a “positive response” on assessments of how supported these employees feel, said Ms Yip. There is also a business case for investing in mental health, said the executive director of the Singapore Human Resources Institute Alvin Aloysius Goh. “If a staff’s mental well-being is not taken care of, he or she may become less productive or may even result in leaving an organisation and these will impact the company greatly,"" he said. “When an organisation looks after its employees, it will reflect positively in their business, hence it is not just if this is a good investment, it is a necessary investment."" At Otis Elevator Company, while its medical insurance provider does not cover mental health services, employees can tap internal “company self-funded insurance” which was expanded to cover some specialist treatments, including psychological support services. This is an “intermediary solution” because the goal ultimately is to have external insurance cover mental health services, said Ms Karine Scelles, the firm's executive HR director of Asia-Pacific. While the company is in talks with its insurer to see what this plan could look like, the main challenge is nailing down a cost. “The (insurers) will tell you that they are okay to cover mental health, but they’ll have to increase your premium by ‘XYZ’. I understand they also have to look at economics, but it’s creating the wrong discussion,” said Ms Scelles. “I really think there is something to be done in terms of having this industry consider mental illness like any other physical illness."" She added: “People spend most of their time working and so as an employer, we have a responsibility for people to be in their best condition, perform and feel well.” Accenture and Otis Elevator Company are part of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, a circle that includes top executives from the private and public sector who meet quarterly to discuss inclusive practices. A subgroup was also set up to deal with the prohibitive costs of improving corporate mental health coverage. They are working together in the hope of strategising and negotiating with insurers. “Once you have a certain level of risk-pooling, then the risk management part of it makes it more affordable, like a critical mass kind of thing,” said mental health advocate Anthea Ong, who founded the workgroup. “The fewer employers who come on board, the more expensive it continues to be, and it’s a chicken and egg situation. There needs to be a collective coordinated effort.” The former Nominated Member of Parliament added that out of the recommendations by the tripartite advisory, which include organising workshops or training managers to spot distress, insuring mental health is the “biggest and hardest” to do. “Therefore, I wouldn’t say it should be the first thing on the list firms should do. But it still absolutely deserves our immediate attention to work on it because it will take time, justification, resources and negotiation,” she told CNA. Ms Ong added that when employers create a safe space for workers to seek help, people will come forward earlier. “The earlier you seek help, just like any condition, the better your recovery. That helps the company,” she said."
12 companies recognised for ‘exemplary efforts’ to promote mental health at work, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-silver-ribbon-employers-award-14741218,Grace Yeoh,04 May 2021 01:05PM,"SINGAPORE: Twelve employers were given awards for creating mentally friendly and healthy working environments by mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore), on Tuesday (May 4). The employers are Bizlink Centre Singapore Ltd, FedEx Express, Jardines MINDSET, Jebsen & Jessen Group, Johnson & Johnson Singapore, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Pocari Sweat Singapore, Project X, PSA Corporation Limited, Rio Tinto, Singapore Civil Defence Force and Twitter Asia Pacific. They were commended for promoting positive mental health awareness in their workplace, offering job opportunities to persons with mental health issues, commemorating World Mental Health Day, equipping their staff with knowledge on identifying mental health issues, and providing accommodation for staff with mental health issues.   “(The award winners have made) exemplary efforts in championing mental wellbeing in their workplaces ... This is especially timely, given the rising awareness of mental wellbeing at workplaces,” said Zaqy Mohamad, Senior Minister of State for Manpower and guest-of-honour at the event. “Mental health is just as important as physical health and it can have a significant impact on workers' productivity.” According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 264 million people suffer from depression globally, with many of these people also experiencing symptoms of anxiety, said Ellen Lee, president of Silver Ribbon. She added that a negative working environment can worsen these mental health problems, leading to physical health issues, harmful use of substances or alcohol, absenteeism, and lost productivity.   Working arrangements under the COVID-19 pandemic have resurfaced the importance of looking after employees’ mental wellbeing. In an online survey conducted by Silver Ribbon in April last year, one in four experienced “low mood, anxiety and loneliness more than usual”, said Ms Lee. Clients who attended Silver Ribbon’s complimentary online emotional support shared that they felt “stressed out while working from home, handling household chores and taking care of their loved ones”, she added. Employers also said that their employees requested Silver Ribbon’s assistance to handle crises and conduct talks for them. Beyond seeking help from Silver Ribbon, employers who received the award have their own mental wellbeing initiatives. At Rio Tinto, a global mining company, leaders and employees get mental health training to recognise “psychosocial hazards”, so they can notice a problem and extend help before it develops, said Karina Gistelinck, vice president for minerals sales and marketing. The company also has peer support programmes with “specially-trained” employees playing a pivotal role to support fellow colleagues, as those who are in distress are “more likely to reach out to friends and colleagues than to use more formal support programmes”, she added. In the company’s Singapore office, Rio Tinto has an Employee Assistance Programme that makes it easier for colleagues and their families to access professional psychologists for help. Similarly at Jardines MINDSET, employees are encouraged to use their 24-hour anonymous counselling service. Managers and HR personnel are also trained in “mental health first-aid”, while managers are encouraged to “exercise discretion” in giving team members time off due to mental health related issues, said Jeffery Tan, CEO of Jardines MINDSET. “During these scenarios, it might be difficult for employees to produce an MC (medical certificate), but this shouldn’t stop them from getting a day off. We want to build a safe environment for our employees to speak openly about their troubles and ask for help when necessary,” added Mr Tan. Aside from boosting morale, mental health initiatives in the workplace can help the company’s bottom line.   “According to WHO, every $1 put into scaled up treatment for common mental disorders, there is a return-on-investment of $4 in improved health and productivity,” said Mr Tan. “An inclusive and safe workplace culture boosts employee morale, and creates a workplace employees are happy with and thus more inclined to remain at.” While there is “no magic bullet” for workplace mental health, Mr Tan said a large part of mental wellbeing comes down to “creating more human-centered work cultures that put employees first”. Hiring people with mental health conditions is even part of business strategy at companies like Bizlink Centre. “Once (these employees) adapt and perform, they bring stability to the workforce. They tend to be committed to delivering the requirements in their job role and could bring a positive mindset and resilience to the workforce,” said Ang Li May, CEO of Bizlink Centre. “What is typically required is bringing them through a structured process, which also helps the organisation put in place better SOPs and have more structure to their processes.” But to promote better mental health at work, companies like the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) recognise that stigma against mental health issues in the workplace is a societal issue. “For too long, mental health issues were seen as character flaws that derailed careers. It’s not just companies that held these views; societies did too, and sadly some still do. But mental health issues don’t define anyone any more than a broken leg does,” said Mr Victor Mills, Chief Executive of SICC, which hopes to encourage more companies to promote mental wellness. To treat mental illness in the workforce, Mr Mills added that companies should begin with “eliminating possible stress triggers”. “Toxic managers should be held accountable and sent for help. Root out purposeless meetings. Don’t call your colleagues after office hours, and certainly not on weekends, unless it’s an emergency. Don’t expect colleagues to respond to an email at some ungodly hour. And don’t treat mental health issues as weaknesses.”"
"Commentary: When we call people with strange behaviour mentally ill, we reinforce mental health stigma ", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/lady-wearing-mask-people-with-strange-behaviour-mentally-ill-14882128,Grace Yeoh,28 May 2021 06:23AM,"SINGAPORE: There was a silver lining amid the grey cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. Much was reported about how working from home frankly made it hard to separate work from life, causing more burnout among employees.  In our private circles, it became increasingly common for friends to share refreshingly honest confessions about having bouts of anxiety and a general sense of ennui.  There has been much forthright talk of collective pandemic fatigue and acceptance that such commonplace challenges should lead us to cut each other some slack.  Blindsided by a pandemic that changed life as we knew it to be, and the loss of lives and livelihoods globally, we struggled to cope - but that struggle saw a beneficial rise in mental health awareness.  The resulting, urgent focus on mental health felt like a tiny but significant win.   Yet, two videos that went viral on social media this year suggest we may still have some way to go in understanding and talking about mental health.  The first offensive clip was  , where she asked commuters about their race. When a commuter responded she was Malay, the woman said, “Malay, is it? Okay, no wonder.”  Later in the video, she added that she would “never mix around with you guys because you are so different”.  The second and more recent video featured  . When a safe distancing ambassador asked her to put on her mask, she refused and asked instead for the ambassador’s credentials.  It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. In both incidents, several online commenters called these women  “crazy”, “with a hole in the brain” and “confirm mentally ill”.  The actions in the videos were problematic, but these comments left an even more bitter aftertaste. While some commenters explicitly mocked them, others seemed to have jumped the gun to assume these women had mental illness and urged others to understand.  Either way, such assumptions seem to reinforce the dated stereotype that those with mental illness would necessarily behave in “crazy” ways, and cannot be taken seriously - a fundamental reason for the prevailing stigma around mental illness.  “I still believe there’s a portion of Singaporeans who are not well-versed or have limited knowledge of mental health. That’s why they’re making such comments,” Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore) said to me.  She cautioned against knee-jerk reactions to label others. “Some people might have unpleasant encounters, and they might draw conclusions based on those encounters. They have not attended any talks or workshops or learnt much about mental health issues.”   The comments also implied that mental illness must have caused their disruptive behaviour caught on camera.  Yet, psychologists have often pointed out that the symptoms of mental health conditions are more varied, sometimes subtle but serious for the patient - like decreased motivation, poor appetite and fatigue. “Many mental health organisations have been working hard to collaborate with the media to raise awareness. It is a setback every time we come across such negative comments,” added Ms Poh.  If all this sounds familiar, recall the case of   who refused to wear a mask last year, because she was “a sovereign”. The circulating video captured her in a heated argument, and commenters were quick to assume that she, too, had an underlying mental health condition.  She was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks with no mental disorder found, and recently sentenced to two weeks jail and a $2,000 fine.  Judging by similar reactions to that case a year ago, it seems more awareness has not translated to less stigma.  Thankfully, this complex relationship between criminality and mental illness deserving of delicate, careful treatment is one our courts have recognised.  In fact, the criminal justice system in Singapore has a system for situations where criminals potentially have a mental health condition. It enlists the professional advice of psychiatrists in deciding the extent to which a mental health condition plays a role. “Doctors will make an initial assessment on several things. One, what type of psychiatric condition this person has. Two, whether the conditions have anything to do with the offence. And three, does the psychiatric condition allow for this person to understand his plea,” Mr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said.  “There are cases where someone’s condition is so advanced or debilitating that they might not understand the nature of the offence or the consequences of his actions.” On the other hand, some might be fit to plead, but still have some form of psychosis, he added.  The law takes into account nuances in judgment and sentencing. In less straightforward cases, two people might have the same condition but behave differently, while another two might have a different psychosis yet behave the same way. “Everyone is an individual, so how psychosis affects them is also individualistic. The psychiatrist will make an assessment whether the psychosis affected the ability to make judgement, whether he fully understands the consequences of his act, and whether he’s unable to control his behaviour,” Mr Nathan said.   “As a defence lawyer, we’re relying on someone’s psychosis to mitigate a sentence or explain someone’s actions, so we have to show the court that there is a causal link between the condition and the offence,” he added. For example, a shoplifter with a history of kleptomania would have their condition taken into consideration during sentencing, because kleptomania affects decision-making and has a “direct causal link” to shoplifting, he shared.  Our laws recognise how anyone living with a mental health condition deserves a closer look based on their unique circumstances and health. Yet our mindsets continue to assume some level of uniformity of people living with mental health conditions - as a group of unpredictable individuals who cause harm, are prone to law-breaking and should be isolated far away from society. For people who struggle with mental health or live with mental illnesses, these comments are a sobering reminder that just because they have found the courage to seek help and speak about their condition does not mean the stigma no longer exists.  For all those who think words have little consequences, think again. One in eight in the Singapore resident population have experienced a mental disorder, according to the Singapore Mental Health study 2010.  The same study initiated in 2016 saw an increase to one in seven.  Your friends or family who are secretly fighting difficult, personal battles might see such comments including yours - and in worst case scenarios, conclude that they have one less person in their corner who they can share their struggles with.   Ultimately, no amount of mental health awareness campaigns or policies can override our daily words and actions.  Campaigns and policies might enact widespread shifts within systems, but everyday action is how we ensure the change needed in our mindsets is deep-rooted and authentic that go beyond lip service. And perhaps, we can start by refraining from calling people “crazy” or “confirm mental illness”. Otherwise, this COVID-19 silver lining can very quickly turn grey."
Commentary: Worries over COVID-19 situation are taking a mental toll on Singapore, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-singapore-mental-health-hotline-resource-14899148,Anthea Ong,30 May 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: “It feels like deja vu,” a young community worker said, a day after the tightened measures for Phase 2 came into effect. He remembers the stress and manic scramble to support children living in rental flats and transitional shelters for home-based learning. He recalls helping migrant workers with food and essential items during the outbreak in the dormitories at the onset of circuit breaker last year. Just 10 days later, two friends with home-based businesses reliant on clients coming to their homes experienced heart palpitations following the announcement of the two-person cap as part of  . They are not alone in feeling nervous about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. Calls to some mental health hotlines saw a spike on Sunday (May 16), the first day of the latest phase of COVID-19 restrictions, executives who run these hotlines tell me. Psychologists have pointed out how stressors released over the uncertainty over livelihoods, routines and catching a deadly virus have created a sense of constant danger and exerted an emotional toll on us. After a year of dealing with a raging pandemic, we have seen signs of increased stress and worry, even when Singapore was doing well in curbing infection numbers. More than nine in 10 Singaporeans (91 per cent) have said that their mental health has declined in the last year, according to a study by AIA last month. The sources are multifold. In the #AreWeOkay poll by SG Mental Health Matters conducted between March and April, 51.2 per cent of respondents said the restrictions on social activities and interactions have negatively impacted their mental health. Forty-four per cent said that changes to work and school had a similar effect. As cases ticked up in recent weeks, fuelling calls for a clean circuit breaker to be pulled, I would argue we should be careful not to do so lightly, not without preparing for the mental health support needed. After all, during the circuit breaker last year, the Samaritans of Singapore received over 10,000 calls in distress, a 36 per cent increase. Over the same period, the non-profit organisation Caregivers’ Alliance supported 11 caregivers, of which six had lost their loved ones to suicide and the remaining five struggling with family members attempting suicide.   It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. People focus on the financial costs and risk of deep economic scarring when restrictions slow recovery. Just as important but less talked about is the price of loneliness and social withdrawal, domestic violence and unresolved grief, not to mention work-from-home stress and the helplessness over an uncertain, volatile future. There are baby steps to build resilience and support people as this coronavirus persists and should additional restrictions be required. Many government-led and community initiatives have sprung up. A National Care Hotline was set up in April last year manned by officers trained to provide mental health first aid and refer cases to public healthcare institutions and community service providers to follow up if necessary. These benefitted 30,000 calls as of October 2020. The Ministry of Social & Family Development also recently launched a 24-hour National Anti-Violence Helpline for the public to report cases of family violence, abuse and neglect. It is also heartening to see targeted efforts to aid specific groups, like the Seniors Go Digital Programme to help seniors connect online with friends, family and government services. There is also a budding recognition that workplaces must step up where the stressors can come from work. More employers, like the CEOs and leaders I work with at the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, have accelerated plans for employee mental well-being including work-from-home support programmes in the last year. Yet let’s be clear about the enormity of the mental health challenges that lie head. While we are better prepared for a second circuit breaker, we carry more baggage picked up from a year of economic uncertainty, pandemic fatigue and the emotional roller-coaster of on-off restriction measures. The mental health divide has also widened, as pandemic measures have a greater impact on segments requiring more attention. Blue-collar workers and low-income individuals were the hardest hit by the circuit breaker. Incomes at the 20th percentile fell 4.5 per cent in June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, according to the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Force report. Last year’s circuit breaker also shone the spotlight on isolation’s ill effects - on victims of family violence trapped with abusers, migrant workers confined to dorms and foreign domestic workers with little space away from their employers. Would people also know how to find help? Less than one in three (29.7 per cent) of respondents to the #AreWeOkay knew how to seek out subsidised mental healthcare. Updates given by the COVID-19 Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) have rightly been focused on the number and breakdown of infections, the ensuing control measures and economic relief support for those affected. Yet let’s also hope that each MTF incorporates an update on mental health strategies included into our pandemic management approach and provide reminders on the mental health support resources available, as much as reminders to see the doctor if unwell or take a swab test if one has been to an area of infections have become commonplace. “What gets measured gets done” is a maxim that should apply to the rate of infections as much as rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental health issues from this pandemic, an urgent call also made by psychiatrists and psychologists in The Lancet. The Government had promised a whole-of-government review of all mental health policies in the Budget 2020 parliamentary debates, an inter-agency mental health task force has been set up last October and three new priorities were announced during the Budget this year. Yet more needs to be done urgently, including improving accessibility, affordability and quality of mental healthcare. Here is also where our national leaders could show compassion to acknowledge the dread and apprehension among those who have been quarantined or received a notification of possible exposure on their TraceTogether app. Leaders can also demonstrate sensitivity to people’s concerns and needs. Each day’s updates brings a sense of fear reflecting uncertainties around elderly relatives who live away by themselves, employment, healthcare and family care for many - even if others may just merely let out another collective sigh and move on. The trauma experienced from COVID-19 also gets repeated in varying degrees with every announcement of more clusters and each round of new restrictions. This persistent COVID-19 crisis is equally a mental health crisis. Not all of us get infected by the virus but all of us are affected by the mental health impact of the pandemic."
"More turn to mindfulness, mental wellness programmes to cope with stress from COVID-19", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-wellness-programmes-mindfulness-courses-covid-19-stress-13904826,Chew Hui Min,09 Jan 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: Minutes into a mindfulness workshop, a participant tears up as she tells the people gathered in the room that she hopes to get help as she feels she is “not doing well” in life.  She apologises for the mild outburst but moderator Associate Professor Angie Chew tells her it’s okay, and an assistant offers a hug.  Of the more than 30 participants at the workshop, a fair number shared that they have experienced sudden changes in their lives, either due to the COVID-19 pandemic or a family member falling ill. They were hoping to learn techniques to better manage their stress or anxiety at the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) workshop organised by non-profit organisation Brahm Centre, which started on Jan 5. MBSR workshops, created by Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979, helps people cope with stress, depression or anxiety. A secular practice, it is now offered in many settings around the world, including hospitals, schools and prisons. “I suppose (this is) because people have no idea where to go. So this is not just a physical getaway but it's a mental vacation,” said Assoc Prof Chew. “Because it's overthinking that causes burnout.” She told CNA that there have been more inquiries about the centre’s mindfulness courses since the “circuit breaker” period in April, and there is a waitlist for their classes and workshops.  The centre trained more than 23,000 people last year, a three-fold increase from 2019. A large number of these were from corporate workshops, and also from a mindfulness conference in August that saw 5,000 people sign up. Yoga and meditation studios told CNA that they have seen a similar situation - mindfulness classes, which tend to be in small groups, are oversubscribed. The Singing Bowl Gallery, which focuses on sound meditation, now holds daily classes due to restrictions on class sizes and increased demand. The number of people who attend its classes each month has increased from 15 before the pandemic to about 40 people. Ms War War Lwin Tun of Ohmsantih Yoga said that she used to get more requests to run physical yoga workshops, but last year, the number of meditation and mindfulness workshops for companies went up significantly. She now runs at least four such events a month. “I think companies also have that awareness now that my employees may be more stressed than before,” she said. Ms Dawn Sim, director at The Open Centre, which runs mindfulness and mental resilience programmes, said that more people have come forward to take their courses. In addition, the corporate workshops they run have switched from focussing on leadership to being about managing stress and anxiety. Health Can Be Fun, a health consultancy that helps organise wellness workshops, has also seen the number of mental wellness programmes they run increase about three times in 2020, from one or two a quarter to one a two a month. Companies from a range of industries have shown interest in training for stress management, mindfulness and resilience building, and workshops that teach breathing techniques and art-based therapy have proven to be popular, a company spokeswoman said. ""In Asia and Singapore, there has often been a stigma surrounding mental health and seeking help. However, COVID-19 has certainly changed the landscape. Since the start of COVID-19, many companies and individuals experience the impact of poor mental wellness and health,"" she said. The emergence of a new disease and the effects it has had on society and the economy may have something to do with this phenomenon. The fear and anxiety triggered by COVID-19 and its consequences can be overwhelming for some, said Ms Sara-Ann Lee, a senior clinical psychologist from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). “The pandemic has emphasised the importance of mental wellness given that many countries had to enforce policies that required physical distancing among individuals in order to control the spread of the virus.” She added that many reported feeling lonely, isolated and depressed due to “lockdown” measures in many countries.  In Singapore, the circuit breaker lasted for two months and many employees lost their jobs or had their pay cut, while some businesses struggled to survive despite substantial subsidies from the Government. Most people have had to adapt to safe distancing measures and new rhythms as schools and offices shifted to their homes. Travel restrictions which have stopped people from going overseas for leisure may also have led to the increase in demand for mental wellness programmes, as people have more time in Singapore, some studios said. In October, the Government set up a COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce to tackle the pandemic’s impact on mental health. Announcing the formation of the task force on Oct 10, which was World Mental Health Day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that with COVID-19, more people are facing stresses, pressures and disruptions to their lives and livelihoods. “Health authorities around the world must not only fight COVID-19, but also manage its impact on the mental health of their populations,"" he said then. The Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), along with other public service agencies, has also launched the mindline.sg website, which helps people assess their mental well-being and consolidates resources that they can tap to cope with stress. In mid-October, an AI penguin chatbot named Wysa was added to the site. As of Dec 28, more than 100,000 have used the site, MOHT said. Ms Wong Yin Li, who heads the youth division of Fei Yue Community Services, said that resources such as mindline can be useful because people can seek help anonymously and in their own time. “It is very good for clients who need to understand more and feel safer before they can do the next step of going for face-to-face services,” she said. Practitioners CNA spoke to also suggested that those who want to start practising mindfulness can have a taste of it by turning to mobile apps, before deciding if they want to commit to classes or workshops. Ms Sim said: “They can start anywhere, anytime ... there are lots of good apps around, and if they want more support, then they can sign up with one of the centres. It’s a way of life and they don’t have to wait until they finish that project, or when they resign.” IMH’s Ms Lee said that in the new year, an increased focus on mental wellbeing is likely to continue as people start to become more aware about these issues and take steps to look after their own mental wellbeing. “Stress is a normal part of our day to day lives, even more so that the fight against COVID-19 continues. We all need to be able to recognise and respond by developing healthy ways to cope with stress,” she said. Ms Lee recommends that people control the amount of information they read regarding the pandemic and trust only reputable sources of information. They should also try to maintain work-life balance despite working from home by setting appropriate boundaries and sticking to a regular work schedule if possible. “Take care of your body by ensuring adequate nutrition and sleep, coupled with exercise. Make time for self-care activities to relax and unwind,” she added. Assoc Prof Chew said there are times when it can be hard to manage one’s repetitive thoughts and worries, despite resolving to do so - which is when mindfulness techniques can be useful. Very often, it’s the inability to let go of what has happened that leads to suffering and negative emotions perpetuating, and having the right “foundational attitudes” can help, she said. “The foundational attitudes of mindfulness is to be curious so that you are less judgmental; to accept what you can't change in that moment in time … to be able to be grateful for what we already have instead of letting the mind focus on what is lacking,” she said."
Mental wellness curriculum launched at polytechnics and ITE colleges, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-curriculum-polytechnics-ite-schools-moe-14322204,Ang Hwee Min,03 Mar 2021 05:29PM,"SINGAPORE: Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges have launched a new mental wellness curriculum for all Year 1 students to raise awareness of mental health and encourage people to seek help early.  Making the announcement at the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate in Parliament, Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling said the institutes of higher learning are enhancing mental health support by strengthening programmes on mental wellness literacy and awareness.  The polytechnics and ITE worked with the Health Promotion Board to launch the new curriculum for all Year 1 students from 2020 and 2021 respectively, she added.  “The (autonomous universities) are also promoting mental wellness through briefings during freshmen orientation and university-wide programmes,” said Ms Sun.  A new centre for character and citizenship education (CCE) will be established in the National Institute of Education, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong in his speech on Wednesday.  “This centre will work with schools to strengthen CCE learning, conduct relevant research and provide thought leadership. Our goal is for every teacher to be a CCE teacher, and we will provide them full support to achieve this,” he added.  The centre for CCE will be launched by the end of 2022, Ms Sun said in her speech.  MOE will also launch a second Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence to allow teachers to train on site, “strengthening the nexus between research, theory and practice”, said Mr Wong.  The first centre is currently located at Yusof Ishak Secondary School, and the new one will be established at New Town Primary School from this year, he added.  Building on Mr Wong’s announcements, Ms Sun noted that the refreshed CCE curriculum has been implemented from this year, starting with secondary schools.  The new curriculum,  , has a stronger emphasis on mental health and cyber wellness education, she added.  “Students will learn about topics like differentiating signs of stress and distress, and healthy habits for positive well-being,” said Ms Sun.  “We recognise the nexus between increasing digital usage and mental health concerns, even more so amongst our young who may not know how to regulate their use of social media.”"
"Better mental health awareness among seniors, but more can be done, say experts", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-elderly-seniors-dementia-14271078,Jalelah Abu Baker,12 Mar 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: When Mr Ng Kok Sing’s mother started showing signs of poor memory and became bad-tempered six years ago, the eldest of four sons noticed the changes.  His mother, Madam Lee Lye Kuen, ran a hawker stall and could remember her customers’ orders, but she was misplacing things, and forgetting to brush her teeth.  She had a group of friends at the local community centre, but her bad temper drove them away, he told CNA in a phone interview.  Mr Ng’s daughter took Madam Lee to the doctor, and the elderly woman was diagnosed with dementia at Singapore General Hospital (SGH).  “I didn’t know much about dementia. After getting the report from SGH, I just could not understand. I was a bit shocked,” Mr Ng said. Mr Ng said his knowledge of dementia was initially minimal, but he made an effort to find out more so he would be equipped to take care of his mother. He did not understand why his mother had the condition as there was no history of it in his family, he said.  “After I found some articles and attended some talks, slowly I understood what dementia is. I had to face it,” he said. On the other hand, Madam Lee is aware of what dementia is from media articles and talks at the Fei Yue Retirees Centre where she goes, Mr Ng said. But she does not know that she has the condition.  A spokesperson for Fei Yue Community Services said that in recent years there has been more mental healthcare screening at polyclinics. “We do see more diagnosed with dementia,” she said, noting that seniors are more aware of dementia and depression because of communications though various media channels.  “Their family members, friends, peers and neighbours who may be diagnosed with similar mental health conditions have also made them more aware,” she said. She added that the elderly are also more open to finding about mental health issues by attending talks and workshops on mental health.   The COVID-19 pandemic has also “surfaced many mental health cases within the community”, she said. “There is now more prominence and light given to mental health wellness,” she said. “Together with some of the Government initiatives, the community has become more aware and embraces (the fact) that mental health issues and mental well-being are important to one’s health. The younger generations like the baby boomers help to detect early symptoms and signs amongst the elderly, to seek intervention and treatment.” The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), which provides emotional support to those in crisis or are thinking about suicide or affected by suicide, also said that awareness of mental health has “generally increased in the past few years”. The organisation has observed an increasing number of community initiatives to support the elderly and their caregivers as well as to increase awareness around mental health conditions, said its chief executive Gasper Tan. “Specifically, we have seen a greater understanding of dementia,” he said. SOS noted that agencies such as Lien Foundation, Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have been fronting educational campaigns. “(They) had played a vital role in equipping and training more with the necessary knowledge and skills to identify symptoms of dementia as well as how to support affected people in the community,” he said. Mental health among seniors came into the spotlight in Parliament last month, after MP Mohd Fahmi Aliman (PAP-Marine Parade) asked about the effectiveness of Government initiatives in reducing elderly suicide and the support mechanisms for old people who are socially isolated. Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said that there were 400 reported cases of suicide in 2019. Of these, 122 cases, or 30.5 per cent, involved persons 60 years and above.   “The causes of suicide are complex and multi-faceted, often involving family, social and mental health issues,” he said. “Therefore, the Government works closely with Ministry of Social and Family Development and community partners on multi-pronged approaches, comprising promoting mental health and well-being, raising awareness on suicide prevention, and providing professional support and crisis interventions to at-risk groups, including targeted support for older adults.” While awareness among seniors is improving, more can still be done so they and their families are more familiar with mental health issues, eldercare groups said. “In our counselling experience, a lot of times older people don’t feel comfortable sharing and talking about their mental health issues,” said Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation. Even when they do share openly, their families sometimes might not understand their challenges, she said. People may come to the wrong conclusions that seniors who are depressed or anxious “think too much or simply forgetful or careless” and that their mental state is a normal aspect of ageing, she said. “Mental health issues can be invisible and be misunderstood,” she said. She added that the behaviour of older people that can hint at a sense of anxiety or distress can be seen by others as being unreasonable or insecure.   “More can be done to promote awareness and understanding that these are not necessarily part of ageing but a mental health issue which we can all solve together,” she said. Fei Yue Community Services also said that there is still much work that can be done.  “The stigma and misconception, and lack of knowledge still exists. Many prefer to not talk about it or dismiss the idea if they should share with someone their emotional state of being,” a spokesperson said.  She added that family members and friends are “critical” to getting seniors to attend workshops or talks to get themselves more acquainted with managing their mental health.  Given that dementia and depression are common mental health issues among seniors, the AIC said that families should look out for signs of these conditions. A spokesperson said that signs of dementia include difficulty performing daily activities like cooking and dressing, changes in behaviour like becoming socially withdrawn and more easily upset, and issues with cognition such as difficulty remembering things and having problems with language and calculations. For depression, signs include thoughts of suicide, a change in sleeping patterns, and irritability and outbursts of anger, she said.  Mr Tan said that among those who called the 24-hour SOS hotline and disclosed their age, about 20 per cent of calls between April 2019 and March last year were from people aged 60 and above. While some call to reach out for a listening ear or vent their daily frustrations, “others may call SOS when they are in crisis, and in need of emotional support to cope with their negative thoughts and suicidal ideations”, said Mr Tan. “In such calls, our priority is to ensure the safety of the caller. In general, we strive to give clients a safe space where they can share their thoughts and feelings openly as we may be their only resource for support, he said. He said that suicide is an “inherently complex issue”, with no single cause. “It is often due to culmination of a variety of factors. When one experience feelings of hopelessness for a prolonged period of time, one may contemplate and even attempt suicide,” he said.  Loneliness, physical illness, loss of independence and loss of loved ones can contribute to seniors’ sense of despair, he said. “The process of growing old is inevitably accompanied with physical and social changes. It can be difficult to cope and adapt to these transitions, there may be fear and feelings of loss with their physical deterioration, and even concern that they are putting on burden to the people around them,” he said. He added that guilt is another emotion that they may encounter.  “When one is in such a situation, especially with a weak social support and no one to turn to, feelings of loneliness and alienation may be amplified,” he said.  SOS views education as key for suicide prevention, he said. “The community must take an proactive commitment to destigmatise suicide and create more open and constructive conversations on how we can empower the elderly, such that they can sustain meaning especially in their late age,” he said. “Furthermore, we believe that the onus should not lie only on the elderly, but the community at large to empathize and support these individuals.” AIC echoed the view that it is important for the community to continue to come together, be aware of the various mental health conditions as well as their signs and symptoms, in order to be supportive of those living with such challenges.  They suggested that families supporting elderly loved ones at-risk of, or living with, mental health conditions should be aware of signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and know who to turn to for information, treatment or support.  The families should also learn about the condition and what to expect of those living with it, treatment options and how to manage their medication, and take time out from caregiving to practise self-care.  “This is important for caregivers so as to manage their own mental wellness and prevent burnout,” a spokesperson for AIC said.  Fei Yue Community Services said that families can support their elderly by being more patient and showing empathy when they display symptoms.  “The family’s willingness to adjust their own living lifestyle to fit the elderly’s needs and not the other way round will help and goes a long way too,” its spokesperson said."
The Big Read: Enough is enough. Just what does it take to break mental health stigma at the workplace?, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-enough-is-enough-just-what-does-it-take-to-break-13659308,Justin Ong,30 Nov 2020 06:26AM,"SINGAPORE: For more than two years since she started working at a bank, Mavis (not her real name) has been keeping a secret from her bosses: She suffers from depression and anxiety. While her company has hired counsellors, Mavis has never used their services, and seeks external counselling instead.  She has kept her mental health condition under wraps due to the “toxic” work culture, said the 25-year-old associate, and she fears that her chances of a promotion will be stymied if her condition is out in the open. “Some have told me that (the company counsellors) will report back to the bank, though my boss said that this doesn’t happen - but you never know,” she said.  ""In my industry, you are expected to work very hard and expected to have endurance … Those  who can work a lot and handle a lot are seen as better."" A former trainee at a law firm, who wanted to be known only as Chloe, had a similar experience.  The 26-year-old, who began working at the firm early last year, developed anxiety attacks throughout her six-month traineeship. Things worsened to the point where she broke down during several lunch breaks, after feeling like she was manipulating her clients by withholding information.  “I felt like I had to lie to my client ... and I was under so much anxiety. During lunch, I would go down to cry, because I felt like I just couldn’t cope.”  Like Mavis, Chloe did not tell her bosses about her deteriorating mental health, but put on a poker face when she returned to the office after each breakdown. “I have friends in the legal practice, and the advice given to me was that I could not speak to anybody about (my emotional issues). The concern was really stigma, so I had to go for private counselling,” said Chloe, who is no longer with the firm but is furthering her studies.   This is what some employees here have to face. But what about the employers? What do they have to say? Those interviewed stressed that they are open to listening to their staff about whatever problems they may have, including mental health issues. However, they admit that a line has to be drawn, especially when it comes to business-critical roles.  If the employees continue to fall short of expectations or are unable to work for long periods of time due to their mental health conditions, the employers said they may have no choice but to refer the workers to other roles within the company or fire them.  Still, having to support staff who have reached their breaking point may not be the biggest challenge when it comes to mental health issues at the workplace in Singapore.  It is actually tackling the stigma surrounding mental illness and encouraging employees to speak up about their problems, based on interviews with workers, employers, human resource (HR) experts, general practitioners (GPs) and psychologists.  While calls to improve mental health awareness in the workplace are not new, the issue has taken on an added urgency this year with COVID-19 creating new stresses and pressures for everyone.  And with more people forced to work from home as the pandemic rages on, the boundaries between work and rest have been blurred, taking a further toll on the mental health of many employees.  But even before the coronavirus struck, the mental health situation here has been a growing concern: The Singapore Mental Health Study conducted between 2016 and 2018 found that one in seven people experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime, compared with one in eight people in 2010’s Mental Health Study. Just earlier this week, TODAY reported that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is investigating allegations made against a firm here where a former employee has   allegedly due to harsh working conditions. Against this backdrop, a   was issued last week by the MOM, Singapore National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress.  In introducing the advisory, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said “protecting workers’ mental health has become even more important” during the pandemic.  Among its guidelines are: While these guidelines are a step in the right direction, more can be done in ensuring that these initiatives are not treated as a paper exercise, and that cultural changes are enacted at the workplace, HR experts and mental wellness advocates said.  Ms Anthea Ong, founder of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, a community of leaders from various companies and national agencies which champion workplace mental well-being, said that the guidelines are “solid building blocks” but it will be up to the bosses to take the lead in eradicating stigma at the workplace. “If the leaders do not catch on and only leave it to the HR department to go and fulfil the requirements on the advisory, then I don’t think we have actually made a dent,” she said. “Until it is actually embraced, acknowledged and acted upon by the leaders ... only then do we start seeing these programmes, policies and practices making an impact on the ground,” said Ms Ong, a former Nominated Member of Parliament.  While larger firms may have more resources to implement the tripartite advisory guidelines, this is not always the case for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), many of which are feeling the crunch from the current economic slowdown.  Mr Adam Esoof Piperdy, chief executive officer and founder of events company Unearthed Productions, said that SMEs like his are in a “very precarious position” during the pandemic and it may not be practical for them to tick every box in the advisory.  “Such measures would (require) quite a high investment. I think what we would rather do is to have more informal practices of checking in with each other,” he added.  Even for larger firms with comprehensive mental health initiatives, the issue of employees not speaking up about their conditions remains a problem - one that has been exacerbated by remote working.  Ms Anuradha Purbey, people director at insurer Aviva Europe and Asia, said that a consequence of remote working is that managers are not able to meet their employees on a frequent basis. “Hence, it becomes harder to ‘visibly’ identify any mental health and other challenges that employees are facing,” she said.   “So, we have to rely, primarily, on the online catch-ups and frequent surveys.”  And like what Mavis and Chloe faced, Ms Anuradha acknowledged that the stigma surrounding mental illness is what prevents many firms from detecting mental health issues in the first place, since employees are reluctant to reach out for help.  “While mental health awareness has been gaining traction in Singapore, for many it is still considered taboo to acknowledge their struggles,” she said.  “At Aviva, we want to make talking about mental health as normal as talking about physical health and continue to do what we can do to remove this stigma."" While there are firms which are willing to cut some slack for employees with mental health issues, they also said that there is a limit to how much employers can do.  Mr Piperdy, for example, said that he will try his best to get any colleagues struggling with mental health to seek professional help or give them days off if they are unable to cope. However, since the event industry is a client-facing role, he cannot continually make concessions at the risk of letting his clients down. “At the end of the day, the job scope doesn’t change … if they’re not able to manage the workload that comes in, which is something we actively do, then I think we will help this person to transition to another job, maybe we will look for opportunities for this person. ""We have successfully redesignated some of them, to find suitable jobs in more fixed, permanent (roles) such as working in a venue instead of working for an events company,” Mr Piperdy added.  “But we are actively trying to avoid that by having early intervention, coaching and mentorships.” In recent years, some companies in Singapore have come up with a slew of measures to promote mental wellness at the workplace, many of which are in line with the tripartite advisory’s guidelines. For instance, national media network Mediacorp introduced earlier this month an emotional and mental well-being support initiative that consists of emotional and mental wellness training and a one-on-one confidential counselling service, among other things.  Mediacorp Chief Human Resources Officer Yvonne Ee said: “As part of our corporate wellness initiative, we continue to support our people with resources they need to adapt positively and perform well, during these unprecedented times.”  She added: “Through (the initiative), we look to create an environment where staff can build strong mental and emotional resilience, and feel secure as they continue to contribute to the organisation.”  Biopharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca Singapore said that among its mental wellness initiatives is an internal online platform for employees to discuss mental health issues and queries within chat groups. It also has in place the employee assistance programmes which provide confidential counselling.  President of AstraZeneca Singapore Vinod Narayanan said: “While we continue to build our open and inclusive culture at the workplace, we also recognise the impact COVID-19 has on mental well-being of our employees and will continue to build that space where it is safe for employees to speak openly about mental health issues.” In response to queries, business consultancy PwC Singapore said it provides several avenues to support mental health including an employee assistance programme, workshops, support groups and online resources to drive awareness of the subject.  Online marketplace Carousell said it has a dedicated wellness programme where employees “come together as a team to focus on our well-being”, at least once a month. It is also looking into establishing an employee assistance programme to offer support to employees struggling with personal and work-related problems.  While companies ramping up their mental wellness initiatives is a positive sign, HR experts said that this has to be coupled with bosses who lead by example in creating a more open company culture.  Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Economic Development Board managing director Chng Kai Fong had opened up about his mental health struggle during the pandemic at a technology conference on Nov 22.  Mr Chng - who was formerly the principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong -  said that family matters that occurred in April had affected his emotional and mental state, leading to feelings of “heat and anger” and depressive bouts. According to Bloomberg, Mr Chng said he wanted to openly share his experience with others who might be facing mounting pressure to lead during times of fear and uncertainty. “We can do a lot more as leaders to acknowledge that (it’s OK not to be OK) and to share a little bit more about ourselves,” Mr Chng said. “And that builds trust.”  Otis Asia Pacific president Stephane de Montlivault, who is a member of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, said that being more open about his struggles with mental health meant that employees of the elevator company were more willing to share their problems as well.  “I shared my personal situation as I happened to also have a number of difficulties (amid COVID-19). I lost a colleague and very close friend who died in a car accident … and shortly after that my father-in-law had a heart attack and was in the ICU,” he isaid. “I was facing a lot of stress, and had sleeping issues, anxieties."" When he shared these issues at a forum with his employees, many of them started opening up, and subsequently many were willing to go to their bosses directly with their problems, he said. “(We) made it very open and clear that it is not only okay, but normal and encouraged to talk about our difficulties and to work on them as a team,” said Mr de Montlivault.  “This actually caused us to take some actions in some cases when we found that people had difficulties when we were constrained by not being able to come to the office.” Agreeing, Ms Ong said that bosses who are willing to reveal their vulnerable side send a clear signal to employees that having mental health issues does not mean that they will not be able to succeed at work. “That’s a very big part of stigma in the workplace, (which) stems a lot from concerns with career progression and advancement,” she said. “When leaders are the ones sharing, then it says that it does not affect your promotion options, your career progress, and your potential.”  Veteran HR practitioner Carmen Wee said that the employer-employee relationship should be one that is centred on the well-being of the employee. “If employees are fearful in asking for help, there’s something wrong with the culture or leadership approach,” she said.  “If you work in a company where the company respects you, wants to look after their well-being, which employee will not flourish and perform? ”There would not be such a fear if employees “feel supported and don’t feel like their psychological safety is threatened”, she added.  Ms Wee noted that for cases where an employee’s mental health condition becomes too severe to continue working at a company, firing the employee should be a last resort.  Other alternatives such as no-pay leave, counselling and job coaching should first be considered.  “If at the end of the day, the person still can’t cope and the job is still contributing to the stress, there needs to be a heart-to-heart talk, and if everything cannot be worked out, they might have to part ways,” she said. Even when making such a decision, the company must also be sensitive given the pandemic situation, where it may be difficult to find employment. Employers can introduce the affected workers to new jobs that may be more suitable, or link them up with job courses.  “Each person’s circumstance is different, so the company needs to examine and come up with an individualised plan,” Ms Wee said. Although awareness of mental health here has grown, there remains a common misconception that physical health takes precedence over it, when both in fact should be viewed on par, said psychologists and GPs whom TODAY spoke to. Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist of The Therapy Room, said that whether it is a physical or mental illness, patients can be “struck down” by it for a prolonged period.  “When they have their diagnosis of anxiety and depression, they cannot go into the office, and someone else has to take over, so it is as bad as having surgery, or breaking your leg,” she said.   Agreeing, GPs said that they would give medical certificates (MCs) regardless of whether it is a physical or mental ailment.  Dr Sunil Kumar Joseph, a GP who runs Tayka Medical Family Clinic in Jurong, reiterated: “Mental illness is treated the same as physical illness from a medical point of view, so there is no issue.”  The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), physical and mental health are interconnected and cannot be viewed in isolation.  “Stress can take a toll on our physical health, while physical challenges can also bring new stress into our lives,” the APA said on its website. Regardless of the literature, Dr Sunil said the main obstacle is the stigma that prevents patients from visiting him in the first place. And one policy that propagates the stigma is company-paid insurance, he noted.  “Indirectly, (the company) is able to access all your medical history because you signed a waiver to your rights of confidentiality,” he said. “So very few people who are using corporate insurance are willing to disclose mental health conditions, so that’s one stumbling block.”  He added that a lot of insurers do not pay for mental health treatment.  One guideline in the tripartite advisory says that companies with flexible employee benefits, such as medical benefits, should consider extending the scope of coverage to include mental well-being programmes, mental health consultations and treatments. Companies such as Aviva Singapore, consultancy firm PwC Singapore and investment holding company Jardine Cycle & Carriage have health coverage plans that include mental health treatment.  Otis’ Mr de Montlivault said that as per the guidelines, his firm will be looking to include mental health as part of its health coverage as well. In the meantime, Otis employees can tap internal company self-funded insurance which has been expanded to include coverage for psychological support services. If employees are hesitant to get MCs for their mental ailments, some companies have a policy where a limited number of sick days can be taken without having to produce an MC.Some employers also provide medical leave based on trust, rather than having to always provide MCs. Mr Jeffery Tan, chief executive officer of charity organisation Jardines Mindset Singapore and group general counsel of Jardine Cycle & Carriage, said that if employees report that they have mental health issues without an MC, it will come down to “managerial discretion and empowerment by the supervisors”.  “Even for physical ailments, we don’t always need to be able to produce an MC before we can go off; we can see someone is struggling with an ailment, they can take an afternoon off,” said Mr Tan, who is also part of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup.  “This is coupled with an element of trust in a safe environment, as opposed to starting off by saying ‘if I have this, are people going to game the system and be less than truthful?’,” he added. “I think those are all the wrong dynamics.”  Agreeing, Ms Audrey Ng, global head of HR for mining firm Anglo-American Marketing, said that trust is “central to the relationship with our teams”.  “We know that the overwhelming majority of them are highly dedicated and committed to achieving great results for the entire organisation, so if we see that someone needs a break, we try to ensure that he or she feels empowered to take some time off with line manager approval,” said Ms Ng.  Still, some employees said taking medical leave as and when they need to is not feasible, as they are on project-based jobs.  A junior art director at an advertising firm, who wanted to be known only as Isabel, said that the number of projects she had to do during the circuit breaker period increased by about 40 per cent as more clients were looking to advertise online.  The longer working hours and higher workload resulted in the 24-year-old feeling stressed and anxious to the point where she would vomit regularly and lose her memory while at work.  She could not take a break as she had to meet the clients’ deadlines, and no one could take over her projects as they would not be familiar with the clients’ requests.  “In advertising, the mindset is always clients first, and that’s very detrimental on the employees,” she said.  Dr Douglas Kong, a mental health expert and performance coach, said that those who are stressed at work may not be able to identify the signs until it is too late.  “Those who are under stress, or have some issues in their life that they aren’t handling well … they can’t see it, and they do their best to cope and handle it,” he said.   He has seen several cases of employees who would not admit to their stress and anxiety, only for their mental health conditions to worsen and affect their productivity.  “So people think that mental illness is terrible, that you must not have it … But the point is that if you can deal with it earlier... it can allow the person to overcome it and get on with their lives and work,” said Dr Kong.  Mr Adrian Choo, founder of career strategy consulting firm Career Agility International, said that employees must know “when to back off” when caught in a stressful situation.  “Employees themselves need to know when they are being stretched and are hitting the limit… (They) need to ask themselves what is more important, your health or your career?” he said. “Because if you are burnt out, you are of no use to your company anyway.”  For Mavis, the bank employee who is hiding her mental health condition from her bosses, only a significant cultural shift in her company will prompt her to open up about her struggles to her superiors.  “If I see a culture where you’re talking openly about mental health, and it’s very clear that if I say something about it, not just my bosses but my colleagues will not think differently of me,” she said. “(Instead) it will be something that can actually help me, with people being more caring and it is not something that will be looked down on. ”She added: “But right now, it is a far cry from that.”"
"With Southeast Asia's highest suicide rate, Thailand grapples with mental health challenge amid pandemic", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/high-suicide-rate-region-thailand-grapples-mental-health-covid-14430142,Neo Chai Chin,18 Mar 2021 06:15AM,"BANGKOK: As the COVID-19 pandemic took its toll on millions of jobs in Thailand last year, Unyakarn Booprasert found herself penniless and with no friends or relatives who could help. The 59-year-old was splitting one packet of instant noodles between three meals. She was desperate for the 15,000 baht (S$655) promised by the government, to be paid over three months, under its No One Left Behind cash relief scheme. When she learnt she was among the 15 million applicants who did not qualify for aid, Unyakarn decided to plead her case to Thailand’s authorities last April. “When I got to the Ministry of Finance, sure enough, they didn’t listen,” said the cleaner. “From their actions, a poor person was similar to a pig or a dog, an animal with scabies.” Unyakarn tried to kill herself with rat poison in front of the ministry’s building. “I wanted to protest. It didn’t happen only to me. It happened to many people,” she told the programme  . I thought that the government wanted to get rid of the poor in the country. So I made their wish come true by getting rid of one person, one life. After her suicide attempt, the authorities looked into her case again and decided she qualified for the relief. Suicides in Thailand have gone up amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2,551 people killed themselves in the first half of last year, up 22 per cent from the same period in 2019. Health officials attributed the increase to pandemic-related stress. Groups particularly impacted by the pandemic’s fallout include tourism employees, sex workers and migrants. Foreign tourism, which makes up 12 per cent of Thailand’s gross domestic product, has collapsed as nations curb international travel to fight the spread of COVID-19. Sex workers, meanwhile, may not be registered in the social security system and have limited access to government support, said economist Thanaporn Sriyakul. Rural-to-urban migrants have also faced difficulty getting aid under the No One Left Behind scheme, as they may be classified in government records as farmers, who come under a different financial scheme. A similar spike in suicides occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when the numbers increased by about 20 to 25 per cent, said Varoth Chotpitayasunondh, spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Mental Health. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. But even before the coronavirus created economic hardship, Thailand had the highest suicide rate in Southeast Asia — which has seen mental health experts and advocates pushing for more resources to tackle the problem. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2019, Thailand’s annual suicide rate was 14.4 per 100,000 of the population, while the global age-standardised average is 10.5 per 100,000. Age-standardised means variations arising from countries’ different age structures have been removed. By comparison, the suicide rates in the other Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states on the WHO list varied from 3.2 (the Philippines) to 11.2 (Singapore) per 100,000 population. There is a suicide attempt every 10 minutes in Thailand. Deep-seated cultural and economic reasons contribute to Thailand’s relatively high suicide rate, according to the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ associate professor Antonio L Rappa, who has studied Thai culture, history and politics for over 20 years. Apart from economic factors, he said the Thai people’s “long history of being warriors” has imbued their psyche with the “idea of death”. The country’s protest culture means people may be willing to die “as a means to mark their cause”, while Theravada Buddhism, which is widely practised, teaches acceptance, he added. During the pandemic, suicide helplines such as the one operated by the Samaritans of Thailand were swamped. Stories surfaced on social media of hotline calls going unanswered. Varoth acknowledged that even after doubling the number of lines to 20 for the Department of Mental Health, it takes 10 to 12 minutes before someone can answer a call. “Some people don’t want to wait until that time. They want it to be within five minutes, and it’s still very difficult,” he said. “The drop rate of the hotline now is still around 40 to 45 per cent.” But he added that the government offers “very good” support for people with mental health issues — such as through universal health coverage that provides mental health treatment in public hospitals for around 30 baht. Suicide survivor and mental health advocate Amornthep “Sanju” Sachamuneewongse, however, flagged gaps such as a shortage of mental health workers, the long wait at government hospitals and the much higher cost of treatment in private hospitals. The 30-year-old developed hallucinations and other symptoms of depression and schizophrenia five years ago, and needed almost a year to be properly diagnosed. He initially underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan, which came out clear, and was taken by his parents to a spiritual doctor before he finally saw a psychiatrist. He had harboured suicidal thoughts, but multiple calls to suicide hotlines went unanswered. “If my call was unanswered, how many other calls were unanswered as well?” he wondered. Varoth acknowledged the need to increase mental health awareness and resources. In a bid to do so, Thai authorities are partnering non-profit groups, technology firms and even the entertainment industry. Amid movement curbs when COVID-19 first began spreading, officials initially planned to round up homeless people — a group that has a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicide risk — and house them in shelters. But social worker Adchara Saravari of the Issarachon Foundation, which helps the homeless in Bangkok, said: “We told them, ‘Let the homeless stay put. Don’t enforce the curfew on them. Let them sleep where they are. It’d be enough to reduce the spread.” This resulted in a collaboration between the people sector and the government to oversee homeless people within an area, she said. But barriers remain. The homeless may not carry identity cards, making it difficult to verify information and for them to qualify for treatment, noted Adchara. They should not be blamed, she added, and the government should “take charge” and “support them”. To reach out to members of the public, the Thai government has set up a special operations team called the Hope Task Force, which uses social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok and the Line app to communicate with sufferers. These platforms provide more channels of help and allow volunteers and mental health specialists to allocate resources more efficiently. For instance, they may chat with more than one person at a time online. The Department of Mental Health also developed the app, Mental Health Check Up. Users may answer a series of questions on their chosen topics, which include burnout, stress levels and depression. Sanju, too, created a mobile app after his experience with the manpower crunch in mental health care: Sati is a digital hotline for users with mental health issues to chat with people who have been trained to listen. To reach out to youths in particular, the authorities collaborated with Unicef and music platform Joox Thailand last year on a campaign called The Sound of Happiness, which featured podcasts, songs and celebrities talking about mental health. One of the songs, Nai Lao (Let’s Talk) by record label YUPP!’s hip-hop artists Autta, Blacksheep and Milli, became a favourite among young listeners. “When we were discussing (the track), we thought of the line, ‘Some people choose ‘lao’ (to drink) over ‘lao’ (to tell),” said music producer and YUPP! founder Sakkapit Makun, explaining the pun in the title. “The words have the same pronunciation but different meanings. It sounds simple. The lyrics are casual so that we can use it among friends. So it became the song Nai Lao.” Suicide and mental health should be “the problem of everyone”, said Varoth. “Right now, yes, we lack the resources to help with the mental health issue in Thailand because of COVID-19,” he noted. “But we can solve this problem by inviting many parties, talking to many people, doing collaborations between organisations who are interested in mental health and letting Thai people decide to come together, help each other.”"
The rise of mental health awareness – and the stigma that remains attached to certain conditions, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-stigma-conditions-depression-14903772,Grace Yeoh,05 Jun 2021 06:01AM,"SINGAPORE: It’s been five years since Sabrina Ooi, 30, attempted suicide - and two since she penned a blog post discussing her attempt.   The blog post, published on October 9, 2019 - one day before World Mental Health Day on October 10 - was the first time Sabrina publicly shared about that dark period in her life. Since that fateful day in 2016, suicide has been decriminalised in Singapore after the committee reviewing the Penal Code acknowledged that treatment, rather than prosecution, was the appropriate response to people who feel they have no choice but to take their own lives.  Sabrina has also co-founded a mental health community, Calm Collective Asia, with two friends during the “circuit breaker” period.  While she’s been called an advocate for mental health, she prefers the term: “Mental health expert by experience”.  “I think this advocacy thing just happened because I’m in my personal journey of processing what I’ve gone through and wanting to help others going through something similar,” she told CNA over the phone.   Occasionally, being open about her anxiety and depression has even led to strangers pouring out their stories to her on social media.  “Whenever I share, I go through a vulnerability hangover. It can be really tiring, but I know that sharing my story is helpful, both to others and for myself in getting clarity about my own story,” she said.  But Sabrina noted that this candour about anxiety and depression doesn’t always extend to another mental health condition she lives with: Bipolar disorder.  This condition causes extreme and unusual shifts in mood, energy, concentration, and activity levels that affect one’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.  “While I've been open with talking about anxiety and depression, I'm still very careful about the term ‘bipolar disorder’ because people tend to freak out and make their own assumptions about the condition,” she said.  “I've had friends completely wash their hands of me. They decided they didn’t really understand it and couldn’t support me in this part of my journey.” Like Sabrina, 30-year-old Syazwan Rahmad, who is also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is no stranger to a fear of judgement.  This partly stems from his own “shock” when he got the unexpected diagnosis recently, he explained, as he thought he only had depression.  “I don’t want people to think that I’m crazy. I’m scared they don’t want to be around me because I have a disorder. Till today, I have this thought in my head,” he told CNA.  Syazwan has since disclosed his condition to family, close friends and even to the public in a   that tracked the economic impact of COVID-19 on his dance career. But he admitted that he still struggles with criticism.  “About 20 per cent respond with negative comments about my career and me as a Muslim (when I talk about my mental health). But ultimately, I’m so open because I want people to know it’s okay not to be okay. Be true to who you are and that’s where healing will start,” he said.  The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a need for more mental health support, with an increase in people calling in to mental health helplines.  Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore saw an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019. Likewise, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) received an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020.  Yet, despite more people seeking help for their mental health over the past year, and the increasing awareness around conditions like anxiety or depression, other conditions remain difficult to disclose, said seven individuals who spoke to CNA.  Some of these conditions are bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia.  The traits of people with BPD include a feeling of emptiness, fear of abandonment, intense anger and irritability, unstable emotion, idealising and devaluing people, possible psychosis when stressed, and even binge eating, said Dr Roger Ho, an associate professor and senior consultant at the Department of Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore.  He added that there is also the possibility of physical self-harm among those with BPD, which is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD).  “Another symptom we pick up is they will cut themselves. In the emergency department, when you see someone with a lot of scars on their forearm, the patient might have BPD,” he said.  “But society doesn't know much about BPD; they think it’s just depression. The self-laceration is a very unique sign. When you ask someone with BPD why they cut themselves, they usually don't say they want to end their life. They want to experience the emotional pain they’ve had in the past.” Dr Ho, however, reinforced that while some people might possess the traits of BPD, having a personality disorder is more than just checking off these traits. “Having a personality disorder means that the traits become so strong that the person has interpersonal problems. These problems affect their life, whether it’s family, work or study,” he said.   Similarly, the stigma attached to schizophrenia - a psychotic disorder - prevails in Singapore.  According to a 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on May 21, about one-third of the population who have been diagnosed with psychotic disorders had a diagnosis of schizophrenia at some point in their lives. This makes schizophrenia the most common psychotic disorder here.  The results were part of the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among those living in Singapore aged 18 and above, their associated factors, and the treatment gap of the disorders.  Despite the prevalence of schizophrenia, public understanding is lacking, with people with the condition being perceived as “dangerous or as individuals incapable of managing themselves”, said Ms Lim Lay Keow, a senior case manager at the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme at the Department of Psychosis in IMH.  “Schizophrenia is still sensationalised by the media. The accessibility to smart phones allow for photo or video taking of a person in distress, subjecting them to be judged online.” This behaviour, Ms Lim noted, doesn’t just make it difficult for those with schizophrenia to disclose their condition for fear of discrimination. It also results in self-stigmatisation, where the person with schizophrenia finds it difficult to “differentiate themselves from the condition”.  The deeply entrenched stereotypes about schizophrenia also make it harder for the public to understand that schizophrenia is “not a personality flaw but a disease of the brain”, she added.  Even before the pandemic last year, younger people were increasingly open about their mental health on social media, with some talking about therapy sessions or situations where their mental health conditions might flare up. But Ron Yap, who was diagnosed with OCD three years ago, said this conversation doesn’t translate into less stigma for all conditions.  “While there has been more conversation for disorders like generalised anxiety disorder and depression, there’s still stigma surrounding more uncommon disorders, like OCD,” the 23-year-old said. “Even though non-sufferers (of anxiety disorders and depression) will never experience the depths of pain and discomfort those conditions cause, they can at least get a rough, if imperfect, idea of what it’s like to suffer, by taking the times in which they experienced anxiety or sadness and amplifying the intensity and duration.”  But with OCD, the 23-year-old said, “It’s harder to fathom how and why someone would wash their hands 50 times to the point of breaking their skin, go to the bathroom 20 times before bed or dwell on a distressing thought for a whole day to the point of paralysis.”  To a non-sufferer, he added, such behaviour is “simply irrational, and even insane, and this impression hinders one’s ability to empathise with the sufferer”.  Ron, who runs the Instagram account @mentalhealthceo, believes misconceptions about OCD don’t help, such as that there’s only one type of OCD “exemplified by someone who obsessively washes their hands or clothes over and over again”. “OCD and its rituals can manifest in countless different forms. I know someone who has to eat their food in a certain order, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to consume the meal at all,” he said.  Although a huge part of Ron’s life involves breaking the stigma around mental health, he still hesitates to disclose some of the “more personal symptoms” of OCD to people around him, such as going to the bathroom multiple times.  “I sometimes mask it by coming up with stories about why I usually spend so much time in the bathroom or through humour, especially when I don’t feel comfortable talking about my OCD in the moment or if I feel like they wouldn’t understand,” he said.  That said, openness about anxiety or depression doesn’t mean a lack of stigma around these conditions, experts observed.  “From what we’ve observed, some of the challenges faced by those living with mental illness include being labelled as ‘attention seeking’ when they talk about their mental illness, or that they’re ‘overreacting’,” said Ms Jasmine Chang, a clinical psychologist at IMH. “Even though there’s awareness around mental illnesses, admitting to having a mental illness is actually a different story.” She added that some of her clients fear that their diagnosis might affect their employment and appraisal, while those serving National Service worry about being negatively evaluated by their peers. With increased awareness about mental health, more nuance is now needed to take people's understanding to the next level, advised clinical psychologist Ms Chang.  For example, there is a difference between having a couple of bad days and having prolonged periods of bad days that debilitate you and prevent you from doing anything else. “All of us experience varying levels of sadness and anxiety. While we experience sadness and anxiety in our everyday life, depression and anxiety disorders lead to significant impairment and distress in someone’s life. It affects their ability to go to work, to sleep, and for a sustained period of time,” she said. Public education about the diagnosis would also help, she added. “This involves highlighting to people that mental illnesses can be managed with the right treatment and support, and those living with mental illnesses can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.”  Besides managing symptoms, Sabrina, who has depression in addition to bipolar disorder, believes it would be better to look deeper at what causes them.  “Usually the triggers stem from your childhood trauma, environmental triggers, and even biological factors. So it’s good that we start talking about anxiety and depression, but we need to take it a step further and understand the root cause,” she said.  And while media campaigns like Beyond the Label aim to change public perception around mental health conditions, some said labels actually help them make light of what they go through.  Sabrina, for example, doesn’t mind that some mental health conditions are more prominent than others, because it helps her “reshape her perspective” on what she’s going through.  “I’ve had people tell me they honestly don’t know what bipolar disorder is. And I realise I have to link it to depression or something more familiar to them for them to understand,” she said.  “So at least the increasing awareness of anxiety and depression has helped me talk about my condition.”   "
Commentary: Workers appreciate mental health days off after a crazy pandemic year, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/mental-health-challenges-work-from-home-employers-leave-15066440,Mayank Parekh,23 Jun 2021 06:02AM,"SINGAPORE: You may have read about   bowing out of the French Open saying she had to prioritise her mental health over her commercial obligations and professional advancement.  This was a point reiterated by President Halimah who in a Facebook post said people have to walk away from toxic environments despite the stigma. Because most adults spend the bulk of their time working, the workplace is naturally one environment facing fresh challenges in a new normal. In a 2020 survey by EngageRocket, one in six workers said they felt stressed. In particular, 30 per cent of employees working in the education sector and 22 per cent from consumer industries indicated their stress levels were unacceptable.  The 2021 survey results are expected at the end of June and it will come as no surprise if more employees feel this way. So what can employers do when they find themselves with requests from employees for time out? How can employers tell apart workers feeling isolated and exhausted trying to cope with work and family from those genuinely struggling with issues such as anxiety and depression?  They are two distinct conditions although both could manifest with similar symptoms such as the lack of energy or cynicism towards work and colleagues.  Being aware of these differences can help employers differentiate when adjustments at work may help and when medical interventions including treatment in the form of therapy or medication may be needed instead. There are useful resources to tap on so that managers can understand the difference. In Singapore, these range from self-help assessment tools such as iWorkHealth developed by the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Institute to online mental health platforms such as the My Mental Health microsite. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) also runs workshops to equip managers and human resource personnel with the knowledge to recognise staff facing difficulties at work and may need help and be supportive leaders at their workplace. But the reality for many organisations is employees shy away from speaking to their bosses about their personal struggles for fear of being seen as weak or even worse, stigmatised.  It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. So the problem is often not knowing there is a problem in the first place. The good news is that companies can adopt good management practices to uncover insights using data, recognise the sensitivities, set the right tone and nurture a culture of trust and openness on mental wellbeing. Almost every company utilises surveys to take the pulse on a number of issues – from corporate culture to change management and views on leadership. Done well, this sort of data provides critical real-time information on how employees feel about their work, their bosses or their prospects in the organisation.  The Harvard Business Review has good resources on how a well-designed survey can lead to quantifiable gains. Tech giant Facebook took things even further and worked with Wharton Professor Adam Grant to study what keeps employees engaged. Companies that use regular check-ins and surveys to take the pulse of how employees are coping have data to pinpoint where the pain points are instead of relying on “gut feel”. This is especially at a time when WFH is the default and bosses may not get to meet their staff as often as they would like to and cannot have conversations by the corridor that give them a sense of how they are coping. When done properly, data and insights on employees can drive effective decision-making for the organisation.  For example, HR can have an overview of its entire workforce’s mental well-being and identify opportunities to drive better engagement. Or they can use this data to target interventions on specific departments needing more support.  Your company’s HR policies can help promote a conducive environment that respects an individual’s privacy and accommodates those with mental health issues. While it is not always possible to remove the stigma, keeping mental health information strictly private and confidential and separate from an employee’s normal personnel file can help reassure and encourage more staff struggling to come forward for help.  Some companies have expanded leave policies to allow for mental health days without a medical certificate to encourage people to take time off when they need it and reduce stress and burnout.  LinkedIn gave its 15,900 full-time employees a paid week off in April to help them combat burnout and encourage them to unplug and recharge. Global companies including SAP, Cisco, Google and Thomson Reuters have instituted companywide “mental health days”.  Smaller companies with more limited resources can start by instituting more flexi-work arrangements. In 2020, more than 8,000 companies comprising 90,000 employees took advantage of government funding support to implement and sustain flexible work arrangements (FWAs) for all employees.  Flexible employee benefits can be expanded to include mental health consultations and treatments, as well as mental well-being programmes. Indeed, because working from home has blurred the boundaries, clarity on an after-hours policy is one of the recommendations of the Tripartite Advisory issued in November last year. Don’t leave it for another day - start relooking longstanding HR policies out of sync with the new realities of work. With more staff aware they can work effectively from anywhere, more employees will feel empowered to ask for flexible work arrangements.  This is especially if they have dependents and find it easier to balance work and family. This will also benefit those who are starting to feel the effects of isolation from going for long periods without interaction with their teams.  Companies that make accommodations to make flexible work as part of their life to get ahead of this curve will get the talent they need who will make an impact to their business.   Greater flexible work arrangements, the blurring of boundaries between work and home and managing burnout is bringing into sharper focus this greater burden on the manager to pick up.  So companies must level up managers, support them with these tools and get a handle on what’s going on. When a manager shows that supporting someone with mental health challenges does not mean he is any less valuable or will not be promoted or given increments goes a long way in getting employees to not just get help but to be committed to your organisation.  Other employees should also get mental health training to recognise “psychosocial hazards”, so they can identify a problem and extend help before it develops, and step in to cover for colleagues who need time off to protect their mental health.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to accommodating workers with mental illness. The key is to try out various approaches to see what works. Even small companies can start by surveys to gather feedback and benchmark their employee perceptions.  While there is plenty that employers can do to help prevent stress and burnout, the best vaccine for mental health is a strong foundation of personal relationships at work with managers and teams that builds trust and goodwill.

‘Mental health is everyone’s business’: How society can better protect seniors’ mental wellbeing, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-elderly-suicide-death-wellbeing-15187078,Cheryl Lin,09 Jul 2021 05:19PM,"SINGAPORE: Amid a rapidly ageing society, the entire community – down to the individual – has a role to play in caring for the mental wellbeing of seniors, said organisations serving the elderly. Efforts that must be undertaken include looking out for vulnerable seniors, strengthening partnerships between care providers and helping the elderly become more resilient, they said. The mental health of seniors is in the spotlight amid a report by suicide prevention organisation Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) that stated elderly suicides hit a nearly two-decade high in the country last year. Out of the 452 suicides reported in Singapore in 2020, 154 were among people aged 60 and above – the highest recorded figure since 1991. This also marked a 26 per cent increase from the year before, according to SOS. ""COVID-19 has severely affected the nation's economy, lifestyle and mental health. We are extremely worried about how our elderly are coping during this public health crisis,"" said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan when the data was released on Thursday. Apart from social isolation, the difficulty in constantly adapting to changes was also a key issue among this group. Moving forward, to better care for seniors’ wellbeing, every member of society has a role to play, said Ms Porsche Poh, the executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore). “Some will say it’s the Government’s responsibility, it’s the charity’s responsibility. But mental health is everyone’s business … Everyone has a role to play in promoting a caring society.” She noted that while social service agencies implement programmes to engage the elderly, grassroots organisations and individuals can also reach out to involve those in their circles. One can simply start by paying attention to the elderly in their families, she said. “We’ve really heard of elderly saying they’re very lonely … For the elderly with children, the kids could spend some time just by having a meal with them ... Educate them, speak to them (about mental health),” said Ms Poh. She added: “Show your concern and keep a look out for your neighbours too … Just say: ‘Hello, how are you? Are you okay?’” Ms Joyz Tan, a senior social worker at Fei Yue Community Services, echoed the importance of interactions within the community. ""We really hope that the elderly will find that the environment that they stay in is a pleasant one - (where there's a face that they're familiar with) that will say hello to them. “When we have such a vibrant community of people who can still make friends, I think that will really build up a sense of positivity in their lives.” At an organisational level, institutions serving the elderly – such as hospitals and social service agencies – should also partner up because a single agency cannot do everything, said Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation. “When we have discussions, we can talk about the observations we have, what kind of care plan we can come up with and who can do which part - the monitoring, the psychosocial intervention. “That is a very helpful strategy … It is so important that we share the same direction, understand the needs of the client and come up with a more holistic care plan together,” she said. From an operational perspective, the recent relaxation of COVID-19 safe management measures is also an essential move for protecting seniors’ wellbeing, said Ms Poh. This is because face-to-face meetings, which provide a human touch, are critical for seniors who feel isolated, she said. Ms Poh also noted that many prefer in-person meetings as they are not digitally savvy, hence making door-to-door visits all the more important. These must be kept up, she said, stressing that one must not assume all seniors can catch up with technology, even if there are growing efforts to help them go online. “We should know that the elderly can be quite stubborn. You can have all the courses to educate them, but (some are) not ready or do not believe in it.” Ms Wang stressed that this is unfamiliar territory for many seniors, who may lack the confidence to try new things. ""It's not so easy for the elderly to step out of their comfort zone ... (We can) be more patient, be more encouraging, help them to learn."" But it is also important to empower the elderly with more confidence and skills to cope with change, she said. So far, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 may have led to fear, anxiety and a sense of helplessness among seniors, and teaching them to examine these could make them more resilient, Ms Wang said. “What’s behind these emotions? I think a lot of times it's the yearning for safety and a sense of control. “So then, we need to help them see … How are we able to learn from these feelings? How are we able to provide some comfort and (soothe) ourselves? And how can they accept that this change could be the new normal? “That's the important part for them to really feel more confident and can take back control in a way,” said Ms Wang. “We do have the ability to make choices to adapt to changes. I think we need to help them to build their confidence,” she said. She also said that helping the elderly tap on these “internal resources” is just as important as giving them external resources."
"Commentary: From sick care to ‘well care’, here’s how to end the mental health stigma", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/from-sick-care-well-care-here-how-to-end-mental-health-stigma-11133166,Bernard J Tyson,20 Jan 2019 01:34PM,"OAKLAND: The world faces an epidemic of mental health problems that cuts across borders, economies, and cultures and carries a stigma that leaves people suffering in silence. Tackling the problem requires political, business, and civil society leaders to make mental health and wellness a global priority, starting with the Globalisation 4.0 discussions at this month’s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Davos is clearly an appropriate forum in which to raise the issue. According to a study by the World Health Organisation, depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy US$1 trillion every year in lost productivity. Yet the same study also suggested that every dollar invested in scaling up treatment for depression and anxiety – the two most common mental health conditions – can generate a return of US$4 in terms of improved well-being and increased ability to work. The WHO study is a welcome intervention. For too long, we have detached the mind from the body and regarded mental conditions as something separate from our overall health. As a result, millions of people needing mental health support have been ignored, with a dramatic impact on economic resources, productivity, and output. The reality, of course, is that mental and physical health are closely connected, with each contributing to overall wellbeing. We must recognise this if we want the world to be a happier and more prosperous place for future generations. To succeed, efforts to tackle major global problems such as mental health must be collaborative and sustainable. In this spirit, I urge leaders joining me in Davos to consider adopting four critical priorities to support mental health and wellness. First, we need to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in the workplace. No one should suffer in silence with a condition that can be treated and even prevented in some cases. By acknowledging mental health and wellness issues at work, we can make a difference in our homes, schools, and communities as well. Seeking mental health care should be as routine and unremarkable as seeking treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes, or a heart condition. Furthermore, we must reduce mental health inequity, a frequently ignored issue. This is often a problem in lower-income communities, where populations may be at greater risk of pathology and often face the highest obstacles to getting care, in part owing to a lack of the specialised resources available in wealthier areas. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. There are some innovative approaches to addressing this problem, such as Zimbabwe’s Friendship Bench, and I look forward to learning more about this project from one of its representatives in Davos. Third, our health systems must shift from “sick-care” to “well-care.” To move mental well-being into the mainstream of health care and pursue primary prevention as the most efficient approach, we must understand how to counteract and ameliorate the effects of adverse childhood experiences, which are highly correlated with poor mental and physical health later in life. The game-changer will be found not in hospitals or clinics, but in communities that nurture rather than traumatise the next generations. For companies such as ours, this means learning how best to deliver health, not just health care. Last, and most relevant for health-care leaders, we must redouble our efforts to connect mind and body. By better integrating mental health services into primary care systems, we can show that a mental health condition is no different from a respiratory, endocrine, or heart issue. And people needing treatment beyond what can be delivered in primary care should be able to see a specialist in the same way they would be referred to an orthopedist or cardiologist. A healthy mind is just as important to our overall health as strong bones and hearts are. For the past three years, I have sought to use the World Economic Forum to make mental health and wellness a global priority. This year, I am encouraged and gratified to see that mental health will be a larger part of the discussions in Davos. By bringing together global leaders from all sectors, we can make further progress toward ending the silent stigma surrounding mental health issues. We can devise innovative ways to improve mental health services, as well as people’s access to them. And we can help to ensure that mental health joins physical wellbeing as an essential component of Globalisation 4.0."
Commentary: Having a second child worsens parents' mental health, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/having-a-second-child-worsens-parent-s-mental-health-11069444,Leah Ruppanner,06 Jan 2019 03:17PM,"BRISBANE: Children are a wonderful gift, bringing joy, laughter, and love. But, then there are the toys, the sleepless nights, the constant barrage of “why?” questions and the plethora of sticky handprints. For many parents, the decision to have a second child is made with the expectation that two can’t be more work than one.  But our research on Australian parents shows this logic is flawed: Second children increase time pressure and deteriorate parents’ mental health. Our study used data from a national household survey, following roughly 20,000 Australians for up to 16 years. The goal was to see what happens to parents’ time pressure and mental health as first children are born, age and new siblings arrive. We weighed two main questions that many parents ask themselves when making the decision to have a second child: Do things get better as children grow older, sleep more and gradually become a bit more independent and robust? Or does a second child add to what may already be a highly stressed and time-poor household? The most ambitious discussions about having second children occur during a date night, in between the first and second bottle of wine – where the short and long-term impacts of children peer out from the distant future. These tensions between the short- and long-term impacts of children tap into what social scientists call the stress process model. In this perspective, major life events can increase stress either in the short-term, as an eventful experience, or as a chronic strain, with effects that linger over time. Health researchers show that chronic stress is the most detrimental to health and well-being, contributing to cardiovascular disease, obesity and other major diseases.  We are not arguing that children lead to heart disease – we have our diets to thank for that – but rather pose the question of whether the birth of first and second children has short or long-term effects on parents’ time pressure and, because of that, mental health. The birth of a first child introduces adults to a new role – that of parent – that comes with expectations about how to allocate time to work or family. Following childbirth, many mothers take a year of parental leave. Some return to work, but others do not. Most Australian fathers maintain full-time work after children are born, in part to make up for mothers’ employment reductions, but also because Australian parents become more traditional in their gender roles following childbirth. Mothers and fathers are more likely to believe that women should stay home to care for children once they become parents than when they were childless. As a result, the bulk of the childcare falls to mothers. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Second (and third) children do not introduce a new role into parents’ lives, but rather increase the demands of the parent role. In theory, parents of second children have developed parenting skills – including how to clean a bottle while rocking a baby, and to never buy expensive dry-clean-only clothes again.  These parenting skills may mean that second children bring less time pressure and stress than first children. Our results, however, do not support this claim. Prior to childbirth, mothers and fathers report similar levels of time pressure. Once the first child is born, time pressure increases for both parents.  Yet this effect is substantially larger for mothers than fathers. Second children double parents’ time pressure, further widening the gap between mothers and fathers. Although we hoped parents’ time pressure would diminish over time – as they gained more skills or kids entered school years, we found that time pressure lingered. We also thought that parents working full-time or those doing most of the housework would be the ones experiencing increased time pressure. Instead, we found that time pressure increased with first and second children for all parents, whether they were working or not. Thus, reducing work to part-time is not a solution to this time-pressure problem. Parents of third children fare no better, indicating that children are not economies of scale. To better understand the health implications of parents’ increased time pressure, we also looked at their mental health. We found that mothers’ mental health improve with first children immediately following birth and remains steady over the next few years. But, with the second child, mothers’ mental health sharply declines and remains low. The reason: Second children intensify mothers’ feelings of time pressure. We showed that if mothers did not have such intense time pressures following second children, their mental health would actually improve with motherhood.  Fathers get a mental health boost with their first child, but also see their mental health decline with the second child. But, unlike mothers, fathers’ mental health plateaus over time. Clearly, fathers aren’t facing the same chronic time pressure as mothers over the long-term. So, what does this mean for families and the institutional environment in which they are embedded?  First, mothers cannot shoulder the time demands of children alone. Even when they reduce their work time to accommodate children’s demands, their time pressures do not ease. This has important consequences for their mental health. Further, the effects of children on mothers’ time pressure is not short-lived, but rather is a chronic stress that slowly deteriorates their health. As such, maternal time pressure must become a top health priority for practitioners and policymakers. Second, mothers need institutions to share in the care. Collectivising childcare – for example, through school buses, lunch programs and flexible work policies that allow fathers’ involvement – may help improve maternal mental health.  Since poor post-partum mental health can lead to poor outcomes for children, it is in the national interest to reduce stressors so that mothers, children and families can thrive."
On a mission for mental health, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/advertorial/on-a-mission-for-mental-health-11422336,Brand Studio,18 Apr 2019 11:17AM,"At the age of 25, Dr Cecilia Kwok was one of the older students at Duke-NUS Medical School. While she initially found it hard to make the adjustment from working as a research assistant to becoming a full-time student, she was able to persevere because, as she says, “being a doctor has always been my dream”. Now 37, the associate consultant at Singapore General Hospital’s (SGH) psychiatry department studied at Raffles Junior College before heading to Davidson College in the United States in 2001. Two years later, she enrolled at Central Queensland University in Australia, graduating in 2005. Dr Kwok, a Singaporean, first worked as a lab technician, and then a research assistant, at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s Department of Paediatrics. “I conducted research in childhood leukemia, looking into ways of detecting very low levels of cancer cells in the blood and bone marrow,” she said. “While I was working as a research assistant, I was offered an opportunity to embark on a PhD in the research I was doing. However, I was determined to pursue my earlier goal of becoming a medical doctor and I rejected the offer and instead applied to Duke-NUS.” In 2007, after eagerly waiting for the school to open, she enrolled at Duke-NUS as part of its pioneer cohort of medical students. “I think being a mature student, in terms of experience if not in age, is an asset in medicine. It helped me understand patients better,” she reflected, adding that her most memorable experiences of medical school came from her team. Said Dr Kwok: “We studied together and argued with one another. While we learnt medicine, we also learnt to work together as a team.” Dr Kwok drew deep from her own experiences when it came to choosing her specialty, psychiatry. She explained: “I struggled with some problems in university that derailed the path I had envisioned for myself, and it made me realise how important mental health is. This explains my interest in adolescent and young adult psychiatry.” Dr Kwok conducts research at SGH on subjects such as eating disorders among young adults and the mental health of junior doctors. She also works with the SGH Burns Centre on psychiatric trauma in burn patients. Dr Kwok is heartened that her juniors at Duke-NUS are now championing mental health awareness through the “I’m STEADY Lah” project. In collaboration with other healthcare organisations, this community service project aims to promote public awareness and tackle social stigma of mental health issues among young adults in Singapore. As a visiting associate consultant at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital’s Department of Psychological Medicine, Dr Kwok coaches students in the course of her work, and hopes that her intervention can help them continue successfully on their chosen life paths. Whether she is treating patients or doing research, she believes that her education at Duke-NUS has taught her to focus on what is most important – people. “What I remember most about medical school are several inspiring and amazing tutors from various disciplines who taught me to see the person behind the patient,” she said. After graduating from Duke-NUS in 2011, Dr Kwok embarked on charity work in the region. She has been to Cambodia twice with Project Sa’Bai, a student-led medical overseas community involvement project. Last year, she went to Cox’s Bazar, a town on the south-east coast of Bangladesh, with the Singapore Red Cross. She is also involved in the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Center, which trains healthcare professionals in psychiatric interventions for landmine victims. Said Dr Kwok: “My charity work started as a way to expose myself to different environments while helping those in need. However, in the process, I found myself – who I am, what my values are. I gained much more than I gave.” For those who are interested in taking up medicine, Dr Kwok said it is important to be sure of what you want. “It is an arduous journey, both physically and mentally,” she said. “If it is your dream, do apply. Duke-NUS gave me my dream.”"
Commentary: What postnatal depression really feels like, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/what-postnatal-pregnancy-mental-health-depression-feels-like-11407134,Rachel Leonard,05 Apr 2019 06:46AM,"BELFAST: Motherhood can be a source of joy, but it can also pose difficulties and challenges – particularly, in the postnatal period. It is a time when some mothers’ emotional and physical endurance is pushed to the limit. About 10 per cent of pregnant women and 13 per cent of women who have just given birth experience a mental illness, primarily depression and anxiety. In developing countries 20 per cent of mothers experience clinical depression after childbirth. Mothers who have mental health problems after giving birth, face the dual challenges of managing motherhood alongside their health issue.  This balancing act can cause an internal conflict – but fears of being judged and shame around what they are experiencing can act as a barrier, which stops many women from seeking help. There is an expectation that having a baby will result in the rosy glow of motherhood. But postnatal depression can leave many women with a persistent feeling of deep sadness, and a loss of interest in life.  This may reduce their ability to care for their baby, or may leave them with thoughts of self-harm or even suicide. We conducted interviews with mothers with mental health problems during the postnatal period. These were gathered as part of a larger study, which explored the family focused practice of health visitors who work with these women. We found that while mothers wanted support, there were barriers to accepting it. The mothers we spoke to felt fear, shame and guilt about being a mother with poor mental health. These feelings led to the mothers covering up their deteriorating mental health, from family, friends and professionals. And with an expectation of happiness, the reality of parenthood mixed with suffering from postnatal depression can be a hard one to accept – as one of the mothers we spoke to explained: I didn’t feel a connection to the baby, and that was stressing me out even more. I was thinking I need to feel something here; I need to feel like fireworks going off here. (Mother of one, age 37) With this internal conflict, mothers describe feelings of guilt and shame about their mental health problems, coupled with a belief that they were not deserving of motherhood: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. I truly at times looked at these two kids and thought, you deserve better than me who is sitting here and can’t get dressed for days. What sort of life am I giving you? (Mother of two, age 34) The mothers in our study also spoke about fearing the judgment of society, believing that society equates mental health problems with bad parenting: I was getting more and more anxious. They’re looking at me, they’re thinking I’m a terrible mother, I am a terrible mother. (Mother of three, age 38) One of the mother spoke about the fears that her children would be taken away from her if she told people how she was really feeling – believing that people would view her as “not being a fit mummy”. Many of the mothers we spoke to talked about going to great lengths to hide their struggles with their mental health – from both their family, friends and the outside world: You have that mask that you put on for society. And then you have days where you just don’t want to wear that mask so you just stay in the house. (Mother of two, age 32) The mothers also felt they are judged more harshly than fathers, due to widely held assumptions that women have instinctual love for their children. To some extent, western society has moved beyond traditional gender roles, yet mothers still predominately take on the bulk of care giving responsibilities for children. And as our research shows mothers feel stigmatised and fear judgment – which can result in them covering up their deteriorating mental health. Our research also highlights how a lack of openness around mental health problems, can mean these women will not be identified and cannot receive appropriate support. Without support there is a risk that their mental health will deteriorate further, potentially resulting in negative outcomes for all the family. Services need to develop a deeper understanding of the impact of poor mental health on mothers and provide opportunities for mums to openly discuss parenting and mental health, in a judgment free environment. Assumptions and expectations of motherhood, also need to be re-examined, and discussed more openly with the general public, as the rosy glow of motherhood does not reflect the universal experience of all mothers."
"Commentary: 'Smiling depression', depressed while appearing happy, a dangerous combination", https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/smiling-depression-appearing-happy-dangerous-mental-health-11275972,Olivia Remes,25 Feb 2019 06:28AM,"CAMBRIDGE: The term “smiling depression” – appearing happy to others while internally suffering depressive symptoms – has become increasingly popular.  Articles on the topic have crept up in the popular literature, and the number of Google searches for the condition has increased dramatically this year. Some may question, however, whether this is actually a real, pathological condition. While smiling depression is not a technical term that psychologists use, it is certainly possible to be depressed and manage to successfully mask the symptoms. The closest technical term for this condition is “atypical depression”.  In fact, a significant proportion of people who experience a low mood and a loss of pleasure in activities manage to hide their condition in this way. And these people might be particularly vulnerable to suicide. It can be very hard to spot people suffering from smiling depression. They may seem like they don’t have a reason to be sad – they have a job, an apartment and maybe even children or a partner. They smile when you greet them and can carry pleasant conversations.  In short, they put on a mask to the outside world while leading seemingly normal and active lives. Inside, however, they feel hopeless and down, sometimes even having thoughts about ending it all. The strength that they have to go on with their daily lives can make them especially vulnerable to carrying out suicide plans. This is in contrast to other forms of depression, in which people might have suicide ideation but not enough energy to act on their intentions. Although people with smiling depression put on a “happy face” to the outside world, they can experience a genuine lift in their mood as a result of positive occurrences in their lives. For example, getting a text message from someone they’ve been craving to hear from or being praised at work can make them feel better for a few moments before going back to feeling low. Other symptoms of this condition include overeating, feeling a sense of heaviness in the arms and legs and being easily hurt by criticism or rejection.  People with smiling depression are also more likely to feel depressed in the evening and feel the need to sleep longer than usual. With other forms of depression, however, your mood might be worse in the morning and you might feel the need for less sleep than you’re normally used to. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Smiling depression seems to be more common in people with certain temperaments. In particular, it is linked to being more prone to anticipate failure, having a hard time getting over embarrassing or humiliating situations and tending to ruminate or excessively think about negative situations that have taken place. It is difficult to determine exactly what causes smiling depression, but low mood can stem from a number of things, such as work problems, relationship breakdown and feeling as if your life doesn’t have purpose and meaning. It is very common. About one in ten people are depressed, and between 15 and 40 per cent of these people suffer from the atypical form that resembles smiling depression. Such depression often starts early in life and can last a long time. If you suffer from smiling depression, it is particularly important to get help. Sadly, though, people suffering from this condition usually don’t, because they might not think that they have a problem in the first place – this is particularly the case if they appear to be carrying on with their tasks and daily routines as before.  They may also feel guilty and rationalise that they don’t have anything to be sad about. So they don’t tell anybody about their problems and end up feeling ashamed of their feelings. So how can you break this cycle? A starting point is knowing that this condition actually exists and that it’s serious.  Only when we stop rationalising away our problems because we think they’re not serious enough can we start making an actual difference. For some, this insight may be enough to turn things around, because it puts them on a path to seeking help and breaking free from the shackles of depression that have been holding them back. Meditation and physical activity have also been shown to have tremendous mental health benefits. In fact, a study done by Rutgers University in the US showed that people who had done meditation and physical activity twice a week experienced a drop of almost 40 per cent in their depression levels only eight weeks into the study. Cognitive behavioural therapy, learning to change your thinking patterns and behaviour, is another option for those affected by this condition. And finding meaning in life is of utmost importance. The Austrian neurologist Viktor Frankl wrote that the cornerstone of good mental health is having purpose in life. He said that we shouldn’t aim to be in a “tensionless state”, free of responsibility and challenges, but rather we should be striving for something in life.  We can find purpose by taking the attention away from ourselves and placing it onto something else. So find a worthwhile goal and try to make regular progress on it, even if it’s for a small amount each day, because this can really have a positive impact. We can also find purpose by caring for someone else. When we take the spotlight off of us and start to think about someone else’s needs and wants, we begin to feel that our lives matter. This can be achieved by volunteering, or taking care of a family member or even an animal. Feeling that our lives matter is ultimately what gives us purpose and meaning – and this can make a significant difference for our mental health and well-being."
