"452 suicides reported in Singapore in 2020 amid Covid-19, highest since 2012",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/452-suicides-reported-in-singapore-in-2020-amid-covid-19-highest-since-2012,"SINGAPORE - A total of 452 suicides were reported in Singapore last year, the highest figure since 2012.
In a statement on Thursday (July 8), non-profit suicide prevention centre Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) said this was a 13 per cent increase from 2019's 400 cases.
It added that the increase in suicide deaths was observed across all age groups. In particular, the number of suicide deaths among the elderly - aged 60 and above - hit 154, the highest recorded figure among this age group since 1991 and a 26 per cent increase from 2019.
SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said: ""Covid-19 has severely affected the nation's economy, lifestyle and mental health. We are extremely worried about how our elderly are coping during this public health crisis.
""During the pandemic period, the elderly were more likely to face social isolation and financial worries. Difficulty in constantly adapting to changes as well as prolonged feelings of loneliness may be devastating.""
While there was an increase in suicide deaths among the elderly in 2020 compared with 2019, SOS said its 24-hour hotline received fewer calls from them.
In its 2020 financial year from April 2020 to March 2021, 4,455 calls were made by the elderly, compared with 4,816 in the 2019 financial year.
SOS added that elderly callers expressed difficulty coping with loneliness and inactivity due to isolation, psychological distress, and impaired social and family relationships - which were compounded by the pandemic.
The Institute of Mental Health's clinical director in the Office of Population Health, Adjunct Associate Professor Lee Cheng, said that the elderly who are living alone may lack support to deal with the pandemic.
""Those who are used to attending social activities outside on a regular basis will also likely feel socially isolated during this period,"" he added.
Said SOS' Mr Tan: ""Since the pandemic, many in-person activities and initiatives for the elderly have moved digitally. Those with limited proficiency with technology may find themselves lost and helpless.
He added that given the uncertainty of how long more the pandemic will last, it is important to build on existing efforts and find new ways to support the mental health of the elderly.

Singapore University of Social Sciences' Associate Professor Helen Ko said it was important to find as many ways as possible to connect with the elderly who are lonely and socially isolated.
""Very often, most elderly persons want to hear a human voice and they long to hear the familiar voice of a loved one,"" she said.
""For those who are not digitally savvy, please be very patient as they may need more time to pick up digital skills.""
From July 26, those who need emotional support may call SOS at its new four-digit hotline at 1-767. SOS said the shortened hotline will help make seeking help more convenient.
The old hotline number, 1800-221-4444, will remain operational even after the four-digit hotline is launched, and both numbers will be toll-free.

Malaysia sees rise in suicides and calls to helplines amid Covid-19 pandemic,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-sees-rise-in-suicides-and-calls-to-helplines-amid-covid-19-pandemic,"KUALA LUMPUR - Having been diagnosed with depression since she was a teenager, online retailer Nina Razif, 35, had learnt to cope with it over the years - or so she thought.
Being under Malaysia's first two lockdowns after the pandemic started last year did not affect her mental health, but by the time the third one was imposed last month, Madam Nina's feelings of stress and depression began to overwhelm her.
""I started feeling really depressed and helpless when I saw more and more people, including some I know, suffering. And I can't do much about it,"" she told The Straits Times.
During the lockdown, a friend attempted to take his life but she managed to reach him in time.
""This shook me to the core because years ago, I lost a close friend to suicide and it also brought me back to the time when I tried to take my own life,"" she said.
""I'm burnt out, and it's almost impossible to juggle parenting, work, school and taking care of my differently-abled child. And for the first time in my life, I'm tired of staying at home. I've been a good citizen but why are cases still increasing?""
Madam Nina is not alone.
The police recorded 468 suicides in the first five months of 2021, compared to 631 in 2020, and 609 in 2019. The three main causes cited were family problems, emotional pressure and finances.
Emotional support help centre Befrienders Kuala Lumpur recorded 20,575 calls from January to June this year, compared to 32,710 for the whole of last year, its publicity director Ardy Ayadali told ST.
When the first lockdown began in March last year, lasting until June, some 9,754 calls were received. This year, a total of 14,136 calls were made to the Befrienders during the same period, marking a 45 per cent surge.
The centre said the main problems the callers faced were issues relating to mental health, relationships and family.
It has also seen an increase in calls related to financial and job-related issues over the past two months.
Malaysia has recorded nearly 800,000 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, with some 7,000 daily new cases over the last few days.
The country is under a nationwide lockdown until the number of daily cases dips below 4,000.
While six states have had some restrictions eased this week, much of Klang Valley has been placed under the strictest form of lockdown due to a persistently high number of infections.
Dr Ng Yin Ping, a consultant psychiatrist from Pantai Hospital, Penang, said that she is seeing more patients with symptoms of increased stress, such as insomnia, anxiety, irritability and low mood, which may affect their daily functioning.

""Contributing factors include work stress or academic stress. Many are required to work from home so some may have difficulties focusing at home due to an unsuitable or noisy home environment.""
Economic uncertainty, loneliness, fear of visiting health facilities due to the risk of infection, and the loss of one's usual coping mechanisms such as socialising, group sports and travelling also contribute to mental health problems, said Dr Ng.
The government needs to incorporate suicide prevention in its lockdown plans, the Consumers' Association of Penang (CAP) said.
""Never have Malaysians witnessed the despair of so many jobless, hungry and homeless people, having to depend on soup kitchens for their meals,"" CAP president Mohideen Abdul Kader was quoted as saying by The New Straits Times on July 1.
""Such a situation causes despair and hopelessness, besides the feeling of loneliness during the pandemic.""
Government aid was insufficient as some may have already depleted their life savings and were jobless, he said.

While the number of people with mental health issues is rising, Malaysia is also grappling with a shortage of psychiatrists.
Health Minister Adham Baba on Tuesday (July 6) revealed that Malaysia's psychiatrist-to-patient ratio was only a tenth of the one per 10,000 recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
There are a total of 400 psychiatrists in Malaysia, when there should be 3,100.
Dr Ng's advice for those who find it difficult to cope during the pandemic is to reach out to family and friends, or to call helplines or see mental health professionals for help.
""Stay connected with people, via video or phone calls. Remember to eat balanced meals, exercise and have adequate rest and sleep. Exercise caution when it comes to receiving or sharing information on social media as some news may be triggering or even harmful to your mental health.
""Finally, be kind to yourself. It's okay to not be okay, and to seek help from mental health professionals,"" she said.

Singapore residents exercising more and eating healthier now compared with last year: Poll,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-residents-feel-healthier-than-last-year-but-mental-health-has-taken-a-hit,"SINGAPORE - People here are exercising more and eating healthier now compared with last year, with about three in four saying physical health is ""very much"" a priority.
But nearly 25 per cent said their mental health has suffered, with money woes being the top reason for anxiety and depression, a recent poll has found.
An online survey of 1,000 Singapore residents aged between 18 and 70 found that 44 per cent felt physically healthier now than before the Covid-19 outbreak.
Sixty-six per cent of respondents reported higher motivation to adopt healthy lifestyles, said communications firm Wunderman Thompson in a report on Monday (July 5).
However, work commitments can get in the way.
Despite their motivation level, 61 per cent reported living more sedentary lives.
The poll found that 46 per cent of respondents reported longer working hours, and 73 per cent said they spend more time in front of their screens.
After money, stress about work and the impact from Covid-19 were the factors that affected mental health most, respondents said.
""Most worryingly, 39 per cent say they have considered suicide at some point, with 5 per cent saying they think of it every day and 8 per cent once or twice a week. Unemployed people were most likely to consider suicide every day or once or twice a week,"" the report said.
At a virtual press conference last Friday (July 2), Ms Malati Afridi, co-author of the study, said 48 per cent of people under 35 had considered suicide at least once in the past year, while the rate was 50 per cent for those with children under the age of six.
The study examined Covid-19's impacts on physical and mental health, as well as relationships and health inequities.
Although nearly a quarter of respondents reported suffering from anxiety and depression in the past year, 68 per cent believe there is a stigma against mental health issues in Singapore.
More than 65 per cent would avoid the topic with their family, even when there is an issue.
Dr Shawn Ee, director of The Psychology Practice, said this decline in mental health was not surprising.
He added: ""Covid-19 is an abnormal event that interrupts our way of life. Any major lifestyle change that removes a coping strategy for stress, can tip someone over into feeling trapped. For example, avid gym goers would struggle when gyms are closed.""
Covid-19's impacts have also carried over to family relationships, with 49 per cent of respondents agreeing that family stress has increased over the past year.

Inequities have also become more pronounced, across markers of gender, education levels, employment status and income.
Women reported feeling less healthy than men, both physically and mentally. The study cited a possible reason as women being more likely to juggle paid work with childcare or eldercare.
Individuals in the highest income bracket (earning $75,000 and above a year) and education level (having post-graduate qualifications) also reported more satisfaction with both physical and mental health.
Mr Gasper Tan, chief executive of Samaritans of Singapore, a suicide prevention centre, said one common anxiety cited by callers to their mental health helpline was uncertainty of the future due to financial insecurity and unemployment.
To cope with such struggles, Mr Tan advised: ""It could be helpful to talk to someone by letting trusted family or friends know what they are going through.
""Having a listening ear can provide relief and assurance that they do not have to go through this difficult period alone.""

"Tennis: Osaka says preparing for Olympics, will do news conferences",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/tennis-osaka-says-preparing-for-olympics-will-do-news-conferences,"TOKYO (AFP) - Tennis star Naomi Osaka said on Monday (July 5) she wants to be on top form at the Olympics and will take part in press conferences, after pulling out of several tournaments citing her struggles with depression and anxiety.
The world No. 2 told Japan's national broadcaster NHK she was getting ready to play on home turf at the pandemic-postponed Tokyo Games, after having withdrawn from Wimbledon and the French Open.
""I am preparing myself little by little so I can be at the top of my game for the Olympics,"" the 23-year-old wrote in a message published by the broadcaster.
""Since getting the attention of the world, I've always had bouts of anxiety. This is especially the case in the lead up to big competitions.""
She set off a debate about mental health in June after abandoning her French Open campaign just one match in over a dispute on media duties.
The Japanese player had said post-match news conferences were detrimental to her mental health and likened them to ""kicking people when they're down"".
She later revealed her battle with depression and anxiety in a post on social media, saying she wanted to take time away from the game to get better.
In the message published by NHK, Osaka said she was ""proud"" to play for her country at the Games, adding that she would take part in news conferences while giving consideration to her mental health.
She was fined US$15,000 (S$20,000) and threatened with disqualification from Roland Garros after refusing to honour mandatory media commitments.
French Open organisers protested that they had treated her with ""care and respect"" after they were accused of being heavy-handed.
Osaka's agent said last month that she had withdrawn from Wimbledon to spend time with friends and family.
But he added that she was ""excited to play in front of her home fans"" at Tokyo 2020, which begins on July 23.

"Job worries, poor mental health afflict Covid-19-hit British youth",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/job-worries-poor-mental-health-afflict-pandemic-hit-uk-youth,"LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - Young people in Britain are emerging from the coronavirus crisis blighted by poor mental health and worried about their financial future, reports published on Monday (July 5) warned.
The separate analyses, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Resolution Foundation, underscore the huge challenges facing millions in their late teens and early 20s as the country returns to normality after more than a year of lockdowns to fight the pandemic.
Those restrictions hit the young harder than other age groups. With government support programmes coming to an end, they are now in danger of permanent damage to their prospects unless policymakers make helping them back to work a top priority, the research groups said.
""Without effective support, there is a risk that young people today will bear the scars of the recession for years to come,"" said IFS senior research economist Xiaowei Xu.
The IFS study found that 19 to 24-year olds were particularly vulnerable to the winding down of furlough wage subsidies, which have saved the vast majority of jobs affected during the pandemic.
Young people, many of whom were forced to move back into the family home, report being more pessimistic about their immediate financial future than other age groups.
The Resolution Foundation said that one in four people aged 18 to 24 are afraid that poor mental health will affect their ability to find a job in future.
Of those placed on furlough, reduced pay or made unemployed, almost 30 per cent say they are experiencing adverse mental effects, according to its survey, which uses new YouGov data.
""Where someone is struggling with their mental health, making the essential first step into the job market can prove impossible, especially in a job market as challenging as the one facing young people,"" said Health Foundation's policy and engagement manager Martina Kane. The Health Foundation supported the survey.

Voices of Youth: Make the classroom a more inclusive space for neurodivergent students,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/voices-of-youth-make-the-classroom-a-more-inclusive-space-for-neurodivergent-students,"Nowadays, Singaporeans are fortunate enough to have a greater awareness of neurodivergent individuals, people whose brains essentially function differently from neurotypical individuals.
This awareness has also led to a better understanding of those with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder and dyslexia.
Despite this progress, Singapore can do better to accommodate neurodivergent students in classroom environments, to ensure that their learning is as fruitful and comfortable as that of everyone else.
For instance, allowing students short breaks in between lessons may help students with ADHD, who may struggle to pay attention for long periods of time. Also, as many neurodivergent students may suffer from sensory overload, allowing students to step out of the classroom whenever they need to can benefit their overall learning experience.
The people around them can also make the classroom a more inclusive space through their daily actions.
As a neurodivergent individual myself, I know that we may sometimes behave differently from neurotypical people.
But we go to school for the same reasons as everyone else - to learn and make friends.
Instead of judging us, students can learn to be patient and more accepting by talking to us and learning more about our conditions.
Through clear communication, students will be able to understand their neurodivergent peers better and can better accommodate their needs.
Ultimately, the classroom should be a safe space for all students. Through fostering an understanding environment, all students can understand one another better and not only get along, but also thrive together.

"askST: When stress takes a toll, who can youth call?",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/askst-when-stress-takes-a-toll-who-can-youth-call,"For many young Singaporeans, it has been a year of anxiety and uncertainty.
In the first of this three-part series exploring opportunities to emerge stronger as Singapore together, we answer questions about youth mental health and the SG Together Alliance for Action that aims to help them build emotional resilience.
Q: What are some key challenges facing youth today? How have these changed from issues that they might have faced in the past?
A: The young in Singapore are concerned about a wide range of issues, including employment, sustainability and support for mental well-being.
With that in mind, the Youth Mental Well-being Network Alliance for Action (AfA) has shortlisted 24 projects that focus on enhancing the emotional resilience of youth and strengthening their support system. The AfA aims to empower young Singaporeans to manage their mental struggles and garner support from their peers.
Q: Do I need to have experience in the mental health sector to join the Youth Mental Well-being Network?
A: No prior experience is required. The AfA welcomes all who are passionate about supporting our youth’s mental health.
Since the Network was set up in February last year, more than 1,500 youths, parents, caregivers, educators, mental health professionals and practitioners have stepped forward to take part in efforts to enhance youth mental well-being.
Q: While the aim of the Youth Mental Well-being Network is good, how can we trust that the methods behind the programmes and initiatives are reliable?
A: The Youth Mental Well-being Network develops initiatives and programmes through consultation with agencies and experienced professionals in mental health. It is also supported by three government agencies — the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education (MOE).
For parents looking for support on youth mental well-being
The MOE Parent Kit and MOE Parents’ Instagram account offer tips on how to provide social and emotional support to your children.
MOE also organises regular ""Ask Me Anything About"" Facebook Live sessions that help address parents’ concerns on supporting their children’s mental well-being. You can reach out to your children’s schools for guidance and support in this area if needed.
For tips on building healthy relationships with your child
MSF’s Positive Parenting Programme teaches you to communicate with your child and techniques to manage their behaviour.
The Health Promotion Board (HPB) also conducts mental health education programmes for parents with pre-school and primary school-going children. These include the ‘Colours of the Mind’ workshops, which equip parents with the knowledge and skills to develop and strengthen their children’s mental well-being.
You can visit HPB’s Parent Hub, a one-stop online resource portal, for more resources on youth mental well-being.
Q: Is there an AfA to support the mental health of older Singaporeans?
A: Yes, the Singapore Together AfA on Emerging Needs and Volunteerism. One of its focus areas is to increase support for mental wellness in the community.
The SG Cares VC @ Jurong East, run by Loving Heart Multi-Service Centre, has introduced a community mental wellness initiative called Sound Mind, Soft Heart. It is working together with partners such as Bold At Work, a ground-up group, and grassroots organisations, to curate core training modules that will equip volunteers with knowledge of mental wellness and skills to help design fun intervention activities within a safe environment for residents.
Together with their partners, the SG Cares VC @ Jurong East aims to recruit about 550 volunteers to conceptualise and execute more mental wellness programmes and activities to further build up the community’s knowledge of self-care, ability to detect signs of stress or early dementia, as well as the capacity to keep an eye on vulnerable neighbours.
There are plans to scale up this initiative across Jurong East with the support of other partners to reach out to and support a greater pool of residents, with the goal of building a more supportive and resilient community.
For more information, e-mail the SG Cares Office.
Q: Why did the Government decide to launch Singapore Together in 2019?
A: More Singaporeans want to be involved in building a shared future for the country, and to co-create policies and programmes to address complex issues. Singapore Together was launched to facilitate partnerships between the Government and citizens and among citizens themselves.
This new governance approach gives Singaporeans the opportunity to understand and engage more deeply with a range of topics and issues facing our nation, and directly contribute their ideas and energies, including through processes such as conversations, citizen workgroups and the Alliances for Action.
Building Singapore Together
The Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfA) were formed to bring together partnerships between people, public and private sectors to tackle complex socio-economic issues the nation faces.
To date, 25 AfAs have been announced.

Seoul using AI to detect and prevent suicide attempts on bridges,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/seoul-using-ai-to-detect-and-prevent-suicide-attempts-on-bridges,"SEOUL (REUTERS) - Is the young woman in the summer dress just admiring the view off the bridge or is she thinking of taking her life?
That is the question South Korean researchers and the emergency services are working to answer using artificial intelligence to detect and prevent suicide attempts.
In this case, it is one of the researchers demonstrating how hard it can be for human surveillance teams to tell.
But the AI system they are developing has been learning patterns of behaviour by analysing data from cameras, sensors and the dispatch records of rescue services since April 2020, Seoul Institute of Technology said on Wednesday (June 30).
Based on information from hours of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage and assessing details such as the hesitation of the person, the AI system can then forecast a hazardous situation and immediately alert rescue teams, principal researcher Kim Jun-chul said.
""We believe the new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster and help us head to a call more promptly,"" Mr Kim Hyeong-gil, who is in charge of the Yeouido Water Rescue Brigade, told Reuters as he monitored real-time footage from bridges on Seoul's Han River.
Mr Kim's team has been working with the researchers to come up with the technology that his crew and the Seoul Fire and Disaster Headquarters will be piloting from October. Their work cannot come quickly enough.
South Korea, with a population of 52 million people in 2019, had the highest suicide rate in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). More than 13,700 people took their own lives that same year, government data showed.
Nearly 500 suicide attempts are reported on 27 bridges over the nearly 500km-long Han River every year, the city said.
The number of rescue dispatches surged about 30 per cent in 2020 compared with the year before, and many of the attempts were made by people in their 20s and 30s as the coronavirus pandemic brought greater economic hardship and worsened the battle for jobs, the rescue brigade's Mr Kim said.
""The system learns the footage itself, which can bring about improved results by greatly reducing false alarms,"" principal researcher Kim Jun-chul said.

Malaysians talk of mental anguish as Covid-19 lockdown is extended,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysians-talk-of-mental-anguish-as-covid-19-lockdown-gets-extended,"KUALA LUMPUR - Ms Firdaus Nisha used to earn a good income from her small environmental consulting firm in Kuala Lumpur, but now, more than a year after the pandemic started, she has slipped into the lower-income group.
She said her business, which had to shift its office and cut overheads, has effectively been in ""cold storage"" for much of this year.
""I used to think I am in the middle-income category, but now I have slipped into the B40 (lower income group) category,"" Ms Nisha told The Straits Times.
Her firm's work is usually done with international clients and schools, but with borders mostly closed and schools shuttered, work has been drying up.
Now that Malaysia's full lockdown - originally scheduled to end on Monday (June 28) - has been extended indefinitely, the future looks bleak for Ms Nisha.
""I am already broke, so I am just thinking about how to survive for the next few months. If I start thinking (about finances), I would go into a panic state,"" she said. ""When (the lockdown) is extended indefinitely, we have nothing to look forward to.""
Ms Nisha urged the government to re-evaluate where people are economically and provide them with consistent aid, saying there are many like her who have slipped in the income category as a result of a challenging year. ""We need proactive measures, not reactive ones,"" she said.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced on Sunday that the full lockdown - which is costing the country RM1 billion (S$322 million) a day - would be extended indefinitely as Covid-19 numbers remained stubbornly high.
That means millions of Malaysians will spend a third month under some form of lockdown. They were in a partial lockdown for much of May before the full lockdown began on June 1.
And with no end date given, Malaysians are speaking of the toll that the lockdown and pandemic are taking on their mental health, relationships and finances.
Mrs Elvina Fernandez understands the need to prolong the curbs due to the high number of cases every day, but she has had ""mixed feelings"".
""I also wonder what will happen to all the people who are surviving on daily wages. Once (the pandemic) is over, what kind of community we are going to create,"" the freelance writer told ST, adding that she imagined a post-pandemic society where poverty and social ills might be on the rise.
Mrs Fernandez - who left her previous job as an executive last year - initially wanted to return to the workforce after a couple of months' break. But she has been putting off the plans as Malaysia has spent much of this year so far dealing with high numbers of Covid-19 cases, a state of emergency, and various iterations of lockdown.
""Fortunately, for now, I have been able to survive despite not having a full-time job,"" she told ST.

Even those who are still employed are feeling the strain of the prolonged closure of the economy and restrictions on movement.
An oil and gas industry worker from an offshore platform - who wanted to be known only as Raj - said that Covid-19 protocols meant he is separated from his family for long periods . He works for four weeks and has to quarantine for two weeks before returning home.
""I spend six weeks away from the family, and only get 10 days with them. We can't go anywhere when onshore,"" Mr Raj told ST. ""There is no mental stability, and it is affecting my family and my relationship.""
Mr Raj's income has fallen by up to 70 per cent since the pandemic started. He lost a previous job at an oil field overseas and returned to Malaysia at the onset of the pandemic, and subsequently went 11 months without work.
""When I heard about the extension, I just felt helpless,"" he said.

Tan Sri Muhyiddin said Malaysia will remain under the lockdown until the daily case load reduces to below 4,000 infections a day - a number last seen more than a month ago.
The country recorded 5,218 infections on Monday, bringing the total tally to 739,266. Another 57 deaths were recorded, meaning the death toll now stands at 5,001.
Malaysia is on a four-phase Covid-19 exit plan that will likely see a reopening of the economy only towards the end of the year.
To move to a second phase - which will allow more businesses to open - daily cases need to drop below 4,000, 10 per cent of its population has to be fully inoculated, and intensive care bed usage needs to return to moderate levels.
ICU bed usage remains above 90 per cent, while only 6.4 per cent of Malaysians are currently fully inoculated. The 10 per cent vaccination target is expected to be reached in mid-July.

As the lockdown drags on, some are worried about the impact on children.
A communications executive and mother of two - who wanted to be known only as Amy - said: ""Reduced physical activity impacts a healthy body and mind. It's even worse on kids, who are happy to sit with devices but there are long-term effects to this.""
""My heart goes out to those living in confined spaces,"" she said.

New programme launched to improve mental wellness of migrant workers in Singapore,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-programme-to-improve-mental-wellness-of-migrant-workers,"SINGAPORE - Various recreational activities are being organised under a new programme to help improve the mental well-being of migrant workers living in the more than 300 dormitories here.
The mental wellness programme, launched on Sunday (June 27) by non-profit organisation Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth Centre and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), comes as migrant workers in the dorms have faced significant anxiety and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic.
On Sunday, various activities, including a poetry-sharing session by local and foreign poets and a mental health talk, were held online. The workers were taught relaxation and meditation techniques by traditional Chinese medicine physician Lim Xiang Jun.
Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the dorms, the movement of more than 300,000 migrant workers has been restricted. Often, the workers are confined to their dormitory.
The Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth Centre has built up expertise in serving this community over the past year and formed a social network to safeguard the mental health of migrant workers. It has partnered several organisations, including cooperative society A Good Space and literary interest group Migrant Writers of Singapore.
The centre's manager, Ms Lim Choon Choon, said the pandemic has highlighted the plight of the migrant workers here. She added that her centre is doing its part ""in bridging the gaps between migrants and locals"".

WikiLeaks founder Assange's fiancee calls his detention in Britain 'grotesque',https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/assange-fiancee-calls-his-detention-in-uk-grotesque,"LONDON (AFP) - The fiancee of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Saturday (June 19) condemned his ""grotesque"" detention in Britain, after visiting him in jail for the first time in eight months.
Ms Stella Moris, 38, went to Belmarsh prison in south London on Saturday with the couple's two young sons. She said she had not seen Assange since he made a court appearance in January.
""The situation is utterly intolerable and grotesque, and it can't go on,"" Ms Moris said after the visit, describing Assange as ""struggling"".
The British authorities are ""driving him to deep depression and into despair"", she added.
Assange, 49, was arrested in Britain in 2019 for jumping bail after spending seven years inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London to evade extradition to Sweden and the US.
Ms Moris is a lawyer and worked on his legal team while he was in the embassy.
In January, a judge ruled not to extradite Assange on mental health grounds, but refused to release him on bail, citing fears he would abscond.
He is detained awaiting the outcome of an appeal against the extradition ruling.
Sweden dropped a rape investigation against Assange in 2019.
He is wanted in Washington to face 18 charges relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 500,000 secret files detailing aspects of military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
If convicted in the United States, he faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in jail.
Ms Moris said Saturday she ""hoped"" the family would stay in Britain if the appeal by US prosecutors is blocked.
She has visited Switzerland and along with the UN special rapporteur on torture and Geneva's mayor, called for Assange's immediate release.

'I weep all the time': Trauma lasts beyond India's Covid-19 peak,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/i-weep-all-the-time-trauma-lasts-beyond-indias-covid-19-peak,"NEW DELHI (BLOOMBERG) - ""I lost my father to Covid-19, I'm very stressed because I have so many responsibilities."" ""I saw so many deaths when I was in the ICU. I wake up to the sound of the ventilator beeps in the night. I don't know why I'm alive."" ""I lost my mother-in-law to Covid-19. I shouldn't have argued with her all the time. I feel so guilty that I can't sleep, I weep all the time.""
These are just some of the cries for help from workers in today's India. The country is going through the world's worst Covid-19 outbreak, a tragedy exacerbated by the trauma of seeing family and friends suffer as so many other countries emerge from the pandemic.
Now, Indian tech companies, which support Wall Street banks and Silicon Valley giants, are trying to figure out how to address the mental-health fallout for a generation of young workers.
Vijay Laxmi has never seen anything like it.
The 31-year-old is an in-house psychologist at the tech services giant HCL Technologies, the source of the testimonials. She now counsels as many as 40 employees a week, four times the number during the first Covid wave last year. She's had to ration her time and make sessions shorter because of the overwhelming demand.
For years, her job involved coaching staff through annual reviews or soothing love-struck employees around Valentine's Day. Now, she sees people with trauma so debilitating they're struggling to get through the next day.
In one recent case, a 30-something employee was hit with severe insomnia and anxiety after losing her mother-in-law to Covid-19. The two had squabbled constantly and the younger woman felt intense guilt over her behaviour.
""Employees are gripped by fear from the suddenness and the intensity of the second Covid-19 wave,"" she said. ""The shortage of ICU beds, oxygen and medical supplies only adds to the anxiety and panic.""
While India's coronavirus outbreak has infected 29 million and left more than 350,000 dead, the effect on citizens' mental health has spread even wider. Tech companies like HCL realise the psychological impact on workers and their families will endure beyond the pandemic's peak.
HCL and peers like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services have long been at the vanguard of employee welfare in India, in part because of a philosophy that a healthy workforce tends to lead to a healthy business. Managers stress work-life balance, while in-house psychologists like Laxmi have been standard for years.
But even these companies aren't sure how to navigate Covid-19's desolation. Tens of thousands of employees who worked assiduously though the pandemic's first wave are now reporting panic attacks, phobia, extreme mood swings and incapacity.
The companies' task is more difficult because employees are toiling through harrowing circumstances while clients in places like New York and San Francisco begin to resume normal lives.
""During the weeks when the wave climaxed, many companies estimated a 50 per cent to 60 per cent productivity drop,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, vice-president and research director at Forrester Research, which studies employee productivity.
Amid fears that such issues could damage India's US$194-billion (S$257 billion) tech services industry - the country's most important - companies are trying everything from more therapy and counselling apps to yoga and mindfulness sessions. They're even coaching managers to take it easy on staff, at least for now.
""So many young people are traumatised after seeing death up close,"" said Apparao V.V., chief human resources officer at HCL, whose clients include Cisco Systems, Airbus and University of California, Berkeley.
""Many don't recognise what they're going through.""
One relatively new treatment that's catching on is counselling via smartphone apps, which offer sessions through chatbots or one-to-one coaching with live counsellors. Google-backed Wysa, one such startup, has tripled its active users over the past year to 300,000.
""At least 50 per cent of the workers in any company are dealing with some kind of grief,"" said Jo Aggarwal, co-founder and chief executive officer of Wysa, whose AI-guided bot provides 24-hour support.
""No company can bury their head in the sand after such a mass tragedy.""

The start-up has increased its client base from one company pre-Covid to 30 currently. Consultant Accenture, with 200,000 staff in India, and analytics provider Fractal Analytics are among those whose workers are reaching out for help with issues like insomnia, anxiety and grief.
Tata Consultancy Services, Asia's largest outsourcer, is experimenting too. It's conducting yoga and meditation sessions for employees, and delivering well-being nudges digitally to their desktops. It's re-training managers to become what they call ""Emotional Health first aiders,"" so they will show more empathy and sensitivity to colleagues stricken with grief and depression.
The outsourcer Mphasis is treating the crisis like an all-hands emergency. The firm developed its own wellness app called Reach for staff and put together a No-Panic Covid-19 mental wellness handbook. It also set up a telephone support line with professional counsellors for its 30,000 employees in May - which now handles as many as 10 calls an hour.
Nitin Rakesh, the company's CEO, said companies everywhere should give special consideration to the toll of the last 18 months on the human psyche.
""This is a time for all of us to be compassionate leaders,"" said Rakesh. ""The second wave of Covid-19 has disproportionately impacted India, making it imperative to provide timely resources and offer the maximum protection possible to all our colleagues and their families.""
Rakesh, who's based in New York, is personally reaching out to employees every day.
There is a cultural hurdle companies need to cross as they help staff. Consulting a psychologist or a psychiatrist is often taboo in India so companies sometimes camouflage their support.
Workers are given access to ""life coaches,"" not psychologists, and they're measured on a ""happiness index,"" rather than an anxiety or depression scale.

This may be one of the draws of a smartphone app like Wysa. Employees can tap the service with anonymity; if they use an AI bot, they don't even communicate with another human being.
Yet Aggarwal, the start-up's CEO, says the collective trauma that India is going through is also changing the culture of the country. The grief, anxiety and trauma are so widespread there is more openness to treatments.
""Something is very different now,"" she said. ""Covid-19 has opened the doors to workplace conversations about mental health.""
There's a generational issue too. At HCL, the median age of the workforce is 28 so many of the employees who have lost family members and are feeling overwhelmed are quite young.
""IT companies will have to lead the way in India in sensitising employers,"" said Laxmi. ""We have a long way to go.""

Recovered stroke patient learns to manage anxiety with mindfulness programme,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/recovered-stroke-patient-learns-to-manage-anxiety-with-mindfulness-programme,"SINGAPORE - When the Government announced on May 4 that fitness studios would close to minimise the spread of Covid-19 in the community, Ms Jessie Tham, 61, experienced a wave of anxiety.
Exercising was not just a way for her to stay fit, but also essential for her to build up her strength and endurance after she had a stroke in December 2018. She worried about the disruption to her rehabilitation.
She was also concerned about the rise in community cases.
So when the Brahm Centre, a charity which promotes mindfulness programmes to reduce stress, launched a 30-minute lunchtime mindfulness programme on May 4, Ms Tham, who works in financial services, did not hesitate to sign up for it.
She is one of over 1,000 people who signed up for the programme.
The sessions are held via Zoom, with about 150 people tuning in every day. They will continue until June 30.
Since attending the sessions three times a week, Ms Tham has found it easier to cope with feelings of anxiety during phase two of the heightened alert, which ended on Sunday (June 13).
Her anxiety had stemmed from having her barre and Pilates classes moved online during the four-week period.
She said: ""On Zoom, the trainer could only give me verbal guidance on how to adjust my posture. There wasn't much time for me to understand the instructions. My focus was not on my exercises but looking at the screen.""
It did not help that she had been hospitalised for three weeks in May last year because of an inflamed aorta, the main artery of the heart.
""Whatever recovery I had achieved between 2019 and April 2020 had gone to waste. My physical condition was back to (what it was in) March 2019,"" said Ms Tham, who is single.
With the help of the Brahm Centre, she is learning to focus on the positive through practising gratitude.
She said: ""Mindfulness teaches us to do one thing at a time at a pace with which we are comfortable. With this non-striving mindset, I don't need to rush my recovery process.""
Mindfulness has also taught her how to manage her emotions and not dwell excessively on the possibility of contracting Covid-19.

Care groups see spike in mental health crises in Singapore amid heightened alert curbs,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/care-groups-see-spike-in-mental-health-crises-in-singapore-amid-heightened-alert,"SINGAPORE - Calls to the Samaritans of Singapore's (SOS) mental health helpline spiked 40 per cent on May 16, the day Singapore started heightened alert restrictions.
Following the announcement of restrictions on May 4, SOS experienced a 12 per cent increase in the volume of calls that week compared with the week before, SOS chief executive Gasper Tan told The Straits Times (ST).
Seven out of 10 mental health organisations and professionals ST spoke to saw spikes of between 20 per cent and 60 per cent in queries and incidents like mental health crises because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the social restrictions that have been used to contain the virus' spread.
Those increased restrictions and the subsequent loss of support from outside the home compounded stress factors such as fears about the virus, difficult living situations, and fears about job loss and the future, say social workers.
Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL), a non-profit organisation that helps the caregivers of those with mental health issues, said that it saw a ""disturbing increase"" in attempted and completed suicides between May last year and April this year among people being cared for.
CAL's head of communications, Ms Tricia Lee, said: ""We have seen a rise in crisis cases as the mental health appointments or daycare programmes of caregivers' loved ones were halted. The social restrictions in some cases caused rising tension within families, increasing the risk of relapse (into a mental health crisis).""
Many students also found home-based learning stressful and missed the social interactions of schooling, support organisations said.
Mr Cho Ming Xiu, founder and executive director of Campus PSY, a mental health organisation for youth, said that it has seen a 40 per cent increase in the number of young people seeking emotional support via e-mail, and a 20 per cent to 30 per cent increase across various social media platforms.
Despite Singapore's experience with the circuit breaker last year, the speed at which heightened alert measures came into effect made the situation difficult for many.
""With the sudden limitations of movement, many of our callers found themselves struggling to adjust and adapt to the newly implemented restrictions,"" said SOS' Mr Tan.
""Many had to cancel their plans and return to working from home or home-based learning arrangements, which contribute to a state of loss and helplessness.
""The accumulation of these stressors may be overwhelming and with no one to speak to, they reach out to SOS.""
However, the experience of last year's circuit breaker helped some organisations prepare for the sudden onset of restrictions, which included a ban on dining in eateries and reduced group sizes for social meetings from five to two.
To meet the intensified need for support, CAL has increased its number of helplines from one to six since April last year, as well as the frequency of its Caregivers-to-Caregivers programmes. These programmes provide fully funded training and support to caregivers of people with mental health issues, such as dementia.

Silver Ribbon Singapore, a charity that provides free counselling services, said it saw a 20 per cent increase in calls, but social worker Phay Yan Deng, 29, said the organisation was more prepared to provide support online this time round.
The senior clinical executive said that during the circuit breaker period, it was ""initially slightly overwhelmed as many things were quite new to us"".
""In the past, we provided emotional support only face to face"", whereas most of its work, from referral to actual sessions, is now done online, he said.
However, while organisations may be better prepared, Silver Ribbon's executive director, Ms Porsche Poh, said it is not helpful to assume that people should be able to cope with heightened alert restrictions just because they have been through it before.
""They might have limited social support, or face a new set of challenges during this phase,"" she said.

Meghan Markle's father says Oprah Winfrey is exploiting Meghan and Harry,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/meghan-markles-father-says-oprah-winfrey-is-exploiting-meghan-and-harry,"Meghan Markle's estranged father, Mr Thomas Markle, has accused talk show host Oprah Winfrey of exploiting his daughter and husband Prince Harry in her televised interviews with them.
""The only person benefiting from this is Oprah Winfrey,"" Mr Markle said on Australian television show 60 Minutes on Sunday (June 13).
When asked if he thought the TV mogul was exploiting Meghan, 39, and Harry, 36, he replied: ""Yes, I do… that's just my opinion. It seems to me she's pushing it to get more and more out of it.""
Winfrey had conducted a bombshell interview with the couple in March, with revelations that rocked the royal family.
She also subsequently spoke to Harry on their new health docu-series on Apple TV+, The Me You Can't See. The issues raised in the interviews included racism in the royal family and mental health issues they had faced.
Mr Markle, 76, who has not spoken to his daughter since two days before her wedding in 2018 after a paparazzi scandal, said: ""I think Oprah Winfrey is playing Harry and Meghan.
""I think she's using them to build her network and her new shows, and I think she's taking advantage of a very weakened man and getting him to say things that you just shouldn't be saying on television.""
However, his disdain of Winfrey did not stop him from driving up from Mexico, where he lives, to her home in Montecito, California, two months ago and leaving a letter requesting she grant him an interview as well.
""I left a letter for Oprah with my phone number and e-mail and I said, 'Give me a chance to tell my story',"" he said on 60 Minutes. ""I said, it's not fair to tell (their) story without hearing my story. I got no response.""
He added that he heard about the birth of his granddaughter Lilibet Diana on June 4 on the radio, with no phone call from Meghan. He has also never met the couple's first child, Archie, two.
""July 18, I'll be 77 years old. Most of the Markle men don't make it much past 80,"" said the retired Hollywood lighting director. ""So there's a good chance I might never see my grandchildren. I'm not looking for pity. I'm just saying that's a reality.""

Why it is important to take breaks from work,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/why-it-is-important-to-take-breaks-from-work,"(NYTIMES) - It's probably never been easier to acknowledge that a lot of us work too much and too hard, and should take more time off. Indeed, the very idea of burnout seems to be having a cultural moment.
""If you think you're burned out, you're burned out. And if you don't think you're burned out, you're burned out,"" Jill Lepore wrote recently in The New Yorker.
To believe this is one thing, but to act on it is another. For years, surveys have found that American workers tend not to use all of their vacation days. And according to NordVPN Teams, a provider of virtual private network technology that is important to remote work set-ups, the stay-at-home workforce created by lockdowns and office closures put in more hours on the job than before the pandemic.
Your biggest obstacle to getting time off is probably you: It can be hard to give yourself that permission to do nothing when there's just so much to do. Consider, however, that Amazon's founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has said he sets aside ""puttering time"" every morning before taking any calls or meetings - basically carving out a scheduled chunk of do-nothing time. Are you really that much busier than him?
Breaks as 'ruthless pragmatism'
The point isn't just that it's nice to goof off every so often - it's that it's necessary. And that's true even if your ultimate goal is doing better work: downtime allows the brain to make new connections and better decisions. Multiple studies have found that sustained mental attention without breaks is depleting, leading to inferior performance and decision-making.
In short, the prefrontal cortex - where goal-oriented and executive-function thinking goes on - can get worn down, potentially resulting in ""decision fatigue"". A variety of research finds that even simple remedies like a walk in nature or a nap can replenish the brain and ultimately improve mental performance.
These findings aren't just limited to academic studies. In his recent book Richer, Wiser, Happier, veteran financial journalist William Green draws on many hours of interviews with highly successful investors, and, as you'd expect, a recurring theme is that these people tend to work hard, and out-think, out-research and out-hustle the crowd.
But a counter-intuitive subtheme also emerges: how seriously his subjects tend to take breaks, time off and make space in their lives for definitive distance from the all-day, everyday 21st century work cycle. Many - including Mr Charlie Munger, Mr Warren Buffett's long-time collaborator - make a point to carve out time for quiet and contemplation. For Mr Munger, that means ignoring up-to-the-second market news and crowd noise and instead exercising extreme patience.
For another one of Green's interviewees, Ms Laura Geritz, CEO at Rondure Global Advisors, it means taking time to sit by a stream and journal. Developing ""a regular meditation practice"", Green notes, has become ""a mission-critical habit for many successful investors"". This isn't an afterthought or a hobby or a personal wellness tactic, Green said. It's a reflection of the ""ruthless pragmatism"" that made his subjects successful in the first place - in the eternal hunt for an edge, they found their rest ethic. It's almost a ""counter-cultural"" move, Green said. ""I don't think you have deep thought without structuring your life this way,"" he said, at a time when everybody is constantly pinged and reacting to short-term stimuli.
Micro-dosing relaxation
The good news is that at least some companies are starting to take breaks seriously. For starters, some are acknowledging that unlimited paid time off, a popular gesture among employers who have tried to address the issue, doesn't really do the trick, says John Fitch, the author with Max Frenzel of the 2020 book Time Off. It can end up feeling like just another responsibility, and nobody wants to be the employee who takes the most days off.
Lately, companies including LinkedIn and Roblox have experimented with mandatory vacation for all or most employees in the form of ""spring break"" periods. Actions like these that emphasise the value of time off represent a ""profound"" shift, Fitch said. He and Frenzel, both tech entrepreneurs, are tinkering with a software tool that would help human resources departments prod workers to take days off.
Still, those companies are outliers, and most of us will have to take the initiative on an individual level. Given the natural resistance to downtime that many of us evidently feel, it might make sense to start small - find a gateway drug equivalent to taking time off. Or, to use Fitch's related metaphor, try micro-dosing breaks.
One obvious place to start? Unplugging. The dream of a weeks-long ""digital detox"" may not be practical, but consider the ""technology Shabbat"" strategy - taking one day a week off from technology - promoted by writer and filmmaker Tiffany Shlain, most recently in her book 24/6.

More needed help during Covid-19 pandemic, say mental health experts
What to do next
For some, the advice to simply unplug or ""do nothing"" feels like a dead end; you need something to fill that space, or you just end up ruminating about work all over again. Fitch recommends an exercise called ""More of, less of"" - periodically taking a chunk of time to list both what you want more of and less of in your life. It's a ""higher altitude"" analysis to pull you out of the day-to-day rut of reacting to other people's stimuli and help you focus on what you need to create, and get rid of, in your life.
Similarly, if you add to your routine a simple walk around the block to clear your head, make sure you really clear it. Spending the whole time checking social media and monitoring your step count is not a quality break. Leave your phone behind, and make a point to notice something new and different on every walk. Turning the walk into a game ensures that your mind is engaged with the world rather than brooding about the work you're supposedly taking a break from.
But wait - don't such ideas sound kind of like another form of work? More goal-oriented tasks intended to boost productivity in the long run? Is developing a rest ethic ultimately another job? Perhaps so. But then again, maybe that's the only language the unhealthily work-obsessed really understand.

Shattered by friend’s suicide, he comes up with a guide
After losing a buddy he met in National Service to suicide earlier this year, Mr Shawn Tilakan, 27, was at a complete loss.
“I found out about it on Facebook and I was so shocked, I just broke down,” he says, with a deep frown. “Around the time it happened, another teammate also lost a friend — her second friend to suicide.”
While grief-stricken, the suicides strengthened their resolve to help others with similar struggles through an initiative called Project It’ll Be Alright.
The project, under the Youth Mental Well-being Network, was set up by Mr Tilakan’s friend Edward Lim to create a community resource and help youth in need.
Its members were mentored by Minister of State for Education and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling, who provided advice and connected them to resources and partners like the Ministry of Education (MOE).
One of the group’s main goals is to gather stories from secondary and tertiary students and young working adults who have experienced mental health struggles. These stories will be compiled into an e-book for youth, with advice from healthcare professionals, to assure them that they are not alone and inspire them to overcome similar hardships.

So far, the team has collected around 100 stories — half their target number — with hopes of launching the e-book by mid-July alongside an art exhibition.
Of these, one real-life account of a former drug addict, now in his mid-20s, struck a chord with Mr Tilakan. The former addict was sent to the Singapore Armed Forces’ detention barracks for taking drugs while serving NS and struggled to end his addiction.
“I found it very interesting that, to turn his life around, he did a lot of research on addiction, and managed to convert those energies into cultivating fitness and other good habits.”
Listening to people’s problems is not new to Mr Tilakan. The AfA volunteer, who works as a crime analyst, says: “Growing up, I was always sort of an unofficial counsellor to my friends. The idea that I could make a difference was very inspiring.”
He adds: “We are the next generation taking Singapore forward. Some people may look successful and well-adjusted in life and you wouldn’t expect them to have problems but they do.”
Why do he and his teammates think they can help? “We’ve all had our share of battles with mental health and want to let our peers know that they are not alone.
“Don’t be afraid to reach out and ask for help if you need to. It may seem like weakness but the people who love you won’t know what is happening to you otherwise.”
Having experienced despair, she now helps parents, kids prepare

Ms Francesca Wah, 29, knows how a little help can go a long way, having come from an underprivileged background.
A child of a school bus driver and housewife, she depended on financial aid programmes to pay for her education. And while she struggled to do well in school, she eventually earned a scholarship to study at the National University of Singapore (NUS) through the support and guidance of her teachers. She credits them for helping to “turn her life around”.
Now she’s paying it forward by helping the less fortunate, including families in rental flats through her non-profit organisation Bringing Love to Every Single Soul (Bless) since 2014.

Joining the Youth Mental Well-being Network was a natural next step for the educator. “I joined the Network to meet other like-minded and passionate individuals and exchange ideas with them to create a collective impact on society,” she says.
Ms Wah, who holds a master’s degree in social work, has always been interested in children and youth development work.
As a convenor in the Network, she led a number of engagement sessions on issues that young Singaporeans face and was keen to lead an initiative to support the mental well-being of at-risk youth. Convenors are members who facilitate and lead preliminary ideas and initiatives in AfAs.
This led to the birth of Driving Resilience and Inspiration for The Incredible Next Generation (Drifting), an outreach programme that hopes to provide social and emotional support for at-risk adolescents aged 10 to 12.
“We aim to develop a network of social support to help improve their social and emotional behaviour. This will also develop self-confidence and help them bounce back from failure,” she shares.
Through a series of discussions starting last July, the 13-member core team came up with a six-month mentorship programme that will teach kids to embrace challenges, build healthy relationships and experience success through activities such as fishing, cycling, nature and art. The activities were developed based on feedback from young Singaporeans and mental health professionals.
The team also plans to leverage informal community touch points, such as bicycle shops and provision shops.
Why target at-risk youth? Ms Wah explains that pre-teens may seek more independence and begin to drift from their parents at a time when they are undergoing many physical, emotional and social changes. This places those who come from households which lack parental guidance or attention at greater risk of going astray.
Through the programme, which is scheduled to start by the end of the year, Ms Wah hopes to instil values such as responsibility and commitment and help channel their energies toward developing new skills and self-expression.
To ensure that the activities resonate with the participants, her team plans to have former youth-at-risk join them as mentors and positive role models for younger children. They will also reach out to government agencies, social service agencies and family service centres to get referrals for youth who could benefit from Drifting.
Says Ms Wah: “We all share the same heartbeat for the future of Singapore and we can actively choose to invest our time to lift others.”

How many among the young can say they are comfortable discussing their feelings with their parents? This is a question that Mr Allen Sng, 28, takes to heart.
His growing-up years were not easy. After his father lost all his savings in a business deal gone bad, his family spent many years trying to pay off their debts. At one point, they even sold off their Housing Board flat to settle some of their dues.
As a child, he says he was not always able to properly express his emotions and concerns. “Like most traditional Asian families, I didn’t know how to talk about my emotions with my family,” he says.
Many families may find it hard to show their emotions, he continues, but it is crucial that they keep communication lines open, “especially for kids who may not understand what they feel or how to cope with negative emotions”.
He hopes to help youth embrace their feelings through his project with the Youth Mental Well-being Network.
As a convenor in the AfA, he is working with two other members on a guidebook that aims to equip parents with the skills to help their children develop emotional resilience.
A Sheridan Fellow at NUS Law, Mr Sng also runs a pro bono project helping parents of children with intellectual disabilities apply to be their kids’ deputies. A deputy is appointed by the court to make certain decisions on behalf of a person who lacks the mental capacity to do so.

He first learnt about the Network on Facebook. The idea for the guidebook came about from a series of engagement sessions that he facilitated. The team discovered during the sessions that a key concern was a lack of openness among youth and parents in Singapore.
To help equip parents with emotional literacy — a term that refers to the ability to express and communicate one’s emotions and feelings — the book will have tips from psychologists and counsellors on how to identify common stressors among kids. Some stressors include online bullying and school-to-work transition.
The team aims to launch the first batch of books for parents of primary school children by the end of the year. Following this, they aim to produce guides for parents of youth in other stages of life — from their teenage years to tertiary life and beyond. They hope to work with MOE and relevant agencies like Family Service Centres to distribute the guides.
While they gear up for the launch of the book, Mr Sng is also ticking off new milestones in his personal life. He recently received a scholarship to pursue a Master of Science in Law and Finance at the University of Oxford later this year.
Despite his packed schedule and the challenges that studying abroad will pose, he hopes to continue helping young Singaporeans adapt to adversity. One of his greatest motivations is to pass on the help that he received in his formative years, especially from his parents who spared no effort in providing for him despite their financial struggles.
“You never know when the help you’re giving someone can actually be a lifeline for them.”
Building Singapore Together
Launched last June, the Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversations (ESC) saw over 17,000 Singaporeans share their experiences living through the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as their ideas for how the economy and society can pull through such uncertain times.
The ESC led to the formation of new Alliances for Action — collaborative groups from people, public and private sectors that tackle various socio-economic issues. More than 20 AfAs, including four new ones, were announced earlier this year.

Rich nations are failing Covid-19's mental health test: OECD,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/rich-nations-are-failing-covids-mental-health-test-oecd,"PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Governments are falling short in most areas where they could tackle mental health difficulties that sharply increased in the Covid-19 pandemic and already place a huge burden on economies around the world, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
The warning comes as the Paris-based organisation published its first attempt at benchmarking the efforts of its 38 members to address the social and economic costs of the phenomenon.
It found the share of spending declined in some countries in the last decade, and that even if access to services is improving, 67 per cent of people who wanted care reported difficulty getting it.
""No mental health system delivers excellent performance across the board,"" the OECD said. ""In some areas, even the countries which are doing best cannot really be considered to be delivering excellent performance.""
Beyond the suffering of individuals, government shortcomings have broader economic consequences. The OECD estimates mental ill-health costs more than 4.2 per cent of economic output, factoring in expenditures on treatment and lower productivity and employment.
The challenge is set to mount with countries observing a surge in reported symptoms in 2020. Already before the pandemic and months of lockdowns and social distancing, one in five people were estimated to be living with mental ill-health at any given time.
""Since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, levels of mental distress have increased sharply, especially among young people, with prevalence of anxiety and depression even doubling in some countries,"" the OECD said.
The organisation urged governments to make integrating mental health into education and employment policies a norm rather than the exception.
The report showed that people affected were less likely to be employed and have a lower level of education, and those with serious conditions still have much lower life expectancy than average.
The OECD also said most countries have struggled to measure whether their health systems are effective, and its efforts in the benchmarking exercise were hampered by poor data availability.
""Countries must invest more in developing stronger and more widely available data on the key dimensions of mental health performance to drive faster and more meaningful improvements,"" the OECD said.

New digital campaign to help youth with thoughts of suicide,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-digital-campaign-to-help-youth-with-thoughts-of-suicide,"SINGAPORE - A new digital campaign will ask young people to reflect before they post content on social media, among other guidelines it will provide on how to identify and help individuals harbouring thoughts of suicide.
Suicide prevention centre Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) aims to reach about 75,000 users with the three-month initiative.
The #PauseBeforeYouPost campaign was launched on May 18 and will run until the end of August.
In the three months, SOS will release bite-sized educational tips such as thinking about possible outcomes before posting content about suicide, and how to safely respond to suicide-related content. SOS said the campaign is remind young people to think about their intention and how best to communicate before they post, as well as to improve their awareness of the appropriate language to use.
It is also developing a curriculum and plans to train 300 young people to look out for their own mental health and safely engage young people online.
Temasek Foundation has pledged $250,000 for the training curriculum, which will be implemented later this year.
SOS and the foundation plan to offer one-hour virtual forum sessions and work with educational institutions such as secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics to offer 2½-hour workshops.
The initiative comes after SOS recorded more than 4,600 texts sent to its text messaging service Care Text between last July, when it was launched, and March this year. Of those, 82 per cent were from individuals aged 10 to 29. And about 70 per cent of them had not used other SOS services before.
Suicide is the leading cause of death in Singapore for those aged 10 to 29. In 2019, there were 400 suicides reported - of which nearly a quarter or 94 were young people in that age group.
SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said: ""Encouraging a 'pause' to think before you speak is the first step in learning how to discuss suicide safely and reminds people to reflect about the consequences of their words before acting.
""It is even more pertinent now, especially as we live in a hyper-connected world where speed and efficiency are of the essence, and we often find ourselves rushing to respond or comment to posts.
""Everyone has a proactive part to play in suicide prevention. We hope that #chatsafe can be part of the solution and form an important part of upstream education on suicide situations, empowering youths to create positive behaviour and mindset change when talking about suicide online.""
The #PauseBeforeYouPost campaign is based on a similar social media campaign held in Australia in 2018. Guidelines for the Australian campaign - first developed by Australian charity Orygen - have been downloaded about 50,000 times since publication.
The Singaporean version of the guidelines was updated to include local helpline information and specific social media content for Singaporean users.
Noting that social media was an important platform for young people to receive and offer help, Orygen's head of suicide prevention Jo Robinson said: ""We also recognise that there is the potential for some kinds of suicide-related content to be distressing or even harmful to others. We are glad to be able to partner with SOS and bring the guidelines to Singapore, helping young people talk safely about their own experiences with suicide and to help them help each other.""

Tennis: Naomi Osaka pulls out of Berlin tournament in wake of French Open withdrawal,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/tennis-naomi-osaka-pulls-out-of-berlin-tournament-in-wake-of-french-open-withdrawal,"BERLIN (AFP) - Naomi Osaka has pulled out of next week's Berlin WTA grass-court tournament in the wake of her controversial exit from the French Open, organisers confirmed on Monday (June 7).
""We have received notification that Naomi Osaka cannot start in Berlin. After consulting her management, she will take a break,"" said a spokesman for the Berlin tournament, which starts on June 14.
Osaka has not said when she plans to play next, casting doubt on her participation at Wimbledon, which starts on June 28, and the Tokyo Olympics.
The 23-year-old four-time Grand Slam winner has been in the spotlight since withdrawing from Roland Garros after a dispute over her refusal to attend press conferences.
As a result, French tennis officials fined Osaka US$15,000 (S$19,860) and threatened to axe her from the tournament for not honouring mandatory media commitments, prompting the Japanese star to withdraw.
On Saturday, Osaka, who revealed her ongoing battle with depression and anxiety which she said having to face the media exacerbated, thanked her supporters in a brief message on Instagram.

In supporting Naomi Osaka, President Halimah highlights the importance of mental health

"In supporting Naomi Osaka, President Halimah highlights the importance of mental health",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/in-supporting-naomi-osaka-president-halimah-highlights-the-importance-of-mental-health,"SINGAPORE - President Halimah Yacob has said she has ""great respect"" for tennis player Naomi Osaka, who recently pulled out of the French Open over mental health issues.
In a Facebook post on Sunday (June 6), Madam Halimah, a long-time advocate for greater awareness of mental health issues, especially among young people, acknowledged that the decision must have been ""terribly difficult for her"", as Ms Osaka, 23, is at the prime of her career.
The Japanese world number two and a four-time Grand Slam champion was fined US$15,000 (S$19,800) on May 30 and threatened with disqualification after she refused to carry out a mandatory news conference following her first-round win. She later withdrew from the tournament.
On the eve of the French Open, Ms Osaka had likened post-match media inquests to ""kicking people when they are down"", which had a detrimental effect on her mental health"".
She also came clean about suffering from bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018, admitting that she had ""a really hard time coping with that"".
The International Tennis Federation has promised a comprehensive review on how players and media interact during tournaments, saying it takes mental health issues extremely seriously, Reuters reported on Saturday.
Affirming that Ms Osaka had done the right thing, Madam Halimah said her move had ""sent a strong signal"" to millions around the world who are struggling with mental health issues, as it showed that ""it's okay to walk away from a toxic and stressful environment, even if that will set you back for a while"".
She added that many people wait too long to protect their mental health, much to their detriment and that of their families, and many still continue to fear the stigma of being ""condemned"" for losing their mental faculties.
Acknowledging that mental health has yet again become a hot topic due to social exclusion, lockdowns and safe management measures amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Madam Halimah said most people have developed ""mental resilience to overcome temporary setbacks"".
However, developing that resilience starts from a young age, both at home and in school, she added.
""It's sad when we read of young children killing themselves due to poor exam results because they saw their self-worth as linked to their school performance, and nothing else. We need constructive, uplifting conversations at home, school and the workplace.""
Amid this difficult period, she added, women working from home often bear the brunt of mental stress, as they have to deal with caregiving responsibilities at the same time.
Regardless of the situation, Madam Halimah said that a lot more empathy, care and kindness can be shown to those in our family and others in the community.
""Always start with ourselves. Treat others like how we would like to be treated ourselves,"" she said.

Feeling socially rusty? Try a little light gossiping,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/feeling-socially-rusty-try-a-little-light-gossiping,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - Go ahead, talk a little trash. Gossip may not be good for you, per se, but it's deeply connected to human nature. And it might just help in navigating a post-pandemic world - at least in a social sense.
Historian Yuval Noah Harari wrote in Sapiens: A Brief History Of Humankind that gossip helped early Homo sapiens form larger and more stable bands. He borrowed the idea from anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who theorised in his 1998 book, Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language, that language - and, by extension, gossip - replaced grooming, a social-bonding practice still seen among our primate cousins.
In other words, humans needed something that would help them keep up to date with friends and family as they spread out across distances, and networks of Homo sapiens were becoming too large for everyone to effectively groom everyone else.
Or, to put it another way, humans evolved to gossip.
Of course, no one can know exactly why or how our species developed an ability to think, communicate and transmit social information. But the language of social bonding is thought to play a pivotal part in ensuring our survival and later flourishing.
This is not to say there are not extreme downsides to gossip, and that there aren't horribly cruel ways to do it. At worst, it can facilitate xenophobia or bigotry on macro levels, and reinforce stereotypes about perceived ""others"". Even in more-casual social settings, gossip can ruin reputations.
But there are also OK ways to gossip. One of those is gossiping about celebrities or powerful people you don't know.
Celebrity-gossip culture began to flourish in the mid-20th century, eventually mutating into its present form as a social media monolith, because - as we all know - it is entertaining.
Famed celebrity-gossip columnist Perez Hilton acknowledged the innate and, in some ways, aspirational human urge to gossip about celebs.
""Even before social media existed, even before we graduated high school, people used to gossip about the captain of the football team, the head cheerleader,"" he said in an interview. ""We always are drawn to perceived roles of power. It's just human nature. It's curiosity.""
As humanity reenters the realm of in-person socialising, we could all benefit from considering this: How might we gossip better? How do we harness this evolutionary tool to our benefit - to connect with greater kindness and empathy after a year that brought with it so much suffering?
Consider your intention and the possible outcomes
When it comes to sharing a bit of gossip, it can help to run through the five Gatekeepers of Speech, which are interpreted from Buddhist teachings: Is it true? Is it kind? Is it beneficial? Is it necessary? Is it the right time?
Gossip need not fulfill all these criteria to be worth sharing, but it is probably less nasty if it fulfills some of them. Note that just because information may be negative, it doesn't mean that the gossip is. An example of this is the whisper networks that emerged from the #MeToo movement.
Consider your motives
If the gossip is negative and doesn't serve any actionable purpose, keep it to yourself. ""People love new couples. People love babies. It's not all negative,"" Hilton said. ""Of course, train wrecks - people being very messy or sloppy publicly - do get a lot of attention. I won't deny that.""
Consider the merit and the source
Gossiping is bad when it sows uncertainty or confusion. And any piece of gossip loses its merit as civilisation-boosting or as a social lubricant when it's a baldfaced lie, or even something heard through the grapevine that can't be substantiated.
When gossiping, remember to exercise some compassion not just for others but for yourself. Everyone gossips - and everyone makes mistakes in gossiping - and you will too.
Don't beat yourself up for falling prey to evolutionary instincts. The best you can do, on your best day, is be kind, keep it positive and stick to the facts.

Tennis: Japan rallies to support Osaka after French Open withdrawal,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/tennis-japan-rallies-to-support-osaka-after-french-open-withdrawal,"TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan joined leading figures in tennis in rallying around Naomi Osaka on Tuesday (June 1) after the world No. 2 withdrew from the French Open in a row about post-match media duties, saying she had been suffering from ""depression"" and ""anxiety"".
One of the biggest names in sport, Osaka stunned the tennis world when she pulled out of the Grand Slam on Monday after being fined and threatened with expulsion for declining to face the media after her first-round match on Sunday.
The four-time Grand Slam champion had last week signalled her intentions to skip her media duties to protect her mental well-being and she returned to Twitter on Monday to announce her withdrawal.
While her original stance had earned the Japanese 23-year-old little backing from her fellow professionals, most saying that dealing with the media was part of the job, her withdrawal triggered a wave of support from around the world.
""The first thing to be considered is Ms Osaka's health. I wish her the earliest possible recovery,"" Japan Tennis Association (JTA) executive director Toshihisa Tsuchihashi said in a statement on Tuesday.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference that he would ""watch over her quietly"" and there was concern on the streets of Tokyo for the woman who will be one of the faces of this year's Olympic Games in the city.
""I think she's under a lot of pressure, more than we can imagine,"" kimono dresser Tomomi Noguchi, 67, told Reuters.
""She got to the top when she was young so I think we can't really imagine what she's going through.""
Vickie Skorji, who manages a helpline at TELL, a non-profit counselling service in Japan, said society needed to be ""more respectful and supportive"" of mental health.
""Who has asked her how she is doing? She put out a statement and said 'I need to take care of myself,' and she's been punished,"" Skorji told Reuters.
""I think she is courageous and needs support.""
Skorji's thoughts echoed earlier comments from women's tennis trailblazers Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King.
""It's incredibly brave that Naomi Osaka has revealed her truth about her struggle with depression,"" King wrote on social media.
""Right now, the important thing is that we give her the space and time she needs. We wish her well.""
Earlier, Williams sisters Serena and Venus, as well as younger American players Coco Gauff and Sloane Stephens, chimed in with messages of support as the focus shifted from Osaka's responsibilities to her well-being.

There were also messages of support posted on social media from athletes in other sports.
""You shouldn't ever have to make a decision like this - but so damn impressive taking the high road when the powers that be don't protect their own. Major respect,"" wrote National Basketball Association All-Star Stephen Curry.
There was some criticism of Roland Garros organisers for their handling of the matter.
French Tennis Federation president Gilles Moretton read a prepared statement on Monday offering Osaka their support but the irony of him not taking questions afterwards was not lost on some.
""So the FFT handled the Ms Osaka mental health concerns without empathy or sensitivity. Then the FFT President refuses to take questions at a presser. An own goal,"" wrote former Australian tennis official Richard Ings.
Osaka earned US$55.2 million (S$72.9 million) over the past 12 months according to sports business website Sportico, much of it from sponsorship deals with major companies in Japan and the United States.
""Above everything else, we wish for Ms Naomi Osaka's quickest recovery and hope she will continue to perform well,"" Japanese sponsor Nissin Foods said in a statement.

The woman, 35, who had given birth to a baby girl five weeks earlier, added that her mind was not working and she had no idea what she was doing.
In October last year, she and her newborn daughter were pronounced dead at the foot of a housing unit block.
State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam said in her findings made available on Friday (May 28) that the mother's death served as ""yet another stark reminder of the devastating effects of postpartum depression"".
The coroner ruled the mother's death a suicide and said she had ""tragically perpetrated the unlawful killing of her infant daughter"".
The court heard that the woman was an account executive on maternity leave at the time of her death. She also had a four-year-old daughter.
At about 5pm on Oct 29 last year, a passer-by heard a loud thud coming from the back of the block and saw the baby lying on the ground. He then heard another loud thud and saw the mother on the ground.
He had not heard any commotion before this and called the police immediately.
The duo were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics and their cause of death was later determined to be multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height.
After the police were called, they found a mobile phone in the family's unit on the 10th floor. It contained a voice recording.
Her husband said the couple had a nanny after the baby was born last September, for the duration of the mother's confinement period.
Five days after the end of that period, the woman told her husband that she was stressed over having to take care of her two children and that she had forgotten how to do it.
He reassured her and said that he and his mother would take care of their elder daughter, and that she only had to rest and take care of the baby.
During her pregnancy, his wife had also expressed concerns about having to go back to work after her maternity leave.
After having the baby, she told him she wanted to quit her job. Her husband advised her to rest during her maternity leave and not think about work.
Her colleague and friend recalled her saying she did not know how to take care of babies any more and suspected she was suffering from postnatal depression, but added that she never expressed a desire to commit suicide.

In the voice message the woman left for her husband, she said that they should not have had the baby as she did not know how to take care of babies or their family.
Her mind was not working, she had no idea what she was doing, she was not a good mother and wife and had let them down, she added.
She asked her husband to take good care of their elder daughter and expressed regret that she would not be around to watch her grow up.
The woman concluded the message by saying that there was no other way as her mind was not working.
The state coroner said in her findings: ""(The woman's) husband responded by reassuring her and making some alternative care arrangements for their older child. Unfortunately, (her) concerns and anxiety persisted.""
She added that the pressures of caring for a newborn can be immense, with demands from managing the household and family while getting ready to return to work seemingly insurmountable.
It is important that new mothers and those around them understand the enormity of the stress, said the state coroner.
""Most of all, a good support network and genuine encouragement from family and friends are essential to help the new mum cope.""

Voices of youth: Let students take days off to improve mental well-being,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/voices-of-youth-let-students-take-days-off-to-improve-mental-well-being,"According to a 2016 survey by the Institute of Mental Health, one in seven people in Singapore has experienced a mental health disorder.
With more students facing stress and anxiety, the Ministry of Education should take action and prioritise students' mental health over academic performance.
Students should be offered mental health days to better their mental well-being. These are days when they can be excused from school, similar to when they are sick.
When feeling extremely stressed, anxious and overwhelmed at a level that hinders them from concentrating, they should be entitled to take a day off from school.
Students can take a break from their hectic school lives and engage in activities to boost their physical and mental wellness.
Missing curriculum time is likely to raise concerns about students falling behind in school work.
However, students can catch up by arranging consultations with their teachers when they return to school.
I believe that, in the long run, mental health days would be beneficial to students in helping them cope both mentally and academically.
Furthermore, it teaches students the importance of taking care of their mental health, which reduces stress and burnout.
Mental health is just as important as physical health.
Through mental health days, schools will raise more awareness and show more support for those struggling with their mental health.

"Tennis: Naomi Osaka fined US$15,000 after win, warned of French Open expulsion",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/tennis-osaka-fined-for-media-boycott-could-face-expulsion-from-french-open,"PARIS (REUTERS) – Naomi Osaka was fined US$15,000 (S$28,000) by Grand Slam organisers for skipping a news conference following her first-round win at the French Open on Sunday (May 30), and was also warned of possible expulsion from Roland Garros and future majors if she fails to meet her media commitments.
In the run up to the claycourt major, the world number two announced she would boycott news conferences while in Paris to raise awareness of players’ mental well-being, saying the nature of questions from journalists is like “kicking a person when they are down”.
Osaka started her French Open campaign with a 6-4 7-6(4) win over Romanian Patricia Maria Tig and then snubbed the post-match news conference, although the four-time Grand Slam champion did hold a court-side interview immediately after the contest.
The board of the four Grand Slams said in a statement on Sunday that the French Open organisers had asked Osaka to reconsider her position and tried unsuccessfully to speak with her to resolve the matter.
“The Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open jointly wrote to her to check on her well-being and offer support, underline their commitment to all athletes’ well-being and suggest dialogue,” the statement read.
“She was also reminded of her obligations, the consequences of not meeting them and that rules should equally apply to all players.
“Naomi Osaka today chose not to honour her contractual media obligations. The Roland Garros referee has therefore issued her a $15,000 fine.”
Osaka’s management did not immediately respond to a request for comment but the player published a cryptic message on Twitter.
“Anger is a lack of understanding. Change makes people uncomfortable,” she wrote.
anger is a lack of understanding. change makes people uncomfortable.
— NaomiOsaka大坂なおみ (@naomiosaka) May 30, 2021
The 23-year-old Japanese player, who lives in Florida, has never made it past the third round at Roland Garros and arrived in Paris having played only three matches on clay this season after early defeats in Madrid and Rome.
Osaka, who according to sports business website Sportico earned US$55.2 million over the past 12 months, has previously used her platform and considerable media attention to highlight issues of police violence and racial inequality.
Media duty
While announcing her decision on Twitter to boycott news conferences she said she hoped the “considerable amount” that she expected to forfeit as fines would go towards a mental health charity.
Rafa Nadal, a 20-times Grand Slam winner, and women’s world number one Ash Barty have said they believe players have a duty to address the media.
Seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Mats Wilander said on Sunday that Osaka should not play tournament tennis until she is ready to take part in post-match news conferences.
“We have advised Naomi Osaka that should she continue to ignore her media obligations during the tournament, she would be exposing herself to possible further Code of Conduct infringement consequences,” the board of the four Grand Slams added.

“As might be expected, repeat violations attract tougher sanctions including default from the tournament ... and the trigger of a major offence investigation that could lead to more substantial fines and future Grand Slam suspensions.” The board said it would be unfair to other players if Osaka refuses to face the press while others honour their commitments.
“We will see how everything will end up,” two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova said after her win in the opening round. “But me personally, I was always trying to follow the rules and be fair not only on the court but off the court as well. Now it’s up to them to decide what’s going to be.”
Osaka showed no signs of being distracted by the issue during her opening match on a sun-bathed Philippe Chatrier court, however.
Asked in her courtside interview about how she adapts her game to the surface, Osaka said: “It’s a work in progress. Hopefully the more I play the better I play.” “I’m really glad that I won. It’s a beautiful court. I’ve only played two matches here (on Philippe Chatrier), one before the roof and one now, so hopefully I’ll keep it going.”

Migrant workers worried about Covid-19 back home can seek counselling: Tan See Leng,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/counselling-provided-to-migrant-workers-worried-about-covid-19-back-home-tan-see-leng,"SINGAPORE - Counselling is being provided to migrant workers who are concerned and worried about the well-being of their loved ones in their home countries, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Sunday (May 23) during a virtual May Day celebration for workers.
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as HealthServe and the Migrant Workers' Centre are attending to the counselling needs of workers, many of whom come from India and Bangladesh, he said.
Other NGOs, such as My Brother SG, have also been working with the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group to produce and distribute booklets on mental health to migrant workers across dormitories, said Dr Tan.
""We are grateful for the show of support from all our community partners, who often go the extra mile for our migrant workers,"" he said in a pre-recorded video message in the event, which was organised by the National Trades Union Congress.
He added that with the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in the community, there was a need to remain vigilant to protect migrant workers. Aside from going to work, they are still mostly not allowed to leave their places of residence.
Non-essential activities outside of the dormitories will be ""limited"", said Dr Tan.
""To aid our migrant workers in fulfilling essential needs, we will work with employers and dormitory operators to facilitate access to supplies, remittance and telco services,"" he added.
To keep workers engaged, the ACE Group is working with community partners to organise virtual activities such as online contests and courses.
""Our MOM officers are also on the lookout for distressed migrant workers who may require assistance,"" said Dr Tan.
During the live stream, workers tuned in from their dormitories to watch song-and-dance performances by artists from China, Myanmar and fellow migrant workers in Singapore.
About 20,000 care packs with items such as face masks, towels, hand sanitisers, vitamin D tablets and other toiletries will be distributed to workers at a later date than planned because of the current Covid-19 measures.

"Traumatised by Israeli bombing, Gaza children scared of dying",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/traumatised-by-israeli-bombing-gaza-children-scared-of-dying,"GAZA CITY, PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES (AFP) - When an Israeli air strike targeted a security office near her home in Gaza this month, 10-year-old Zeina Dabous frantically scribbled a note and slipped it under her mother's pillow.
""Mummy, my love, I am very, very scared. If we all die, put us in the same grave all together so I can stay in your arms,"" she wrote.
""I want to wear my Eid clothes,"" she added, of the outfit she never got to wear for the Muslim celebration after Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian enclave started on May 10.
The 11-day bombing campaign came in response to rocket fire from Gaza by Hamas and other militants, triggered by an Israeli police crackdown on worshippers at east Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound.
Though a ceasefire has halted the air raids since Friday (May 21), experts warn that children in the besieged coastal strip will likely carry the mental scars for years to come.
Psychologists say many are showing signs of depression, anxiety, behavioural disorders or irritability, and many are wetting their bed.
At home in Gaza city just before the bombing stopped, Zeina said she was constantly petrified and barely sleeping.
""They're always bombing,"" she told Agence France-Presse.
After a strike hit very close, ""before sleeping I wrote a note in red pen to my mother and slipped it under the pillow because I was scared I would die"", she said.
Zeina is one of around a million children living in Gaza, according to the UN's children agency Unicef.
Israeli strikes on Gaza killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and have wounded another 1,900 people, the Gaza Health Ministry says.
Rockets and other fire from Gaza have claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, an Israeli soldier, one Indian, and two Thai nationals, medics say. Some 357 people in Israel have been wounded.

Gaza truce between Israel and Hamas takes hold after 11 days of fighting
There is controversy over how many of those killed in Gaza were combatants, and how many were civilians.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's bombing campaign had killed ""more than 200 terrorists"" in Gaza.
'Don't be scared'
Israeli air strikes also pounded the densely populated enclave in the periods from 2008 to 2009, in 2012 and 2014.
When the last war raged, Zeina was no older than four.
""A whole generation of children has been ravaged by repeated conflicts,"" said Zeina's grandfather Saeed Dabous.
The charity Save the Children on Friday warned that children in Gaza would suffer for years to come.
They ""are suffering from fear and anxiety, a lack of sleep, and are displaying worrying signs of distress, such as constant shaking and bedwetting"", it said.
In their grandfather's home, Ms Maysa Abu al-Awf, 22, held her two-year-old brother Ahmad on her lap and tried to comfort him after they lost two sisters and dozens of relatives in a devastating air strike.
""I'm scared, I'm scared,"" Ahmad constantly repeated, a scab on his hand and stitches on his bare foot.

Ms Maysa said that whenever he heard an explosion, he cried out. ""I tell him, 'don't be scared, it's just the sound of balloons popping'.""
After air strikes demolished their four-storey family home in Gaza city on Sunday last week, Ms Maysa, little Ahmad and their sister Maram, who is seven, screamed for hours under the rubble before they were rescued.
Their two sisters - 20-year-old dentistry student Shaima and 17-year-old school pupil Rawan - did not survive.
Sitting beside her grandfather, Maram shook as she recounted being trapped under the rubble.
""I called out for Mummy... I called for them to get me out,"" she said.
At the site of her demolished home, AFP saw Maram's favourite red teddy bear lying in the debris, foam spilling from its left leg.
""I am sad,"" Maram said. ""All my books and notebooks were burnt.""
'Catastrophic number'
In the Gaza Strip's main Shifa hospital, their 16-year-old cousin Omar was in shock after the same strike killed his two brothers and father, who was the head of internal medicine at the facility.
He had stopped talking, his family said.
During Israel's latest military campaign on the coastal strip, which is home to two million people, the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) posted advice for parents on Facebook.
It told them to discuss feelings with their children, but also to try to distract them from the sounds of war with games, drawing or prayers.
There is no overall tally of how many children are suffering from mental health issues in Gaza due to repeated conflict, the GCMHP says.

Facing the shadow during a pandemic of fear,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/facing-the-shadow-during-a-pandemic-of-fear,"Over these past weeks, especially for those in Singapore with Indian connections, the unending pandemic distress and India's high number of fatalities have brought new anxiety.
Just when it seemed glimmers of hope were discerned, not only has Singapore returned to partial restrictions, but also, for many Indian nationals here, hardly a day passes without news from their homeland of yet another death. Even if one is not individually close to them, many of these fatalities are at the end of a chain of relationships chillingly near the personal domain.
Some countries, such as Britain, with large swathes of their population now vaccinated, appear to be on the upswing and emerging from lockdown, but others seem to be spiralling downwards.
No matter where one lives in the world, everyone is asking - when will this end and also, why is this catastrophe happening?
Depending on one's philosophy or religious conviction, the answer seems to be either that the pandemic is the wrath of God visited upon a degraded and unprincipled world; the unleashed madness of unethical scientific experimentation; or the result of the unbridled egoistical folly of collective human pride. Possibly, something of all these explanations and more have conspired together at this time.
If we look to Indian cosmology, it is said the world goes through repeated celestial cycles of Utopian and Dystopian epochs. Unfortunately, according to these ancient teachings, we are now in the last phase of Kali Yuga, our present dismal cycle, ""the age of darkness, the age of vice and misery"". Hindus believe civilisation degenerates spiritually during this bleak phase, and each individual cycle is said to last a very long time; Kali Yuga, which began 5,122 years ago, stretches through 432,000 years. If that is so, then we have a long way to go, and it is not a happy thought.
Rise of violence and hate
Fear defeats more people than any other thing in the world, said philosopher and writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. At this moment, while we face a deadly pandemic, we also face a pandemic of fear.
There are those whose bravery is saving lives, but there are also those for whom fear now dominates life. As media platforms churn out the latest death tolls and other abysmal information, the constant feeling of being under threat affects us all. Constricted by the fear of contagion, we become more conformist and tribalistic, less accepting of outsiders or anything unconventional.
This fear is reflected in the rise of violence everywhere, particularly gun violence in the United States, violence towards the planet that sustains us, violence towards women, and xenophobic attacks on Asians in many places, including a recent incident of racist assault on an Indian in Singapore.
A global crisis of domestic violence has left many women trapped in lockdowns with their abusers, and political tensions are globally high with the rise of autocratic leaders spouting a culture of lies and control.
Unacceptable economic disparity is leading to aggressive confrontations on multiple levels everywhere in the world.
Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh writes: ""We have a great, habitual fear inside ourselves. We're afraid of many things - of our own death, of losing loved ones, of change, of being alone.""
All these fears belong to our shadow self, that buried area of uncomfortable personal emotional baggage we all carry deep in our subconscious.
Carl Jung, the great Swiss psychiatrist who spent his life studying this shadow, believed that, just as we have our own personal shadow self, humanity as a whole has a collective unconscious shadow.
In its darkness is contained all the past and present knowledge and experiences human beings share as a people, all the atrocities, cruelties, tragedies and horror perpetrated by humankind over the ages, and stored at an unconscious cellular level.
Jung viewed the two world wars as an eruption of this darkness, like a volcano when the pressure within becomes too great. If he were alive today, he would probably trace the flood of pandemic horror to our collective shadow.

Changing for the better
Yet, it is the presence of this very same shadow, both individually and collectively, that makes us human. In a slim book published in 1933, In Praise Of Shadows, Japanese writer Junichiro Tanizaki wrote: ""We find beauty not in the thing itself but in the patterns of shadows, the light and the darkness, that one thing against another creates... Were it not for shadows, there would be no beauty.""
To understand both the beauty and the darkness of our world, a collective change in our lives and attitudes is needed, a new paradigm by which to live, of mutual tolerance and respect. As a shower of rain falls to earth in billions of droplets, so the same essence of life fills us all - human, animal, insect, bird and plant.
Thich Nhat Hanh tells us that ""all mental formations - including compassion, love, fear, sorrow and despair - are organic in nature. We don't need to be afraid of any of them, because transformation is always possible"".
In 1902, Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke, writing to a young friend, stressed that it is our inability to understand our higher purpose in life that is the problem. ""That which we call destiny goes forth from within people, not from without into them. Only because so many have not absorbed their destinies and transmuted them within themselves while they were living in them, have they not recognised what has gone forth out of them...""

The world is now focused on controlling the coronavirus, as indeed it must, through vaccination and restrictive measures. Yet, if we push the emotional damage of our pandemic back into the shadow without the integration and healing needed to eradicate deeper scars, then we will all have suffered for nought. We must not retreat before the difficulties ahead.
In a world beset with overwhelming challenges, the growing problem of ""othering"" is now a major destructive force - from the Proud Boys in America, to the present conflagration between Israel and Palestine, to the recent xenophobic attacks on Asians in the US and Indians in Singapore.
In an article in The Atlantic in 2016, then US President Barack Obama was quoted as saying that the stresses of globalisation and the collision of cultures have led to the establishment of a default position in the world, in which things are organised by ""tribe - us/them, a hostility towards the unfamiliar or the unknown"", and the need to ""push back or strike out against those who are different"".
According to Jung, however, when the shadow is faced and explored, it is impossible to say others are wrong, for whatever is wrong in the world is found also in oneself.
If we each deal with our own personal shadow, then slowly society can be changed. Transformation is what the world needs now at this historic time, and in spite of everything, thankfully there are many who are working towards that.

Lady Gaga says she was pregnant after sexual assault at age 19,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/lady-gaga-says-she-was-pregnant-after-sexual-assault-at-age-19,"American pop star Lady Gaga has revealed that she became pregnant after she was raped at the age of 19.
The 35-year-old singer was the guest on the first episode of The Me You Can't See, a new docuseries co-created and produced by Britain's Prince Harry and talk show host Oprah Winfrey.
The series, which launched on streaming service Apple TV+ on Friday (May 21), features interviews with celebrities about their struggles with mental health .
""I was 19 years old, and I was working in the business, and a producer said to me, 'Take your clothes off,'"" Lady Gaga told Winfrey.
""I said no, and I left, and they told me they were gonna burn all my music.""
She recalled in tears: ""And they didn't stop. They didn't stop asking me and I just froze and I just… I don't even remember.""
Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, would not name the producer.
""I understand this #MeToo movement, I understand that some people feel really comfortable with this, and I do not,"" she said.
""I do not ever want to face that person again. This system is so abusive, it's so dangerous.""
She first went public about her sexual assault in a radio interview on The Howard Stern Show in December 2014. Two years later, she revealed that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
On The Me You Can't See show, she recounted that several years after she was raped, she went to a hospital for chronic pain and was surprised when she was treated by a psychiatrist instead of a medical doctor.
""I said why is there a psych here, I can't feel my body,"" she said. ""First I felt full on pain, then I went numb and then I was sick for weeks and weeks and weeks after.""
She continued: ""And I realised that it was the same pain that I felt when the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on a corner, at my parent's house. Because I was vomiting and sick. Because I had been being abused. I was locked away in a studio for months.""
She said the trauma led to ""a total psychotic break"" for a few years, which was still plaguing her when she won the Oscar for Best Original Song for Shallow in 2019.
The song is featured in 2018's A Star Is Born and a duet with her co-star Bradley Cooper, who also directed the film.
Lady Gaga said the improvement in her mental health was ""a slow rise"" and not a ""straight line"".
""Even if I have six brilliant months, all it takes is getting triggered once to feel bad,"" she said.
It took her 2½ years to recover as she ""learned all the ways to pull myself out of it"".
She added: ""It all started to slowly change.""

And she is not alone in her experience. Results from the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on Friday (May 21), found that one in 43 of those aged 18 and up here has had a psychotic disorder in their lifetime.
This translates to about 71,600 people.
The study was conducted on 6,126 participants, representing the population, between 2016 and 2018 in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Nanyang Technological University. It was funded by MOH and Temasek Foundation
It is the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of psychotic disorders in the Singapore resident population aged 18 years and above, the factors associated with such disorders and the treatment gap for the disorders.
Psychotic disorders may involve one or more of the following:
- Delusions, which are the fixed belief in something that is not true.
- Hallucinations, which are sensations that are not real, such as seeing things that are not there.
- Disorganised thoughts, making a person's speech difficult to follow with no logical connection.
- Abnormal motor behaviour, which includes inappropriate or bizarre postures, or a complete lack of response to instructions.

The most common psychotic disorder in Singapore was schizophrenia, with about one in 116 - or 26,800 people - having been diagnosed with it at some point in their lives.
This condition comes with a wide array of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganised behaviour, social withdrawal and attention impairment.
The study found that the average age of onset of psychotic disorders here was 23.1 years, and that those with such conditions were 4.3 times more likely to be unemployed - although the researchers could not say for sure that this was directly caused by their condition.
At least 80.4 per cent of those with such conditions had sought help for their symptoms.
Professor Chong Siow Ann, senior consultant at the Research Division and Department of Psychosis at IMH and principal investigator of the study, said that while psychotic disorders are not as common as other mental health conditions, the extent of impairment and disabilities - including death - caused by psychotic disorders can be considerably greater.
""The publication of this study is a timely reminder as we commemorate World Schizophrenia Day on May 24 that early detection and intervention can make a big difference in relieving the distress and suffering of the tens of thousands of people afflicted, and (who) will be afflicted, with these disorders,"" he added.

'I thought the tv was talking to me'
For those living with a psychotic disorder, the experience can be very distressing.
Marilyn (not her real name) was 20 years old when she began experiencing symptoms of schizoaffective disorder.
Those with this condition have symptoms of schizophrenia as well as a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder.
Now 30, the housewife told ST that her rush of thoughts used to keep her up for days.
She said: ""My mind tried to link things that were not connected - it'd affect my thinking, so I couldn't speak properly, I couldn't have a proper conversation with my family.
""When I watched TV, I'd think that it was talking about me and my family, and that could mean that something bad may happen to my family members. So I got very scared and worried, and my thoughts would run wild.""
Ms Lai, who is currently unemployed, and started manifesting symptoms of a psychotic disorder around the age of 18, had similar experiences in the past.
She said: ""I thought that people were looking at me from the HDB block opposite, and when I went out I thought that people were pointing at me.
""I wanted to dash across the road - the voices (in my head) were saying that the cars would not hit me, and I was running away from something.""
The lack of understanding of mental health conditions made it even harder to cope, said Ms Lai.
""When I was having symptoms of depression, I didn't know what was going on. People thought I had an attitude problem… some teachers even said I was wasting space in the school,"" she said, adding that she did not even know she had a mental health condition at that time.

Living a normal life is possible, with help
Dr Charmaine Tang, chief of the Department of Psychosis at IMH, said early intervention is key to helping those with psychotic disorders cope with their conditions.
""While schizophrenia and psychotic disorders are serious and chronic conditions, medications and psychosocial therapy can help people manage these conditions, recover and lead normal, fulfilling lives,"" she said.
She added that when a person is more stable, individual and family therapy, social skills training, vocational rehabilitation and supported employment, as well as the support of family and friends, play a big role too.
Ms Lai now takes a monthly injection to manage her symptoms, and has been largely symptom-free for the last three to four years apart from periodic bouts of depression, which she is able to manage on her own.
Up till recently she worked in the special needs sector and as a peer support specialist, drawing on her own experiences to support those with mental health conditions.
Marilyn experienced a total of three psychotic breaks from 2010 till now, and was admitted to IMH for a short period of time on each occasion.
But with the help of medical support, she has managed to lead a relatively normal life, working as an accountant for seven years, getting married in 2017, and recently becoming a mother to a one-year-old child.
'We're not crazy people'
Ms Lai said it has been heartening to see a general increase in mental health awareness in Singapore in recent years.
However, both she and Marilyn noted that there are still misconceptions surrounding psychotic disorders.
Ms Lai said that people tend to think someone with schizoaffective disorder has multiple personalities - which is incorrect - or is dangerous.
""From my experience, people with this condition are more likely to be harmed than harm people,"" she said, adding that she hopes to see greater efforts in mental health education and more opportunities for people with mental health issues to integrate into society.
Such harm may take the form of discrimination when applying for jobs or to schools, leading them to miss out on opportunities in life.
This in turn perpetuates stigma about those with mental health conditions, said Ms Lai.
Marilyn said: ""A lot of times, people think that those with this condition cannot be cured, and it's the end for them. They also think it means they have to stay in hospital on a long-term basis.""
But she added that her experience shows this is not the case.
She said: ""We can lead a normal life as well with proper medication and intervention.
""Stigma against those with mental health conditions still exists in Singapore. I hope that people here can learn more about these conditions and reduce this stigma, because we are able to lead normal lives - we're not crazy people.""",Timothy Goh,TRUE
Forum: Recognise role of counsellors in mental health ecosystem as well,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-recognise-role-of-counsellors-in-mental-health-ecosystem-as-well,"Marine Parade GRC MP Seah Kian Peng asked about the ratio of mental health professionals to the resident population in Singapore in Parliament last week.
In then Health Minister Gan Kim Yong's response, only psychiatrists and psychologists were mentioned.
The omission of counsellors could give the impression that we are not an integral part of the mental health ecosystem, when in fact counsellors contribute significantly to the psychological well-being of Singaporeans of all ages and backgrounds, and are often the first professional points of contact for those experiencing psychological distress.
Counsellors serve an important role in almost every community and institutional setting.
For example, the Ministry of Education has laudably ensured that every public school has at least one resident counsellor.
It was also reported that the National Care Hotline (manned by volunteers, many of whom are counsellors) launched in April last year received more than 6,600 calls in close to three weeks (Over 6,600 calls made to National Care Hotline, April 30, 2020).
And counsellors provide crucial support in crisis and suicide situations through avenues such as the Samaritans of Singapore.
More corporate organisations are also providing employee assistance programmes for their staff.
I have observed more Singaporeans - especially among the younger generation - wanting to become trained counsellors, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic began.
More than a thousand people have graduated with master's level qualifications in counselling from my counselling school, and the school is continuing to see more enrolments.
This growth in interest bodes well for the building of Singapore's capacity to support people's mental health needs.
I hope the Government will give more formal recognition to the counselling profession to continue enhancing Singapore's psychological resilience.
This would not only encourage more people to acquire mental health support skills, but also assure those who suffer in silence that professional help is just a phone call away.

"TikTok to work with Govt, non-profits to train youths to be mental health content creators",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/tiktok-to-work-with-government-local-non-profits-to-train-youths-to-become-mental-health,"SINGAPORE - Young people here can now apply to join a training programme to learn how to support others with mental health issues through content creation on the video-sharing platform TikTok.
As part of its Youth for Good initiative, TikTok will be running an eight-week training programme from June 28 to Aug 22.
The programme aims to teach young people to create educational content and to provide support to their peers who are struggling with their mental health, said TikTok in a statement.
To provide the training, the app has partnered with local non-profit organisations including Campus PSY, Care Corner, Care Singapore, Fei Yue Community Services, Samaritans of Singapore, Silver Ribbon (Singapore), and Touch Community Services for their expertise.
It will teach users which stigmatising words to avoid, how to notice and respond to early signs and symptoms of mental health issues in peers, how to tackle online harassment and cyber bullying and also share tips to take care of the trainees' own online well-being.
Applications opened last Friday (May 14) and will close at the end of the month, and are open to Singaporeans between the ages of 19 and 34.
The programme was launched at a panel discussion titled Conversations Without Walls, which was held live on the TikTok app last Friday.
The panel comprised Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling, TikTok's Asia-Pacific head of regional product policy, trust & safety Jamin Tan, assistant director of Touch Mental Wellness Andrea Chan and TikTok user and mental health advocate Yanni Ruth.
It was moderated by TikTok user and Singapore Management University (SMU) student Ian Jeevan.
The panel shared about their own experiences working with young people and mental health, along with some of their owns struggles with issues such as eating disorders. They also spoke on the need to reduce the stigma surrounding speaking up about mental health.
Ms Sun said: ""We are placing a lot of emphasis on teaching students the telltale signs that their mental health is at risk... very importantly, we are trying to normalise these conversations in schools.""
TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among young people worldwide.
However, mental health content on the app has been characterised as oversimplifying complex issues in mental health.
In January, The New York Times (NYT) reported that therapists like licensed professional counsellor and former southern region chairman at the American Counselling Association Lisa Henderson were concerned that on TikTok, where videos are necessarily short, mental health treatments can be presented easy fixes.
""It can be misleading more so than intentionally harmful,"" she told NYT.

Forum: Don't want others to go through pain of anorexia,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-dont-want-others-to-go-through-pain-of-anorexia,"As someone who has suffered from anorexia and still has the mindset of a patient, here is my take.
For those suffering from anorexia, there are usually catalysts in their lives that make them feel this way.
For me, it was my cousins. It started with name-calling when I was five. They called me zhu rou bao, or pork bun, just because they were skinnier than me.
I started to doubt myself and had this idea that I was really fat.
This remark was further ingrained when my relatives agreed with the sentiment. To them, it was just a remark. But it meant much more to me.
I started losing weight in Primary 3. My relatives, the same people who had called me chubby, noticed the difference and said ""you lost weight"".
It made me secretly happy and amplified my drive to continue this vicious circle. Every day, I would just have a drink for breakfast, skip lunch and have a small dinner. This was during a period of growth and development.
When I was in Primary 5, my parents finally noticed the extremes I went to in avoiding food.
My mum tricked me, telling me she was taking me to visit a doctor, but took me to the emergency ward instead. That day, I was diagnosed with anorexia and had to be admitted and force-fed.
The hospital was not equipped to handle such cases. I was strapped to the bed against my will. I still remember the doctor forcing my head down and draining out all that I had drunk earlier.
It was night when he shoved a 1m-long tube through my nostril to my stomach. The tube got stuck in my larynx and I felt really uncomfortable and teared up.
This was the start of my trauma and I still have scars. I was in the hospital for a month.
I am now 24 years old. Have I suffered? Yes. Do I want others to go through the same pain? No. I am not the first or the last to experience this.
I am currently working as an artist. Art is my passion, and I want to use it to educate others who may be suffering in silence.

"Lady Gaga, Glenn Close join Prince Harry and Oprah Winfrey for mental health TV series",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/lady-gaga-glenn-close-join-prince-harry-and-oprah-winfrey-for-mental-health-tv,"LONDON (REUTERS) - Britain's Prince Harry and American chat show queen Oprah Winfrey will premiere their television documentary series on mental health issues later this month, with singer Lady Gaga and actress Glenn Close among those contributing.
The Me You Can't See series, co-created and produced by Harry and Winfrey, will feature stories from high-profile guests and others across the world about mental health and emotional well-being issues, Apple TV+, the streaming service which will air the programmes from May 21, said on Monday (May 10).
Winfrey, 67, said the series aimed to spark a global conversation, and replace the shame surrounding mental health with wisdom and compassion. Among those participating will also be basketball players DeMar DeRozan from the San Antonio Spurs and Langston Galloway from the Phoenix Suns, Apple said.
""The majority of us carry some form of unresolved trauma, loss, or grief, which feels - and is - very personal,"" Harry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, said in a statement.
""Yet the last year has shown us that we are all in this together, and my hope is that this series will show there is power in vulnerability, connection in empathy, and strength in honesty.""
The prince, the sixth-in-line to the throne, has publicly spoken of his own mental health battles and dealing with the grief of the death of his mother Princess Diana who was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997 when he was just 12.
In March, he was named first chief impact officer of BetterUp, a service that provides employee coaching and mental health assistance.
The TV series is one of the first ventures by Harry, 36, since he and his wife Meghan, 39, stepped down from official royal duties and moved to California to forge new independent careers. The couple have also signed deals to deliver programming for Netflix and to produce and host podcasts for Spotify.
It also comes after the couple's explosive TV interview with Winfrey two months ago, which included Meghan accusing one unnamed royal of making a racist comment about their son Archie before he was born and plunged the monarchy into its biggest crisis in decades.

How achievement-oriented parents and schools stress out kids,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/how-achievement-oriented-parents-and-schools-stress-out-kids,"(NYTIMES) When schools shut down last spring, Carson Roubison, a charter school student in Phoenix, Arizona, was initially relieved. There were some difficulties in those early days at home - when classes went online, Carson and his parents, both public school teachers, had to share the sole family computer. But Carson's stress levels fell as school became less demanding during the transition to distance learning.
""I wasn't aware of the giant impact the pandemic would have,"" he said, ""so I was excited, to be honest, to have some time off school."" But things changed in autumn. The academic load went back to pre-pandemic levels even though learning was still remote. Carson, a senior, struggled to stay motivated. His mental health suffered. He hoped to attend community college the following autumn, but grew increasingly ""terrified"" that the education he'd received in high school over the past year would leave him unprepared.
""I'm afraid I'm going to get to community college,"" he said, ""and be held to the same standards as past students, and fail. That's the biggest source of my anxiety.""
Carson's story is not unique. The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of millions. But adolescents have been hit especially hard. According to a national poll in the United States conducted in January by the University of Michigan's C. S. Mott Children's Hospital, 46 per cent of parents say their teenagers' mental health has worsened during the pandemic. More alarmingly, a report by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention found that the proportion of 12- to 17-year-olds visiting emergency rooms for mental health reasons rose 31 per cent for most of last year compared with 2019. And this is all on top of an already existing mental health crisis among young people.
While many experts believe that the reason adolescents are struggling today is that they're away from friends and school, a closer look at the research reveals a more complicated picture.
According to psychologists who study adolescent resilience, one of the biggest threats to the well-being of today's teenagers is not social isolation but something else - the pressure to achieve, which has intensified over the past year.
Psychologists define resilience as the ability to adapt well to stress. For decades, they have studied why some children are more resilient in adversity than others. Dr Suniya Luthar, emerita professor of psychology at Columbia University's Teachers College and a leading resilience researcher, believes the pandemic is a ""natural experiment"" that can help answer that question: When you expose adolescents to an event that changes their lives significantly, how do they cope?
Dr Luthar began her career studying resilience among urban youth living in poverty in Connecticut in the 1990s. At the urging of one of her students at Yale University, where she was teaching, she also started studying teenagers living in middle- and upper middle-class suburbs like Westport, Connecticut, where many of the parents are high-achieving professionals who emphasise the value of status and achievement to their children.
Comparing these students with the poor, urban adolescents, she was shocked to discover that the suburban children were doing worse on drug and alcohol abuse. They also had higher rates of anxiety and depression compared with national norms. Researchers knew that social conditions were important determinants of resilience, but they hadn't known that living in success-oriented cultures was a risk factor.
In the years since, Dr Luthar and her colleagues at Authentic Connections, a research group that works to foster resilience in school communities, have studied tens of thousands of teenagers attending ""high-achieving schools"", which she defines as public and private institutions where students on average score in the top third on standardised tests. The students in these samples come from a variety of racial, regional and socioeconomic backgrounds.
In one group of students Dr Luthar studied, for example, one-third were members of ethnic and racial minorities and one-quarter came from homes where at least one parent did not attend college.
But regardless of these differences, many of them were struggling in the same way. In a paper published last year in the academic journal American Psychologist, Dr Luthar and her colleagues - psychological researchers Nina Kumar and Nicole Zillmer - reviewed three decades' worth of research findings showing that adolescents at high-achieving schools suffer from symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety at rates three to seven times higher than national norms for children their age.
What's driving their misery, the research shows, is the pressure to excel in multiple academic and extracurricular pursuits. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation suggest children living in an achievement-oriented culture are at risk of adjustment problems, like those facing more predictable forms of adversity, such as poverty and trauma.
The pandemic offered a rare reprieve for students - at first. Since 2019, Dr Luthar and her colleagues have surveyed thousands of adolescents each year at public and private schools across the nation. Replicating findings of earlier research, these students reported suffering from anxiety and depression at higher rates than national norms before the pandemic.
But when schools closed last spring, something unexpected happened - the well-being of these students actually improved. As classes and exams were cancelled, grading moved to pass/fail and extracurricular activity ceased, they reported lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression compared with 2019.

But these improvements were short-lived. Dr Luthar and her colleagues found that, beginning in autumn last year, as school work was ramped back up, the mental health of adolescents returned to pre-pandemic levels or worse. According to research that will be published in Social Policy Report, a quarterly publication of the Society for Research in Child Development, the strongest predictor of depression among these students was perceived parental criticism and unreachable standards.
""Even though I'm trying my best, it never really goes the way I wished,"" a student Dr Luthar studied wrote, ""and my mother adds stress because she is always saying that I need to have a 90 or higher averages in all my classes.""
Other research supports these findings. In a nationally representative study conducted by NBC News and Challenge Success, a nonprofit affiliated with Stanford University's education school, researchers studied more than 10,000 high school students in autumn last year. Comparing the experience of these students with about 65,000 adolescents surveyed between 2018 and February last year, these researchers, too, found that many students reported feeling more stressed about school during autumn last year than before the pandemic. A chief cause of their stress: the pressure to achieve.
Nearly half of all students reported that the pressure to do well in school had increased since 2019, and more than half said their school-related stress overall had risen. Grades, workload, time management, lack of sleep and college fears were the most commonly cited sources of stress.
These findings held across socioeconomically diverse schools. At under-resourced schools, students were more likely to report being stressed about family finances, according to Dr Denise Pope, a founder of Challenge Success, but the top stressors were still grades, assessments and college.

How not to handle stress in kids
""My school is giving too much work,"" a 10th-grader in this study wrote, ""even though times are tough for everyone. At first, this was just a break from school, but now all I feel is stress, anxiety, and pain.""
Parents appear to play a big role in this phenomenon. Fifty-seven per cent of students said that their parents' expectations for their performance stayed the same during the pandemic, while 34 per cent said their expectations increased. The stereotype of the adolescent aloof from parental influence doesn't seem to apply to these students, who report feeling more stressed about family pressure than peer pressure.
When Dr Pope asks parents to define success, they inevitably say that they want their children to be happy and healthy, have loving relationships and give back to society. But when she asks children how they define success, many describe a narrow path: getting good grades, going to college and securing a high-paying job.
Dr Pope believes the gap is due in part to how parents praise their children. Many parents reward their children when they perform well, which sends a signal to them that the approval and love of their parents depends on how much they're achieving. So, inevitably, if they believe they are falling short of their parents' expectations, their sense of worth and well-being suffers.
Larger cultural forces are also pushing students to define success narrowly. As inequality rises and two major recessions in the past decade have left millions out of work, many students may feel compelled to climb the ladder to ensure their economic security as adults. College admissions at top-tiered schools have become more selective over the same period of time, leaving students competing harder for fewer spots - only to receive an education that will likely leave them or their parents in debt for many years to come.
If we want more resilient children coming out of the pandemic, then we need to heed a lesson of this past year - that the pressure to achieve is crushing the spirits of many young people and should be dialled back.

Parents can play a vital role here. They can help ease their children's anxiety by reminding them that where they attend college will not make or break them - and that getting Bs does not equal failure.
They can encourage them to prioritise their health and well-being by getting enough sleep and making time for play and leisure. And, above all, they can teach their children that loss is an inevitable part of life by speaking to them about the grief of the past year.
This doesn't mean parents should necessarily lower their standards. But they might emphasise different benchmarks for achievement, like those they themselves claim to most value for their children - happiness, health and love.

How to make your small talk big,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/how-to-make-your-small-talk-big,"(NYTIMES) - We've forgotten how to talk to people.
For more than a year, we have mostly been apart. We've learnt to put a premium on efficiency, whether in masked exchanges on street corners or on work calls between distractions. We talk fast and abruptly shift from greetings to agenda-driven updates. Then we replay it when we're back in isolation. Our entire social lives have become a middle school dance: unrealistic expectations in the lead-up, self-conscious regrets in the aftermath.

"Hold toxic managers accountable, drop useless meetings: Commerce chamber CEO on workplace mental wellness",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/hold-toxic-managers-accountable-drop-useless-meetings-commerce-chamber-ceo-on,"SINGAPORE - The Covid-19 pandemic has had a transforming impact on society and those who denied or ignored the importance of mental health came to experience such issues for themselves when it struck, chief executive of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce Victor Mills said on Tuesday (May 4).
Speaking virtually at the Silver Ribbon Mental Health Awards Ceremony for Employers 2021, which was held over Zoom, the Singaporean added that mental health issues should not be treated as a weakness.
Mr Mills, who was in financial services for three decades and previously sat on the Board of Trustees of ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, provided some steps companies here can take towards promoting mental wellness in the workplace.
""Treating mental illness in the workforce starts with eliminating all possible stress triggers. Toxic managers should be held accountable, and sent for help. Root out purposeless meetings, don't call your colleagues after office hours, and certainly not on weekends, unless it's an emergency,"" he said.
Mr Mills added that staff should also not be expected to respond to an e-mail ""at some ungodly hour"".
""Don't treat mental health issues as a weakness. We expect others to be considerate of us. And here's a newsflash: They expect the same consideration from us.""
He said it is now time to put to use the lessons learnt.
""We must all be prepared to build on the momentum which the pandemic has provided and not waste this moment in history to make meaningful changes to how we as societies and businesses treat mental illness.""
Tuesday's inaugural ceremony saw 12 companies recognised for their efforts in creating a mentally healthy working environment in various ways.
These include offering job opportunities to persons with mental health issues, equipping their staff with knowledge on identifying mental health issues, and promoting positive mental health awareness at their workplace.
Jardines Mindset was one of 12 companies named.
The registered charity for the Jardines group has hired about 230 people with mental health conditions over the past 10 years, and helped place another 310 in organisations outside the group.
Its chief executive officer, Mr Jeffery Tan, told The Straits Times that some people have the misconception that hiring a person with a mental health condition will disadvantage an organisation.
He said hiring such people actually ""makes the organisation receive more in return"", as it gives others the opportunity to understand that those with mental health challenges are just like anybody else.
""It also gives us an opportunity to journey alongside individuals to see how they improve and integrate to the office environment, and gives you an opportunity to display empathy as well,"" he added.

Ms Ang Li May, chief executive officer of non-profit Bizlink Centre Singapore, said it is important to have a culture where people understand each other's working styles and help those with mental health conditions to feel comfortable in the workplace.
""It's about how we help them to cope if there's a project coming in (or) a more stressful period,"" she said.
A spokesman for global mining group Rio Tinto said that the group believes investing in mental health and wellness programmes and committing to an inclusive environment is ""not only the right thing to do, but it is also good for business"".
""The pandemic has shown that anyone can be vulnerable to the unintended mental health impacts brought about by Covid-19 mitigation measures. Employers need to understand that even employees who may not suffer from mental health conditions may be impacted during their time under employment,"" said the spokesman.
Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad, who was at the ceremony, said that mental well-being at the workplace has become a growing concern, especially as employees face changes in working arrangements due to the pandemic.
""It is therefore encouraging to see companies doing their part to care for and support their employees' mental well-being - and that we recognise these efforts through initiatives like the Silver Ribbon Awards,"" he added.

He said that supporting the mental well-being of workers is a priority for the Government, citing several recent efforts such as the launch of the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces in November last year, and the launch of the iWorkHealth tool two months ago.
iWorkHealth is an online self-administered psychosocial health assessment tool for companies and their employees to identify stressors at work.
Mr Zaqy said: ""I want to emphasise that mental health is just as important as physical health - and it can have a significant impact on workers' productivity.

Mental wellness an important issue amid Covid-19 pandemic: Shanmugam,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mental-wellness-an-important-issue-amid-covid-19-pandemic-shanmugam,"SINGAPORE - With lockdowns sparked by Covid-19 imposing severe constraints on people globally, mental wellness has been an important issue and will be even more so going forward, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam on Saturday (May 1).
In Singapore, there are different facets to the issue, given the urban environment, the hectic lifestyle, as well as an ageing population.
""It is something that all of us have to actively get involved in,"" said Mr Shanmugam, who joined the board members of charity Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) on a short walk at the Botanic Gardens with several canine companions.
The walk is part of a larger campaign by CAL to raise awareness about mental health and the challenges faced by caregivers of people with mental health issues. It also aims to raise funds for CAL, which provides free training programmes for these caregivers.
The donations will allow the charity to continue providing much needed support to caregivers and help to expand several new programmes, including courses for younger caregivers and caregivers of people with dementia.
CAL's head of communications, Ms Tricia Lee, told The Straits Times: ""We have definitely seen an increase in the demand for the courses. Among our caregivers, more people have also been experiencing crises at home.""
A survey of 1,000 people commissioned by ST in March found that one in three people felt his or her mental well-being had worsened since the eight-week circuit breaker period a year ago.
Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) received 39,492 suicide and crisis-related calls last year, an increase of 18 per cent from 33,387 in 2019.
On the effect that the coronavirus has had on mental health, Mr Shanmugam said: ""People are social beings and when you can't socialise as much as you did (before), it does impact some people a little bit more.""
More broadly, younger people here face daily stresses, whether in school or at work, he said. Meanwhile, older people are living longer and could face dementia-related issues.
Mr Shanmugam added: ""Many of us will know people in our family, somebody (who) has a problem... I think as a society, we need to do more.""
Launched on April 5, CAL's campaign, called Walk for Mental Wellness, ends on May 16, but donations are open until June 30.
The campaign has already exceeded its $250,000 target, which will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the Government.
Based on the idea of ""You Donate, They Walk"", mental wellness champions including Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, MP Murali Pillai, former Nominated MP Anthea Ong and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital chief executive Chua Hong Choon, have been roped in for the campaign. They will need to walk or run 1km for every $100 raised, and have four weeks - between April 17 and May 16 - to complete their walk or run.
Donors can track their champion's progress on the campaign's website.
There is also a social media challenge. Members of the public can donate to CAL, walk 1km, and then nominate a friend to do the same by using the hashtag #W4MWChallenge.
The campaign has raised $288,461 and clocked 2,884km so far.

Use force or negotiate? A look at how the S’pore police handle tense stand-offs,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/police-in-spore-demonstrate-how-they-deal-with-tense-standoffs,"SINGAPORE - It was the second time in two months that the elderly woman had locked herself in her rental flat and threatened to harm herself or jump out the window.
But following a stand-off which lasted under five hours, police officers were able to get into her flat without damaging property and secure her psychiatric help at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
Both incidents happened in 2018, said the Commander of the Central Police Division, Assistant Commissioner of Police Gregory Tan Siew Hin.
He was asked about memorable stand-offs he had been involved in.
AC Tan was speaking at the Home Team Tactical Centre on Tuesday (April 27) during a media event in which the police demonstrated how negotiations and forced entries are used in a stand-off.
He said stand-off incidents where people display symptoms of mental health conditions are the most unpredictable.
""In some cases, officers managed to break the door quickly enough, or find a way to crawl through windows to stop the person and save a life.
""There were also incidents where officers were not able to reach the person in time to stop them from ending their lives,"" he said, noting that stand-offs usually arise from people evading police arrests or contemplating suicide.
There were also incidents involving those who may be of unsound mind.
In the woman's case, officers visited her after she returned from her time in IMH and won her trust. She is also better now with treatment.
The demonstrations on Tuesday came after a number of incidents this year made the headlines.
In February, officers had to force their way into a Toa Payoh flat after a 64-year-old man locked himself in his room and threatened to commit suicide.
In the room, the man was seen holding a canister of butane fuel and a lighter in his hands before he is said to have charged towards the officers.
The man was arrested after he allegedly stabbed a police officer in the thigh. The police officer is no longer in hospital.

Another incident in March involved a 38-year-old Caucasian man who had locked himself inside a residential unit.
Officers entered the unit nearly four hours after the initial call for help. They had assessed that he posed a danger to himself.
The man was arrested under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. He was also investigated for consumption of controlled drugs.
The longest stand-off was 17 hours. It involved a drug abuser who took his girlfriend's toddler hostage in a Sembawang flat in 2016.
Such stand-off situations can be difficult to handle, especially since the approach is to minimise harm and uncertainty, said AC Tan.
""This is why we need so many resources,"" he added.
Their resources include the Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU) and Special Operations Command.
The CNU includes police officers and psychologists who are trained in negotiation tactics.

One of the tools of their trade is active listening, said principal psychologist Ho Hui Fen.
""We will reflect certain contents and certain words that a person may be saying. We may try to reflect feelings, try to mirror what they are feeling,"" she said.
But handling these incidents can take an emotional toll on psychologists, added Ms Ho.
""It can be heart-wrenching to see some family members having to cope with the struggles they are having with the person, especially those with chronic mental health issues who can be violent or suicidal. The psychologists do check in, talk and share with one another as a form of coping mechanism,"" she said.
Mental Health (Care & Treatment) Act

Individuals can be detained by the authorities under the Mental Health (Care & Treatment) Act if they refuse treatment and are assessed to pose a risk to themselves or others.
Between January and March this year, 723 patients were admitted to Institute of Mental Health (IMH) under the Act.
Total admissions under the Act in 2019 was 2,768, and 2,510 patients last year.
Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a senior consultant of emergency services at IMH, Dr Jared Ng, said that the patients taken to the institute under the Act are usually either suicidal or are suspected to be of unsound mind.
""All reports of possible suicidality are taken seriously as one life lost to suicide is one too many,"" said Dr Ng.
Those who need emergency medical treatment are first taken to the nearest Ministry of Health-designated hospital. They are then taken to the IMH emergency services (ES) for psychiatric assessment.
""At IMH ES, the doctor would perform a thorough psychiatric assessment and determine if the patient requires inpatient treatment, or whether he or she can be discharged from the hospital and followed-up either as an outpatient or by care agencies in the community,"" explained Dr Ng.

The assessment includes a psychiatric interview, physical examination and medical investigations.
For patients diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, treatment includes medication and psychological treatment.
Under the Act, a person may first be admitted to IMH for 72 hours, during which he or she is assessed and treated for any mental health conditions.
The period of the mandatory admission can be increased if the patient requires continued treatment in IMH due to his psychiatric condition, and if this is in the best interest for the health and safety of the patient or others around him.
The team will also work with caregivers and community partners to address other psycho-social issues and concerns and ensure that safe, holistic and quality care continues beyond the admission, said Dr Ng.
He added: ""Patients will not be kept in the hospital beyond what is necessary. We believe that care can be delivered in the community and once it is safe for patients to be discharged, we will do so.""

Police stand-offs: Notable cases
Toa Payoh, 2021
A man was arrested after he locked himself in the bedroom of a Toa Payoh flat and stabbed a police officer in the thigh on Feb 8.
The incident happened at Block 124 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. The man, 64, had locked himself in his room and threatened to commit suicide.
He refused to heed officers' repeated calls to open the door and the police had to use forced entry to get into the room. They found him holding a canister of butane fuel and a lighter in his hands.
One of the police officers, 28, was stabbed in the left thigh with a knife, allegedly by the man.
Sembawang, 2016
A drug abuser who held his girlfriend's two-year-old son hostage caused a 17-hour stand-off with police. It remains the longest stand-off the authorities here have dealt with.
Muhammad Iskandah Suhaimi, then 40, had locked himself and the boy in a flat after he told his girlfriend to buy him cigarettes.
Officers from the Special Operations Command forced their way into the flat by breaking a window and removing the front gate when Iskandah was in the toilet. They arrested him and rescued the boy.
In March 2018, he was sentenced to five years' jail and six strokes of the cane for kidnapping the toddler, possessing and consuming methamphetamine, and for illegally possessing a knuckleduster.

Lim Ah Seng, then 37, was arrested following a four-hour stand-off.
Lim was armed with two knives and had slammed the front door shut, refusing to let the police officers in. With the help of the man's children, the police eventually persuaded him to open the door.
Lim's wife - Madam Riana Agustina, 26, an Indonesian permanent resident - was found dead in the flat.
In court it emerged that Lim and his children had been physically and mentally abused by Madam Riana for years. He had strangled her during a quarrel.

Work-from-home arrangements highlight need to build workers' mental resilience: Zaqy Mohamad,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/work-from-home-arrangements-highlight-need-to-build-workers-mental-resilience-zaqy,"SINGAPORE - The adoption of work-from-home arrangements last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the mental stressors faced by workers here, especially with the blurring of work-life boundaries.
As such, building workers' mental resilience is critical, stressed Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad on Thursday (April 29) at the launch of this year's National Workplace Safety and Health Campaign. The hybrid event was held at the Trade Association Hub in Jurong and streamed online.
""Workers must take time to take care not just of their physical health, but also of their mental well-being,"" he added.
The annual campaign, organised by the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, entails year-long outreach efforts to promote safety and health in workplaces.
On mental well-being, a new campaign in September will see healthcare institutions and agencies share best practices to build workers' mental resilience.
About one in three people in Singapore feels his mental well-being has worsened since the circuit breaker kicked in a year ago, a poll commissioned by The Straits Times showed.
The poll of 1,000 people, conducted by online market research firm Milieu Insight from March 25 to March 29 this year, found that 31 per cent reported that their mental well-being had “somewhat worsened”. Five per cent said it had worsened “much more”.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will continue to assist firms in developing such support at their workplaces, said Mr Zaqy. The WSH council will also be developing training workshops and an online resource page on mental health matters.
In addition, a tripartite award on mental well-being will be introduced next year to recognise individuals and companies that have adopted exemplary practices.
This year, employers and workers are also called to take a pause from work to care for their safety and health. This can be a scheduled break of 30 minutes or more, where workers can do stretching exercises, perform safety checks or identify hazards around them.
WSH Council chairman John Ng said: ""When conducted regularly, these actions become habitual and can improve the worker's health and heighten his awareness of unsafe acts or conditions in his work environment in the long run.""
Two other campaigns for workplace safety will run throughout the year to address the top two contributors to non-fatal workplace injuries in recent years.
One, targeting high-risk sectors, will be launched in June to address slips, trips and falls. Employers and workers will pick up best practices and set goals to reduce incidents.
A Safe Hands Campaign is also planned for March next year, where companies will be encouraged to take steps to prevent machinery incidents.
On Thursday, Mr Zaqy called on employers to send workers for regular training, assess risks and carry out periodic checks on equipment and procedures. Fostering a ""no-blame culture"" will also encourage workers to speak up when they see anything amiss, he pointed out.

He also urged workers to report unsafe conditions and near-misses to their supervisors.
Mr Zaqy said machinery safety, as well as slips, trips and falls were two ""hot spots"" that accounted for nearly half of all major injuries last year.
Citing an inspection on a manufacturing firm last week where MOM officers uncovered several lapses, including the poor maintenance of machinery, Mr Zaqy said such safety lapses can lead to serious injuries or fatalities. His ministry has also observed an emerging issue of more untrained personnel operating machinery.
For slip, trip and fall incidents, six out of 10 of those injured were cleaners and labourers, he highlighted.

One in five of those injured slipped, tripped or fell as they were walking, according to a survey of the 26,000 such workplace incidents between 2012 and 2019. The most common location where these accidents happened were at stairs or steps.
Mandatory workplace safety and health training will be rolled out in stages for selected sectors. For instance, all cleaners will undergo such training from next year to reduce the risk of slips, trips and falls.
WSH Council's Mr Ng said: ""Although Singapore has gradually resumed most of its business activities and safe management measures may have been relaxed, we must continue to do our utmost to ensure that no one gets hurt at work.""",Calvin Yang,TRUE
Forum: Be confident that we can recover quickly from difficulties,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-be-confident-that-we-can-recover-quickly-from-difficulties,"Since the Covid-19 outbreak began, Singapore has been witnessing a significant increase in the number of people seeking professional help for mental health issues.
Many people hold pessimistic views towards the future, with some worrying about their employment and economic prospects.
But research has found that people tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of their emotional reactions to negative life events, which causes unnecessary anxiety. This inaccurate prediction of our emotion responses is called impact bias in social psychology.
One reason for this bias is that we are often unaware that our psychological defence mechanisms will automatically come into play to help us better cope with reality.
Many of us picked up hobbies like music, art and gardening during the circuit breaker period. Some may argue that we did so because we were bored at home. But subconsciously, we may have taken up such hobbies to help funnel out our negative emotions.
Research has also found that when we try to predict the future, we focus more on material goods rather than relationships. But social support also defines our level of life satisfaction extensively.
The music video for charity song Stuck With U by Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber shows real-life clips of people all over the world cuddling, dancing and laughing with their loved ones while stuck at home. It demonstrates that life's difficulties are not that intimidating when we are surrounded by family and friends.
Also, we focus too much on how our life will be different after a life crisis, but overlook how the new life will be similar to the old one.
People should become aware that as human beings, we tend to overestimate the impact of a future event. We should stay optimistic, and have confidence in our ability to recover quickly from difficulties in life.

Re-entry blues: How to manage higher stress and anxiety with the reopening of workplaces,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/re-entry-blues-how-to-manage-higher-stress-and-anxiety-with-the-reopening-of-workplaces,"SINGAPORE - When Ms P. Lim, 32, returned to the office last week after working from home for about a year, she found it hard to adjust.
It was difficult to start conversations with her colleagues and she preferred going for lunch alone, which was not the case before.
The marketing and sales executive, who now has to work three days a week in office, had become comfortable with weekly meetings via video conferencing and was not looking forward to ""unnecessary small talk"".
Ms Lim, who would give only her initials, says: ""It feels like I have to rewire my brain into understanding this new normal all over again. I felt tense and uncomfortable in getting used to a different setting, with my bosses and colleagues around me, compared with when I was working alone at home.""
Like Ms Lim, some people are feeling anxious or stressed as they start going back to work regularly in the office.
It was announced on March 24 that up to 75 per cent of employees may return to the workplace at any one time from April 5, up from 50 per cent. However, an online poll by The Sunday Times published on March 28 found that three in four of nearly 2,600 respondents did not wish to return to the office.
The reopening of workplaces could cause re-entry anxiety, says Mr Chad Yip, a clinical psychologist for Noah and Zoey, which are digital health platforms for men and women.
Re-entry anxiety occurs when people experience higher levels of anxiety and stress in response to the fear of changes. In this case, people worry about what will happen when they step out of their homes more often, return to the workplace and socialise.
Mr Yip has seen a 20 per cent increase in patients with such anxiety since last month.
Dr Felicia Neo, director and clinical psychologist at Neo Cooper Psychology Clinic, says: ""As more and more employees are asked to return to the workplace with increasing hours, many may view this as a break in the structure, regimen and normality that they have learnt to create in the environments they have set up for themselves over the past year.""
Apart from disrupting the routine that people have grown used to working from home, Dr Neo notes that many could feel anxious and confused returning to the workplace with new Covid-19 rules and restrictions to adhere to.
Besides anxiety, she says the return to office can also cause an adjustment disorder, in which one feels more emotionally distressed than normal in response to an unexpected or a stressful event.
""This is because people may feel pressured to readjust back to the old norm, after having been accustomed to working from home for a year or more,"" she adds.
Symptoms of an adjustment disorder include lack of participation in meetings; social withdrawal and isolation in workplace gatherings; absenteeism from work; feelings of fear and helplessness; and appearing more anxious, temperamental and angry.

Back to the office best done in small doses
It may take up to three months for symptoms to develop after a person is exposed to a stressful situation, says Mr Yip.
These symptoms are likely to affect productivity, as a person might have problems managing and focusing on tasks even though he is present in the office.
""People will tend to be more disengaged from work and encounter difficulties interacting with colleagues or meeting deadlines,"" he adds.
Dr Annabelle Chow, principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology, says such behaviour may cause people to doubt their capabilities and have reduced confidence in their skills.
This was the case for Mr Seck, a marketing coordinator, who last week started going back to work in the office twice a week.
The 29-year-old, who declines to share his full name, says he did not feel as confident as he used to when he had to present at meetings. He also felt less productive and found it tough to focus on work, ""possibly due to the change in environment"".

""I think it may improve with time, but at the start, it can be a bit overwhelming to adjust to this hybrid work arrangement,"" he adds.
To take better care of one's mental health, Dr Chow suggests that people take some time during the day to pen down overwhelming thoughts. ""By doing so, you allow yourself to prioritise your worries and be aware of what can be controlled,"" she says.
Mr Yip adds that bosses should check in with employees to understand how they are coping, as it encourages open conversations and allows for warning signs of emotional distress to be identified.
Dr Neo urges people to recognise their feelings and seek help if needed.
""Consider this perspective: If you were to have a fever, you would not dismiss it and would take active steps to address it. Similarly, if you are experiencing anxiety and emotional distress, do not dismiss this as nothing, but take active steps to address it,"" she says.
8 ways to care for your mental health
1. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY
The first step is to recognise stress and anxiety when you experience them.
Allow yourself to notice your emotions even if they are negative. The more you suppress and resist them, the more they will work against you.
Recognise what your triggers and problem areas are. For example, recognise why you feel happy about something. Emotions exist for a reason.
2. ACCEPT THAT IT IS OKAY TO FEEL THIS WAY
Adjusting to a new norm can be difficult. With regard to work performance, there may be expectations from yourself and your superiors to do well.
These feelings and thoughts can be challenging to deal with. But remember that it is okay to feel vulnerable in such a situation and try not to be too harsh on yourself.
3. TAKE BABY STEPS TO DEVELOP NEW HABITS
Set small steps that could help you overcome your anxiety, such as taking public transport to work during non-peak hours.
These can help you regain some sense of control and confront your sources of anxiety.

4. ESTABLISH A NEW ROUTINE AND STICK TO IT
Having a routine will give you comfort and a sense of control in stressful situations. Give yourself some time to adjust to the new situation and form a new routine, which can ease your anxiety.
You may want to engage in activities such as mindfulness and deep breathing exercises, which can reduce stress.
Consider starting the day with a simple activity like taking deep breaths, stretching or having breakfast.
5. DOCUMENT YOUR THOUGHTS
Journaling can have positive health benefits. Give yourself 10 minutes a day to write down all your thoughts.
This can help you gain perspective, clarity and understand your thoughts and emotions better.
6. STAY CONNECTED TO LOVED ONES
Avoid using the pandemic as an excuse to distance yourself from your loved ones.
Use technology to keep in touch with friends and family, such as through voice calls, video conferencing, messaging or e-mails.
7. TAKE CARE OF YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
Engaging in physical exercise and having a healthy and well-balanced diet as well as seven to nine hours of quality sleep can improve psychological functioning and moods.
8. SEEK HELP IF THINGS GET OVERWHELMING
Try to seek support from family, friends and trusted colleagues as much as possible.
You can also approach your general practitioner, who can provide medical advice and a referral to a mental health provider.
There is also the option of online counselling, where you can speak with a professional to learn to be more in tune with your emotions and take charge of your mental well-being in a safe, private and confidential setting.

""As a child, I fancied being lost in a forest,"" she said. ""Wilderness expands one's sense of possibilities, so things tend to get pretty fantastical in the forests I imagine."" While her head is in the clouds, her imaginary feet enjoy magical waterfalls, fields of yellow flowers or cosy bathtubs that overlook lush valleys.

Circuit breaker anniversary: It's okay not to be okay,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/circuit-breaker-anniversary-its-okay-not-to-be-okay,"SINGAPORE - The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the importance of good mental health to the forefront.
A slew of nationwide initiatives focusing on mental well-being have been rolled out since last year. Prominent public figures like DBS Group chief executive Piyush Gupta have also spoken openly about their mental health struggles in socially conservative Singapore, reducing the stigma surrounding the topic.
The National Care Hotline, which was set up in April last year to provide psychological first aid and emotional support during Covid-19, was one example of the historic scale of these efforts, says mental health professional Andrea Chan.
""For so long in the history of Singapore, we never had this. It was as if the nation came together to say, 'We embrace mental health', and that came about as a result of Covid-19,"" adds the assistant director of Touch Mental Wellness, a division of Touch Community Services, which provides mental health services and education.
She says: ""There has been a normalisation of mental health struggles. In the past, people with such challenges may have been viewed as weak, but with Covid-19, everyone experienced vulnerability to stress and disruption to some degree.""
Such symptoms could include feelings of fear or uncertainty, or a sense of being overwhelmed by Covid-19 restrictions, such as when the entire family was working and learning from home.
Ms Chan adds that there seems to be greater acceptance towards seeking help and talking about mental health, especially in mass media.
The National Care Hotline has managed more than 40,000 calls since it started operations a year ago, the latest figures provided by the Ministry of Social and Family Development showed.
Other initiatives include the Covid-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce, which was announced in October last year. The inter-agency task force was convened by the Government to provide a coordinated national response to the mental health needs of Singaporeans arising from the pandemic.
In November, Economic Development Board managing director Chng Kai Fong opened up about his mental and emotional state, a rare occurrence among Singapore's top public servants.
He spoke about the ""signs of depressive bouts"" he experienced during the pandemic, when facing crises like the death of his brother-in-law. One day, he did not even want to get out of bed, he said.
Shortly after, Mr Gupta shared how he went through a period of ""acute anxiety"" when his start-up failed in 2000.
""I also learnt that people are often wary of talking about this because of a presumed stigma. However, the more open you are, the easier it becomes to deal with the issue,"" the top banker said.
Last year, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) received about 10,000 outpatient referrals, a 3 per cent increase over the year before, according to figures it provided.
Dr Jared Ng, senior consultant in IMH's emergency services, says there is now a greater hunger on the part of the public and employers to learn more about mental health, through avenues like webinars.

National Council of Social Service launches guide for media reporting on mental health issues
Observers say mental health awareness had already been growing in recent years, but the pandemic made it difficult to ignore symptoms that were previously swept under the carpet.
In 2018, the National Council of Social Service launched the Beyond The Label movement to encourage the public to look beyond a mental health diagnosis and accept people with mental health conditions for who they are.
Mr Jonathan Siew, principal counsellor at Care Corner Counselling Centre, saw marital conflicts spike in the enforced proximity of the stay-home period.
The stress and social isolation of Covid-19 also placed a mental burden across almost all demographics, including teens, parents and seniors.
The silver lining has been the unexpected success of online counselling, he says.

Mr Siew adds: ""The idea of doing online counselling was not possible before, as it was felt that counselling had to be in person.
""When push came to shove, however, we found that online counselling was efficient and opened us up to new groups of clients.""
Telecounselling via Zoom helped him support some young adults working from home. They were experiencing tensions with family members, whom they used to spend long hours away from while at work.
Mr Siew is also looking into how Zoom therapy can benefit people with depression, who may not want to venture out or travel for a counselling session.
Some mental health service providers have already charted new plans for a post-Covid-19 future.
In January, Touch Mental Wellness launched an intervention service that helps primary school pupils build resilience.
Ms Chan says: ""Even if there's no longer Covid-19, the children will have the resources to deal with stressors in a very uncertain world.""

Looking ahead after an abnormal year,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/st-editorial/looking-ahead-after-an-abnormal-year,"What a difference a year has made. This time last year, residents here were hunkering down to a bewildering new situation - the circuit breaker - as the number of locally transmitted Covid-19 cases spiked. Most had to work or take school lessons from home, and eating out, a favourite pastime, was no longer an option - indeed, they could not leave their homes except for essentials such as to buy food and groceries. Today, while life is not fully back to normal, malls and foodcourts are buzzing again, students attend classes in person, more employees are returning to workplaces, and family and friends are meeting up although such gatherings remain restricted to eight persons.
This turnaround had much to do with measures put in place to control the spread of infections, and with the public's willingness to do their part to help keep Covid-19 in check. As a survey by this newspaper published yesterday showed, there has been a high level of confidence in the authorities' handling of the pandemic. The majority of people today are more likely to practise safe management measures than a year ago. There were initial missteps that led to the jump in local cases, such as overlooking how quickly the disease could spread in workers' dormitories. And there were those who defied restrictions by breaking their quarantine or by gathering in large groups.
Great strides have been made since, with local transmissions regularly in single digits or zero in any given week. This and an easing of circuit breaker measures have made it tempting to take things easier. There is optimism that vaccinations - being rolled out smoothly here - will lead to herd immunity. There is fatigue from having to conform to safe management measures day in and day out, and a strong yen to travel. But the World Health Organisation continues to warn that the resurgence in many countries is precisely because of an early relaxation of restrictions and lifting of measures. The emergence of new variants has also played a part.
The year has proved costly to the global economy, and Singapore was not unscathed. With borders closed, travel and related industries were severely hit. Businesses shuttered and people lost jobs, although support measures cushioned the impact significantly. Yet there are positives from this year of living abnormally: an acceleration in the adoption of technology; a change in attitudes towards work and workplaces; opportunities to reskill, upgrade and pivot to new and emerging businesses; and a compact among people that underlined how society again came together in the face of another significant challenge. The threat has not receded. Promising as the outlook might seem here today, this is not the time for anyone to let his guard down. A small misstep is all it takes to undo the progress made and set society back to where it was a year ago.",,TRUE
"1 in 3 Covid-19 survivors suffer mental, neurological problems: Study",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/1-in-3-covid-19-survivors-suffer-mental-neurological-problems-study,"PARIS (AFP) - One in three people who overcome Covid-19 suffer from a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis six months on, according to the largest study so far published on the mental toll that long-Covid takes on survivors.
Authors said the research, printed Wednesday (April 7) in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, proved that Covid-19 patients were significantly more likely to develop brain conditions than those suffering from other respiratory tract infections.
Studying the health records of more than 230,000 patients who had recovered from Covid-19, they found that 34 per cent were diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition within six months.
The most common conditions were anxiety (17 per cent of patients) and mood disorders (14 per cent).
For 13 per cent of patients the disorders were their first diagnosis of a mental health issue.
Incidence of neurological disorders such as brain haemorrhage (0.6 per cent), stroke (2.1 per cent) and dementia (0.7 per cent) was lower overall than for psychiatric disorders but the risk for brain disorders was generally higher in patients who had severe Covid-19.
The authors also examined data from more than 100,000 patients diagnosed with influenza and more than 236,000 diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection.
They found there was overall a 44 per cent greater risk of neurological and mental health diagnoses after Covid-19 than after flu, and a 16 per cent higher risk than with respiratory tract infections.
Paul Harrison, lead author from the University of Oxford, said that while the individual risk of neurological and psychiatric orders from Covid-19 was small, the overall effect across the global population could prove to be ""substantial"".
""Many of these conditions are chronic,"" he said.
""As a result, health care systems need to be resourced to deal with the anticipated need, both within primary and secondary care services.""
'Severe impact'
Patients hospitalised with severe Covid-19 were at great risk of developing long-term conditions, according to the analysis.
For example, 46 per cent of patients who needed intensive care were diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric conditions within six months of recovery.

The data showed 2.7 per cent of people needing intensive care suffered a subsequent brain haemorrhage, compared to 0.3 percent of people who weren't hospitalised.
And nearly 7 per cent of those needing ICU care suffered a stroke, compared with 1.3 per cent of patients who didn't.
Writing in a linked comment article, Jonathan Rogers from University College London, said further research was needed on the long-term neurological and psychiatric outcomes among Covid-19 patients.
""Sadly, many of the disorders identified in this study tend to be chronic or recurrent, so we can anticipate that the impact of Covid-19 could be with us for many years,"" said Rogers, who was not involved in the study.
""It is clear from this study that the impact Covid-19 is having on individuals mental health can be severe,"" said Lea Milligan, CEO of the MQ Mental Health research group.
""This is contributing to the already rising levels of mental illness and requires further, urgent research.""

It is estimated that one in 50 Singaporeans will exhibit hoarding behaviour in their lifetimes. The Sunday Times spoke to Dr Kelvin Ng, consultant, IMH, to understand hoarding behaviour.
A: Most people have difficulties in parting with valuable possessions, but a person with hoarding behaviour would have difficulties parting with items that are not useful, and would experience emotional distress such as anxiety attacks when asked to discard them.

Forum: Give employees time to adjust to working in office again,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-give-employees-time-to-adjust-to-working-in-office-again,"I refer to the article ""Caution urged even as more can return to workplace"" (March 25).
During the circuit breaker, Silver Ribbon Singapore counselled a number of office workers, apart from the elderly, youth, couples, migrant workers and persons with disabilities.
The office workers said they experienced a high level of anxiety while working from home and juggling other responsibilities, including household chores and caring for children and the elderly at home.
In fact, in an online survey we conducted with members of the public to measure the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, one in four of the 577 respondents reported that they experienced low mood, anxiety and loneliness more than usual.
According to the World Health Organisation, workplaces that promote mental health and support people with mental disorders are more likely to reduce absenteeism, increase productivity and benefit from associated economic gains.
Therefore, we hope employers will be understanding and patient as more employees return to the office.
This is because some employees may feel stressed and require additional time to adjust to this change, especially after working from home in the past months.
In addition, employees could also play an active role in watching out for warning signs of stress, such as disturbed sleep, poor appetite, mood swings, and so on, in their colleagues, and encourage them to seek early help. Mental health is everyone's business.
Let's play a part in creating a mental-health-friendly community.

Burden and blessing for Singapore to be city in nature: Desmond Lee,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/burden-and-blessing-to-be-city-in-nature-desmond-lee,"SINGAPORE - Like no other country, Singapore carries both the burden and the blessing of having greenery and nature reserves in the midst of one of the densest cities in the world.
This is why the Republic must continue protecting its green spaces, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee on Saturday (March 27).
And it's why the Government is pushing for a vision of a city-in-nature - not in spite of, but because of the greater developmental pressures of today.
Mr Lee was speaking at the launch of a book of essays by 20 prominent individuals aged 60 to 79, who were also participants in a Nature and Mindful Awareness Study (Namas) by the National University Health System's (NUHS) Mind Science Centre.
Namas is based on the idea that a mindful walk in greenery and nature can benefit mental, physical and social health.
And Mr Lee stressed on the need to protect nature so that Singapore's future generations can experience that thrill and spectacle of nature, even in a bustling city like ours.
He said: ""Beyond the ecological explanations of connectivity and diversity, (it) is to enable Singaporeans to benefit from the therapeutic balm that nature offers to our minds, to our spirit, and to our being.""
The 320-page book, titled Profiles in Resilience: Reflections in the Time of Covid-19, was edited by former Speaker of Parliament Abdullah Tarmugi and mental health doyen Kua Ee Heok.
Writers include former Auditor-General Lim Soo Ping and ex-MP Hong Hai, with a foreword by Ambassador-At-Large Tommy Koh.

Addressing a hybrid event of 50 in-person attendees at Goodwood Park Hotel and some 300 online viewers, Professor Koh noted that one challenge facing Singapore was how to reconcile the imperative of development with that of sustainability and protecting the environment.
Mr Lee acknowledged this and outlined the challenges in charting Singapore's land use as spanning the needs in housing, recreation, public health, active ageing, education and more.
Hence the need for continued conversations with Singaporeans on balancing these needs and ultimately, ensuring that the most precious biodiversity and habitats continue to thrive, he said.

Mr Lee, who is also minister-in-charge of social services integration, also said the Government must continue to support the mental well-being of Singaporeans, especially with the Covid-19 pandemic taking an emotional and psychological toll on many.
He said the National Care Hotline has managed over 40,000 calls since it was set up by the health and social and family development ministries in April.
The hotline provides a listening ear to help Singaporeans cope with the stress and anxiety brought on by the pandemic. Many of these calls resulted in follow-up action and interventions, said Mr Lee.
He also stressed the need to go beyond state-led efforts to have a much bigger impact.
He said: ""The Government can bring people together and provide support and resources, but it is often the community itself that best understands what the real needs are on the ground, and how these can be addressed.""

Indeed, the pet's eventual death is often an emotionally wrenching experience that can affect the owner's emotional and physical health. Their grief may be as long and severe as when a significant person in their life dies.
This came home to me when I saw a patient who was profoundly depressed following the death of her pet dog. She had been given it by a friend as a puppy.

Blackstone invests in mental health app at US$1 billion valuation,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/blackstone-invests-in-mental-health-app-at-us1-billion-valuation,"SAN FREANCISCO (BLOOMBERG) - Blackstone Group is leading a US$100 million (S$134.6 million) funding round in on-demand mental-health company Ginger, accelerating a push into fast-growing technology start-ups.
The funds will come out of the investment firm's growth equity arm, Blackstone and Ginger said. The stake values the San Francisco-based service at about US$1 billion, vaulting it to unicorn status.
Demand for resources provided by Ginger, which connects users to behavioural health experts via a mobile app, is surging amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company's revenue has tripled in the past year.
""There's a widespread prevalence of mental health issues in this country,"" said Mr Ram Jagannath, who heads healthcare investing for Blackstone Growth Equity. ""Like other sectors of healthcare, the pandemic exacerbated the underlying trends and accelerated people's adoption of digital platforms.""
Blackstone recently announced the final close of its first growth equity fund at US$4.5 billion. Its New York-based growth vehicle has made several investments, including backing online dating company Bumble prior to its initial public offering, vegan food products maker Oatly, enterprise software provider ISN Software Corp and Epidemic Sound, a royalty-free music company.
Ginger chief executive Russ Glass plans to use Blackstone's investment to acquire companies and platforms focused on mental health, or data that could complement what Ginger is already doing.
""There's going to be a massive mental health need for the foreseeable future,"" Mr Glass said in an interview. ""The more we can focus on innovation, everyone who has a need will get access.""
Statistics bear that out. During the week of March 8, demand for therapy and psychiatry services jumped 365 per cent compared with pre-pandemic averages measured from August 2019 to January last year, the company said.
In the first half of the year, Ginger plans to extend its reach to underserved populations through new government relationships and collaborations with non-profits, Mr Glass said.
Ginger has already made inroads with large brand-name companies - including Delta Air Lines, Sanofi and Domino's Pizza - which provide Ginger's mental health resources to their employees.
In August, Ginger raised US$50 million from investors including Advance Venture Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners. Earlier this month, former Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy III and cyber-security executive Myrna Soto joined its advisory board. Ginger has also announced a partnership with digital pharmacy Capsule to provide medication delivery to members.
""I see this as an investment, not a cost,"" said Mr Clint Wallace, the head of human resources for North America at Sanofi. ""We can't solve all of people's problems but we can help them give their best.""

"To maintain feelings of happiness, you need to work on it a bit",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/to-maintain-feelings-of-happiness-you-need-to-work-on-it-a-bit,"SINGAPORE - The birds are chirping, a warm breeze is blowing and some of your friends are getting vaccinated.
After a year of anxiety and stress, many people are finally rediscovering what optimism feels like. But if you are expecting your happiness to skyrocket the moment the world finishes off this pandemic once and for all, think again.
Yes, receiving your vaccine shot, daydreaming about intimate dinner parties or first hugs with grandchildren may give you a jolt of joy - but euphoria, unfortunately, tends to be fleeting.
Blame ""hedonic adaptation"", says Dr Rhea Owens, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota Duluth, who conducts research on positive psychology interventions in counselling practices.
When good or bad things happen, people feel an initial surge or dip in their overall happiness levels.
Hedonic adaptation means that, over time, they settle back into wherever they were happiness-wise before that good or bad event happened, even if the good thing - such as getting your dream job - is continuing.
To maintain those positive feelings, you are going to need to work on it a bit. Thank evolution.
""Our brains developed biologically for survival, not happiness,"" says Dr Sanjay Kumar, director of contemplative practices and well-being at the Fish Interfaith Center at Chapman University in Orange, California.
The human mind, he adds, ""prioritises negative experiences to be remembered more strongly than positive ones, as a way for us to anticipate potential threats in our environment"".
While that is good for evolution, excessive worry is not anyone's idea of a happy state of mind.
Ultimately, happiness is more of a daily practice than anything else, Dr Kumar says. This is why getting your coronavirus shot may make you happy for a moment, but will not bring long-term happiness.
The good news is that researchers have found steps that will - and no needles are required. These strategies work perfectly in a moment like this - when hope is on the horizon, but the path towards it is not yet clear.
It is okay to not yet be okay
While many are beginning to exhale, others are still buried deep in grief.
If that sounds like you, it is acceptable if this stage of the pandemic does not feel joyous, says psychologist Shannon South, who is based in North Carolina.
If you need to avoid pictures of your friends getting their coronavirus vaccines on social media, that is fine.
Consider this your permission to let yourself feel what you need to feel.

How to be happier at work
Savour everything
For some, their first time hugging friends in a year is going to be a moment to savour.
But there is joy in everyday things too.
Even mundane things - such as watching yet another youth football game - can feel special if you take a moment to remember the not-so-distant past when so much of life was put on hold.
Dr Owens recommends taking the time whenever something good happens - no matter how small - to really acknowledge it.
Marvel as much as you can
In the past decade, researchers have been investigating the relationship between wonder, happiness and good health.
In 2013, the Social Interaction Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, started Project Awe to study the intersection of awe and happiness.
In one study published in the journal Emotion in 2015, participants who experienced more positive emotions had lower levels of interleukin-6, a marker for inflammation. And participants with the lowest levels of interleukin-6 were those who reported feeling awe most often.

Perhaps this explains why getting the vaccine is such a serotonin boost for so many. Not only do you feel like the future is brighter, but you may also feel awe at the wonders of modern science.
The feeling of awe can also come from a walk around the block, says The Awe Factor author Allen Klein.
One of his favourite strategies for ensuring his daily dose of awe is heading out for an ""awe walk"".
On these strolls, he switches off his mental list of chores and things to remember, and instead focuses on finding wonder in small things along the way.
Be grateful and kind
Acts of kindness tend to increase people's ratings of their own happiness, Dr Owens says.
You may also get some benefit from simply thinking about good deeds you have done.
A study this year - published in The Journal of Positive Psychology by researchers at the University of California, Riverside - found that reflecting on past kind deeds improved well-being at a rate similar to actually going out and doing new good deeds.
Realise happiness alone is not enough
If you have been struggling with depression throughout the pandemic, working to boost your own happiness may not be a cure.
""The opposite of depression is not happiness,"" says New York-based psychiatrist Jeff Ditzell. ""The opposite of depression is no longer being depressed.""
If you have had symptoms of depression these past 12 months, you may feel your depression subside as the pandemic slowly wanes.
But on the other hand, it may not. Clinical depression should be treated by a mental health professional.
Break out your calendar
While it is still uncertain when big parties and other activities people enjoyed before the pandemic will return, scheduling a few safe activities can do wonders for keeping your optimism up.
In fact, just anticipating an event can sometimes be as pleasurable as the activity itself.
Perhaps it is too early to set a date for a 15-person dinner party, but you can crack open a cookbook to start planning the menu.
And when party day arrives, remember to savour every last morsel and belly laugh, as you eat, drink and be more than just fleetingly merry.",,TRUE

Over 3 million people signed up for Yale's happiness course,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/over-3-million-people-signed-up-for-yales-happiness-course,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - The Yale happiness class, formally known as Psyc 157: Psychology and the Good Life, is one of the most popular classes to be offered in the university's 320-year history.
The class was only ever taught in-person once, during the spring 2018 semester, as a 1,200-person lecture course in the largest space on campus.
That March, a free 10-week version made available to the public via Coursera, titled The Science Of Well-Being, also became instantly popular, attracting hundreds of thousands of online learners.
But when lockdowns began last March, two full years later, the enrolment numbers skyrocketed. To date, over 3.3 million people have signed up, according to the website.
""We octupled the number of people taking the class,"" said Dr Laurie Santos, a professor of psychology at Yale and the head of the university's Silliman College, of its pandemic-era popularity.
""Everyone knows what they need to do to protect their physical health: wash your hands and social distance and wear a mask,"" she added. ""People were struggling with what to do to protect their mental health.""
The Coursera curriculum, adapted from the one Dr Santos taught at Yale, asks students to, among other things, track their sleep patterns, keep a gratitude journal, perform random acts of kindness, and take note of whether, over time, these behaviours correlate with a positive change in their general mood.
Ms Gretchen McIntire, 34, a home health aide in Massachusetts, is studying for her bachelor's degree in psychology through an online programme from Southern New Hampshire University.
In her free time during the lockdown in August, Ms McIntire took the class. She called it ""life-changing"".
The practical aspect of the Coursera curriculum appealed to Ms McIntire, who learnt she had Asperger's syndrome at 23. A night owl, she had struggled with sleep and on enforcing her own time boundaries.
""It's hard to set those boundaries with yourself sometimes and say, 'I know this book is really exciting, but it can wait till tomorrow, sleep is more important,'"" she said.
""That's discipline, right? But I had never done it in that way, where it's like, 'It's going to make you happier. It's not just good for you; it's going to actually legitimately make you happier.'""
She said she found having a daily meditation practice helpful and has stuck with it even after finishing the class. Meditation also helped her to get off social media.
""I found myself looking inward. It helped me become more introspective,"" she said. ""Honestly, it was the best thing I ever did.""
She later re-downloaded her social apps, including Facebook Messenger, and felt instantly overwhelmed.

Ms Tracy Morgan, a programming supervisor at the Bob Snodgrass Recreation Complex in High River in Alberta, Canada, signed up for the class last June as she was in lockdown with her children and husband.
""There's no reason I shouldn't be happy,"" she said. ""I have a wonderful marriage. I have two kids. I have a nice job and a nice house. And I just could never find happiness.""
Since taking the course, Ms Morgan, 52, has made a commitment to do three things every day: practise yoga for one hour, take a walk outside in nature no matter how cold it may be in Alberta, and write three to five entries in her gratitude journal before bed.
""When you start writing down those things at the end of the day, you think about it only at the end of the day, but once you make it a routine, you start to think about it all throughout the day,"" she said.
And some studies show that finding reasons to be grateful can increase your general sense of well-being.

How to be happier at work
Can money buy happiness?
Dr Ewa Szypula, 37, a lecturer of French studies at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said she has been interested in self-improvement techniques since studying for her PhD several years ago.
""Somewhere along the second or third year, you do feel a bit burned out, and you need strategies for dealing with it,"" she said.
One small study from Dr Santos' curriculum that stuck with her involved polling 632 Americans to predict how happy they would be if they were given US$5 (S$6.70) to spend on themselves versus getting US$5 and being told they must spend it on someone else.
In the study, people predicted that they would be happier if they were allowed to keep the money. But participants consistently reported afterward that they had in fact derived more satisfaction from spending money on someone.
Dr Szypula had the opportunity to combine her newfound knowledge in a practical experiment on her sister's birthday. Instead of keeping an expensive dress she had bought, she gave it to her sister.

""I'm still feeling that happiness months later,"" she said.
Not every student of the class has felt transformed.
Mr Matt Nadel, 21, a Yale senior, was among the 1,200 students taking the class on campus in 2018. He said the rigours of Yale were a big adjustment when he started at the university in the autumn of 2017.
""I was stressed, and I didn't know exactly how to manage that,"" he said.
Mr Nadel said he was disappointed that the class was a sort of review of the kinds of obvious good advice you may get from a grandmother: Get enough sleep, drink enough water, just do your best.
""I knew that sleeping was good. I knew that my grades didn't matter for long-term happiness, that I wasn't going to be a happier, better person because of having good grades,"" he said. ""Did the class impact my life in a long term, tangible way? The answer is no.""
While the class was not life-changing for him, Mr Nadel said that he is more expressive now when he feels gratitude.
""Which is great,"" he said. ""But that's about all.""",,TRUE
National Council of Social Service launches guide for media reporting on mental health issues,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/national-council-of-social-service-launches-guide-for-media-reporting-on-mental,"SINGAPORE - As part of efforts to address the stigma associated with mental health conditions, the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) on Tuesday (March 16) launched a guide with words and phrases that should be avoided when reporting on the issue.
For example, the phrase ""someone with a mental health condition"" is preferred over terms such as ""mentally ill"", ""psycho"", ""mad"" or ""crazy"".
Aside from stigmatising terms and their suggested alternatives, the Beyond the Label Media Guide contains suggestions on how people with mental health conditions should be interviewed, as well as angling and headlining stories, and reporting on violence and suicides.
The guide was developed in consultation with social service agencies, mental health professionals, persons with mental health conditions and members of local media.
Ms Anita Fam, president of NCSS, said the guide provides recommendations for media professionals reporting on mental health issues or writing about incidents involving persons with mental health conditions.
""We believe that the media is and can be instrumental in influencing and changing attitudes and behaviour, educating and encouraging people to think differently about mental health, and to be aware of the problem of stigma associated with mental health conditions,"" added Ms Fam.
The guide follows work NCSS did in 2018, when it launched the first nationwide mental health anti-stigma campaign ""Beyond the Label"".
It was aimed at correcting misperceptions, raising awareness and promoting greater social inclusion of people in recovery from mental health conditions.
The issue was also addressed earlier this month when Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Health and Communications and Information, said during the debate on the Health Ministry's budget last week that the Covid-19 mental health task force would be transformed into an inter-agency platform to oversee mental health and well-being efforts beyond the pandemic.
The guide was introduced after a study by NCSS and the Singapore Management University showed that about 40 per cent of articles about mental health were crime-related.
NCSS said this may give the public cause to link mental illness with crime. In contrast, the study found that only about 15 per cent of articles highlighted care, prevention and recovery.
The study had examined 2,000 local media articles from 2016 to 2019.
In addition, the study found that stigmatising phrases such as ""mentally ill"" were used, especially in the headlines of articles.
Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore), said: ""You don't say a person with skin problem or cancer was caught for attacking someone. If you don't mention a physical illness why mention a mental illness?""
Silver Ribbon is a non-profit organisation dedicated to combating mental health stigma and helping those with mental health conditions integrate into society.

In the book's foreword, editor-at-large of The Straits Times Han Fook Kwang said stories that stigmatise people result in readers no longer looking for the whys and hows behind an incident, as they have already formed their own stereotyped views.
""I learnt much from this guide and wished it was available when I was in the newsroom. It pains me to think of the number of times we might have fallen short.
""Looking back, I think we were largely ignorant and did not know our work could have such a stigmatising effect. This guide should help journalists do better,"" added Mr Han.

Spike in calls to suicide prevention agency SOS in 2020 as more in distress amid Covid-19,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spike-in-calls-to-sos-last-year-as-more-in-distress-amid-pandemic-0,"SINGAPORE - Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) received 39,492 suicide and crisis-related calls last year.
This was up from 33,387 in 2019 - an increase of 18 per cent - as more people sought help for mental distress amid the pandemic.
Between April and June last year, which coincided with the circuit breaker and phase one of reopening, the agency received 10,671 calls, up from 7,844 in the same period in 2019.
Mr Gasper Tan, chief executive of SOS, said 2020 was a year of uncertainties, and many experienced more anxiety as the pandemic placed a strain on relationships and finances.
He added: ""At a time where uncertainty looms over most of us, anxiety and worry may amplify our reactions to day-to-day matters.""
SOS clients reported more conflicts with their romantic partners and family members, said Mr Tan.
Financial instability, or the loss of a job, was also a significant stressor as it can be damaging to an individual's self-worth, he added.
Mr Tan said some clients may also find it difficult to cope with mental health, as mental health services were interrupted and had longer wait times.
In response, SOS launched a text messaging service, Care Text, in October last year to provide support to those in distress.
Since its pilot in July, the service had completed 3,000 chats last year. Most of its clients were aged 29 and below.
Other mental health organisations also received more calls for help.
The Institute of Mental Health's mental health helpline received 48 per cent more calls between April and December last year, compared with the same period in 2019, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in a parliamentary response to Ms Raeesah Khan (Sengkang GRC), who asked about postpartum and mental health issues on Feb 26.
Ms Voon Yen Sing, assistant director of clinical services at the Singapore Association for Mental Health, said it received 2,719 calls last year, an increase from 2,143 in 2019.
It also saw a 50 per cent increase in the number of calls to its helpline between April and June last year, compared with the same period in 2019, she added.
Ms May Chng, head of the family support team at Brahm Centre, an organisation that provides mental health support, said the centre attended to an average of 227 calls a month from April to June last year, up from 80 a month from August 2019 to January last year.

"More needed help during Covid-19 pandemic, say mental health experts",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-needed-help-during-pandemic-say-mental-health-experts,"SINGAPORE - When the pandemic hit last year, counsellor Sharlene Teo, 37, who has a two-year-old son, found herself struggling to balance her motherhood duties with work commitments.
Her work at the community mental health department at Fei Yue Community Services became more stressful, as clients needed more frequent sessions.
She said: ""The pandemic was not easy for me as well. I'm just the same as my clients, or any other human being going through this.""
She took frequent self-care breaks, when she would listen to relaxing music, read a book, or take a walk in the park.
Mental health professionals here said they have had to attend to more cases over the past year. More clients were dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts amid the pandemic.
Mr Sam Roberts, centre director of Olive Branch Psychology and Counselling Services, said the organisation saw a spike in July last year, with cases increasing progressively till now.
The Singapore Counselling Centre also saw a 40 per cent increase in the number of clients from 2019 to 2020, said its chief well-being officer, Mr John Shepherd Lim.
Associate Professor John Wong, a senior consultant psychiatrist at the National University Hospital, said that stressors such as the derailment of school, work and social routines and financial woes, created a sense of hopelessness.
Prof Wong added: ""These, when placed on an vulnerable individual already under strain, could tip one over to become suicidal.""
Dr Jared Ng, a consultant at the Institute of Mental Health, said while suicidal acts are often impulsive, and crises leading to suicidal tendencies are often fleeting, what is most important is support from family and friends.
Mr Joseph Rajagopal, senior counsellor at Singapore Counselling Centre, said: ""We need to be more receptive to receiving help and seeking help for our loved ones, instead of being hindered by the belief that we are going to be labelled as mental patients.""
Mr Joseph said that as the first line of support for suicidal people, family members must go the extra mile and talk to them about their struggles.
Ms Teo said people should be careful not to minimise the experiences of those vulnerable to suicide.
She said: ""Even if you cannot walk that journey for them, you can walk alongside them.""
She added that suicide was not a problem unique to any age group.
The elderly who live alone, caregivers who had to care for young children, and students who were troubled by conflict at home were all vulnerable, said Ms Teo.
Mr Jim Bek, 58, a counsellor working with youth, once saw someone jumping off a building and that motivated him to work harder for his clients.
He said: ""Suicide knows no boundary of age, ethnicity, belief, or timeline. I don't want them to become another statistic on the chart.""

Voices of Youth: Regular exercise has positive impact on mental health,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/voices-of-youth-regular-exercise-has-positive-impact-on-mental-health,"I have met peers who faced depression, anxiety and eating disorders, engulfed by challenges ranging from academic pressure to relationship obstacles and family issues.
It is very heartening to see the Government setting up a task force to help children with mental health (A variety of resources available to ensure children's mental health, March 4).
But because teenagers often keep their mental issues to themselves, I would like to share something they can do to fight their demons - exercise.
There are many clinical trials supporting the benefits of exercise in tackling mental illnesses.
One study showed that exercising lowered the need to use anti-depressants in major depressive disorder patients, while another showed how exercising may have a positive impact on a core brain region involved in depression.
Exercise could potentially treat mental illnesses rather than just prevent them.
Exercising three times a week has been shown to improve mental illness.
Just moderate or low intensity exercise can still be helpful in tackling the illnesses.
I encourage people to exercise when they are feeling down. Calm the mind, enjoy the thrill from exercising and enjoy the satisfaction of feeling healthier, younger and more refreshed.

Letter of the week: Do inspiring women's stories set impossible benchmark instead?,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/letter-of-the-week-do-inspiring-womens-stories-set-impossible-benchmark-instead,"Every year when International Women's Day comes round, there are many stories published of women juggling successful careers while raising young children, grateful for the ""village"" that helps them become what the media hails as the ""women who have it all"".
I used to read these stories in earnest, looking for hacks and inspiration to achieve similar success as a woman facing the exact same challenges - trying to achieve professional success, raising two children, and being a good wife and daughter.
Perhaps it was the increased focus on mental health issues in the media, or that I have found time to reflect upon my own experience, but I began to wonder if such stories are indeed inspiring, or if they instead set an impossible benchmark for working mothers out there.
After all, not everyone has access to a ""village"" and, therefore, an inability to have it all may exacerbate a mother's guilt, create resentment and cause her to feel a lack of achievement.
On the surface, I looked like I had it all, but the grind to get there resulted in a deep sense of hopelessness that I came to realise was depression. Thankfully, months of psychotherapy enabled me to achieve clarity of purpose and helped me realise that I am good enough.
It would perhaps be more inspiring if the media could publish stories of working mothers who work within the challenges that life has thrown them, and have them share with others where they find sources of strength to carry on. These stories may be less newsworthy but are surely more real.
It is my hope that we can find a new narrative that ""every mother is a good mother"", ""every mother tries her best"" or ""don't be afraid to be good enough"", because there may be a dark side in trying to attain the ""holy grail"".

Mental health advocate sets up charity to guide community in suicide prevention,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mental-health-advocate-sets-up-charity-to-guide-community-in-suicide-prevention,"SINGAPORE - In her early years of volunteering with families in crisis, mental health advocate Dr Sally Thio encountered a young girl in need of help. Separated from her father and sister, the girl was struggling, trying to cope with her parents' divorce and her upcoming exams.
Dr Thio said: ""One night she called me and said 'everything is better' and that she wanted to treat me to breakfast the next morning. She seemed so happy when we had that breakfast.
""Unfortunately, that was the last time I would see her. The reason she felt better that morning was because she had decided to end her life.""
The traumatic episode led Dr Thio to devote over 30 years to improving the lives of persons with mental health issues, culminating in her setting up local charity Caring for Life (CFL) in April last year.
The charity, which aims to establish a community approach to suicide prevention, was founded by Dr Thio and philanthropists Keith Chua and Hsieh Fu Hua.
Since August last year, it has trained more than 300 participants from different organisations through a customised programme, which teaches participants to recognise signs of suicidal ideation at the workplace, school or within the home.
The programme is called LIFE - an acronym for Listen, Inquire directly, Find lifelines, and Engage professional help.
Through it, participants learn to recognise signs, engage individuals with suicidal ideation, and connect them with community resources for suicide intervention.
It also stresses safety in engaging conversations that foster open talk to address suicide.
Mr Chua, who serves as the board chairman of the charity, said: ""The intention of CFL is not to duplicate the existing services in this area. Where we fit in is in the early intervention and prevention category, where a lot more can be done.
""Because of stigma, many people with mental health issues are not seeking professional help. We hope CFL's programme will help the community gain a better understanding and also enable those who are not yet seeking proper help to do so in time.""
Dr Thio, who serves as CFL's executive director, sought to develop the LIFE programme's curriculum with a strong emphasis on community effort.
She said: ""We tend to do better with a strong social network of friends and family. As such, I am led to believe that suicide prevention efforts must involve the community, especially the loved ones and close friends of the individuals at-risk of suicide.""
CFL has collaborated with organisations such as the Institute of Mental Health, Samaritans of Singapore and ground-up movement SGFamilies.

Ms Carol Loi, co-founder of SGFamilies, said she participated in the programme to support those struggling with suicidal ideation as well as their next-of-kin.
""The programme helped me better understand how to broach the difficult topic of suicide and recognise that bringing the issue out in the open is helpful,"" she said.
Despite the progress she has witnessed and initiated in Singapore's mental health sector over the years, Dr Thio still remembers that young girl who ended her life years ago and asks herself the same questions:
""The questions from back then still ring in my ears today. What else could I have done? What did I miss? What now?
""If there is one thing I can take from that incident, it is this: I should have Listened and Inquired more, Found a Lifeline and Engaged a Professional's Help.""

"Budget debate: Covid-19 mental health task force to look into post-pandemic needs, develop national strategy",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/covid-19-mental-wellness-task-force-will-look-into-post-pandemic-needs-develop,"SINGAPORE - The Covid-19 mental health task force will be transformed into an inter-agency platform to oversee mental health and well-being efforts beyond the pandemic.
Announcing this during the debate for his ministry's budget on Friday (March 5), Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said the task force will focus on ""cross-cutting issues that require multi- and inter-agency collaborations"".
The pandemic has brought mental health issues to the forefront, with more seeking help for such conditions during the outbreak.
Dr Janil said that the task force, which was set up in October last year to look into the psycho-social impact of the pandemic on the population, has highlighted three areas to be worked on.
First, it will develop a national mental health and well-being strategy to align and guide the work of various agencies in the area. Second, it will develop a national mental health resources webpage to help individuals access useful and accurate information.
Third, it will establish a national mental health competency training framework to align and standardise training curricula on mental health in the community.
Task force chairman Chua Hong Choon told The Straits Times on Friday that the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) will lead the development of this framework.
Its work will include coming up with a national mental health curriculum for the management of mental health issues among front-line workers, and more training to bridge the knowledge gap on mental health among general practitioners.
He added that while the pandemic negatively impacted the well-being of those here in many ways, it also produced three positive outcomes.
First, multiple agencies are now coming together with renewed impetus to support people who experience mental health distress.
Second, there is greater awareness that mental health issues are not uncommon as more people come forward to share their experiences publicly.
""This helps to de-stigmatise mental health conditions, and encourage more people to self-care and seek help from the community,"" said Professor Chua.
Third, there is also a strong commitment at the government level to invest resources to further strengthen mental health resilience in the population.
""There is a saying within the task force that as we vaccinate ourselves against the Covid-19 virus, building resilience is our 'vaccine' against mental health issues,"" said Prof Chua.
The task force is to be transformed by the middle of this year, and more details will be shared when ready.

Dr Janil said in Parliament that Singapore is on track to meet its end-of-year targets for the Community Mental Health Masterplan, which was launched in 2012 and enhanced in 2017.
In 2017, then Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor had said that Singapore would set up 50 community outreach teams and 18 community intervention teams by the end of 2021.
Dr Janil updated the House that 50 community outreach teams have already been set up and reached out to over 350,000 persons with mental health or dementia needs, while 21 community intervention teams have been established to provide mental health interventions such as psycho-social therapeutic interventions and counselling; ahead of the previous timeline.
Singapore also now has over 220 general practitioners and 14 polyclinics that can provide patients with either mental health or dementia services, or both.
Speaking in the same debate, Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam added that in August last year, the ""Brave the New"" campaign was launched to build the psychological resilience of individuals.
The campaign provided tips for self-care, and information to support their peers and loved ones, and reached 2.1 million Singaporeans.
Ms Rahayu said that three-quarters of those surveyed reported being more motivated to help themselves or others in their mental wellbeing.
In order to complement this, the ""Hi!JustCheckingIn"" movement kicked off in January this year to equip targeted segments of the population with the appropriate skills to help them identify and reach out to those who may need support.
""Building a supportive community is important, to encourage Singaporeans to seek help if they are unable to cope,"" said Ms Rahayu.

Physical infrastructure
Dr Janil noted that refurbishment works at IMH, which began in 2018, are expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
Upon completion, IMH will have a new short-stay unit to manage patients who need a few days of observation and treatment, six upgraded acute psychiatric wards with modular flexibility for more efficient care of patients, and two new rehabilitative wards mimicking a home environment to facilitate recovery.
It will also have an upgraded child and adolescent psychiatry ward to provide inpatient psychiatric care for younger patients and an upgraded Addiction Medicine ward to facilitate recovery and rehabilitation of patients.
Helping the young and old
Turning to the subject of youth mental health, Dr Janil noted that the Integrated Youth Service - a programme giving at-risk youth access to coordinated mental health and social support services - has been piloted in partnership with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), IMH and community partner Care Corner.
Since April last year, the latter has begun community outreach using online platforms, and has reached out to over 2,600 users online.
Dr Janil added that MOH and AIC have also worked with other community partners to set up youth community outreach teams to reach out to young people in mental distress to provide basic emotional support and resources.
Such teams also engage families to understand stressors the youth may be facing, as well as their situation at home, and help provide links to social and health services.

Help for seniors at risk of mental health conditions or dementia
There are teams that reach out to residents and their caregivers to provide information on mental health or dementia, basic emotional support, and link them to the appropriate health or social services where necessary.
Seniors at risk of social isolation are connected to befrienders by the active ageing centres, the Silver Generation Office and local grassroots organisations.
These befrienders will reach out to the seniors on a regular basis, provide companionship and encourage them to participate in social activities. Seniors can also sign up with CareLine, a 24/7 social support hotline that provides tele-befriending services as well as emergency response to seniors in distress.
Ms Rahayu added that many seniors were mentally and physically affected during the pandemic, especially during the circuit breaker last year.
She said that last year, the virtual ""Balik Kampung"" programme was trialled and linked 100 seniors with 22 senior activity centres for mentally stimulating activities.
""With good feedback on how it has helped seniors stay socially connected, we will ramp up these efforts,"" she said.
Dr Janil said: ""Our ability to get this far was the result of many years of investing in our people, facilities, systems, research and capabilities. We must learn the lessons from this experience. The preparations for the next crisis are under way and require that we keep ourselves and our healthcare system in good health. Prevention is best; preparation is also necessary.""

Budget debate: New task force to boost women and children's health,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/helping-children-get-a-head-start-even-before-they-are-born,"SINGAPORE - A new inter-agency task force has been set up to ensure there is comprehensive support to help women prepare for motherhood, and help children attain good health and well-being from their early years.
Local research by the Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes, or Gusto, study has shown that a mother's health can directly influence her child's development, and that a child's early years can have a lasting impact on later life outcomes.
""These findings underscore the importance of intervening early in life to prevent disadvantages from snowballing, and that parents play a key role to a child's longer-term development,"" said Second Minister of Health Masagos Zulkifli at the Ministry of Health's budget debate on Friday (March 5).
He will chair the task force that will oversee the development and implementation of a five-year Child and Maternal Health & Well-being action plan.
""Its scope will span from preconception to adolescents aged 18 years old - many critical developmental milestones occur then,"" said Mr Masagos, who is also the Minister for Social and Family Development.
""These are part of our larger efforts to improve the population's health by addressing individual health needs and modifiable risk factors, beyond the healthcare domain.""
The task force will bring together various agencies such as the Early Childhood Development Agency, Health Promotion Board, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth , Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Prime Minister's Office and public healthcare clusters.
Discussions on what will be in the plan started at the beginning of the year and will continue this year. The plan will be implemented in phases, with the first phase expected to be ready by early next year.
Professor Chong Yap Seng, a member of the action plan's work group, said they will look at how to keep women in good physical and mental health for motherhood, support the development of a healthier next generation and reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity through sustained lifestyle changes.
Prof Chong, who is the executive director of the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, A*Star (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), said that poor mental health in pregnant women has been shown to have an adverse impact on their children.
Nearly 40 per cent of the mothers in the Gusto study had high levels of depressive symptoms, which were associated with changes in their babies' brains on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at birth, which persisted even at four years of life, he said.
""The children of mothers with high levels of depressive symptoms also performed poorer in tests of their socio-emotional regulation, executive function, reasoning, memory and other pre-academic skills at four years of age.""
Prof Chong, who is the study's lead principal investigator and dean of the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said that other studies have shown that mental health disorders are a major burden among children and adolescents in Singapore.
""Approximately one in 10 pregnant women exhibits clinical symptoms of depression. One in 25 women has depressive symptoms after delivery that required intervention,"" said another action plan work group member, Associate Professor Chan Yoke Hwee, who is chairman of the division of medicine at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

""This problem is not uncommon, and can be detected through systematic screening and assessment. However, the challenges lie in raising awareness in the society about this issue and encouraging women to undergo assessment and intervention if required.""
Prof Chong said: ""Pregnancy is like national service, so employers have to be fair to them. Maybe maternity leave needs to be enhanced or lengthened.""
In coming up with various initiatives, the task force will also help to boost flagging fertility rates and reduce the mental health burden in mothers and children, he said.
Furthermore, Singapore has one of the highest rates of gestational diabetes in the world. These mothers have a two in five chance of going on to have diabetes or pre-diabetes within the next six years and their children will have a higher risk of obesity, diabetes and neuro-behavioural issues, said Prof Chong.

Digital resources available to help parents learn about children's mental well-being: Eric Chua,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/digital-resources-available-to-help-parents-learn-about-childrens-mental-well-being-eric,"SINGAPORE - Parents today can tap on a variety of digital resources to better support their children's mental health, said Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua.
These include the Share-the-Care video series by Families for Life, which covers topics such as building strong family relationships, as well as his ministry's Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) that outlines evidence-based techniques to promote children's psychological, social and emotional competence.
Families for Life is a people-sector council under the Ministry of Social and Family Development, comprising 15 volunteers from the people and private sectors.
On top of that, the Temasek Foundation and Agency for Integrated Care has developed a microsite to address mental health challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Chua said.
Called MyMentalHealth, the website is a repository of articles and resources to help caregivers and parents manage mental health stress.
Mr Chua was responding in Parliament to Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon GRC), who had asked about inter-ministry efforts to promote youth mental health awareness among parents.
On the reach of the Triple P, he said more than 30,000 parents had benefited from the programme to date. After three months, parents reported a 20 per cent reduction in their children's scores for problematic behaviour, as well as their own parenting stress scores.
Parents can sign up for the programme by contacting the Parenting Support Providers serving their child’s school or region, or approach the child’s school teacher-in-charge of parenting programmes.
He added that more than 1,500 individuals - including young people, parents and mental health professionals - also came together to start the Youth Mental Well-Being Network last year. This network is supported by the Ministry for Social and Family Development, as well as the Health and Education ministries.
""We have parents coming back to tell us that they now have greater parenting competence,"" he added.
Ms Tan then asked if there are plans to take such programmes offline and into the real world, especially for parents who may not ""naturally gravitate"" towards finding information online.
Online platforms are being heavily used at present given the ongoing pandemic, Mr Chua replied, but added that his ministry will nevertheless work with community partners as much as possible.

"British press were 'destroying my mental health', says Prince Harry",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/british-press-were-destroying-my-mental-health-says-prince-harry,"NEW YORK (AFP) - Britain's Prince Harry said in a rare one-on-one interview that he left royal life because the British press was ""destroying"" his mental health, and revealed he watches The Crown.
Harry gave an intimate insight into his young family's new life in Los Angeles during an open-top bus tour of the city with The Late Late Show host James Corden.
""We all know what the British press can be like, and it was destroying my mental health,"" said Harry, who relocated to the United States with wife Meghan Markle last year.
""I was, like, this is toxic. So I did what any husband and what any father would do. I need to get my family out of here.""
Harry and Markle's shock announcement in January 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties rocked Britain's royal family, with British newspapers dubbing it ""Megxit"".
Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace announced that the couple had permanently quit royal duties following a one-year review of the new arrangement.
Queen Elizabeth II ordered the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are formally known, to relinquish their honorary titles and patronages.
""It was never walking away,"" Harry, 36, told Corden. ""It was stepping back rather than stepping down. It was a really difficult environment.""
Harry has long had a difficult relationship with Britain's tabloids, blaming press intrusion for contributing to his mother Princess Diana's death in a car crash in 1997.
Earlier this month, Markle won a high-profile privacy claim against Associated Newspapers for publishing a private letter that she wrote to her estranged father.
Harry said he was ""more comfortable"" with the portrayal of the royal family in the hit Netflix series The Crown than he is with newspaper stories written about him and his family.
""They don't pretend to be news. It's fictional,"" Harry said of the show.
""It's loosely based on the truth. Of course, it's not strictly accurate, but it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.""

Harry and Corden visited the house from hit 1990s US TV series The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. They voice-called Markle, who referred to Harry as ""Haz"".
Harry said that he had Zoomed with the Queen and Prince Philip so they could see their great-grandson Archie.
The prince revealed that Archie's first word was ""crocodile"" and that the Queen had sent Archie a waffle maker for Christmas.
Harry also described evenings at their Santa Barbara home.
""Depending on how the day's been and how busy it's been, we do Archie's tea, give him a bath, read him a book, put him down, go downstairs.
""Meg might cook a meal, might order a takeaway, go upstairs sit in bed, turn the TV on, watch some Jeopardy, maybe watch a little bit of Netflix,"" the prince said.
The release of the interview comes a week before Harry and Markle's controversial interview with Oprah Winfrey will air.

askST: How to avoid mental health discrimination when hiring,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/askst-how-to-avoid-mental-health-discrimination-when-hiring,"Mental health issues are rising, not least with the health, financial and psychological stresses brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
In October last year, several mental health clinicians and service providers told The Straits Times that more people in Singapore had been seeking help for mental health issues amid the virus outbreak.
To help those battling this silent disease, there needs to be more support and awareness of it — not just at home but in the workplace too.
Q: At a recent job interview, an employer told me that the company would not hire individuals with mental health conditions. The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices does not mention mental health conditions as an area where employers are not allowed to discriminate. Will I be protected if I face discrimination from employers due to a mental health condition?
A: Employers are expected to hire and select employees on the basis of merit. Any hiring decisions that are not merit-based may be in breach of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.
The Guidelines say that employers should not discriminate against potential employees on the basis of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, and disability. This list is not exhaustive and highlights more common examples of discrimination. Tafep will look into all cases of workplace discrimination, even if they arise from attributes not cited as examples in the Guidelines.
If an employer lists a hiring requirement that is not merit-based or relevant to the job, the onus is on him or her to prove grounds for excluding candidates on this basis.
In your case, Tafep would find the employer discriminatory if he or she is unable to reasonably justify why individuals with mental health conditions cannot do the job. Tafep works closely with the Ministry of Manpower to take action against employers who do not abide by the Guidelines.
Q: I interviewed someone for a training manager position who seemed to be a good fit based on his skills and work experience. He declared in the job application form that he has a mental health condition, which is fully under control with medication. How do I manage this situation?
A: Before starting the hiring process, you should ensure that your job application forms only collect information directly related to the qualifications, skills, knowledge and experience required for the role.
All declarations on mental health conditions should be removed from job application forms. People with mental health conditions can contribute actively and perform well at the workplace, and you should assess this candidate based on objective criteria related to the job scope.
Examples of other fields that should not be included are age, gender, race, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, and disability; these are not exhaustive. You should clearly state reasons for collecting information that may be viewed by jobseekers as discriminatory.
If a jobseeker brings up his mental health condition during the interview or upon selection, you are encouraged to have an open and honest conversation with him to find out more about his needs and explore how existing work arrangements can meet his needs.
For instance, you can consider extending your organisation’s flexible work arrangements to the employee for occasional medical follow-ups. At the same time, you should help the jobseeker to accurately understand the demands of the job scope by making your expectations clear and coming to an understanding on what is required of him.
Avoid unconscious biases, especially in the way you hire and treat your employees. For help or guidance, read the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices or attend a clinic conducted by Tafep to review whether your employment practices are fair and progressive.
Advice and guidance
Tafep helps employers build workplaces where employees are respected, valued and able to achieve their fullest potential for the success of the organisation.
If you face workplace-related discrimination or unreasonable employment practices, you can submit an online report at tafep.sg/contact-us or call 6838-0969 to speak to a Tafep officer.
Tafep’s operating hours are Monday to Friday, 8.30am to 5.30pm, excluding public holidays.

Japan's emperor calls for more effort to stop suicides as 'Minister of Loneliness' starts work,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/emperor-naruhito-calls-for-greater-effort-to-prevent-suicides-japans-first-minister,"TOKYO - Japan's struggle with suicide has been well-documented even as deaths due to suicide had been declining for 11 straight years until Covid-19 hit.
From the country's notorious ""suicide forest"" of Aokigahara - one of the world's most-used suicide sites - to Takahiro Shiraishi, rapist and serial killer who used Twitter to lure suicidal women to his home, the spectre of suicide looms large over Japan and its perception abroad.
Behind every suicide and suicide attempt is an individual tragedy further exacerbated by isolation and lack of a social support network. Suicide has been consistently ranked among the top 10 causes of death in Japan for the past decade.
Amid the coronavirus pandemic last year, suicide fatalities in Japan increased by 3.7 per cent to 20,919, exhibiting a worrisome spike among women and youth.
Emperor Naruhito, who turned 61 on Tuesday (Feb 23), said that he felt pained by the increase in suicides and urged for all-out preventive efforts and greater support for vulnerable groups.
Comparatively, Japan registered 3,492 deaths due to Covid-19 last year. As at Monday (Feb 22), the country's total coronavirus death toll stood at 7,549.
The number of suicide deaths last year is well under the all-time high of 34,427 recorded in 2003. But last year also marks the first year-on-year rise since the 2009 financial crisis.
This prompted Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to create a new Cabinet post to address mental health issues.
Mr Tetsushi Sakamoto, 70, who is concurrently regional revitalisation minister and minister-in-charge of reversing Japan's falling birthrate, takes on the position of ""Minister of Loneliness"".
He heads a new office on suicide countermeasures, with about 30 officials, that began work last Friday.
""Women are suffering from isolation more (than men are), and the number of suicides is on a rising trend. I hope you will identify problems and promote policy measures comprehensively,"" Mr Suga instructed Mr Sakamoto.
Japan follows in the footsteps of Britain which, in 2018, appointed a minister in charge of loneliness. London defines loneliness as ""a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship"".
Mr Sakamoto wrote on his personal homepage: ""It seems that Britain's isolation problem lies with its elderly. But in Japan, the problem is lurking across age groups - including children, young people, women and older people - a problem that has manifested with the prolonged Covid-19 crisis.""
Japan has grappled with isolation issues described by words such as hikikomori (acute reclusiveness, typically of people who are unemployed and shun social interaction) and kodokushi (dying alone, a growing problem with a rise in single households).
This has been compounded by Covid-19. Waseda University sociologist Michiko Ueda, who studies suicide, said that women and youth are at higher risk of feeling psychologically cornered.
She noted that women are more likely to be contract workers whose jobs are at greater risk of being terminated, and are more likely to work in service industries that are hard-hit by the pandemic.

Japan's suicides jump 16% in Covid-19 second wave after fall in 1st wave: Study
Japanese suicides decline to lowest level in over 40 years
Youth, meanwhile, may feel isolated from being unable to attend school in person, she said, citing a study by the National Centre for Child Health and Development that showed 72 per cent of students reporting stress and 28 per cent depression from school closures.
This has borne out in the suicide data. While male suicide deaths last year fell 1 per cent from 2019 to 13,943, female suicide deaths jumped 14.5 per cent to 6,976.
The number of elementary, junior high and high school students who died by suicide surged 40 per cent to 479 last year, the highest since records began in 1980, Education Ministry figures show.
Japan was also rocked by a series of high-profile celebrity suicides last year, including reality television star Hana Kimura, 22, actor Haruma Miura, 30, and Yuko Takeuchi, 40.
Prof Ueda expressed concern that these deaths could have inspired copycat suicides. Female suicides soared 90 per cent in October from the same month last year after the abrupt death of Ms Takeuchi, an award-winning popular actress at the height of her career, on Sept 27.
Last month, it was reported that a mother in her 30s killed herself out of guilt, haunted by the possibility that she had caught Covid-19 and spread it to her husband and daughter.
""I'm so sorry to have caused trouble,"" she reportedly said in her suicide note.
She is one of the 1,646 suicides last month, when Japan enacted a state of emergency as it battles a third wave of Covid-19 cases.
This may be a decline from 1,694 in December and from 1,680 in the same month last year, but Prof Ueda said that the situation remains severe and called for customised proactive approaches that target vulnerable groups, beyond conventional strategies such as helplines.

How are you? These NTU students want to know,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/how-are-you-these-ntu-students-want-to-know,"SINGAPORE - With mental health increasingly of concern during the pandemic, a group of undergraduates have rolled out a project to tell young people it is okay to not be okay.
The group have introduced podcasts on the topic and are facilitating conversations about mental health with an event called Conversation Cafe, which starts on Thursday (Feb 25) and runs till Monday.
""Our group wanted to target a topic that is relevant during these uncertain times,"" says Ms Ong Shi Ting, 23, a final-year student from Nanyang Technological University's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, who co-founded the project with three schoolmates.
Conversation Cafe, which is for youth aged 19 to 24, is held in collaboration with the National Council of Social Service's Beyond the Label campaign, which aims to dispel the stigma faced by people with mental health conditions.
The event will take place at the Main Street Commissary cafe in Rowell Road, with participants divided into groups of four to six.
They will make use of question cards from Beyond the Label's expansion pack of the card game Smol Tok. There will be 42 cards with prompts such as ""What helps you get through a difficult day?"" to get players to share their experiences and thoughts pertaining to mental health. Each session can last up to 90 minutes.
""To facilitate such intimate conversations among close friends, we designed the event in a cafe environment to allow this dialogue to happen in a safe, everyday space that youth feel comfortable in,"" says Ms Macabelle Chan, 24, one of the group members.
They conducted an online survey in October last year with about 200 people aged 19 to 24 and found that 70 per cent of participants did not know how to identify a person with depression or were unsure about doing so.

Nearly six in 10 said they were unsure of or did not know how to give advice to a person with depression.
The NTU group also came up with bite-sized information posts on Instagram and weekly podcasts on Spotify to raise awareness of mental health issues.
Their podcast, Pods for Support, invited guests such as influencer Nicole Choo and mental health advocate Ron Yap to share their expertise and experiences with depression each week.
""This is our part to empower our listeners and let them know they are not alone in facing depression,"" Ms Ong says.
• Conversation Cafe slots are still available for Thursday and Monday and can be booked at this website. For more information, go to this Instagram page.

Mental health issues rise among Japanese women amid Covid-19 crisis,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/as-covid-19-pandemic-takes-hold-mental-health-issues-rise-among-japanese-women,"TOKYO (NYTIMES) - Not long after Japan ramped up its fight against the coronavirus last spring, Ms Nazuna Hashimoto started suffering panic attacks. The gym in Osaka where she worked as a personal trainer suspended operations, and her friends were staying home at the recommendation of the government.
Afraid to be alone, she would call her boyfriend of just a few months and ask him to come over. Even then, she was sometimes unable to stop crying. Her depression, which had been diagnosed earlier in the year, spiralled.
""The world I was living in was already small,"" she said. ""But I felt it become smaller.""
By July, Ms Hashimoto could see no way out, and she tried to kill herself. Her boyfriend found her, called an ambulance and saved her life. She is speaking out publicly about her experience now because she wants to remove the stigma associated with talking about mental health in Japan.
While the pandemic has been difficult for many in Japan, the pressures have been compounded for women. As in many countries, more women have lost their jobs. In Tokyo, the country's largest metropolis, about one in five women live alone, and the exhortations to stay home and avoid visiting family have exacerbated feelings of isolation.
Other women have struggled with the deep disparities in the division of housework and childcare during the work-from-home period, or suffered from a rise in domestic violence and sexual assault.
The rising psychological and physical toll of the pandemic has been accompanied by a worrisome spike in suicide among women. In Japan, 6,976 women took their lives last year, nearly 15 per cent more than in 2019. It was the first year-over-year increase in more than a decade.
Each suicide - and suicide attempt - represents an individual tragedy rooted in a complex constellation of reasons. But the increase among women, which extended across seven straight months last year, has concerned government officials and mental health experts who have worked to reduce what had been among the highest rates of suicide in the world.
Japanese culture
The situation has reinforced long-standing challenges for Japan. Talking about mental health issues, or seeking help, is still difficult in a society that emphasises stoicism.
The pandemic has also amplified the stresses in a culture that is grounded in social cohesion and relies on peer pressure to drive compliance with government requests to wear masks and practise good hygiene. Women, who are often designated as primary caregivers, at times fear public humiliation if they somehow fail to uphold these measures or get infected with the coronavirus.
""Women bear the burden of doing virus prevention,"" said Ms Yuki Nishimura, a director of the Japanese Association of Mental Health Services. ""Women have to look after their families' health, and they have to look after cleanliness and can get looked down upon if they are not doing it right.""
Associate professor of political science Michiko Ueda from Waseda University in Tokyo, who has researched suicide, said that, unfortunately, the current tendency is to blame the victim. In surveys last year, 40 per cent of respondents worried about social pressure if they contracted the virus, she said.
Experts have also worried that a succession of Japanese film and television stars who took their own lives last year may have spurred a string of copycat suicides.
After Yuko Takeuchi, a popular, award-winning actress, took her life in late September, the number of women taking their own lives in the following month jumped by close to 90 per cent compared to the previous year.
Shortly after Takeuchi's death, Nao, 30, started writing a blog to chronicle her lifelong battles with depression and eating disorders. She wrote candidly about her suicide attempt three years earlier.
Such openness about mental health struggles is still relatively rare in Japan. The celebrity suicides prompted Nao, whose family name has been withheld at her request to protect her privacy, to reflect on how she might have reacted if she had hit her emotional nadir during the pandemic.
""When you're at home alone, you feel very isolated from society and that feeling is really painful,"" she said.

Job losses
During the pandemic, women have suffered disproportionate job losses. They made up the bulk of employees within the industries most affected by infection control measures, including restaurants, bars and hotels.
About half of all working women hold part-time or contract jobs, and when business flatlined, companies cut those employees first. In the first nine months of last year, 1.44 million such workers lost their jobs, more than half of them women.
In the past, suicide rates in Japan have spiked during times of economic crisis, including after the burst of the property-based bubble in the 1990s and the global downturn in 2008.
During those periods, it was men who were most affected by job losses and who killed themselves at higher rates. Historically, suicides among men in Japan have outnumbered those among women by a factor of at least 2-1.
In Ms Hashimoto's case, fears of financial dependence contributed to her sense of hopelessness.
Even when the gym where she worked as a personal trainer reopened, she did not feel emotionally stable enough to return. She then felt guilty about relying on her boyfriend, Mr Nozomu Takeda, 23, emotionally and financially.
Unable to afford therapy and suffering severe anxiety attacks, Ms Hashimoto said she identified with others who ""felt very pushed into a corner"".
Even those who have not lost jobs may have come under extra stress.
Before the pandemic, working from home was extremely rare in Japan. Then women suddenly had to worry not only about pleasing their bosses from afar, but also about juggling new safety and hygiene protocols for their children, or protecting elderly parents who were more vulnerable to the virus.
The expectations to excel did not change, but their contact with friends and other support networks diminished.
""If they can't get together with other people or share their stresses with other people, then it's not really surprising"" that they are feeling pressured or depressed, said professor of sociology Kumiko Nemoto from Kyoto University of Foreign Studies.

Helping others
Having survived her own suicide attempt, Ms Hashimoto now wants to help others learn to talk through their emotional problems and connect them to professionals.
Mr Takeda said he appreciates how Ms Hashimoto speaks openly about her depression. ""She is the type of person who really shares what she needs and what is wrong,"" he said. ""So it was very easy for me to support her because she vocalises what she needs.""
Eventually, Ms Hashimoto would like to train as a therapist herself, with a special focus on women.
""The country has mainly focused on moving women up the career ladder and their economic well-being,"" she said. ""But I would like to emphasise women's mental health.""

Cricket: India's Kohli says he suffered from depression,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/cricket-indias-kohli-says-he-suffered-from-depression,"NEW DELHI (AFP) - Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli has revealed that he struggled with depression and felt like the ""loneliest guy in the world"" after failing with the bat during a tour of England in 2014.
Kohli, one of the highest-paid athletes in the world with a net worth of US$26 million (S$34.4 million), also said that a chat with the legendary Sachin Tendulkar helped him through the mental-health crisis.
The 32-year-old batsman made the revelations on a podcast with English commentator and former cricketer Mark Nicholas.
""I did (feel depressed). It's not a great feeling to wake up knowing that you won't be able to score runs and I think all batsmen have felt that at some stage that you are not in control of anything at all,"" said Kohli, who is adored by millions of fans for his tough and competitive on-field persona.
""You just didn't understand how to get over it. That was a phase when I literally couldn't do anything to overturn things... I felt like I was the loneliest guy in the world.""
The Indian skipper averaged just 13.50 from five Tests in that series, which India lost 3-1 after drawing the opener.
Kohli said he felt lonely despite having supportive people in his life.
""Personally, for me that was a revelation that you could feel that lonely even though you are a part of a big group,"" said the cricketer, who married top Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma in 2017.
""I won't say I didn't have people who I could speak to but not having a professional to speak to who could understand what I am going through completely, I think is a huge factor.""
Kohli added that he heeded advice from Tendulkar about letting the feeling pass instead of fighting it.
""If you start fighting that feeling, it grows stronger. So, that is the advice I took on board and my mindset really opened up from then on.""
Kohli is leading India against England in a four-Test home series tied 1-1.

Olympics: Skateboarding eyes brighter future with US Olympic and Paralympic body's support on mental issues,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/olympics-skateboarding-eyes-brighter-future-with-us-olympic-and-paralympic-bodys-support-on,"LOS ANGELES (REUTERS) - The skateboarding community, rocked by several prominent deaths related to mental health issues, is hoping the benefits that go with the sport's inclusion in this year's Tokyo Olympics will help its athletes tackle the underlying problems.
Briton Ben Raemers died by suicide in 2019, skateboarding pioneer Jeff Grosso passed away after a drug overdose in 2020, and 22-year-old Henry Gartland took his own life last month, highlighting the urgent need to address issues like depression and addiction.
""Skateboarding is a very tight-knit community,"" said USA Skateboarding chief executive officer Josh Friedberg.
""Everyone has these links to each other and that makes losses like these tougher to deal with because there's so many personal connections.
""The good news is that it's causing people to think more deeply about mental health in skateboarding - trying to figure out new ways to support the people that they love and care about.""
Friedberg said one key development is that the athletes now have access to the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) mental health services for the first time.
""We've been really lucky to have the support of the USOPC in this situation,"" he said. ""They have been proactive in providing mental health resource for our team and staff.""
Tony Hawk, one of the world's most famous skateboarders, said that while there has been progress in combating the stigma associated with mental health, more work needs to be done.
""I'd like to say it's more open now, but there have been times when I've heard of someone struggling or even pass away and it's very hush-hush as to what happened.
""As much as I respect the privacy of families, I think it's a disservice to not bring that to light so people understand that hey, everyone is struggling.""
Battling addiction
Veteran skateboarder Brandon Turner has made it his mission to use his own battles with substance abuse to help those who find themselves on the same destructive path.
Turner, a prodigy who rose to fame during the sport's era of excess in the 1990s, nearly lost his life several times due to drinking-related incidents that included leaping from a bridge and being hit by a car.
""It was fun 24/7, which is unmanageable for anyone,"" he recalls of the sport's early days.
Now 39, Turner devotes his time to supporting skaters who want to get sober through his work with San Diego rehab centre Healthy Life Recovery. He has also experienced a career renaissance.

""I'm trying to let people know that there is hope,"" he said.
He said perceptions around mental health are evolving.
""Things are getting better because when I was growing up, if I was talking about my feelings, I would have been put in a headlock.
""People are starting to empathise now and getting more awareness, which is awesome.""
Hawk said skateboarding, which has seen a surge in the sale of boards amid coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdowns and which will reach a massive new audience after it is showcased on the Olympic stage, has a bright future.
""I feel like there's hope on the horizon,"" he said. ""Skateboarding is more popular than ever, I'm thankful for that. Let's just get on the other side of all of this.""",,TRUE
"Student who had anxiety, panic attacks took a year off while preparing for A levels",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/student-opts-for-a-gap-year-during-a-levels-to-take-control-of-her,"SINGAPORE - Taking a full year off while preparing for the A levels would be unimaginable for most students.
But it was necessary for the mental health of 20-year-old Megan Chan, a former Yishun Innova Junior College student, who received her results with the rest of her cohort on Friday (Feb 19).
""I think I was a bit of a perfectionist, wanting everything to be well, and school, with all the pressure of exams, provided a situation that was not ideal,"" said Ms Chan, who suffered from anxiety and panic attacks.
""With the heightened anxiety, listening and understanding whatever was being taught was even harder, so it really affected my studies,"" she said.
With the support of her school and parents, Ms Chan decided to take the year off after her first year of junior college, spending the time reading and working on her physical and emotional health.
""I just felt lost and without direction, but being able to have the control and independence to plan my days was really good for me,"" she said.
""I used to dread waking up early for school but during that gap year, I slept at 10pm and woke up at 6am because I enjoyed the routine,"" she added.
""I really appreciated that I had the choice to make my life how I wanted it to be and that I could live in the reality I was creating for myself.""
After a year of taking care of herself, Ms Chan, who has been working part-time at a child support centre while awaiting her results, decided to return to finish her A levels. She wanted to prove to herself that she could achieve what she had set out to do, and because she wanted to make her parents proud.
On Friday afternoon, Ms Chan received 80 out of a possible 90 rank points, a result she said her family and her are happy with.
When asked what she would say to somebody in a similar predicament as hers, Ms Chan said: ""Nobody's struggle is the same but I think they should recognise that having this condition is not a choice, and that you should hold on to the belief that there is light at the end of the tunnel.""
She plans to pursue either social sciences or business-related studies at university.

Students get mental health lessons on how to spot signs of distress and seek help,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/mental-health-lessons-teach-secondary-school-students-to-spot-signs-of,"SINGAPORE - Facing his Secondary 2 form class, Mr Michael Chow shared with them his own series of setbacks since young, from family problems to having to scale back on sports when he tore a ligament in his right knee.
The 38-year-old Serangoon Secondary School teacher weaved in his personal experiences into a character and citizenship education (CCE) lesson on Thursday (Feb 18), to illustrate the importance of recognising stress and finding different ways to cope.
Mental health education has been included in the refreshed CCE curriculum for secondary schools from this year, along with a greater emphasis on peer support.
These plans were announced as part of last year's debate on the Education Ministry's budget.
Thursday's session, at which the media was invited to observe, was the first in a series on mental health at Serangoon Secondary School.
During the class, the students watched video clips presenting scenarios of teens facing various pressures like schoolwork or negative thoughts, and the different coping strategies.
Using a digital app, Padlet, the students discussed how they can identify stress, when such feelings might become overwhelming and turn into distress, as well as how they can seek help in such situations.
Mr Chow, a specialised CCE teacher, said: ""I notice the things that they write and issues they bring up. These lessons bring about greater awareness of real struggles they have.
""When students respond to scenarios, we can roughly deduce that they're facing certain issues at home or in school, or with classmates.""
The school also started peer support training last year. These sessions cover calming-down techniques like breathing exercises and ways to detect changes in emotions.
It now has 26 dedicated peer support leaders across the school - one per class - and aims to increase this to two per class next year. Student and co-curricular activity leaders are also sent for training in peer support.

Ms Moritza Lim, the school's subject head for student well-being, said: ""We equip them with strategies to know how to spot friends in distress, how to listen actively to them and channel any needs to teachers.
""We tell them 'you're the first line of support for your friends, but you're not alone'.""
She added: ""When students raise any cases to us, it helps us to intervene early. So far the challenges have been about family issues, studies, friendships, bullying and social exclusion.""

Secondary 2 student Kate Lau, 14, who is a peer support leader, said: ""I usually listen to my peers and let them talk about their issues. A lot of people may think that to help someone, you must save them, or be the hero. But usually they just need someone to listen to them, to care about them.""
She looks out for changes in behaviour, like getting angry over small things, losing concentration or not being as enthusiastic as before.
""There was once my friend did not do so well in school... she approached me and she trusted me because I was her friend. So I listened to her and I tried to help her,"" she said.
""I told her it's okay because it's just one test - it won't determine the rest of her life and she was going to be fine and she could talk to me if she needed to.""
Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling, who sat in on Thursday's lesson, said the increased focus on mental health in schools is timely, given the challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic may have brought about for students.

""Some of them may feel isolated, or may be facing problems in the family at home,"" she said, noting that young people today may also have their own pressures.
""Nowadays more young people are using social media, and they may feel that they have to present a certain front to keep up with their friends on social media, and that can bring about stress,"" she said.
""Through our CCE classes, students learn that it's actually okay to not feel okay and that they can talk to their friends, teachers, counsellors,"" said Ms Sun.
""I appreciate the fact that our specially trained CCE teachers also open up about themselves as adults to their students and (this) encourages sharing of experiences.""
Said Mr Chow: ""Don't think that your teachers are perfect; we have our own experiences too but we have learnt to deal with setbacks.
""When I was younger, I realised I needed to seek help - I had to talk it out with my closer friends.""
