1,"Love, Death and Fungi: What Mushrooms Can Teach Us About Our Relationship With Nature",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-love-death-fungi-mushrooms-can-teach-us-relationship-nature/,"Culture, People","All photography by Marisse Caine for Rice Media After a heavy rain, the forest lights up with foxfire.  From the hillsides of Bukit Batok to the green lung of Macritchie, clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms appear seemingly from out of nowhere and all at once, like psychedelic beacons in the darkness. This phantom light draws in the critters and insects of the forest, which helps the mushroom to cast its spores across Singapore like an invisible spell.  For the average city-dweller, the mushroom feels rather alien and unnatural. It is by turns attractive and disgusting; beautiful, yet vaguely unsettling. We fear it for its poison even as many fungi like lingzhi are prized in TCM for their rare healing properties. It’s the yeast that raises our bread and the mold that spoils it.  It exists in a liminal space between the living and the dead.  As Nature’s decomposers, mushrooms break things down. They remind us of things we’d prefer not to think about—death, disease and decay—even as they facilitate the most vital parts of life.   So much about the mushroom remains shrouded in mystery. In recent years, scientists have discovered an ‘internet of fungi’, a communication network made up of fungal threads called mycelium that’s buried beneath the soil like fiber-optic cables, connecting the forest together.  Through this network, large trees can donate essential nutrients to younger seedlings in the shade. Plants can warn their neighbours against predators or disease by sending chemical signals through the mycelia.  This network has existed for thousands of years. And even as we clear our forests to make way for development, most Singaporeans remain largely ignorant of the ancient mysteries buried beneath their feet.  Which begs the question: is it the mushroom that is alien or are we as human beings just alienated from Nature? Have You Met the Mushroom Man?  “For many years in my 20s I was just floating around in life,” says Ng Sze Kiat, 41. “I guess I was looking for something that I could dedicate myself to. Then one day, mushrooms came into the picture and I fell in love.”  This might sound like the opening monologue of a tree-hugging hippie, but a quick tour of Kiat’s lab at the heart of Bukit Merah quickly dispels this notion.  As the one-man R&D team behind Bewilder, the man knows his science. His primary occupation, that of growing mushrooms, is an intense and carefully tuned process.  First, Kiat collects mycelium samples from the wild and clones them in petri dishes in his lab. Once the mycelium starts to run cleanly, the cultures are then used to inoculate a container full of millet, where the web-like mycelium colonises the grain. Finally, the colonies are transferred to even larger bags of sawdust and wood chips, from which mushrooms start to fruit.   This is work that requires precision. One false move could contaminate the entire batch and undo weeks of work. So it’s strange, then, that Kiat would prefer to call himself an artist and his lab, a ‘mushroom design studio.’ Looking around, I can see examples of his artwork: unsettling sculptures of mushrooms growing out of replica human skulls and lamps with protruding mushrooms hanging from the ceiling.   “Growing mushrooms is as much about feel and intuition as getting the measurements right,” Kiat explains. “Fungi are fickle organisms. I know some scientists who can’t fruit mushrooms to save their life—even when they follow a fixed formula. On the other hand, some artists can grow mushrooms with one eye closed.” This kind of intuition has been honed through over a decade of experience. Before starting Bewilder, Kiat worked on a local farm, where he cultivated mushrooms from waste substrates by converting two disused toilets into his personal R&D lab. “I moved into the men’s toilet and covered the entire room with duct tape and plastic sheets,” he recalls wistfully. “The samples I kept in the urinal.  It was terrible because there was no ventilation in there. I had to step out every half hour just to get fresh air.”  These years of experimentation and play have made Kiat who he is today. Three years ago, the farm shut down and all of his cultures—a two-door fridge filled with them—were thrown away, leaving him to start from scratch again. For many, this would be a failure, but to Kiat, it held the promise of a blank canvas. Now in his early 40s, he no longer feels insecure about calling himself an artist.  “Looking back, I wouldn’t exactly call it an illustrious career,” says Kiat. “I guess I always had a rebellious streak. A bit stubborn. I don’t really fit the mold of your typical Singaporean.”  Despite his personal passion, mushrooms are only a means to an end.  Kiat’s primary goal is to educate the Singaporean public on the environment. As a business, Bewilder is structured like the mushrooms he grows: there’s an education component, where Kiat holds mushroom workshops with the public. The second spore is the R&D that goes into creating sustainable materials using fungi, a technology that could one day replace materials like styrofoam. Finally, there’s the F&B component, where he plans to supply top-quality mushrooms to high-end restaurants.  “Right now I’m in the colonising period,” says Kiat. “On one hand, it’s tough to do this because no one else in Singapore does it. It’s just me. But that’s cool. I get to play around. I get to shake things up. People in Singapore aren’t used to seeing this kind of stuff, so straight away, it attracts attention.” Ultimately, Kiat wants people to be more eco-literate at a younger age, to understand that we are all part of something that’s bigger than ourselves.   How Singaporeans Treat Nature A tree falling in the forest is a momentous event.  It provides much needed sunlight for saplings on the forest floor to grow. The trunk of the fallen tree becomes home to insects and fungi. As the tree decomposes, it becomes fertile soil for the next generation of life.  But in Singapore, who shows up first? The saplings and fungi? Or does NParks show up with a team to remove this ‘dangerous obstacle’?   “Singapore sells a pretty picture of green spaces and people living in harmony with nature,” said Kiat.  “A part of this is true. We’ve done a great job at putting greenery all around us. But do we really live in it? I don’t think so. When you look at parents and their kids at our crowded parks, it’s almost as if they don’t know how to interact freely with the natural world.” Garden City is both window-dressing and a clever marketing campaign for tourists. In reality, when a tree grows out of line in Singapore, we trim it. When there’s a hole, we fill it. Every bump in the road is smoothed over. Every risk and uncertainty is made more predictable.  We plant non-native trees along the roadside and are surprised when the roots don’t run deep and end up falling over.  But it wasn’t always this way. Singaporeans are just two generations removed from people who still know the names and uses of certain native plants and fungi. These traditions are kept alive in the makciks who still forage on Pulau Ubin today, and the villagers in remote corners of Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, these are largely oral traditions. They are not documented anywhere. In another generation, Singaporeans will become tourists in their own land.  “That’s what I feel angry about. In Singapore, it’s all about producing results,” says Kiat. “What’s the yield of this land? How much money can this make? When will it be ready to be consumed?“ “But hey, slow down, you know? Let’s try to understand the land we live on first, instead of thinking that we already know everything. That it’s all just there for our benefit. It’s so arrogant to think that way!” If there’s one silver lining to this pandemic, it’s the kick in everyone’s ass. We’ve been forced to slow down and confront the sometimes uncomfortable things about ourselves. It’s making us question the important things in life.  “Don’t get me wrong,” says Kiat. “Making money is important but it’s not the most important thing in the world.”  “Ultimately, we as human beings are the biggest problems on the planet. We are the cancer. So we need to find ways to keep ourselves in check.” “Besides that, I don’t have any easy answers.”   Please, Accept the Mystery “I fell in love with mushrooms because they both scare and excite me,” says Kiat.  ”When a fungi sample gets contaminated in my lab, it freaks me out too, okay? There are some molds that are so vile and toxic it’s almost too repulsive when you’re confronted with it. But at the same time it’s a push and pull thing. Why am I so repulsed by something so natural? It makes me want to understand it even more. That’s the contradiction. Everything in life is ultimately that lah.”  This attitude of curiosity and exploration feels out of place here.

There’s this tendency in Singapore to put people and things into boxes. You’re an artist. She’s a scientist. You belong in this box. She belongs in hers. This is the yield the land can generate and this is the economic value you can create. The line ends here. No trespassing. We rush to make ourselves useful without taking the time to truly come to terms with who we are and what we actually want.  As a result, Singapore’s brand of resilience is a fragile and stage-managed one. The constant interference with Nature and in people’s lives stunts their ability to innovate and adapt. It creates comfort without intimacy, safety without connection.  The roots run too shallow and the soil lacks the essential nutrients of life.  We’ve become disconnected from the land we live in and our memory and knowledge of it is fading faster than the forests are disappearing.  But if Covid has taught us anything, it’s that there’s no hiding from the uncertainty of the world. As the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.   There’s also no running away from ourselves.  “This is the way I see the world,” says Kiat. “There’s good stuff and bad stuff in it, but there’s no true good or evil. It’s all just one big mishmash of everything that’s constantly moving and changing.” As human beings, we have to remember that we’re part of this evolving mystery too.

2,Through Their Lenses: Teenage Mums,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-teenage-mums-disposable-camera/,"Culture, Life","A week after Raj asked her to be his girlfriend, Gerry discovered she was pregnant. She was 16 at the time, and had been sure she’d wanted an abortion. But she went on to miss every appointment made with the clinic (they only had early morning slots, and she kept oversleeping) until it was 5 months into the pregnancy, and the doctor told her that they’d have to kill the foetus before aborting. Raj and Gerry left the clinic, cried, smoked, and decided to keep the baby.  Belle was studying for her O-levels when she found out. The child became the single most important thing in her life, and she ditched her studies and started planning how she could raise him. People at school called her a disgrace for keeping the baby, and a slut, even though the father of her child was her first sexual partner. Autumn cried when she moved out to live with her in-laws. She used to be her parents’ little girl, and all of a sudden she had to be an adult and move out, without having given anything back to her own family.  Today, at 19, 20, and 22, Gerry, Belle, and Autumn couldn’t be happier to be mothers. All of them, in their own ways, agree that their lives have been made better for it, despite what were mistakes in their teenage years.  For this photo series, we gave the three of them disposable film cameras to capture their experiences being a young mother in Singapore. GERRY “The pregnancy was a very, very difficult part of my life. Raj and I were new to the relationship and had to settle into a fully committed one. We were still maturing individually, and there was a lot going on around me … I wasn’t on great terms with my family.  Those were very sad days, I couldn’t go out much because I’d get looks from the public, being so young, visibly pregnant with tattoos and all. I didn’t want to take public transport, I just cooped myself up at home, and I don’t know, they were sad times. But at the same time it felt very wholesome, feeling Asher’s kicks in me.” “Seeing Asher and Raj fall asleep together really warms my heart. Just knowing that someone else loves this child as much or more than I love him. I think about him in the future, about how he’ll see me and Raj. And that motivates me to want to continue with my education. I don’t want him to have to worry about our survival.” “It’s always close to sunset around the time we pick Asher up from preschool. There’s pretty skies, everyone is there with their kids and their dogs, doing their own things. Three of us would just get on the swing and chill for a while. It’s times like these, in our little bubble just for that 10 minutes or so, where I feel like our lives could be so much better if it was just the three of us, in a place of greenery.  I don’t like the environment that Asher is growing up in. Everywhere you look, there’s fucked up things happening. Around the world, and just downstairs. I wish I could give him better.” BELLE “I’m really glad I brought them (note: Belle is a mother of three boys, of whom the younger two are twins) into the world and I would do it over again.   I’d just like to say that young mums are just as capable as, if not more than, regular mums. Physically, because our bodies had to go through something meant to be experienced in adulthood, and mentally, because of the judgment we had to face. I wouldn’t say I’m the best mum in the world but I’m pretty sure I’m the best mum in their eyes. We’re very close.” “My twins have never really been outside because of Covid, it’s quite sad, they only know how our void deck looks like. For my eldest son, we used to bring him out a lot, now he can’t even go to school and everyday he’s saying he wants to go. Now my hubby and I usually dabao food back for the whole family. We also just like to go riding around on an e-bike.” “This picture of the sky was actually taken early in the morning. I hadn’t slept; I usually look after my kids at night, pat them to sleep, and change their diapers in the middle of the night. When my helper and grandma-in-law wakes up, then I’ll go to sleep. So this sunrise is the last thing I see before I sleep. If there’s work the next day sometimes I just don’t sleep.” AUTUMN “Being a mum at any age isn’t easy. If a woman is willing to go through that nine months then that child must be very precious. I believe these photographs tell a story, and when Grayson grows up he can see how much he’s loved.” “Grayson is like a treasure, he’s something that I didn’t ask for but he’s here for me. If I tell him that my leg hurts he will try to massage it; he’s very smart, we tell him things once and he will listen and learn, like when I sing him the ‘sun, moon, and stars’ song he will look outside the window and say ‘hello moon!’. Even the teacher calls me and says he’s very cute, clever, understanding.” “I don’t know why but I feel like he is the happiest thing. He brings a lot of joy everywhere he goes, and his presence bonds the family more, even our extended family. Everyone looks forward to seeing him, and being the first grandson he’s showered with a lot of love and attention. I used to be very insecure about my voice because people said it sounded cartoonish, and I was afraid to speak out. After having Grayson I feel more courage, like I can take on the world for him. To all the young moms out there, I’d say that being a young mom is tough, but definitely worth it. You don’t have to worry about other people’s judgment, because 在妈妈的眼里只有小孩 (in the eyes of a mother, there is only her child).” Author © 2020 Rice Media. All rights reserved ",,TRUE
3,How We Must Redefine ‘Racial Harmony’ for Singapore in 2021,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-redefine-racial-harmony-singapore-2021/,"Current Affairs, Features","All images from Rice File Photos unless otherwise stated. No one can seem to agree on what exactly racial harmony is. Or at least, what Singapore wants it to be.  Online discourse over the past few months has been a massive feedback loop of disenfranchisement. The recent spike in COVID-19 cases and its rapidly spreading B1617 variant has not only emboldened some Singaporeans to express noxious racist and xenophobic comments on social media but has also fueled public cases of unbridled targeted physical and verbal attacks. The latest lightning rod of controversy comes in the form of a Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer’s unprompted racist tirade at an interracial couple. In a video shared by Dave Parkash, the man accuses him of predatory behaviour, doubling down on shaming and hurling racist insults at the interracial couple even after being confronted. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam then responded, saying: “I used to believe that Singapore was moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony. Based on recent events, I am not so sure anymore. It is impossible to ignore the irony of a senior educator clad in a shirt with ‘Singapore’ emblazoned across his chest uttering typically implicit, veiled racist sentiments out loud. While nothing new, these long-simmering hostilities seem to be exacerbated by the profound exhaustion of the past year—and the seemingly never-ending, ever-mutating virus that has indirectly called into question the optics of Singapore’s racial harmony. Sure, there’re government benchmarks measuring its success based on abstract markers like being comfortable with having a neighbour of a different race and the lack of racial or religious tensions in our daily lives. There’s also the florid spiel we hear in school about how Racial Harmony Day commemorates the race riots of 1964. Never again, they say. Similarly, Singaporean youths can’t quite reach a consensus on what they want the idea of racial harmony to mean. “I would say that within Singapore, or around the globe, no country has reached racial harmony,” one remarked in a group discussion with Rice.  As disparate viewpoints accented the conversation, a small but diverse set of young Singaporeans cycled through their various interpretations. For a country whose national identity hinges so much on this indescribable, infinitely debatable concept, why do recent trends reveal a Singapore that is not, in fact, racially harmonious at all? CMIO CMI Plumbing into the depths of racial politics, the group first turned a gimlet eye upon the country’s unique structural relations.  One suggested that perhaps the vague notion of racial harmony can be read as moving past race entirely, that it should be a non-factor in the way we treat each other. Another attributed the current surge in blatant xenophobia and racism to our rigid understanding of race, an unfortunate and pervasive byproduct of the CMIO Model passed down from Singapore’s colonial past. In a survey conducted by Institute of Policy Studies and CNA, six in ten respondents indicated that race was important to them, which seemed to suggest that the Singaporean identity is still greatly enshrined in the CMIO framework.  While race-based policies such as the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and the reserved Presidential Election ensured minority representation in various institutions, it has, more importantly, been emphasised as a key structural reinforcement for minorities to practice their cultures without feeling like they would have to conform to the practices of the majority race. “What we struggle with is that with CMIO, you lose a lot of resolution in the form of racial subcultures … It’s not about ignoring race and pretending that (overlooking race) is understanding.” However, racial categorisation in Singapore is not something that is self-identified but is assigned by the state based on paternal lines of descent. “We are measuring today’s problems with yesterday’s policies,” he elaborates. Zeroing in on the Ethnic Integration Policy, a scheme enacted in 1989 to ensure a balanced mix of ethnicities in HDB estates to “promote racial harmony and strengthen social cohesion”, he laments that these goals don’t quite translate. Rather, its mechanical and impersonal design lends itself to a lack of organic, communal understanding. His peer chimes in that despite being surrounded by a diverse set of neighbours, he still keeps to himself. As for those who already confine themselves within their racial bubbles, the lack of meaningful interaction in HDB estates exacerbates things. This illuminates the glaring fault lines between the different racial groups. No Country for Old Values Most strikingly, the youths were especially eager to distance themselves from the inflexible ideologies that have come to be characteristic of older generations. “I think it’s easier for (my grandparent’s) generation to have the tendency to rely on race as an excuse”, one participant observed. This, as the group identified, is a double-edged sword that could result in one of two outcomes. These racist sentiments could either internalise themselves, passing through the generations, resulting in an infinite cycle of ignorance and intolerance. Or it could spawn a new batch of vocal and educated youth willing to acknowledge their culpability and challenge the prejudiced assumptions of the older generations. “I remember my father mentioned that (I) cannot take the lift (by myself) because the cleaners are foreign workers and therefore it is not safe. It is only when I started volunteering with migrant worker enterprises that I realised they are extremely precious. But it really stems from these organic opportunities,” commented a participant. Either way, it is hard to ignore that race will always be the first mark in the face of uncertainty and discomfort. The overarching narrative of racial harmony has, after all, been central to our country’s self-conception, making it an easy and inevitable scapegoat to avoid uncomfortable conversations about more complicated underlying issues. Take for example the inflammatory remarks made by local creative director Eugene Chong, who asserted: “The noisy minority must be discouraged from playing the race card.” Likening our heightened cultural sensitivity to an unwelcome disruption in our country’s racial harmony, he epitomises the wider inclination for Singaporeans to remain silent and plaster a feeble band-aid on a gaping wound, shying away from informing themselves and speaking up in the face of discontent. Singapore Social… Studies Just as the participants were quick to point out that the key difference in the current generation’s multifaceted perspective of race is due to more comprehensive education, many of them also recognised that national education has been crucial in moulding their perception of racial harmony.  Taught in schools and reinforced in the larger rhetoric, this simultaneously prioritises and hinders the way they view how various aspects of Singaporean life intersects with race. They enriched the discussion with personal anecdotes of institutional successes and missteps. One shared her coddled experience in a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School, which presented a Singaporean experience that was predominantly Chinese. It was only when she entered polytechnic that she became cognizant of her shallow depth of racial awareness, inadvertently tinting her new experiences with peers of different racial groups with an air of ignorance—even if it was in good faith. Another added that some SAP Schools have also been taking steps to actively combat their lack of racial diversity, introducing tailored programmes like Exploration in Ethnicity and Faith. Through their curriculums, they aim to provide a safe environment to facilitate much-needed conversations with young students. But if such supposedly fundamental ideas have to be supplemented, or what more specifically taught, does that indicate a larger failure to weave nuanced racial awareness and sensitivity into our social etiquette? An Identity Crisis A participant puts forth the assertion that although racial harmony has always been Singapore’s defining feature, this does not actually equate to most of our lived realities. “Whenever we have national performances, our national identity is that we’re racially diverse. Other ASEAN countries are amazing in their cultural performances, but in Singapore, we struggle when we sing Munnaeru Vaalibaa.” His peer agreed: “I think national identity is sort of amorphous, it’s something that when you go out chasing, you will never get.” Moreover, celebrating racial harmony in its current manner may also belay the attainment of true harmony, whatever that may amount to. “When a new culture enters, we stereotype them based on the jobs that they take up, whether blue or white collar, based on a handful of individuals. So, for example, if they’re taking particularly high paying jobs, Singaporeans will say these people are stealing our jobs.” Another shared that many still colloquially refer to Changi Business District as Chennai Business Park because of the high density of Non-Resident Indians living and working in the area. This diagnosis of poor cultural awareness signals a wider obstacle of pervasive and prevalent stereotypes, and how easily that could curdle into active discrimination. As the conflation between race and nationality bounced back and forth, it was, frankly, a much-needed reminder that it is easy for many to swap them out almost interchangeably. Ironically, being constantly reminded to look beyond the superficial instead reveals an attempt to codify experience. It is just as crucial to understand that many intersecting factors such as class, nationality, and even gender colours individual perspectives. Though Singapore’s foreign workers more often than not fit into CMIO moulds, they seem to be socially exempt from fully integrating into the racial fabric of the country, assuming a certain uniformity of experience that separates locals from “outsiders”. The same youth points out that this has driven the manner in which discrimination is pegged to job opportunities. “Purely pursuing racial harmony because it’s something we want or something we value may make less sense than identifying the problems and frictions that may emerge because of clashes and tensions between races. If we take a problem-driven approach to help address some of these race-related problems, challenges, and tensions, perhaps it may also be worth taking a look behind the frustrations and anxieties.” Promising Young Nation “The more we talk about identity, it becomes a lowest common denominator thing. And if it starts splintering and decentralising amongst each of us, the idea of the self is broken into all these small little pieces that form our identity. How can we come back together if all we worry about are these small pieces?” posited a participant. Broad solutions were thrown around, some suggesting a more empathetic approach from an angle of diversity and inclusion. This includes fostering a welcoming environment for Singaporeans to ask questions, without fear of hostility or retaliation. Courage and critical thinking should also be encouraged to challenge the existing assumptions and beliefs that drive outright bigotry. “My hope is that the idea of identity as the key thing that differentiates us becomes the key thing that brings us together,” another remarked. While education remains vital, many agreed that more emphasis should be placed on illuminating the set of challenges minorities face, addressing the root cause of current-day animosity head-on instead of shying away from “taboo” topics. Or maybe the answer is a lot simpler: It’s time to move past the narrative of racial harmony entirely. As our country progresses and our youth evolve accordingly, they hold the power to redefine what racial harmony could be, something that is neither fixed nor absolute. Just as their perceptions of racial harmony are currently varied and conflicting, their concepts of it are sure to change accordingly in the next decade. Even though our future feels more uncertain with each passing day, pre-existing racist and xenophobic sentiments coming into sharp focus should be more than enough to mobilise our youths to affect tangible shifts in attitudes in the larger community. But if there is one thing we can all agree on, though, it’s this: These issues will definitely not be met with yet another generational shrug.

4,"With Dining Out Restricted During Phase 2HA, How Have Singaporeans Been Coping?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-dining-restricted-phase-2ha-singaporeans-coping-outdoors/,"Culture, Life","Photography by Zachary Tang unless otherwise stated. Outdoor Dining, But Where?  With the introduction of measures in this heightened version of Phase 2, diners all across Singapore have found themselves stranded and uncertain on where to head for their weekly date fix, be it with a friend or special other. In light of this, public spaces such as park benches, steps, playgrounds and even backdoor alleys are now playing host to diners who wish to have their take-away meals outside the confines of their home. Couples armed with cooler bags and take-away boxes seem to flock to these places in recent times in hopes for a short getaway from their back-to-back Zoom meetings during the day.  Fascinated by this rising trend, I decided to scout out other notable spots where diners have opted to have their meal outdoors in the city, in hopes of capturing similar vignettes of how Singaporeans have found ways in coping with these heightened safety regulations. The First: A Drive-Thru Escapade  The first locale of note I visited was tucked away in an open-air car park in Kallang, conveniently located near a McDonald’s drive-thru and a KFC outlet.  The wide expanse offered by the parking lot in the area ensures that visitors who patronise either the neighbouring fast food outlets are guaranteed to be able to find a cosy spot to enjoy their meal in the comfort of their vehicle. Be it with the windows down, sunroof open, or air-conditioning on full blast, dining in one’s vehicle is indubitably becoming a popular option for those looking for an “outdoor” dining occasion for two. Just be mindful of spillage and crumbs in the car.  For those wanting to replicate the ambience of al fresco dining, I was slightly bemused to observe couples bringing foldable chairs and a makeshift table to the car park with them. It was not a rare sight to witness visitors reclining in their chairs under trees in the car park, cups and snack boxes in hand.  The Decathlon store nearby provides the opportunity for pairs to walk off the grease from their fast-food meal and seek some air-conditioned respite from the heat outside. Just a cautionary note, however: be prepared to expect decently strong sentiments of post-indulgence guilt in the face of ab-rollers and yoga mats.  The Second: RoofTop+  One of the more popular options for outdoor dining finds itself situated cozily above the mall of Bugis+. Accompanied with the fairly calming ambience of carpeted grass and trees, the wooden floorboards that cover the rooftop veranda provides an almost oasis-like atmosphere for diners in search of a quick respite from the air-conditioned retail shops that lie below.  After a quick menu deliberation with my dining companion, we eventually decided on having our dinner at this very location.  Awkwardly struggling with our purchases of tako-yaki and a selection of finger food, we made our way to the mall’s rooftop veranda to host our meal. Pairs of diners were sparsely strewn across the entire area, paper bags with snacks just like ours. Others cradled precious lunch boxes and tiffin cans drawn from cooler bags, complete with metal utensils and personal hand sanitisers. One couple at the far end of the patio even basked in the tiny flickering glow of an electronic candle as they chatted over their supermarket haul.  Comfortably nestled on the rooftop of the mall, this locale boasts relatively scenic views of the surrounding areas. The synthetic foliage that surrounds the veranda also provides some shade from the elements as well, offering sporadic shade to diners who opt to lounge on the synthetic grass. Of note however, would be the exhaust pipes and vents that line the walls of the shopping mall – this may not be the ideal location for the picky or those with sensitive noses. Nevertheless, the unique ambience and wide expanse still makes this a note-worthy dining spot, with adequate space for couples to maintain social-distancing with each other and other diners without having to jostle for spots.  The Third: Diner’s Bridge The CBD itself plays host to unique ad-hoc outdoor dining spots while boasting mesmerising panoramic views of the bustling city. If the grounded feel of Kallang’s open-air carpark doesn’t cut it, the bridge across Raffles Boulevard offers a more scenic alternative. Embarking on the short stroll down from Millenia Walk and onto the white-tiled bridge, it would be difficult for one to avoid the unique and rounded seating areas that pepper the vicinity. The circular formation offers evening diners privacy from other bridge-goers, while at the same time guaranteeing an almost unobstructed view of the city. Food options in the area, however, appear to be far pricier than in other places. An inevitable cost of getting a bite within the CBD area.  While still relatively picturesque and scenic during the day, its lack of shelter and covered areas left visitors like me absolutely scorched in the afternoon sun and scampering back into the air-conditioned comfort of Millenia Walk. For thrill-seekers and the dauntless who are willing to brave the afternoon heat however, the brilliant lighting in the afternoon makes for excellent keepsake photographs that accommodate shots of the Singapore Flyer.  Alternatively, the cool evening winds and stunning nighttime views of the city that this spot offers makes it a brilliant locale for an impromptu al fresco dinner to recuperate from the ubiquitous zoom meetings that occupy the most of our days.  A Better Tomorrow?  Be it dining on mall rooftops, upon bridges or even in car parks, outdoor dining has undeniably taken on a new meaning and perspective in recent weeks. The truth of the matter is, this phenomenon paints a particular picture – one that details our perseverance in sticking close to our love for food and communal interaction. It is also perhaps within these short glimpses of normalcy as we dine outdoors with our companion, that we seek some brief respite from the perilous reality we know as normalcy today.  That aside, safe distancing still takes priority. Even in the absence of the watchful sentinels that were the ubiquitous safe distancing ambassadors in red, I found that these outdoor diners were often responsible and space themselves (and their vehicles) far apart from each other. What the world had once brushed off as a temporary ailment has now evolved into a lived reality for all. It is indeed fortunate then, that the vast majority of us have come to accept and internalise this new iteration of normalcy, and this is perhaps the first crucial step towards a better tomorrow. Perhaps it is not so much the environment per se that is important, as much as it is the company that we share with our dining companions and friends. Regardless of whether you opt to indulge your outdoor meal on a cush  rooftop, fancy bridge, or even an open-air carpark, it is arguably these precious moments that are shared over food and drink that truly make for the most indelible memories, especially during this trying period. While you do so however, do be mindful that we are still a ways to go before we can fully enjoy this same experience in the future, but with more company then. We are not out of the woods just yet and there still remains work to be done. Until then, here’s to safety a la al fresco.  Do you think outdoor dining will be here to stay for the long term?

5,The Dave Parkash Video Shows Our Double Standards In Calling Out Racism,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-dave-parkash-video-double-standards-racism/,"Current Affairs, Opinion","Top image: Dave Parkash/Facebook. For the last couple of days, the Internet has been abuzz over the video of a couple being harassed by a Chinese man, simply for being mixed-race. I’m sure we’ve all seen it by now, so I won’t rehash all nine excruciating minutes. The video has gone viral and drawn condemnation all around, but it’s worth scrutinising what exactly this is directed at. The responses to it are telling about our current politics of acceptability, and what gets to ‘count’ as racism or not.  One response, typified by Minister K. Shanmugam’s, is first and foremost appalled by the shamelessness of the Chinese man — namely, that he actually came out and said those things in public.  What could he (and people like Beow Tan and the Choa Chu Kang attacker) have been thinking? Where are all these people coming from, and what has emboldened them to come forward and spew filth so openly?  I’m no proponent of thoughtcrime, but I think we can all agree that the litmus test for whether something is racist isn’t whether it’s aired in public. Racist statements are just as racist even if they’re muttered over the dinner table rather than hurled in the street, or silently brushed off rather than blowing up on social media. (Even, for that matter, if they’re unintentional.) To that end—as minority Singaporeans and residents, in particular, know all too well—racism is neither a new nor surprising phenomenon here. Videos like Dave’s only make it more difficult to pretend that Singapore is a racially harmonious, cosmopolitan utopia, but it shouldn’t be news that many people (especially Chinese people) have long gotten away with expressing similar prejudice. And in many cases, what they got away with was exactly the same as the man in the video: objection to interracial relationships. 
This leaves us with a curious double-standard where incidents like what happened to Dave are quickly condemned as racist, while we contort ourselves into all sorts of mental gymnastics trying to explain how others are not.
 In the video, the harasser draws on the trope of ‘Indian men coming to prey on Chinese girls’. It’s racist, sexist, and utterly cringeworthy, but show me a Chinese girl who hasn’t heard this at some point growing up. Unfortunately, sentiments like this are all too common. My parents were horrified by Dave’s video, and they have welcomed and adored my friends and exes of all races and backgrounds. But years ago, before I went off to university, they, too, implored me to ‘try not to come back with a Black guy’. It’s a difficult and ugly memory to grapple with, though part of me recognises my parents were probably only repeating what they had heard all their lives. Tropes like the apu neh neh, the predatory Bangla, thieving Africans—these were probably recited by their parents, too.  All the same, the problem can’t be easily dismissed as generational. You only need to look at dating apps, and the many accounts of minority Singaporeans being rejected by people who don’t want to date outside their race, to see this. It’s just explained differently: writing someone off on Tinder, rather than cussing them out in the street, gets to be justified as ‘personal choice’.  This leaves us with a curious double-standard where incidents like what happened to Dave are quickly condemned as racist, while we contort ourselves into all sorts of mental gymnastics trying to explain how others are not.  Heckle a mixed-race couple in the street: racist. Not wanting to date someone of a different race: personal preference. Attack an elderly Indian lady out for a stroll: racist. Refusing to rent a flat to an Indian tenant: personal preference. Post a job ad for tuition teachers saying ‘no minorities allowed’: racist. Explaining that ‘the parents are more comfortable with a Chinese teacher’: personal preference. (Chinese person intimidates someone from a minority race: racist. Minorities call out racism: racist!) Part of the problem is, perhaps, the reluctance to recognise that small things add up, and that playground slurs and familial warnings help prejudice take root. Part of it is a climate where dog-whistle racism is increasingly spouted by politicians and the press. But part of it is also that we conflate degrees of harm—which can exist on a spectrum— with whether something is racist or not. There shouldn’t be a gray area there. Clinging to arbitrary standards, where conduct only deserves censure if it breaches social norms like politeness and non-aggression, does nothing for understanding and unity. Socially endorsed racism is still racism, and a quiet bigot is just as concerning as an unapologetic one.  Calling what happened to Dave and his girlfriend a ‘wake-up call’ doesn’t do justice to how minorities have long put up with things like this. But if it does achieve anything, perhaps it’s exposing the false binary around what is unacceptable and what can be tolerated. To paraphrase the famous line from Animal Farm: all forms of racism are racist, and some are not more racist than others.  And for what it’s worth: we really need to get over this obsession with other people’s relationships. Whether the parties are of different races, the same sex, have a 20-year age gap, or are into bondage and food play— hell, even if someone is single and not dating anyone at all— it’s really no-one else’s business.

6,"These Stalls Used To Fuel Workers At Industrial Parks. Now, They Are Barely Surviving",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-stalls-fuel-workers-industrial-parks-barely-surviving/,"Current Affairs, Features","All photography by the author for RICE Media. Top image by Tey Liang Jin. Three words: They are screwed. With most of us forced to work from home, the de facto circuit breaker we are experiencing now has been a nightmare for stallholders at industrial parks. This is pretty much a death knell since their businesses cater mainly to workers there. It is 2.25pm on a Tuesday. I’ve decided to visit the 280 Cafe coffee shop at Harvest@Woodlands, which is located in Woodlands Industrial Park.  The journey there takes me more than half an hour from Woodlands Bus Interchange, as I board bus 858 and alight seven stops later. After alighting, I walk for another 15 minutes before arriving. Given how far-flung the coffee shop is, it is no wonder places like this get overlooked unless one works there.  As if the restrictions were not damaging enough to the stallholders there, they were dealt with a Covid-19 cluster from the same building during the last week of May.  The coffee shop is eerily quiet, with sound coming only from the humming of the large overhead fans. Among the beige tables taped with the familiar red-white barricade tape, I spot 31-year-old Jomin Goh taking a breather in front of her noodle stall.  1. Noodles are difficult to takeaway – Jomin Goh, 31 Dressed in a red, short-sleeved qipao top, Jomin tells me the deserted scene of the coffee shop is a daily sight—even during lunch time—since May 16 when Phase Two (Heightened Alert) started.  Normally, Ms Goh doesn’t even have time to rest because long queues are a constant when she whips up piping hot bowls of fishball noodles or bak chor mee from 8 AM to 7 PM daily, except on Saturdays (when she operates half-day) and Sundays (when she closes).  Her business used to flourish, selling more than 150 bowls of noodles daily. Those were the good old days when office ladies, who make up the majority of her customers, had lunch at her stall.  But sadly, most of them are now forced to work from home and Ms Goh struggles to even dish out 80 bowls per day. She said men cannot be depended on either—gastronomically speaking—because they usually prefer heavier meals such as cai fan (economic rice) over lighter fare from her stall. Ms Goh forks out almost $2,000 a month for rent and other miscellaneous fees. Last year, she received relief during the circuit breaker and paid about $500 a month after accounting for the subsidies—which was still a burden since she barely sold 20 bowls a day then. I asked her: Why don’t you hop onto the delivery platforms? Isn’t this the most logical thing to do?  Food sellers like Ms Goh are not stupid. Obviously she is aware of them. Due to poor business during the circuit breaker last year, she applied for her stall to be listed on Grab, FoodPanda and Deliveroo. But she lamented that none of them got back to her due to the large volume of applications.  Ms Goh did not follow up with the application process after the circuit breaker because business gradually picked up. She reckoned that by accepting online orders from those platforms, she would struggle to cope as there were already many orders from customers at her stall.  Little did she know the same fate would befall her again this year with the dine-in restrictions.  I can see she takes pride in her noodles, as she describes enthusiastically that the chilli paste, fried shallots and crispy pork lard are all prepared in house once every few days—less commonly seen these days as many hawkers take the easy way out and buy them from a supplier.  And it is this same pride which makes her reluctant to embark on delivery platforms: her food was never meant to be dabao-ed in the first place. She wants her customers to feel satisfied eating her noodles.  By the time the delivery person in the signature green long-sleeved shirt arrives and hangs your bag of mee pok tah (dried noodles) on the door, the noodles would have gone soggy and become an inseparable lump of mess. This is not the kind of food Ms Goh wants her customers to chomp on.  I pity Ms Goh, who is a working mother of four children, aged four, five, six and 10. Life is not easy for this Malaysian here on a long-term visit pass. Her Singaporean husband, 51, used to help her at the stall but has gone to look for other jobs in the past year to supplement the family’s income. He is now working as a linen attendant at a hotel.  Like me, Ms Goh has her fingers crossed that restrictions will be lifted on June 13, because things are not looking good should there be an extension.  “If this situation persists for another two to three months, I might consider closing down the stall,” she says.  2. A double whammy for HMJ Malay Cuisine – Razali, 58 At Gold 186 Food Court, I get hold of 58-year-old Mr Razali at his corner stall and he immediately tells me the no dine-in rule is a double whammy. He is a newcomer in this F&B business—at least in the coffee shop industry.  The opening of his stall after Chinese New Year this year was actually a pivot from his previous business of wedding catering, which he was running for 15 years. Due to the pandemic, he found it untenable to continue his family business of more than five decades.  With the current restrictions which only allow customers to take away their meals, he claims his sales have plummeted by more than half, with barely enough money left to pay his rent of about $4,000 a month.  Meanwhile, it does not help when he—as well as other stallholders—depends on workers from the nearby semiconductor factory Micron (a 10-min walk away) to have their lunch here.  According to him, due to the pandemic, Micron has instructed their staff—some of whom are still working on site—not to leave the workplace for meals and consume food sold in the factory instead. The factory did not respond to queries on this as of publication time.  The HDB dwellers in Woodlands don’t patronise his stall either.   “HDB there already got makan, they want to come here for what? So leceh, ” Mr Razali says. He opens his stall only on weekdays, from 6.30 AM to about 3 PM in the afternoon. Even among the few who drop by his stall, such as taxi drivers, they pick fewer dishes for their nasi lemak than they normally do. Not because Mr Razali’s food is unaffordable (his prices are modest at $3 to $4) or that people are tightening their belts. But these customers who have to eat their meals in the car prefer to keep it simple. Maybe one chicken wing and a fried egg to go with their rice, tops, so the packet of food is easier to hold onto on the go, Mr Razali says. But Mr Razali is not one who throws in the towel easily. Instead of moping when his catering business became untenable, he opened a food stall. Instead of swatting flies at the coffee shop, he dabbles a little in his old trade by preparing bento sets for couples who push on with their weddings (solemnisations can still take place, within limits). Better to have bread crumbs than nothing—an attitude I see in Mr Razali.  Then what about food delivery platforms, I ask him. “You ask the claypot guy lah, he uses all these!” gesturing me to another stallholder a few tables away who sells claypot dishes.  3. Business is still horrible despite being on three delivery platforms – Au Chee Meng, 39 I walk over to the Claypot Delight stall, and clearly, its stallholder is a forward-looking one. Mr Au Chee Meng, 39, has numerous food delivery labels attached to his stall-front—GrabFood, foodpanda and Deliveroo.  Not bad, I tell myself, business should not be too bad. Online, commentators have lauded the usefulness of these delivery platforms in the—pardon the cliche—pandemic new normal. Statistics from SingStat have also painted an optimistic picture, with Enterprise Singapore funding 5% of the commission cost charged by four food delivery platforms—including Bungkus—until June 15. These platforms usually impose a charge of about 30% of the total food order.  The Infocomm Media Development Authority also launched the Digital Resilience Bonus cash grant last year to help stallholders like Mr Au to go digital. But if food sellers are indeed benefitting from food delivery apps, Mr Au isn’t one of them. He claims his business has fallen by 70%, selling only 20 to 30 claypots worth of food a day. This is a blow for someone who used to sell more than 100 claypots.  “I don’t even know how to think anymore,” Mr Au sighs. He said his rent and miscellaneous fees which add up to about $3,600 have been weighing down on him.  He blames his dismal business on the inaccessibility of the coffee shop. While it may be convenient for workers nearby to pop by for a meal, residents don’t do so—the nearest flats are a kilometer away and walking there takes you 20 minutes. Food delivery riders are not keen to serve this area either, Mr Au says.  Like every stall in the coffee shop, he also relies heavily on his customers from Micron. Before the restrictions, the coffee shop would normally be packed to the seams with more than half occupied by Micron workers. But the crowds are no longer here.  Despite the difficulties, Mr Au soldiers on. He continues to dish out piping hot claypots of curry chicken and tom yum soup every single day, from 11 AM to 9 PM.  He’s also gotten creative with his outreach efforts, getting his friend who is an insurance agent to advertise for him. His clients who order those claypot dishes from Mr Au enjoy a 10% referral discount. For the past few weeks, I have read countless stories online about the plight of hawkers, especially those in the central business district. Like stallholders in the industrial parks, they are also suffering from a dearth of customers as most of us are working from home. Some even chose to shut during this period of tighter restrictions.  For now, they stand to benefit from a one-month rent waiver and full subsidy of table cleaning and centralised dishwashing services from the government if they are managed by the National Environment Agency.  CBD stalls have also had their fair bit of media coverage in recent days (here and here). The more well-known ones in the area—numerous of them—may have loyal customers from other parts of the island patronising them, even if they don’t have their usual clientele of office-workers.  But those stalls nestled deep inside the industrial parks are usually nondescript and cater specifically to workers who work in the vicinity. Few of us would make a trip down to these food establishments to have a meal because of how inaccessible they are.  When the government imposed the no dine-in rule, these stalls suffered, even with measures such as the Job Support Scheme and Covid-19 recovery grants.  The road ahead looks bleak too: for coffee shops not under government agencies such as JTC Corporation and Singapore Land Authority, they will receive only half a month of rental relief instead of a month’s worth.  And only from mid-August this year will the taxman dole out the rental support cash payout directly to coffee shop operators and their stallholders. These stallholders also do not receive any waiver for dish collection services (or any other miscellaneous fees for the matter) from the government, which is understandably so for privately-owned coffee shops. If they do, it is usually due to the goodwill of their operators. I’d say the odds do not seem to be in their favour. These are stories of persistence, determination and maybe even desperation. We can only wish them all the best in surviving the rough journey ahead. After all, they are the ones who keep the industrial parks fed and running.

7,What Goes Into a $5 Hor Fun?: The Economics of Running An F&B Business In A Pandemic,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-food-the-economics-of-running-singapore-f-b-business-pandemic/,"Culture, Food","Photos by Liang Jin Tey; annotations by RICE’s photo department. If COVID-19 has rallied us around anything, it’s local F&B businesses. The pandemic has already claimed countless eateries, many of them beloved (RIP, Thaipan and your glorious butter squid). Since the start of the current ban on indoor dining, social media has been abuzz with campaigns aimed at averting further losses. This said, most of us, myself included, know butt-all about restaurant economics. We cringe if our local bak chor mee stall raises prices, or at shelling out $15 for avocado toast, just because we know what we’d pay for the ingredients at NTUC—but this doesn’t account for all the costs that go into making a dish, or how much restaurants can make at the end of the day.  So armed with an empty stomach and a list of questions, I set out to eat my way around Singapore in search of answers. The idea: get F&B owners to break down the costs and challenges of staying in business, using a dish from their menus. The 4th Gen Zi Char Hawker: Tang Kay Kee  Debbie, the upbeat 4th-gen owner of Tang Kay Kee, perks up when I arrive at her stall around 3:00PM. “I thought you were a customer,” she explains. The business was started by her great grandfather in the 1940s, before moving into fixed premises at Hong Lim Centre. Today, Debbie’s great-aunt owns the business, and she and a cousin came on board a few years ago. On top of zi char dishes, they offer a limited lunch menu of items like rice and hor fun bowls. Ingredients (approx. 27% of gross margins) Zi char places make most of their profits on dishes like har cheong gai or cereal prawns, compared to ‘main’ carbs like fried rice. Debbie illustrated this with their popular Mixed Hor Fun lunch bowl: ingredients alone cost the business nearly 50% the menu price ($5). In absolute numbers, there’s not much profit to be made. “For lunchtime, people go for ‘filler’ items like carbs, and my grand-aunt always gives people more because she doesn’t want customers to go back hungry,” says Debbie. “But per head spending for these is a lot lower than if people get dishes.”  Moreover, zi char is usually only ordered at dinnertime— the period of their business which has been worst hit. While they are getting by at lunchtime, thanks to lingering office workers in the area, dinner takings have plunged about 50% without families and large groups coming in. Overheads Rent: Approx $2,000 a month for two stalls. Debbie considers them lucky, because this is cheaper than what many surrounding stalls pay: as an older-generation hawker business, their rent is partially subsidised. (As tenants in an NEA-managed hawker business, their rent is currently being waived during Phase 2 (HA)). Cleaning charges: $800 for two stalls ($400 each). While these have also been waived during Phase 2 (HA), she isn’t sure how this will change when the upcoming measures to get diners to clear their own trays at hawker centres take effect. While this would reduce the need for a clearing service, they haven’t heard if the charges will be slashed accordingly. Packaging costs: With the entire F&B industry pivoting to take-aways and deliveries thanks to the pandemic, packaging costs have shot up, pushing their operating costs up as well. Due to a shortage of white cardboard boxes (8-10 cents per piece), they had to start using more plastic takeaway containers (14-17 cents per piece).  This is partially passed on to consumers: they now charge a flat rate of 30 cents for takeaway packaging, including disposables like cutlery, though this is waived for large orders. “My aunt wasn’t happy about this, but I explained that we really don’t have a choice,” said Debbie. “We just couldn’t keep absorbing the costs. Some of our regulars weren’t pleased too, especially older customers, but most younger consumers seem to recognise it’s necessary.” Given how rare young hawkers are, I’m curious as to why Debbie joined the business, especially after she shares her hours: 8:30am to 10:00pm most days, although she has breaks in between. The punishing schedule means late nights out and impromptu meals with friends are rarely possible. She shrugged. “I’m with my family, so there’s a stronger incentive for me to keep doing this. My grand-aunt has been doing this for a long time, and she keeps us all grounded.” Nonetheless, she knows exactly how hard it is to find staff, having struggled with hiring challenges even before Phase 2. NEA-managed hawker stalls like hers are only allowed to hire Singaporeans and PRs—but given the pay, unsociable hours, and perceived lack of prestige, few locals want the gig. “I think this is why a lot of hawkers, especially elderly couples, just do what they can and close up when they’re done for the day,” she surmised. “If they had higher labour costs, this would drive up the price of their food, and I don’t think Singaporeans are willing to pay more just yet.” The Small Dessert Shop: Merely Ice Cream Things were grim at Merely Ice Cream, a small-batch ice cream shop with two branches. “I don’t see an endgame any time soon,” says Ying Wai, the owner, as we chat by the glass shopfront of his Sunshine Plaza outlet. Since the start of Phase 2 (HA), takings here have plunged around 70-80%, while their Tampines outlet has fallen 60-70%. Of the three places I interviewed for this story, they’ve taken the worst hit. Being in the middle of the museum and university district, the branch used to attract significant footfall from office workers, students, and—pre-pandemic—tourists. Today, I’m the sole customer in the store, and the only people outside are delivery riders walking past.  Ingredients (approx. 27% of gross margins) If there’s a silver lining in all this, it’s that ice cream is a relatively flexible product. Production can be adjusted depending on demand, and sudden changes don’t result in the same amount of scrambling as highly perishable cooked food, like cai fan. “Although walk-in demand was hit badly, most of our ingredients have a longer shelf life of a few weeks to a few months, so there’s less wastage and you don’t have to throw everything out at the end of the day,” said Ying Wai. To adjust to the falling demand, they’ve consolidated their supply orders for the two outlets. Still, I can’t help but wince as he shares some numbers: where they used to order 8-10kg of pasteurized egg yolks per outlet per week, they’re now getting by on 2-4kg. Overheads Rent: Approx $6,000 per month for a ground floor, street-facing unit in Sunshine Plaza, a strata mall. Due to the prime location, this is on the high side for the area.  (Financial assistance measures for Phase 2 (HA) were announced shortly after our interview. Ying Wai is still working out how the business will benefit from these, but expects to receive rebates of 50% and 100% for the Sunshine Plaza and Tampines outlets respectively.)  Labour: While they’ve benefitted from the Jobs Support Scheme, this has been limited by a snag: the rebate only applies to full-time employees, and the bulk of his staff are part-timers. (PT staff earn about $7.50-$8.50 an hour, depending on shift, experience, and commitment.) “I feel really bad not being able to give them shifts, because many of them are students paying living expenses and so on,” said Ying Wai. “I’d been planning to expand the team before Phase 2 kicked in, but that’s on pause because there’s simply no work.” Delivery: Both outlets are on Grab and Deliveroo, for which they pay around 30% commission. They also take in-house orders via their website, sent out via Lalamove (flat delivery fee of $12, waived for orders above $45). While Ying Wai finds the app charges bearable, on the basis that they get marketing and exposure on top of delivery services, the clear preference is for in-house orders. Orders tend to be larger, and even if they waive the delivery charge as an incentive, “all in, it’s still cheaper than using Grab or Deliveroo.” To my surprise, he explains that despite the push to #supportlocal, delivery demand has actually fallen compared to last year. Since the start of the pandemic, the whole food delivery business has become more competitive. Operators—including home-based businesses— have proliferated, and everyone is competing for a slice of the pie. Moreover, the ‘gifting novelty’ of circuit breaker, which was enough to tide them through last year’s closure, has worn off. “Last year, people couldn’t see each other at all, so the volume of gifts was much higher. People would send ice-cream to their friends, boyfriends, as Mother’s Day gifts, and so on,” he explained. “That’s dropped off now.” The Institution: Warong Nasi Pariaman For my last stop, I wanted to look at something different: an established restaurant with a decades-long history and a loyal customer base. Warong Nasi Pariaman, located a stone’s throw from the Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam, is said to be the oldest nasi padang restaurant in Singapore. The business is currently helmed by Mr Jumrin and his family, whose father set up the restaurant in 1948. Ingredients (% of gross margins: …it’s complicated.) Despite his gentle, fatherly air, Mr Jumrin looks exasperated— as far as I can tell behind his mask, anyway — when I ask if he can break down a standard nasi padang order. He gestures to the bento box in front of us. “Sophie, look at this. Got so much. How to break down like that?”  Looking at the tray, I concede he has a point. The mix must contain at least 20-30 ingredients — and there are at least another dozen dishes at the counter downstairs. What he can tell me, at least, is that the cost of ingredients has skyrocketed over the years. Mr Jumrin still goes to Tekka Market early in the morning to get some groceries, and where $400 or $500 would cover this in the past, he now forks out as much as $1,000. They manage the volatility of market prices by relying on suppliers, some of whom they’ve worked with for years.  Although he says they’re not doing too badly in Phase 2 (HA), business has still suffered from the various restrictions.  Extras like drinks and rice top-ups are where they make the highest margins, but those have vanished with the loss of dine-in customers. During Ramadan, bulk orders for iftar also fell, and they no longer benefit from walk-in customers stopping in after prayers at the Sultan Mosque. “Normally, that mosque has a capacity of 5,000,” says Mr. Jumrin. “Now, it’s more like 50 or 150.” Overheads Rent: Although he declines to share the exact amount on the record, the business pays a sizeable five-figure sum for two units. (While they used to allow dine-in customers on both floors, the upper storey has been closed for the last year.) Labour: Costs here have grown, albeit not due to the pandemic. The business employs a handful of work permit holders, and the local qualifying salary—ie. the minimum amount that a local worker must receive in order for the business to be allowed to hire foreigners— has been increasing. (It is now $1,400, up from $1,200 previously.) “So for example, for five local workers, that’s an extra $1,000 a month. Small things like that, but they add up.”  Other costs: The business budgets for tax duties in their cash flow, on top of regular utilities like electricity, water, insurance, packaging, and delivery costs.  Throughout our interview, Mr Jumrin keeps stressing that making ends meet is enough. His priority each month is just to break even with no debts, and ensure that all the staff are paid. Nonetheless, the sustainability of the business is a growing concern. “Frankly, if you ask whether we still can make money, yes,” he says. “But margins are very, very small compared to my father’s time.” “ I’m here because I’ve been here for 30 years and I am committed to it. Older generations like me, we just keep going. It’s just the way things are now, but young people don’t want to start a traditional business like this. So what to do?” By the end of my eating tour, I was stuffed, sweaty, and fighting a losing battle against my food coma. (Digestion: 1. Deadline panic: 0).  Even with the urge to nap, however, one thing was clear: while the loss of dine-in customers has blown a hole in business’ balance sheets, many of the underlying challenges also preceded the pandemic.   In fairness, it’s no secret that F&B has always been one of the hardest industries to make a buck in, but COVID-19 has made it painfully clear how these businesses are vulnerable to forces beyond their control. While margins on ingredients are generally good, prices are volatile to supply shocks like trade disruption and climate disasters. After that, overheads like rent and labour gobble up most of what’s left. While all three places I spoke to have raised their prices over the years, this is barely keeping pace with costs.  Moreover, even after COVID-19 recedes, issues like labour shortages, business sustainability, and the difficulty of changing customers’ mindsets will persist. There’s no clear way of solving any of these. If, like a vaccine, a pill could be developed to cure the delusion that hawker prices can stay fixed for all eternity, I’m sure Debbie would love to hear about it.  So even if it’s really sticking a band-aid on the problem: #supportlocal. Buy from your favourite places (and get a takeaway or their in-house delivery, if you can). Suck up that extra packaging charge, or bring your own containers.  It’s the least we can do.

8,Should Sex Offenders Receive Treatment Instead of Punishment? A Psychotherapist Weighs In,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-sex-offenders-treatment-or-punishment/,"Current Affairs, Features","Top image by Marisse Caine. Last week, Leonard Teo Min Xuan, the administrator of the obscene chat group SG Nasi Lemak, was sentenced to a year of mandatory treatment. The verdict came after a report by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he suffered major depressive disorder that impaired his judgment, and led to him committing the offences.  Teo’s case brings to light important questions on whether more sex offenders should be made to go through mandatory treatment, and whether we should be treating sex offences as a public health issue as opposed to a criminal one.  Psychotherapy and addiction recovery can be important tools in the treatment of sex offenders, and many professionals in the field believe that a treatment approach can help to address the underlying social issues behind rampant sex offence cases. To gain further insight into these issues, we speak to Andrew da Roza, an Addictions Psychotherapist at Promises Healthcare, who has experience working with sex offenders. He explains why we should explore treatment as a default response to sexual offences: Rice: Do you advocate for sex offence cases to be treated as  mental health issues, rather than criminal offences? Andrew da Roza (ADR): Where possible, yes. But we need to differentiate the presentations of sex offenders.  It is possible to separate sex offenders into two categories: sex offenders who are unlikely to respond to treatment, and individuals diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD)—who are susceptible to treatment. CSBD is defined as an impulse control mental disorder by the World Health Organisation. There are different therapists and therapeutic interventions for these groups. If a client has CSBD and their sexual behaviour is confined to Internet porn only, and this has led them to join “homemade” platforms like SG Nasi Lemak, it is likely that treatment will be effective. It does depend on their motivation and their response to therapy.  However, clients who present with more severe forms of sexual behaviour—such as rape, sexual assault, and the exploitation of vulnerable people (such as children, the elderly, and those with severe mental or physical disabilities)—treatment is less likely to work. In some cases, the only option may be to protect society from their behaviour by incarceration and close monitoring in the community.   Rice: How do we differentiate between sex offenders who deserve treatment, and those who don’t?  ADR: A sex offender who is unable or unwilling to take on recovery will commonly present with personality disorders such as Antisocial Personality Disorder. They are likely to lack remorse, guilt, empathy and compassion. Their actions are exploitative and tend to be malicious and premeditated. They may also be indifferent to the consequences of their actions and may feel entitled to act in the way that they do.     These individuals are less likely to connect and cooperate with their therapist or see that their behaviour is harmful, and therefore, do not have the motivation to change.  Recovery work involves joining peer-led, 12 step recovery groups like, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Such sex offenders are likely to be resistant to joining or even be disruptive within such groups.   Individuals with CSBD who do not suffer from Antisocial Personality Disorder tend to be more suitable candidates for treatment.  They may have underlying mental health issues that led them to sexually acting out. These could be, for example, major depressive disorder; general or social  anxiety disorder; borderline personality disorder—which are treatable. Some may also suffer from addictions.  These individuals tend to be significantly distressed by their sexual behaviour and the damage it is causing in their lives and in the lives of others.  They may often be ashamed and even loath this side of themselves. The therapist will then seek to treat their underlying disorders, as well as CSBD.  Rice: How does one get a Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder from watching porn? ADR: Broadly, the same dynamics occur across addictions—whether it be porn, gambling, or drugs. Some of the factors that make a person vulnerable to CSBD also make them vulnerable to other addictions.     Compulsivity occurs when the “reward centre” in the brain is “hijacked” by the behaviour, such as porn watching, if the behaviour is frequently repeated over long periods of time.  Growing tolerance and withdrawal will feed compulsivity, so over time, more porn of more novel, exciting, disgusting or dangerous nature will be needed to get the same effect.       The porn industry knows this, so they  will ensure that a porn user transitions from one porn genre to another until they land on problematic genres such as  non consensual porn, revenge porn, under age porn, and violent and abusive porn—which were the genres discovered on the Sg Nasi Lemak chat site. As the brain gets desensitised to the genres, the porn user may eventually find themselves watching a genre they don’t even enjoy or a genre that would have disgusted or even alarmed them in the past. 
For example, I have worked with men who are not homosexual but end up getting aroused by homosexual porn because of this spiral.
 There are also men who have watching child pornography, but who in the “real world”, would never consider acting sexually with a child or fantasize sexually about them.   However, if someone goes straight to this kind of content, it may be a much more complex issue that may not be a result of CSBD.   Rice: It sometimes feels like the online space is becoming increasingly dangerous, and filled with places like Sg Nasi Lemak. Why is this happening? ADR: To understand why these spaces are rampant, we need to look at why they grow in the first place. Porn addiction cannot be looked at in a vacuum, as it is tied to a spectrum of familial, religious, social and cultural issues. The first of which is the lack of appropriate sex-education throughout children’s development.  Currently, sex-ed is not taught in schools at every level in a way that appropriately addresses sexuality, intimacy, respect, and consent. And when sex-ed doesn’t teach these things, but only emphasizes how ugly some STDs are and the dangers of pregnancy, children will internalise the notion that sex is always a disgusting, horrible, dangerous and fearful act.  Without appropriate sex education, children and teens turn to porn for their “education”. Porn is “educating” children to objectify men and women, to accept and normalise non-consentual sex, and to believe that abusive sex is appropriate. It may also give children unrealistic expectations or demands of their future sexual partners.  Similarly, if sex is a taboo topic at home, it’s hard for children and teens to gain a healthy understanding of consent, sexuality, sensuality and intimacy. Parents who only talk about the dangers of sex and solely focus on sexual abstinence take the risk of further instilling the idea that sex is ‘dangerous’ and ‘bad”, immoral and unhealthy. Their children’s healthy sexual development will suffer and this may lead to fractious, difficult and unsatisfying relationships when they become adults.  Rice: Why do we see more men turn to these toxic outlets, like porn or group chats, as compared to women?  ADR: If we add  the lack of adequate sex education, with socially perpetuated toxic masculinity, we have a recipe for disaster.  Social and cultural norms pressure boys to be strong, tough, self-reliant, and to show little emotion. This creates men who feel isolated, lonely and incapable of expressing and managing their emotions in a healthy way. They become vulnerable to “self-medicating” their loneliness, emotional suffering and frustrations by turning to addictions like gaming or porn.  Another issue is that male dominant environments often  make matters worse. From NS to boys schools, the prevailing narrative towards women can quickly turn to objectification, disrespect,  competition and conquest. And in chat groups like SG Nasi Lemak, men egg each other on by normalising and encouraging what is abnormal and destructive behaviour. Rice: How do we start addressing these sex offence cases with public health in mind?  ADR: If we treat all sex offenders  the same—as criminals—we miss the opportunity to treat those who can be helped; and we risk ignoring the social and educational issues that may be at the root of the problem.  It would be helpful for all men who are investigated for sex offence cases, such as being online predators, to be given a psychiatric evaluation.  From there, clinicians can determine whether the offender can be treated and is willing to take action to recover. If they have spiralled in their sexual behaviour because of CSBD and other conditions, they should be given an opportunity to recover. In these cases, a mandatory treatment order may be helpful.  If they are simply incarcerated without treatment, they are likely to relapse on their release, once again exposing the community to danger.    Rice: On a macro level, how do we start addressing the increasing number of sex offence cases in society?   ADR: A socio-cultural approach needs to be taken to target underlying social issues. This should start with research on porn use and its effect on children and youth.  For example in collaboration with schools, the SAF, and institutes of higher learning, independant researchers could ask students anonymously, what they know about sex, what sex means to them, whether they use porn and if so, when they started, and so on. Research like this will give the Government and those in the mental health treatment space an idea of the scale and severity of the public health problem, and what resources to apply to it.   This research can also  be used to create robust sex eductation initatives, to teach children, youth and adults about mental health, sex, sexuality, sensuality and intimacy; and how to avoid, manage and seek help for CSBD when it arises. With this information, men can learn to be more aware of their peers’ behaviour towards women,  call each other out on disrespectful and damaging behaviour, and most importantly–be aware when they themselves are falling into toxic spirals.

9,"After Dover, Will Clementi Forest Be Next On The Chopping Board?",https://www.ricemedia.co/dover-will-clementi-forest-next-chopping-board/,"Current Affairs, Features","Trudging through the maze of vegetation, we brush off waist-high foliage lazily trawling our sides, gingerly setting shoe to soil until we finally emerge into a landscape reminiscent of Jurassic Park. With the ethereal morning mist draped across the valley of lush greenery, it is a marvel that this terrain sits next to a bustling tarmac road.  Elliott and Inez, a pair of self-professed nature enthusiasts, have brought me out to trek Clementi forest in the wee hours of the morning. As nature guides and educators, they belong to a burgeoning group of Gen-Z environmental influencers. From Tik Tok dances (“I am a reluctant participant,” says Elliott) to speaking at seminars (cue the recent Singapore Heritage Festival), the lovebirds have taken the cause of championing our local habitats to heart. We’re in Clementi forest today because the couple wants to show me what might be disappearing next.  Earlier this year, the outcry over Dover Forest sparked waves of action, from petitions to parliamentary speeches. While a laudable milestone in the uphill battle to protect our green spaces, Elliot maintains that Dover is a unique case study.  “Dover was unprecedented because prior to this, so many of our forests were disappearing but not as many people cared about the issue. But with Dover, it was the residents living in the area who didn’t want to see it go. That’s not always the case with other green spaces,” Elliott muses.  Inez nods in agreement. “Have you heard of Tengah forest?” she asks, to my puzzlement.  Tengah forest is (or was) an approximately 700 hectares patch of greenery teeming with life, housing predators of the air such as the near-threatened Grey-headed Fish Eagle, as well as land troopers like the critically endangered Sunda pangolin. Sitting snugly between the Western Water Catchment and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, it also serves as an important connector facilitating the migration of wildlife from one forest patch to another.  Unfortunately, being located remotely meant that there was little fanfare when it was announced that the forest would soon give way to what was termed the “Tengah Forest Town”, an HDB residential estate resembling the size of Bishan. In fact, slots for the upcoming Build-To-Order (BTO) flats recently opened up in May 2021. Not lost on me is the irony of its name or its tagline where future residents can experience being “At Home with Nature”.  Inez is quick to reassure me that rather than a mercenary bulldozing, there were indeed mitigation measures announced like the setting aside of a 5km long, 100m wide green corridor to ensure connectivity between the catchments, as well as a wildlife shepherding exercise to safely relocate the animals to neighbouring habitats. But can we really heave a sigh of relief and congratulate ourselves on acquiring these concessions?  Woefully inadequate, is how the folks at the Nature Society of Singapore puts it. The land area of the corridor, which totals only 10% of the original forest or less, is inadequate in accounting for the volume of species present, while the mere 100m width of the corridor will see the slender strip being sandwiched closely by the Kranji expressway on the northern flank and disturbances coming from a dense housing estate on the southern flank.  “We also need to think about the journey once wildlife exits the green corridor,” Dr Ho Hua Chew, vice-chair of the Conservation Committee of the Nature Society, says. Highlighting the fragmented connectivity to surrounding reserves, he elaborates, “Currently there are only segmented green patches here and there, not a complete passageway to safety. In essence, an animal still has to cross the Kranji Expressway to get to their next destination.” This is why Dr Ho and his team have advocated for building further eco links and preserving two core areas of forest patches on either end of the green corridor. “It’s a pitstop for them to take cover and get back their confidence before pushing on through the corridor,” he explains. Constantly relocating wildlife is proving to be a feeble solution too. In fact, Dr Ho posits that wildlife may have originally entered Tengah Forest as the carrying capacities of other forests were likely exceeded. As we tear down more and more, we will be left cramming our wildlife like sardines in a can to whatever green space is available. After all, we guided animals out of Lentor Forest into the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and then, later on, decided to run the Cross Island Line (albeit 70m down deep) through said reserve. As it stands, the current fate of Tengah is uncertain, a common refrain when it comes to most of our forests. The obscurity of our natural spaces is what drives Elliott and Inez to frequently lead tours to uncommon habitats like forests or coastlines, in hopes that getting acquainted with an area would help people care deeply about it. “People get so stoked just getting to hold a starfish in their hands,” Inez says. “There are actually so many cool things in Singapore that people don’t know about, so I love that I get to help people discover this side of our island.”As we continue our hike, they point out the richness of biodiversity with ease. Did you hear that? It’s the straw headed bulbul, Elliott says breezily. Elsewhere, Inez is admiring a leaf she’s picked up from the ground. It’s not every day you hear someone describe a leaf as cute. To understand more about the success of mitigation measures, I ask about efforts at re-planting when a forest is cleared, such as in the recommendations following the Cross Island Line saga. “It takes a long time to engineer a regrowth forest, and no matter how well you do it, you can never get back the same makeup of biodiversity. It’s effective if you’re talking about carbon offset, but it’s a loss on the biodiversity front,” Elliott patiently explains. A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.  My interest is piqued on this topic of biodiversity. To the layman, the case for biodiversity just seems like preserving for the sake of variety. Is it just so we have cool things to gawk at?  Both of them react viscerally to my insinuation, to which Inez flatly responds, “if there’s no biodiversity, we’ll all die.”  The two try to paint it for me simplistically.  Bats, like the fruit bat or the cave nectar bat, are indispensable in the pollination of the nation’s favourite fruit (subject to personal discretion)—durian. Wipeout its habitat, lose the bat, and we will have no more green, thorny shells to crack open.  To find out more, I turn to Dr Andie Ang, a Mandai Nature Research Scientist and President of the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore). “Firstly, I just want to say that tree planting is great, it really is,” she says with gusto over our Zoom meeting, hands clasped anxiously to reassure me she is not a tree-planting hater. “But planting a million trees is not the same as keeping a million trees.” Newly planted trees are usually scattered around different landscapes, such as in a housing estate or by the roadside. The outcome is far from replicating the dense, rich environment of a forest primed to support existing biodiversity. From acting as a natural water filter against flash floods to curbing sweltering temperatures, the benefits of strong ecosystems are endless.  “We have to look at forests as a whole and not in compartments. You cannot talk about intact forests without talking about the wildlife that lives in the forest. So even if you preserve a green corridor or a strip of greenery, but if it’s an inadequate space for wildlife to really thrive in, that’s not fully protecting our biodiversity,” Dr Ang says.  Dr Ang would know. She has devoted her time to conservation efforts for the Raffles’ banded langur, a jet black monkey whose home has been constantly threatened on our shores. Amid deep sighs, Dr Ang tells me about a roadkill incident of one such langur in 2017 on the BKE. The langur was most likely attempting to cross from the Central Catchment Nature Reserve to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and video footage showed the langur perched on the central divider in the middle of the road, wavering in its course of action.  “It might have tried to cross, realized that the traffic was too busy, tried to go back, and then, bam,” Dr Ang says sadly. Ironically, the kill spot was only 650m south of the eco-link corridor. “That’s the thing right, it’s not like animals can read signs telling them that there is a safe corridor further down the road,” Dr Ang laments regretfully. “If we’re removing someone’s home, we need to think about how to provide proper alternative homes.” Back at Clementi, Elliott is making me squirm with a story on how baby wasps feed inside figs.  “Only certain species of wasps, the fig wasps, can pollinate fig flowers. The wasp mum will crawl inside, lay her eggs and then die. The inside of fig fruits are food for her little grubs, so if you take an unripe fig fruit and peel it open, you’ll see all of them wriggling inside.” Upon seeing my appalled face, Elliott laughs. “Yeah, it sounds quite gross. But once they mature, they all fly out of the fig fruit, and that’s when we pick it and eat it. And figs, in turn, are important food sources for other animals, like birds, monkeys, even bats.” Talk about biodiversity.  “I think our generation has a lot of nature influencers talking about climate change, like reducing plastic and all that, but I do think biodiversity has been largely overshadowed,” Elliott quips.  Karl Png, 24, from the Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity, is certainly well versed to speak on Gen Z advocacy. A two-year-old organisation, the youth team behind SYVB boasts an impressive roster of advocacy work, from organizing youth consultations and forums to participating in international roundtables.  The idea of advocacy can bear a bitter taste in the sceptic’s mouth, so I question if he gets jaded hearing about these cases with very little fruit over and over again. Does the work put in actually equate to a proportionate outcome? “Let’s just put it this way,” Karl responds. “I am not certain of the fate of Dover forest, but it’s way better than if it were business as usual.” As we speak, Karl and his team are in the midst of finishing up an infographic on yet another case of undue clearance at Sembawang Woods, where an 800m section of the North-South viaduct is slated to pass through the forest patch. Karl gives an approving nod to the mitigation measures taken in this case, albeit calling for connectivity corridors to be sufficiently vegetated and widened.  “The thing about biodiversity that people don’t always grasp,” Karl states, “is that we are part of it. It does take a toll seeing spaces get culled all the time, but the motivation comes from knowing that it’s these organisms that feed me and give me clean air and water. It’s that gratitude I have toward nature because of all the underappreciated services it provides.”  Elliott echoes a similar thread. “We always try to frame it as saving wild spaces for animals, but in actual fact, it’s saving these spaces for people too. We always benefit when we preserve natural spaces. I think people tend to forget that until it’s something closer to home.” The sky is turning an ominous grey as we near lunchtime, so we decide to head out before the imminent downpour. As we skirt back out onto the main path, construction fences loom on either side, housing excavators donning a faded shade of green. In land-scarce Singapore, how are we to satisfactorily balance conservation with the need for development? “Land use is a touchy topic,” Karl acknowledges. “We’re not saying you cannot do this or that it’s morally wrong, rather, we’re trying to pose a set of questions that can result in more robust decisions. Have we considered all options of other usable areas? Have we allowed ourselves to study the forest in question?” For instance, Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, had previously pointed out the availability of neighbouring, vacant sites in the Ghim Moh area as a substitution to clearing Dover Forest. Similarly, Elliott and Inez clarify that their stand isn’t a brusque opposition to development, but rather the need for a more thoughtful and intentional approach to it. “In fact, when there’s clearance to be done, I actually think we might not always need to preserve the whole area,” Elliot offers. “But we hope that there can be consultations at the start, not just when the clearing happens and consultations are only to salvage or remedy.” Dr Ang thinks there needs to be a mindset overhaul on the ways we approach land use. “Rather than mitigating the impact, it’s about not even incurring this impact. I know it’s challenging to say you want to be involved right in the beginning, but I really feel it’s a missed opportunity to not be more consultative at the start.” The recent erroneous clearing of Kranji Woodlands is a testament to the mantra of too little too late. Adding on to the list of umbrages is the shock clearing of Lower Seletar Reservoir, a move that the Nature Society of Singapore has indicated they were uninformed about. Within the nature community, calls for an Environmental Impact Assessment law, or EIA law, have been circulating as well.  Elliott explains that in the case of Dover, only a baseline study was conducted, which is not the same as an EIA. While a baseline study outlines what kinds of flora and fauna are present in the forest, EIAs assess the impact on the habitat when construction works are made and present recommendations to circumvent those effects. Simply put, knowing what is in the forest does not equate to knowing how it will be affected.  Pointing out the presence of EIAs that have led to mitigation measures in the Cross Island Line and Bukit Batok Hillside Park cases, Inez says, “we’re really gunning for a law that would make EIAs mandatory, and that the findings would be made transparent to the public.” On the flipside, Dr Andie Ang and Karl are more cautious about the push for legislation. “Do we really have to go down the fine people route?” Karl laments, yet acknowledges that enforcement might be inevitable if patterns of careless clearing persist.  “What I would really like to see is more education upstream,” Dr Ang counters. “Teach about our local forests in the kindergartens, so that there is an early appreciation of it. Ultimately, you can only care about the things that you know.” With all that is on the horizon, do they still feel hopeful? Across the board, all unanimously agree that the recent attention on green spaces merits great encouragement. Recounting how she recently heard some elderly folk complaining about the Kranji Woodlands clearance at the kopitiam, Dr Ang says, “previously, it was always the converted talking back to the converted, but for the story to reach a 70-year-old uncle, that’s really on the ground.” “I just hope more people go out into the green spaces near them and enjoy them. Have a stake in our natural spaces, so that when the time comes, you’ll be a voice for it,” Elliott challenges. “I won’t stop advocating,” declares Dr Ho, “because nature is so fundamental to a meaningful life.” After all, as Dr Ang reminds me, our flora and fauna can and should be coined a part of our heritage. “Our natural heritage is part of our national heritage too, it’s what we have and share. I hope we get to preserve that.” The ecofeminist scholar Donna Haraway talks about the concept of making kin, where kin are defined to be “those who have an enduring mutual, obligatory, non-optional, you-can’t-just-cast-that-away-when-it-gets-inconvenient, enduring relatedness that carries consequences.”1 For Haraway, she found kin in Cayenne, an Australian shepherd dog with whom she had a relationship founded upon mutual respect. She posits that if we have kin with another, then we carry accountabilities and obligations that are steeped in sites of attachment and relationship. Indeed, we make kin unknowingly with the creatures and critters that surround our atmosphere day in day out, painfully unconscious of the ways in which our ability to breathe and move are, in part, attributed to their continued existence on this planet. We would do well to acknowledge and honour these threads of kinship, treating them with a dutiful reverence and safeguarding them with a discerning will, before these threads are irreparably severed. Or, as Inez simply puts it, “You got to respect the forest man, these guys were here before us.” Citations

10,"We Went Languishing Around Singapore And It Was Terrible, But Perfect",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-we-went-languishing-around-singapore-and-it-was-terrible-but-perfect/,"Culture, Life, Travel","All images by Feline Lim.  In April, the New York Times termed the latest stage of the pandemic fatigue as languishing. The thinking goes: We’re not burnt out, depressed, or anxious. We’re joyless, aimless, stagnated and empty.  “[Languishing] feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life in a foggy windshield.”  We’ve all felt like we’re just muddling through, right? Even when the restrictions in Singapore were eased, there was a distinct lack of spontaneity, adventure, and excitement. It almost felt normal to sit in a restaurant with a group of eight friends. It was something like freedom but not quite. There was a roadblock to joy. It could be remembered but not replicated.  Now, in Phase 2 (HA) the slices of normalcy that eased our languishing are gone. There’s nowhere to hide. We can’t meet more than one person at a time. We can’t travel anytime soon. Essentially, we’ve regressed to a point in the pandemic that we wanted to forget. The languishing article I mentioned above offers some antidotes: give yourself uninterrupted leisure time, focus on a small goal. These strategies might feel implementable in the United States, where mass vaccination is steadily easing restrictions—but in Singapore, we’re a few months away from returning to the spoils we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Though hope is on the horizon, until later this year, we’re in a semi-pleasant purgatory.  So, in the absence of an imminent end to the pandemic, I wanted to try something different. Instead of rejecting this mid-point between flourishing and depression, I indulged it. Here’s how I intentionally languished around Singapore.  Where Should One Languish in Singapore?  Firstly, languishing is neither pleasant nor destructive. When researching the term further, I learned that it is “an apathy, a sense of restlessness or feeling unsettled, an overall lack of interest in life.” To languish appropriately, I thought it best to select places where not much happens, and there’s nothing spectacular to see or do. In fact, when scouting for locations, I wanted to make sure there was nothing excitable at all. The whole point of languishing is to embrace a low-level of dread. So, with that in mind, I picked three areas of Singapore which are not featured in tourist brochures: Tuas, Sembawang, and Yishun. Of course, I was still writing an article—technically a photo essay, with pictures from my colleague Feline Lim. We needed some nice visuals, so I found some photogenic spots in these unremarkable places. Does glamourising languishing defeat its purpose? It could have, but it didn’t. Here’s what happened.  Missed Connection: The Lalang Field  Initially, I selected the Raffles Marina lighthouse as our first location to languish—there was an idyllic shot I had in mind: a silhouette of myself or a stranger gazing at the sea while the sun set on the water. Unfortunately, the marina was closed to non-members. The security guard shooed us away as we approached the gate.  A bummer. But I had another place in mind: the famous Lalang Field in Tuas South Avenue 4, the backdrop of many wedding photoshoots. “What do we do when we get there?” Feline asked me. I told her that we were going to languish and she would know how it felt when we did it. Though, at this point, I wondered if I had pitched an article I couldn’t write. We drove in circles around the area where the Lalang Field was supposed to be. It was fenced off with barbed wire.  “Where do we go now?” Feline asked and I shrugged. I ran out of options. We meandered on the empty sidewalks, submerged in a cloud of dust stirred up by a lorry on the road. It was late in the afternoon when we stumbled on a dehydrated field of nothing.  There, I laid down on a spikey patch of grass, and closed my eyes. The sun roasted my skin and a swarm of midges buzzed in front of my face. With the lorries rumbling in the background, and the afternoon heat on my neck, I felt uncomfortable but not uncomfortable enough to change position. I laid there and thought how nice it would be to sunbathe literally anywhere else.  “Okay, we’re losing the light, shall we go somewhere else?” Feline called from afar. Sure, I thought, without saying anything. I was overcome by the need to stay where I was, to indulge the discomfort. But we had an article to produce.  In Pursuit of Nothing: The Break Down in Tuas  The next port of call in Tuas was Lamp Post 1, a landmark for cyclists at the westernmost point of Singapore. Lamp Post 1 is outside the Tuas Checkpoint and home to a collage of stickers and trinkets put there by the cyclists. I thought it would be heartwarming, but upon closer inspection there were ziploc baggies of cigarette butts and used masks taped next to the inspirational quotes. It was a nonsensical place to spend more than a few minutes, given the heavy traffic, grimey litter, and noisy construction beyond the checkpoint. There was no good reason to hang out there, yet there we were; languishing. I felt annoyed and slightly serene.  In the car, I talked with Feline about how frustrating it was to find a ‘good place’ to languish in Singapore. “There are no open spaces.” She remarked while switching lanes. “Before, there were places you could go to make your own fun. You didn’t have to buy, eat, or drink something to participate. There was no price to pay.”Feline mentioned the plot of reclaimed land where Gardens By The Bay now exists. It used to be a wide, open space of nothing. Yet, it was made useful. Both of us remembered the afternoons we spent flying kites and picnicking there. It wasn’t special or remarkable, but it was unspoiled and free.  Before we went home, we stopped by Long King Canteen—which had an excellent selection of Bangladeshi cuisine. There were some migrant workers there (on their own, or in pairs) collecting refreshments. They too, seemed to be languishing. We took our food across the road, to another stretch of dehydrated grass that faced the water. There, we watched the sunset. In the distance I noticed Forest City silhouetted in the sky. Forest City comprises four man-made islands in Johor, billed as a “smart and green futuristic city.” It’s a copycat version of Singapore opposite our own shores. Forest City looks a lot like Dubai. While admiring it, I thought: I would really like to be in Dubai. Or, again, anywhere but here. With great effort, I could swim to Forest City from Tuas. Seeing another country up-close and personal made me think about how arbitrary travel restrictions are.  Technically, I could have booked a flight from Changi and gone somewhere the next day. But I didn’t. On the way home, the car broke down. Feline wrestled with the spare tire, then we waited two hours for help. The entire trip had been kind of a bust, all of our preferred locations were closed. We sat on the side of the empty road, in silence, apathetic and disinterested.  Long story short, Tuas is ripe for languishing.  Go Forth and Languish at Sembawang Beach and the Yishun Dam  Sembawang Park was crowded when I arrived. Uncles huffed and puffed through their masks as they shuffle-jogged around the beachfront, which was also under construction. On the pier, a small crowd were fishing. “Fishing is kind of like languishing, right?” Feline asked as we watched the fishermen stare expectantly at the filthy sea.  A man waded into the sea to cast a big net. Time and again he threw it out, then pulled it back in. We watched for half an hour and he didn’t catch anything. The other fishermen observed from the pier in silence. “Yes, fishing is definitely a kind of languishing.” I said to Feline.  Sembawang Beach was covered in plastic bags, empty cans, and food waste. It was not an idyllic spot to relax. Yet, there were quite a few pairs sitting on stone benches and smoking cigarettes. I wondered: Why did they choose this place? Singapore is full of manicured, pristine nature. Were they deliberately languishing, in a setting which suited the mood? The hulky port disturbed what could have been a nice view. Though there were many people around, I never heard any chatter.  Yishun Dam was our hail mary for one good picture. Feline said the sunset on the water was unreal. We arrived early and sat in silence for some time, dodging insects and watching a hawk swoop down from the sky to catch a fish. “Sometimes I come here with my boyfriend and we bring a portable chess table.” Feline exhaled. I thought this was another example of languishing.  When the sun finally set, it was too cloudy for the pretty colors to break through. The sky went dark without warning. As we called our cabs to go home, we counted the hours spent chasing nothing this week. I disagreed with Feline on how long, exactly, we had spent in Tuas. “Surely, it was only an hour,” I said, but she seemed to think we had been there for three or four hours.  In the car on the way home, I thought: we wasted a lot of time on something that is not interesting. But, isn’t that how most of the past year has been? Sitting around, trying to unearth diamonds from the rubble, and forgetting how long it took.  Yes, we had wasted the whole week languishing. And it felt aimless and joyless, but appropriate.  Found any good spots to languish in Singapore? Write to us community@ricemedia.co.  Author © 2020 Rice Media. All rights reserved ",,FALSE
11,Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Follows the Money (Part 2),https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-movie-reviews-jack-neos-ah-boys-to-men-franchise-part-2/,"Culture, Events","The following is Part 2 of a two-part review on Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men series. You can read Part One here. By the mid-2010s, there was a noticeable shift in the global culture towards more socially progressive causes, driven largely by the internet and social media. As Disney’s Marvel franchise and movies like DC’s Wonder Woman (2017) would go on to demonstrate, there was now an easy buck to be made from taking a stand on social issues.  The formula is simple: just slap a <insert minority> into a lead role, write some generic dialogue about empowerment, add a dash of 90s nostalgia, then have said minority kick the ass of their historic oppressor … and voila! The audience can now experience the catharsis of shattering the Grand Illusion, while enriching the coffers of global MNCs. Everyone wins. Coincidentally, this sudden whiff of profits also made these ‘Western’ ideologies more palatable in Singapore. This is reflected in the final two movies of the Ah Boys Franchise — with mixed results.  Ah Boys to Men 3 (2015): Every Seamen’s Fantasy  In the Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen, Jack Neo uses the Time Stone to transport his characters back to an alternate timeline where they enlist in the Naval Diving Unit (NDU) instead — in order to produce propaganda for the Singapore Navy. The early films’ success at the box office is reflected in the now bloated runtime of two and half hours.  Supported by an even more massive budget, the audience is treated to yet another CGI opening sequence. This time, our heroes board an ocean vessel, where a group of United Colours of Benetton terrorists have taken the crew hostage.  To be honest, despite the CGI fireworks, it’s getting late and I find myself nodding off within the first few minu— HOLY SHIT. NEVERMIND. A Chinese female terrorist just got shot in the face! “There are no female crew on the list,” said the naval commando to his subordinate. “Do your homework.”  Duly reprimanded, I’m now wide awake. The threat of terrorism in Singapore is no laughing matter. Like the Spanish Inquisition, it can pop up in places where we least expect.  Unfortunately, this headshot is also the highwater mark of this movie. Perhaps this is due to the limitations of the alternate timeline, where the characters must retrace the exact same arc, albeit with a few adjustments. Wayang King is still very wayang, but in this timeline, he actually fights back and stands up for himself. Meanwhile, Ken Chow’s girlfriend leaves him again for being too childish.  “I need someone who’s stronger, who’s able to protect me, love me, care about me, understand my feelings,” says his girlfriend. “I need someone who is more determined and mature.” “You’ve been watching too many movies because that person doesn’t even exist!” yells Ken.  Ooh, nice. This movie is breaking the fourth wall to gaslight the audience.  The only standout scene is a genuinely touching storyline of Lobang and his mother, who struggles with drug addiction. One night, as his mother goes into a fit of withdrawal, Lobang is forced to break out of Tekong. He then makes the heart-wrenching decision to turn his mother into the police in order to save his sister.  Back at camp, the whole platoon is brought before the encik to be held to account for this dangerous safety breach.  “How do we choose between doing the right things, and doing things right?” asks the encik.  Astonishingly, this scene ends with the encik admitting to his own mistake of not understanding Lobang’s family situation and giving himself 100 push-ups as punishment. This inspires the rest of the platoon to follow his example. TL;DR
Leaders showing accountability? This really is the alternate timeline.  Ah Boys to Men 4 (2017): Joking Only One. Women Cannot Take a Joke Meh? By 2017, the culmination of three instalments and half a decade of character development finds the ah boys mature into fully-fledged uncles, as they sluggishly report for their fourth round of reservist duties — this time to the armoured division. When the movie first came out, a RICE contributor dubbed Ah Boys to Men 4 ‘pure sexist trash’. I disagree. The most egregious examples of sexism actually took place in the first two instalments. By the fourth instalment, the franchise is, on the contrary, attempting to pander to the increasingly lucrative trend of female empowerment.  Unfortunately, this attempt fails miserably.  The introduction of the first real female character in Lieutenant Zhang Xinyi, played by Apple Chan, arguably sets womens’ rights in Singapore back another generation.  It’s not the actresses’ fault. For all the controversy her character generated, Apple Chan is given almost nothing to work with. Her defining personality trait is that of a hardass with no sense of humour, and her hobbies include making the reservists write lines as punishment.  That said, as misogyny goes, it’s pretty toothless stuff compared to previous iterations. The entire cast and production feels tired, sad and low energy.  Sure, there’s a confrontation between IP Man and Apple Chan, where the familiar refrain of ‘can’t women take a joke?’ is trotted out. But even this movie is self-aware enough to have the other characters call IP Man out for sexual harassment.  The bigger problem is that despite all the hullabaloo about a female ‘lead’, Apple Chan’s character is still just being used as a prop — except now she’s a prop in the foreground instead of the background. Having her beat up IP Man is supposed to be one small step for all womankind, before the movie takes three giant leaps backward when the screenwriters awkwardly pair her up with Second Sergeant Alex Ong (played by Tosh Zhang) by the end of the movie.  The writer / director even had to work Apple Chan’s mouth like a puppet for a final time with this cringey piece of dialogue: “The power of brotherhood is really amazing. I will definitely want to learn more from you guys.” Thanks Jack. Very nice.  TL;DR Can someone explain why this is the last shot of Ah Boys to Men 4? Why is Singapore burning down? Is it a metaphor? Like…the true enemy was inside of us all along? I’m genuinely lost and concerned.  Together We Will Chiong. On and on and on. Once you remove the bad CGI and outlandish plot developments, Ah Boys to Men is less a slapstick comedy and more a cultural record of the times. Its primary value lies in documenting the shifting cultural priorities from 2012 to 2017, from open misogyny to insincere pandering to women’s rights.  Like the franchise, it’s a bit pathetic to call this progress, but one can’t deny that for the past decade, ‘socially conservative’ Singapore has been dragged kicking and screaming into the modern era.  Arguably, the government’s support for Ah Boys has less to do with outright sexism so much as risk aversion and political expediency; it seems that the authorities always have a knack for following the prevailing wisdom of the times, even if it means hitching their wagons to declining cultural and social trends.  Maybe what Jack Neo has really taught us is that you can’t lead a country based on the nostalgia of out-of-touch uncles, where NS was always ‘so much tougher’ back in their day and gender roles were easier to understand. After all, NS was never just about national security. According to LKY, it is also about building a national and political consciousness. While I take umbrage at always placing the blame on the authorities, we already have a few recent examples of how SAF culture might bleed into the civil service or corporate boardroom — with negative social consequences.  So instead of always rushing to wait and waiting to rush, perhaps some initiative and leadership are in order. Perhaps it’s time to actually chart a course for the type of society Singapore wants for the future, instead of just acquiescing to the prevailing winds of the times.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

12,Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Is A Cultural Treasure (Part 1),https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-classic-movie-reviews-jack-neos-ah-boys-to-men-franchise-is-a-cultural-treasure-part-1/,"Culture, Events","All images taken from Netflix.  The consensus at RICE is that Ah Boys to Men is a terrible franchise. That its director Jack Neo is a hack who has really jumped the shark from his early decent films like Money No Enough and I Not Stupid to directing big-budget B-movies that are essentially commercials for the Singapore government and corporate brands.  Jack must be wiping away tears with money at our disapproval because the S$30MM in local box office receipts tell a different story. Every couple of years, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans willingly part with their hard-earned cash to attend these cultural events.  If it isn’t the quality filmmaking that draws them in, something else must have struck a chord — enough for them to overlook the blatant MINDEF propaganda.  But debates about quality aside, all films are also time capsules. And it’s precisely this combination of government backing, corporate sponsorship, and mainstream appeal that makes the Ah Boys franchise so interesting for the armchair anthropologist (i.e. me).  When you read between the lines, the true value of this franchise is that it tells us what the powers-that-be in Singapore accepted as ‘normal’ and ‘uncontroversial’ between the years 2012 and 2017.
 This is especially relevant in light of the recent proposal by AWARE chief Corinna Lim to let women serve NS, in order to address the ‘toxic masculinity’ problem in SAF.  So what I want to know is this: does Ah Boys to Men depict a problematic NS culture? Does the series actually deliver on its promise of turning boys into men? And if so, what kind of men do they turn into?  Let’s find out.  Ah Boys to Men 1 (2012): Sponsored Sexism In 2012, Ah Boys to Men was the highest-grossing Singaporean film of all time.  It also finds Singapore’s media authorities asleep at their terminals.  Because forget the Hollywood movies depicting drug use. The opening montage to Ah Boys to Men is the biggest threat to Singapore’s national security.  Within the opening seconds, we learn that Singapore is under attack by a mysterious military force. The brain-dead responses from Singaporeans, however, is like an invitation for Singapore’s enemies to actually invade.  Watching civilians, including women and children, get gunned down or burned to a crisp with bad CGI shouldn’t be this funny, and it borders on treason that Jack Neo has managed to make the death of innocents look so corny. But fear not, in the ultimate non-sequitur, a GAME OVER sign flashes across the screen, and we find out that the past twelve minutes was actually … a video game all along? This is a worse plot device than ‘it was all a dream.’ It’s more upsetting when you consider that a big part of the film’s S$3M budget must’ve been spent just so that Jack could go pew pew pew and make explosion noises like a 5-year old boy playing with LEGOS.  Who said there wasn’t patronage of the arts in Singapore?  But to quote HBO’s Chernobyl, “Reality is the most horrifying genre of all.”  After this Ready Player One ripoff, we are introduced to the main character Ken Chow, whose entire personality revolves around being a rich brat who really hates NS. His girlfriend is leaving to study overseas, but the patriarchy is holding him back.  In a rage, Ken stops traffic and ends by kicking over a garbage can, before being arrested by SPF. This isn’t just your run-of-the-mill rich boy fit, it’s the kind of tantrum deserving of execution by firing squad.  What follows is your standard NS enlistment process, where we are introduced to a cast of colourful characters: Lobang (the ah beng with a heart of gold), IP Man (the playboy), Aloysius Jin (aka Wayang King), as well as the Indian, Malay and PRC stereotypes who serve as comedic wallpaper for its four Chinese-Singaporean main characters.  Sounds about right.  Partway through the movie, Ken’s worst fears finally come true. His girlfriend leaves him. After the breakup scene at Benjamin Sheares bridge, she hops into the passenger seat of a mysterious Mercedes, whose owner is presumably a richer white man with a ten-inch penis, thus confirming the darkest fantasies of incels on SammyBoy and EDMW. But by far, the worst advice on women in this movie comes from the father figures.  During training, the boys are constantly mocked for being gu niang (ladies in Chinese). Government-issued rifles are compared to wives: “After tonight, we are all married men. This wife is a pain. She sticks to you wherever you go. You’ll be punished for mistreating her. And she has a loud voice, ‘Bang!’ You can’t say no to marriage and you can’t get a divorce. Worst thing is, you can’t even go to bed with her.” In case you think I’m cherry-picking, I present you with the CB leaf. Here are some other classic Boomer pearls of wisdom that cleared Singapore’s media censors in 2012: “Women are like clothes, ready to be worn and discarded when you’ve worn them. Why must you insist on wearing this one?” “Next time, when other guys pick her up, they’ll be like rag-and-bone men. Because she is used goods.” If I can sum up the internal logic of this movie it would be as follow:  Younger women are possessions with sell-by dates. They have unrealistic expectations and are overly materialistic. “90% of recruit girlfriends” will confirm cheat on you (mutiny / bing-bian) when they get the chance.  Middle-aged women are shrill and naggy mother/wife figures that should not be taken seriously.  But don’t fret, women become lovable again once they become Grandma, whose only purpose in life is to spoil their grandsons and fall ill.  As for the female siblings? Forget it. Just let them do housework. The twins from The Shining had more to do than the actresses playing Ken Chow’s sisters.  Finally, the movie drags on with tedious Boomer flashbacks on how NS was so much tougher back in their day, ending on a cliffhanger after Ken’s father has a stroke/heart attack while driving to the hospital to see his shithead son.  TL;DR
Singapore in 2012 was basically an EDMW forum in real life.  Ah Boys to Men 2 (2013): Know Your Role and Shut Your Mouth Meet the second half, the same as the first half. In 2013, the second instalment of Ah Boys picks up where the first one left off. After his father’s accident, Ken Chow makes an about-face and is now on the straight and narrow path to OCS. Another recruit, IP Man, gets cheated on by his girlfriend. Because women, amirite?   Meanwhile, Wayang King’s wayang skills have gotten so powerful that the whole section ends up hating his guts. In a hazing incident worthy of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, they sabo him by putting a stone in his field pack during a march across Singapore.  Here, the father figures in these movies have another chance to shine. At FoodRepublic, Wayang’s father provides Wayang with more nuggets of wisdom lifted straight out of a HardwareZone message board. His advice for dealing with bullies? The best way to fight is to not do anything.  Say what? He goes on to explain this ‘logic’ in the most convoluted way possible with, of course, yet another CGI set-piece courtesy of Jack Neo.  But maybe Wayang’s dad has a point. Later on in the film, we are introduced to the concept of being ‘marked’ by a superior officer, a practice that’s reminiscent of Jack Nicholson and A Few Good Men. Allegedly, it’s an unofficial way that superiors can punish recruits they don’t like by always volunteering them for the toughest tasks. Everyone knows it’s a punishment and yet no one can acknowledge that it exists. Since it’s off the books, there is no way of proving that this actually happens.  Which is why under these (alleged) conditions, Wayang Father’s advice of keeping your head down and avoiding the spotlight is actually a pretty good one.  TL;DR
 Fall in line, soldier. Don’t be such a lil bitch and just STFU. The manliest thing you can do is keep your head down and allow problems to slowly fester beneath the surface.  The Story So Far This concludes the first part of this review on Jack Neo’s Bohemian Rhapsody for Boomers.  My verdict so far?  On one hand, it’s hard to get worked up over something this juvenile and pathetic. Some might even argue that I’m reading too much into a slapstick comedy. Normally, I’d agree with you. After all, freedom of artistic expression should cover terrible artists as well. But culturally, these films become significant once you consider the context in which they were made.  While many misogynistic movies aimed at a broader audience were released in the early 2010s, only the Ah Boys franchise can boast this level of private and public support — to the point where the likes of MINDEF and other local brands had no problems slapping their logos on it.  Other movies have been banned for less. In a country like Singapore with tight restrictions on ‘controversial’ content, the fact that Ah Boys 1-2 was considered ‘normal’ is truly an indictment of the times.  Stay tuned for Part 2 tomorrow, where the writer reviews Ah Boys to Men 3-4. In the meantime, Ah Boys 1-2 are available on Netflix.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

13,Antique Warehouses Along Turf Club Road Is What We Need To Stave Off Historical Amnesia,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-antique-warehouses-turf-club/,"Culture, Life","All photography by Marisse Caine for Rice Media Unless you know the specific warehouses that operate there, few would have even heard about Antique Row. Even this name is a moniker Singaporeans attach to the antique warehouses along Turf Club Road, rather than an official title. I would not have known of Antique Row’s existence either, if not for my cousin who took a wrong turn while driving to Rider’s Cafe, which is about a 15 minutes walk away. This treasure-trove located in an ulu part of Bukit Timah is a quiet playground for scavenger hunters, never mind that the building is dilapidated. Who knows, the unpretentious state of the building might be what aroused visitors’ curiosity to the warehouses in the first place, which, by the way, are open to the public till evening. The four antique warehouses are hidden out of view within the secluded Bukit Timah Saddle Club and Turf City area, flanked by thick vegetation on both sides. Its rooftop is overgrown with shrubs and trees. At first glance, I did not think highly of the row of warehouses. With a mix of wooden furniture and rock sculptures piled up and cluttered outside the building, it resembled more of a dumpster for bulky items by karung guni men, than a de facto history museum.  But the old-world charm of the vicinity caught my attention, as wild roosters roamed around in the shrubs and uncles unwound outside their warehouses. Sitting on stools around a foldable table on the road, they chatted away in Chinese dialects and drank Kopi O together, paying no heed to the hustle and bustle of city life.  For a brief moment, I thought the kampung spirit had made a comeback. Not as a national myth, of course, but more like an organic sense of community fostered among the owners.  Looking at their interactions, I could see that they have camaraderie, cracking jokes and gossiping with one another like old friends. But, more crucially, there is a culture of trust and neighbourliness. If one of the uncles had to leave their warehouse unattended to pee or make deliveries, he could always count on his neighbour to keep a lookout for him.   If I had to churn out a recipe for nostalgia, this has to be it: A group of middle-aged uncles collecting and displaying antiques in this laid-back and rustic setting, set in an elongated building built decades ago. The metal netting at the top of its facade reminds us of the past when people installed them for ventilation, instead of using fans or air-conditioners. In one of the warehouses which belongs to 55-year-old Alan Wong, there are many items from yesteryear which would bring a tear to the eye of someone who lived through the 1960s and 70s in Singapore.  They range from black-and-white television sets (which used to be a luxury) to smaller collectibles like bus tickets (which bus conductors used to punch holes on), coated with a layer of dust which makes those items look even more time-worn. The other three warehouses also have a similar collection of local antiques, with unique items such as a vintage jackpot machine and an old barber chair.   If you dig deep enough, you may even spot a blue restricted passport placed haphazardly among the shelves of Mr Wong’s warehouse, which tells us an almost-forgotten immigration policy from the past. There was actually a time when Singaporeans held two passports: the red passport we are familiar with for international travel and the blue one for trips to West Malaysia. The blue passport was used from 1967 to 1999.  I spoke to the friendly and bespectacled Mr Wong, who set up his warehouse here in March 2018. He also has a shop in Bukit Merah which sells similar goods.  Like the other uncles, Mr Wong is knowledgeable of his antiques. Appreciating antiques is an expertise, he says. He takes it upon himself to know the history behind the products displayed in his warehouse, sometimes learning from visitors themselves. For art pieces, he has to distinguish between the real masterpieces and the forged ones.  Speaking in Mandarin, he shares the tranquility of the area—with sounds coming only from the crowing of the roosters or chirping of crickets—is what makes the place enjoyable.  The countryside-like vibes is why Mr Wong chose to relocate his warehouse here, after shifting from various locations such as Depot Road and Toh Guan Centre. On the flipside, as the Turf City precinct is secluded, he has to contend with a lower footfall. On average, he receives fewer than 10 visitors on a weekday, while the number is only slightly higher on weekends.  But Mr Wong claims that over here, he pays a lower rent of about $3,200 per month, which isn’t surprising since the area is ulu. His warehouse of over 2,000 square feet would have cost him at least $5,000 per month at somewhere more populous, according to him.  It is pitch dark when night falls—there are no lamp-posts along this stretch of road. Perhaps this is why the uncles from adjacent warehouses call it a day by 5pm. Mr Wong, however, stays on till after sunset. He says he spends his mornings at his Bukit Merah store and opens his warehouse later, at noon, while other owners start their day here at 10am.  Although the darkness does not spook him, he recalls an incident during the Hungry Ghost Festival last year. As per tradition, he lit up red prayer candles along the road and prayed. But in the midst of doing so, nature called and he went to answer it in the nearby bushes. This was when Mr Wong saw a “lady” in a red dress who sat by the roadside near his car and disappeared after a while. He later learnt from a visitor that many years ago, a woman was raped and killed in a colonial black-and-white house nearby. Apparently, it’s a well-known tale among those working in the vicinity.  Personally, what I found more mysterious was that nobody seemed to have a clear idea of the history of this decrepit building. Multiple attempts to reach out to the relevant authorities did not yield any concrete answers. What I did have were anecdotal accounts from the uncles. One of them said the building used to be a stable and was built in the 1930s; another remarked that the building used to store horse feed and that the road in front of it was previously closed to vehicular traffic. It’s a shame that there isn’t an official history of this old building.  Given the lack of heritage interest in this building by the authorities, I wasn’t surprised when Mr Wong told me they might need to make way by June next year as the place is slated for redevelopment. Upon checking, I learnt that plans for the site are still being studied, so my fingers are crossed while its fate hangs by a thread.  I’m praying that Antique Row does not get relegated to the history books. For one, we will lose a place with an identity and rustic character of its own, which distinguishes itself from the cookie-cutter shopping malls we are so sick of. A tight-knit community will also be erased.   Moreover, ever since the Sungei Road Thieves Market was closed in 2017, we no longer have a large collective site for antique collectors to display their wares. The closest we have now are Antique Row and Fook Hai Building, which houses a few antique shops.   Perhaps in the eyes of the authorities, they have no qualms doing away with the vintage scene because little economic incentives can be reaped from there, as compared to redeveloping the area for residential or commercial purposes.  If the Urban Redevelopment Authority redevelops Antique Row and its surroundings according to its latest Master Plan, taller flats or condominiums can be built and the government coffers can rake in more money derived from stamp duties and property taxes—more than rent collected from antique warehouse owners of an old single-storey building. But not everything can be measured in dollars and cents. What does it bode about our collective history if we no longer have antique warehouses and shops, more so if the collectors decide to call it a day, in the event they are forced to vacate Antique Row?  From an educational perspective, I will feel sorry for our children and grandchildren if they do not have opportunities to be exposed to these vintage goods which used to be everyday items for us.  Sure, there are museums where children can learn a fair bit from. But museums only display items aligned with their curatorial agendas, rather than random knick-knacks. This does not do justice to those arbitrary items of yore, which also have a story to tell.  For example, a coin-operated public telephone displayed in Mr Wong’s warehouse may not be important enough to deserve a place in a glass casing at the history gallery of the National Museum. Ultimately, the museum’s focus is on Singapore’s pre-independence history and the public phone is a relic from the 1980s.  But it tells us a story of a time before mobile phones became common, when communication was less convenient and people on the streets had to physically search for a phone to contact someone. This was also why people used to carry 10-cent coins and pocket phone books when they were out, so they could make calls in public.  History is not just gleaned from textbooks, museums or state-sanctioned events like Singapore HeritageFest, because they do not paint a complete picture of the past. It is also through organic and ground-up experiences like visiting antique warehouses and shops which not only keeps the national memory alive, but also gives them a sense of cultural rootedness. I will be sad if one day, our children suffer from historical amnesia and are clueless about their community’s history and lived experiences of the past. Sometimes, it is in such unassuming places like Antique Row where you unearth unexpected vintage gems and learn a history lesson. For me, Antique Row is also a social space which reminds me of simpler times in the past, as I see how laid-back and easy-going the uncles are. This is also the reason why owners like Mr Wong chose to shift his warehouse here.  Know of a place with the charm of Antique Row? Tell us about it at community@ricemedia.co.

14,"Indians Not Allowed, Thank You.",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-racism-indian-national-singapore/,"Commentary, Culture, Current Affairs, People","All images by Zachary Tang. “Indians not allowed, thank you.” This was what an agent said to me back in April, when I was looking for a new home here in Singapore. Trouble is, this wasn’t even an isolated incident. Before long, I had to either start looking for houses owned by Indian families, or give a caveat to agents beforehand that I am, in fact, Indian. I felt bad, of course. But more than that, I felt pity for these people for having such mindsets even in this day and age. (Coincidentally, my Swedish housemate finally found a house for us which was apparently owned by an Indian man, and I indulged myself in the house shifting and tried to forget these racist experiences that I’ve accumulated over this two-and-a-half-year long stay in Singapore.) Racism—it’s not always in plain sight. But one can still sense it in the everyday.  In that look in the eyes of one person. Or a smile returned with hostility during a walk in the park. You sense it behind sugar-coated words, especially when you try to have an open discussion about it. Even if it’s not always put in words, you can sense it. All that said, if you ask me if I think Singapore is a racist country, my answer would still be a big no.  A friend of mine from India was having lunch with his Chinese girlfriend (from Hong Kong) at an Indian restaurant one day. Out of nowhere a middle-aged, Singaporean Chinese lady leaned over and said something to her in Mandarin, in a low tone. His girlfriend snapped in response that it was none of her business. A long silence followed. When my friend asked what the matter was, she told him that the lady informed her that “Indian men are not trustworthy, you know, so be careful.”  I mean, my friend is no Casanova or Picasso. He ain’t no John Wilkes or Peter the Great. He comes from India, but he ain’t no Maharaja Bhupinder Singh. He’s just a simple-looking, decent, brown middle-class student. I wonder if it was an Italian, Russian, Spanish, or any white guy in his place—would he have been greeted with such judgement? I find it funny because maybe my guy’s just got tough luck. The other day, we were running late for work and rushing down an escalator when his hand brushed the hand of a Chinese woman who looked to be in her late 50s. Which he apologised for, twice. This is what she shouted back. “Fuck off, you people do this intentionally, I will take you to the police!”, she yelled, trying to kick him. He mentioned that there were cameras around and he wouldn’t mind going to the police if she wanted. She lost her temper even more and started blabbering in Mandarin. Throughout this entire ordeal, what stood out most was that not it was not just us — even fellow Singaporeans around could sense that she was being unreasonable and nobody paid any attention to her.  From these incidents, one can see that it takes a whole nation to make for a multicultural, interracial, peaceful society. But it takes just a few frustrated, inhumane, and unreasonable people to make us look like a racist country. Singapore is a vibrant country to me and has those attributes that make me love it like my own country as well. Like India, it is colourful; it is home to people of multiple nationalities, faiths, and interests. It is full of nature, heritage, and art; it has a rich history in its struggle for freedom. I love the similar ways we improvise with food, where everything gets all mixed up and accepted until it’s difficult to identify their origins. Isn’t it all so beautiful? To flag a country like this as racist would be unfair. It would be unfair to all of my Chinese, Malay, Filipino, Australian, European, and Indian friends, who have always been there, who show love and support in difficult situations. It would be unfair to all of those sending postcards asking how I’m doing, or how my family’s doing back home in these disastrous times. Some have even asked me out or sent me homemade food just to tell me that I am not alone here. It just wouldn’t be fair. My Indian mates and I haven’t been home for a year and a half now, and what we hear in the news is enough to send us spiralling into depression.  Every other day brings some bad news—hearing friends and relatives dying because of COVID-19 keeps us on our toes. We fear: what if something happens to our families tomorrow? Would we even be able to go home to be with them? With all this in the backdrop, it makes the treatment of Indians here by those with crippled mindsets even more questionable and sad, like kicking us when we’re down. When the actions of these small groups of people come to national attention, sometimes it looks like they are winning against racial harmony. We shouldn’t let that happen in a country like Singapore.  My Chinese friends tell me about the kind of racist statements they hear from the people around them, and one of the silliest things I’ve come across is that “Indian houses smell like curry”. Well, yeah … I guess they would? Every household smells like something or other, but how is that cause for discrimination? I remember how I didn’t like the smell of Malay and Filipino food when I came to Singapore in 2019, but that only made me curious about it. After some time with my friends from these regions who invited me over and cooked for me and introduced me to their food, I started enjoying it. All I needed was to break my walls and accept the differences and the love that everyone brings with their own culture. The other stupid thing I hear is that “Indian houses are dirty.” Well, myths, myths, myths. A person’s way of living isn’t just decided by their nationality. There are so many factors, like their personalities or their financial situation. People look down on our construction workers’ quarters and call them dirty, just because they can’t afford the kind of maintenance that a regular Singaporean household can. What do you expect from someone with a monthly salary of around $450?  But still, mind you, there are houses of the same construction workers that are cleaner and way more organised than rich fellas out there who have no sense of living and couldn’t do a thing without maids in their houses, which are ten times bigger than a construction worker’s abode. But we just wouldn’t dare to go and pay a visit to the houses of people who have built our homes. It’s easier to call them names.  To break these taboos, we have to explore and experience on our own, and not be part of the crowd which blindly follows “traditions” and “beliefs”. Two years ago, when I first visited my previous rented apartment and met the owner, a sweet and humble Chinese lady, I noticed a line of doubt on her forehead. Later, I was also told by her Chinese agent how some Indian and Bangladeshi tenants had their leases terminated because they could not maintain hygiene standards.  They rented the house to me anyway. Two years later, as I was giving my keys back on the last day, my landlord laughed and told me I was her favourite tenant.  On my end, I feel we must stare back laughing instead of looking down, especially when passing by a stranger with that look in their eyes. We must pass an even brighter smile if it isn’t returned. The more people start sugar-coating their words, the more firm our voices should be when we talk about it.  All this with complete understanding that these people might be completely innocent, unaware of this virus called racism that they’re showing symptoms of, and what it might have done to their poor brains.  We need to identify them, talk to them, give them some love. That might just be the only hope for change.  Have something to say about this story? Write to us at community@ricemedia.co. Author © 2020 Rice Media. All rights reserved ",,TRUE
15,This Polyamorous Commune in Singapore Aims to Help People Find Authenticity in Relationships,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-polyamorous-commune-singapore-aims-help-people-find-authenticity-relationships/,"Culture, People","Photography by Liang Jin Tey / RICE Media.  Gabe and Elle first met through a dating app. They watched Jumanji on their first date, and it just so happened that they had the same lifestyle philosophy about open relationships. For both of them, the scripted Singapore relationship is far from appealing: getting married by 25, BTO by 30, then having kids and a traditional family structure. To them, this arrangement prohibits connecting with and loving other human beings outside their relationship. They both feel that there are so many interesting people in this world, and it is possible to build deep intimacy with more than one person.  Gabe is a man of many interests and passions. While he holds a full-time job, he is also an avid practitioner of sensual massage therapy on the side, and works with both women and men. This is how he first got acquainted with the polyamorous lifestyle. Meanwhile Elle, a freelance designer, has pursued her own fair share of research, and exploration into this lifestyle, out of her own interest and curiosity. The two quickly connected over the same vision of how a relationship should be.  “We are both solo polyamorists who get along so well, and decide to cohabit together without marriage,” Elle said. “Our primary partners are ourselves, we are two complete individuals who choose to take care of each other. In this sense we get to date other people and have sex with other people outside of our relationship, but this does not diminish the strength in our relationship in any way. “If anything, this arrangement is a testament to how strong our bond is, because we choose to stay together out of our conscious will and love as a daily choice, not because we have to follow through till ‘death do us part’.”  Just last year, the couple decided to move in together in the middle of the pandemic to an HDB flat in the heartlands. But before you think that this was a typical move-in arrangement, here’s the caveat: they moved in together with another couple—Art and Dee—who practices a dominant-submissive relationship, making the household essentially a quadruple “polyamorous commune” of sort.  They’ve come to call the space “The 360 Experience.” It is not only a co-living space, but also a space to host “holistic” sexual education related events, collaborating with other polyamorous advocates and practitioners in their communities.  ‘360’ (degree) refers to an all-rounded education, true to their mission to cover every aspect of growth in self-discovery, sex, love, and intimacy. Elle explained: “A lot of sex education platform and courses in Singapore are usually limited to abstinence and negative consequences. People don’t find them relevant or informative at all. We are teaching through different means and sensorial experiences, using tools, props, and practical workshops. We are creative and versatile. We want to provide a multidisciplinary sex education that is inclusive, honest, complete, real and available for everyone.” The second couple in the household, Art and Dee also met through a dating app.  Dee, who works in the healthcare industry, came from a very traditional Muslim family. Before meeting Art, she was previously engaged in a toxic relationship where her fiancé would control her behaviour, refusing to let her be herself.  “It was a toxic relationship but I did not realise how bad it was. I was not myself, I was being shamed for having desires and inclination to do many things. When I finally met Art, it felt like a breath of fresh air. He did not judge me—he encouraged and supported all of my explorations, my needs, and my desires. I felt heard and nourished.”  Art, a bartender-turned-food delivery rider, came from two prior failed marriages, so he understands how a lot of couples in Singapore are trapped in toxic marriages or relationships where they are unable to grow or to be themselves.  “It is so easy to lose sight of who you are when you feel like you have to conform to a template dictated by society,” he says. “With every failure, I learnt more about myself and that led me to who I am today, someone with crystal-clear clarity on what I need and want from my romantic relationships. Effective, vulnerable, open communication and strong trust are foundational to create a lasting relationship.”  Through their explorations in the polyamory communities and alternative lifestyles, they met Gabe and Elle. The two couples hit it off immediately and became good friends. They’ve gone for staycation trips together, and enjoy each other’s company immensely. Then, in 2017, on a fateful night over drinks, they decided they would move in together in the coming future. They understood that they connected intellectually and emotionally, and share similar relationship values. They also wanted to educate others on how to have better relationships. Hence the idea of The 360 Experience was born.  Even though they live together, the two couples are not romantic and sexual with each other. Art and Dee share a very different polyamorous relationship model than Gabe and Elle. They are exclusive with each other and chose to get married, followed by signing an official dominant-and-submissive contract.  Elle and Gabe were respectively the best woman and the best man, acting as witnesses in the marriage and the signing of the contract. Elle cried buckets during the signing ceremony. “It was such an emotional, touching moment,” Elle recalled. But how exactly does the dominant-submissive contract work? It is basically an agreement to establish a communication style and share an exchange of power. Dee defers to Art for most decisions but still retains her autonomy to veto. The dominant, Art, agrees to be responsible for the well being of his submissive, Dee, and has her best interests in all aspects of her life at heart, including everyday routines and even her diet. In addition, Art dictates to Dee how he would like to be taken care of. An example of such instructions would be how exactly Art likes his morning coffee made. On the other hand, Dee shares with Art her goals in self-improvement and self-care, and Art guides her through their shared journeys.  “It is not legally binding though,” Art clarified. “We are always revising the terms of the contract for further improvement, and we can adapt them according to different life stages. I visited this curious HDB commune for this interview. As far as the layout went, it was a completely normal unit, but with a few little twists.  First came a rather spacious living room that is used to host workshops. On one side stood a big shelf displaying sex toys and relationship card games. On the other side was a headless mannequin body tied up with shibari ropes, next to a curious metal rig from which an aerial yoga hammock hung. A curtain at the corner led to the dining room.  In the dining room, there was a mood board populated with erotic photographs: from boudoir to bondage, from nyotaimori (the art of eating sushi from one’s body) to nuru massage (Japanese erotic body-to-body massage where participants are covered in odorless and colorless massage lotion)—the tastefully taken snaps showed an eclectic range of experimental sensual activities.  “These are just a few of the workshops and activities that we host in this space,” Gabe told me. He pointed to a blackboard mounted on another wall in the dining room. “There on the blackboard is the list of our upcoming workshops. We do not plan too far ahead as we all have full time career and family commitments. We communicate through personal channels, sometimes social media, and host bespoke, tailored events only one at a time. Our offerings are very intimate and catered for small groups.” I saw all kinds of events and workshops, from the more avant-garde practices such as bondage and nuru to more “vanilla” activities such as “mindful masturbation”, learning about “erogenous zones”, “communicating consent”, and even a “cocktail making masterclass.”  However what really caught my attention was the upper right corner of the blackboard, which spelled out the key values of the commune: connection, openness, communication, inclusive, love, safe space, discovery and awareness, and so on.  The foursome shares that life inside the commune is a lot of hard work. They come up with a proper schedule for each other to do house chores, cooking, and other logistical operations so that everything runs smoothly and harmoniously. They all live and work together inside the commune, on top of organising events for the public—hence life inside the commune can be very hectic if not properly managed.  “We work hard to create events and workshops that will be useful for the attendees. We have to prepare presentation slides, plan for event flows, and collaborate with the right people in the scene,” said Elle. “We have to make sure that we respect and appreciate each other’s needs and schedule in the commune, and give each other space. We take turns using the living room and we decide on all the events and workshops by consensus.”  They are also very open and accepting of each other’s sexual expressions and desires, regularly inviting friends of their communities to join in or host events. Unlike other groups of roommates who might stigmatise and judge each others’ sexual activities, this is one big way in which they do things differently.  Another thing that they emphasize in the commune is a radically honest, compassionate communication format to discuss everything. They have regular house meetings to check in with each other on any problem that needs to be addressed. Instead of treating each other passive aggressively and letting dissatisfaction fester into resentment, they choose to always have open discussions.  “We call out on each other … lovingly of course,” Gabe added with a chuckle. “Of course we encounter problems like any other group of people living together. Maybe one of us forgets to clear the dishes, maybe one bails on cleaning the house, or hogs the bathroom too long … But we will voice out all these concerns in a neutral, rational, calm, and loving manner. We pride ourselves for striving to have the best communication possible with each other.”  They also frequently schedule group dates and celebrate every milestone in their joint relationships. Group hugs, cuddles, and massages are common in the household.  People outside the polyamory lifestyle might associate all this with debauchery, hedonism, and recklessness, but according to them, polyamory relationships can offer a more structured flexibility and diverse life experiences as compared to traditional relationships. This lifestyle requires a commitment to honesty, ethics and mindfulness to maintain.  The last room in the unit was the “play room”. At first glance, it seemed like a normal bedroom with a queen-sized bed. However, a curtain on one side of the room opened to a big wardrobe filled with all sorts of sex toys, tools, ropes and costumes. Toys and paraphernalia can be cost-prohibitive in Singapore and many find themselves unable to have a firsthand experience at retail outlets or online. The 360 Experience presents an opportunity for singles and couples to explore different things that they may like.  I was genuinely impressed by what I learned from the two couples that day. It sounded to me that spaces like The 360 Experience need to be more common and accessible. We all sorely need access to better education regarding love, sex and intimacy. We want answers, opinions and insights to discuss things that we repress or are deemed taboo, and a non-judgmental safe space to discuss and explore.  It is always a constant challenge for the four of them to keep the space financially sustainable, as they are not marketing or scaling their events for large profits. They consider the commune a non-profit; a passion project. Moving forward, they hope that their network and community members can grow organically and contribute to the longevity of their passion, purpose, and mission.  They are envisioning a fully fledged co-living and educational space in the future, equipped with an F&B space that is open to the public. They hope they can eventually run this space full time.  “Fingers crossed that we will be able to spread our philosophy and help many couples in Singapore become more authentic with themselves and each other,” Dee concluded with a hopeful smile.  The 360 Experience is available on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram at @th360exp.

16,"We Took A 12 KM Walk To The Industrial Heartlands Of Tuas, Because Phase 2(HA)",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-travel-a-12-km-walk-to-tuas-phase-2ha/,"Culture, Life, Travel","All photography by the author for RICE Media. A month ago, before Singapore went into ‘heightened alert’, I hit upon the idea of walking to Tuas on foot, following the 2009 heritage trail from Pioneer MRT to Tuas Link station. The journey is 12-kilometres long and takes roughly two and a half hours. If I set out in the afternoon, I’d reach my destination just in time to catch the ‘best sunset in Singapore’ at Raffles Marina. Why was I doing this? Well, with gyms being shut down, and massive queues forming in nature, I felt like I was slowly suffocating here in Singapore. The second reason for walking to Tuas was morbid curiosity. As an outsider, a lot of what I thought I knew about Singapore have turned out to be half- truths. There’s a gap between the clean-cut image that Singapore projects to the world and the often harsh realities that are hidden within its borders. With tensions rising in this pandemic, more locals are starting to notice this rift as well. To this end, I wanted to head west to see Singapore’s industrial heartlands for myself. I wanted to follow the paths and viaducts of the ‘real’ economy that most Singaporeans choose to ignore, on their way to their air-conditioned offices in the CBD. In short, I wanted to test the firmness of Singapore’s foundations with my own two feet. I. The Heat  It is unconscionably hot in early May. Not just your garden-variety tropical heat, but the kind of heat that really saps  willpower and raises tempers. It’s the kind of hot that makes you want to question everything.   In the ensuing days, I make several half-hearted attempts to begin my walk to Tuas, only to be turned back, first by the suffocating humidity, then by a sudden thunderstorm, which, turned the air into even more of a sauna instead of cooling things down. This is the type of climate that can really draw out the crazies: Beow Tan. The Pasir Ris Man. Bruce Lee and the Karate Kid. In Ang Mo Kio, cats are being found with slash wounds on their bodies.  But even as I condemn these violent acts, I’d be lying to say that I don’t recognise the anger.  A five-minute walk to my neighbourhood kopitiam is enough to leave me short-tempered and drenched in sweat. Despite being an early advocate of facemasks, I feel an urge to declare myself sovereign and join the anti-mask movement.  Eventually, I start to let my guard down and wear my mask beneath my nose.  In this climate of uncertainty, it’s a small and feeble attempt to take back control.  “This is the kind of weather that makes me want to hurt somebody,” I tell my wife.  II. The Road  I finally set out towards Tuas on a Wednesday—just two days before Phase 2 (HA).  To maximize my shade, the plan is to follow the MRT viaduct from Pioneer station all the way to the Johor Strait, before rounding the corner to Tuas Link and Raffles Marina.  Beyond the residential HDBs of Pioneer, the road widens, as do the number of trucks barreling towards the expressway. The noise of traffic is deafening, making it hard for me to find my bearings. Even behind my face mask, my lungs are filled with the smell of burnt rubber and car exhaust. It takes just fifteen minutes before I’m dripping with sweat.  Enroute, I make a quick pit-stop at a Chinese restaurant that’s frequented by the PRC community, just south of Pioneer Road. I’m there to inquire about a whole roasted goat on their menu. “Was this goat born and raised in Singapore?” I ask the restaurant owner’s wife.  She shakes her head. “No, the goat isn’t Singaporean. It had to be imported from Malaysia.”  Disappointed, I move on, all the while lamenting the fact that the Singaporean goat is slowly being replaced by foreigners.  By the time I reach Joo Koon station it’s almost the end of the work day. Outside the NTUC Fairprice hub, workers huddle outside the entrance smoking cigarettes. They all have different coloured uniforms on, some in blue, some in yellow, some in white, but all of them wear the same blank and exhausted looks on their faces.  Poor bastards. A storm is coming and they don’t even know it.  III. The Workers Turning off the main road, I get lost somewhere in a quiet industrial estate in Gul Circle, caught within a labyrinth of factories and migrant worker dormitories. At a deserted traffic light, an auntie behind the wheel of a Toyota honks at me. She puts up both hands, in the universal body language of ‘boy, what the hell do you think you’re doing?’ I’m beginning to ask myself the same question. What am I doing here? Because none of what I’m seeing makes sense to me. My sheltered scholarly ass has absolutely no frame of reference for the industrial parks and construction and engineering firms that I walk past. I watch blankly as containers get loaded and unloaded onto trucks, and stare at the bales of packaged goods stacked up towards the warehouse ceilings—without really understanding anything.  Everything feels alien. Detached.  I walk past the enclosures of factory workers. They’re all sitting behind chain-link fences, on makeshift benches and picnic tables. Some are on their phones, others are having dinner. This has been their life for the better part of the year, their movements heavily restricted, even as the rest of Singapore has moved from Circuit Breaker to Phase 2.  As some of them stare back at me with equally blank expressions, I realise I don’t know anything about these people. Their lives are so removed from mine that I can’t even imagine myself in their shoes.  On the main road, I see plenty of lorries transporting migrant workers in the rear decks like cattle. Some are smaller and can fit 8-10 men. Others are spacious enough to carry dozens. Last month, two workers died and over a dozen were hospitalised in two separate lorry accidents. Apparently, that’s just the cost of doing business here.   While a vocal minority of Singaporeans might make a fuss about seat belts and safety standards, others will say that these are ‘unfortunate incidents’ that can’t be helped. The drivers should’ve been more careful. A few weeks later, the construction firms will beg for more workers to replace them, and Singaporeans will wait impatiently for their BTOs to finish construction.   For all its reputation for order and efficiency, this is the practical side to Singapore that gives me  pause. It encourages zero-sum games, where your loss is my gain, and the price of human dignity must be ‘carefully balanced’ against a construction company’s profit-loss statement.  Perhaps we can rationalise this because most of these workers are foreigners. The ballasts that Singapore shed in a storm. And even as they build our homes and pave our roads, they exist outside the social contract that Singaporeans have signed up for.  But when I walk past the chain-linked fences towards Tuas and see the Chinese and Indian workers sitting behind them, I can’t tell who’s a local and who’s a foreigner. Who’s a PR and who’s a citizen.  Do these distinctions even matter when they’re all stuck in brutal, race-to-the-bottom jobs in the forgotten corners of this city?  IV. The Marina   By 7 PM, I manage to round Tuas Crescent. From here, it’s a straight shot all the way to Tuas Link station. Despite my best efforts to make good time, I know I’m not going to make the sunset at Raffles Marina. I can see the light dwindling in the distance; no matter how fast I walk, it’ll be too late. But that’s okay.  Sometimes life just works out that way.  At the westernmost edge of Pioneer Road, solitary migrant workers lounge under the MRT shade on blankets. I can’t tell whether they’re praying or resting. Only later do I realise that it was Eid al-Fitr that evening, the final day of Ramadan. The workers had been sitting there watching the sunset, far from family and home.  I reach Raffles Marina and scan my TraceTogether token at security. My face is hot and sweaty and I barely manage to clear the temperature check.  Feet blistering, I limp past a Mercedes Benz as it’s pulling out of the parking lot. I poke my head in for a moment into the grand lobby of the Raffles Marina Club. In my sweat-drenched state, the air-conditioning is almost too overpowering. So I retreat via a side path towards the pier. At the pier, a French man playfully slaps the ass of his partner as they walk towards the Marina Bistro, their swimsuits glistening in the dusk. There’s a lightness to the air that stands in harsh contrast to the industrial scenes I just witnessed.  Growing up around the rich in an international school, I’ve noticed that there’s a specific kind of distance  the rich can create between the world and themselves. It’s a distance that can only be achieved with money.  Sooner or later, you start to believe that your problems are the only ones that matter. The only ones that exist. A cocoon of comfort numbs your senses and dulls your capacity to feel anything. Everything comes too easy. You know all the rules and just go through the motions.  Sometimes, this is the way I feel about Singaporeans.  Whose song was it anyway? The ‘Singapore’ vs. ‘Indian’ variant. Never have I seen so much being made of so very little.  When you zoom out even further beyond this city’s borders, and consider the hospital beds and ICU units being overrun and families not able to say their last goodbyes to their loved ones, it can make some of the outbursts I hear from Singaporeans sound spoiled and coddled.  I reach the end of my walk at Raffles Lighthouse with its selfie-taking locals, and I take a seat by the water’s edge to catch my breath. Malaysia lies over the bridge in the darkness. Over 6,000 cases per day. The half-finished condo developments in the distance are as dark as the jungle that surrounds them.  Everything looks all but abandoned.  V. The East-West Line  From Raffles Marina, I slowly trudge back to Tuas Link station, and board a train back towards the CBD.  Both Asian and Western cultures have this romantic idea of the mythical, unexplored West, whether it’s the Monkey King in search of enlightenment, or cowboys and Indians in America’s westward expansion.  But what if there is no epiphany?  What if, by attempting to replace my pandemic fatigue with a physical one, I got no closer to true empathy or understanding? What if, in the end, there are some things that I won’t ever be sure of and can never fully control?  At Tuas Crescent station, a group of migrant workers board the train and sit down in the seats next to me. We are all squeezed together, shoulder to shoulder. Too close for comfort. I get up from my seat and move towards the door. While I’d like to think that it’s not racism that makes me do this, I honestly can’t say for sure. I doubt Singaporeans can either.  Covid and job losses have created a pressure cooker, where all plans have been disrupted and all lines have blurred. And we’re suffocating, just looking for someone to blame.  On the East-West Line, the train doors open. The night settles in.  I look up from the latest Covid numbers only to find myself right back where I started.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

17,"Who Decides Where Home Is? After 17 Years, A Long Time Immigrant Reflects on Leaving Singapore",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-after-17-years-a-long-time-immigrant-reflects-on-leaving-singapore/,"Culture, People","Photography by Thaddeus J Loh.  As a child, Maria “Masha” Isaeva was plagued with skin rashes. They were so bad her skin would become flakey, red, and itchy to the point that she couldn’t sleep. Her doctors told her she couldn’t eat anything but potatoes—anything else would cause an allergic reaction. By the time she was 12, she was so underweight that her apartment elevator wouldn’t detect her presence when she was alone in the lift, making her unable to travel in it.  Desperate for a resolution, her mother booked them a flight from Vladivostok, their hometown, to Singapore, where Masha’s Japanese stepfather was residing (she refers to him as her Otousan, which means father).  Soon, with the help of Singaporean doctors and the tropical climate, her body changed. The red rashes on her skin started fading away, and she was allowed to eat an assortment of food for the first time—like strawberries, chocolate, and anything containing milk. She would rarely ever get flare-ups again—until recently. Red patches have reappeared on her skin. The cause? The stress of moving from Singapore in a matter of days. After 17 years, Masha’s visa is still tied to her employment. And when most of the foreigners in her company were trimmed, she decided to leave—following the exodus of almost 200,000 other foreigners who left in 2020 alone.  10 days To Go (From Masha’s Diary) I have made a list in a day of who I can meet for the last time in my last 10 days in Singapore. It’s funny having to squeeze years of memories with people into hourly interactions. 21 May 2021 Living in Pasir Ris, Masha was assigned to Loyang Primary School from MOE, where she attended before moving on to Greenview Secondary. Integration in school was not easy at first—between the language barrier and looking obviously foreign, she was often excluded. While she soon managed to make close friendships, it was her teachers who never warmed up to her. Soon after joining, Masha tried to join the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) as a CCA. She joined because she “likes discipline,” and because it was a good opportunity to learn Malay. But when it was time for all the enrolled students to collect their uniforms, Masha’s was the only one not there. Instead of picking up the attire, she was taken into a room where she was interrogated. “They asked me, a 12-year-old, what my intentions were with joining NPCC,” she recalled. “They asked me if I intended to send my uniform abroad, and they asked me to promise not to export it.” The conversation ended with an agreement that her uniform would be ordered in, but by National Day, it was still nowhere to be seen. “Just march without a uniform,” they told her. Unsettled, Masha dropped out.  “I told them I wasn’t going to go forth with marching on the day itself as the only person without the uniform, it’s embarrassing.” Over her 17 years here, the system has reminded Masha time and time again that she is a foreigner. Often, when flying back from abroad when travelling, she would get questioned by authorities. “You’re too young to be working here alone, we need to check your documents,” officers would tell her. Similar to Masha, I have heard from many Russian women that they are often questioned about being escorts or prostitutes in airports across the globe.  Now again she is reminded of her standing, as she waits for the result of her 10th PR application—the previous nine of which were rejected. 9 Days   Time has a very powerful way of filtering out chaos The noise of people you thought saw you are now silent The people whose intentions had been a grey area have a fixed colour palette now. This day will become a blur too, and moving will allow me to see things from a broader perspective, from a lens of a person who is not weighed down by a giant adolescent diaper. Those who do not become a blur, will be immortalised Are there more reasons to leave than to stay now?   22 May 2021 The last time I saw Masha before this interview was over a year ago. She told me how when we last met, I asked her a question that has remained etched in her mind ever since.  What keeps you here? When we met again, she knew the answer, one she had thought about continuously. It’s the relationships with people.  “My first love happened here. My first graduation and job too,” she said. “I watched my boyfriend go through NS while I got my diploma. I went to the funerals of my friend’s mothers. My own mother’s church friends became my second family when she left.” “Over time, my friends have become my everything here. When I’m sick, they are the ones who send porridge to my house and bring me groceries.” While heartwarming to hear, all of that is not recognised on paper. But while her documents say she is an immigrant, it takes barely more than 10 minutes with her to realise she is far from one. Her accent sways from intense Singlish to generic English. If you talk to her about her career as an Art Director, she can easily go on about the plans she had for Singapore’s creative community. These were so consolidated she even applied for PR via a National Arts Council scheme that rewards talents who intend to make long-term contributions to the local scene—but this attempt also failed.  6 Days   What am I feeling now? The word for this sits between the pages of a foreign vocabulary I am yet to discover. Like when you visit a new place for the first time, and you experience loss, disorientation and floatiness for the first couple of days Places I used to frequent as a student, the parks where we would have family BBQs or the traffic lights I would cross for daily business lunches  have become unfamiliar. It’s very uncanny.  I feel like my mind has already detached itself from this town while my body has not. My mind is floating somewhere, I will find out soon when I land.   25 May So where are you from? I asked Masha. “I’m a citizen of the world!” she laughs with a grin on her face. “Say that.” The second time I asked, she said she only knows that Singapore is home. “I feel the most stable here. I feel like I belong but literally, I don’t. I thought about that over Hari Raya. My childhood friends invite me to their homes every year. I’ve seen their siblings grow up and their parents grow old, but unlike them, I don’t know if i’ll be there next year.” While these memories float around vividly in Masha’s mind, they only exist there. There’s no tangible proof of them being there—and she knows it. “I’m not investing in and buying property, and I’m not in cancer research or finance,” she said. “And I really like that the government is putting locals first. Every country should do that.” But why is Masha not a local? She will never know—PR application rejections don’t come with reasoning.  Singapore has a relatively high number of foreigners living in the country, but what kind of immigrants are preferred remains unknown. On one hand, there are immigrants like Masha who are essentially locals—their relationships and lifestyle are built side by side with their Singaporean peers.  Then there are immigrants who come in with job expertise or financial prowess—your researchers, finance moguls, and shipbrokers, among many others. Naturally, the government may prefer these individuals for the knowledge and experience they bring with them.  But the same week that Masha leaves, Bloomberg announces that Singapore is the new preferred destination for the region’s ultra-rich and their families. This contrast begs one question: what will the future of integration between foreigners and locals look like? What happens when deeply rooted foreigners are forced out, but schemes like the Global Investors Program give the ultra-rich a fast track to gaining Permanent Residency (PR)? It is only understandable that the government would want to attract investment and talent to the country, but to what extent can these immigrants integrate into society? Last year, a survey found that more than 6 in 10 Singaporeans felt that foreigners were not doing enough to integrate. But as the Bloomberg article highlights, the newly settled rich are currently scrambling for luxury property, sports cars, and golf club memberships—is this where bonds with everyday Singaporeans are fostered? They would need to go far beyond their comfort zones if they intend to integrate into Singapore society.  For Masha, someone who has been through the same system as the average Singaporean kid, these headlines could be a source of resentment. But Masha says she is leaving with a free heart. “I’m not angry or sad, I’m just at a state where I’m trying to draw conclusions. After having been through so much here, there’s so much emotional baggage to sort through.” 5 days The most interesting part of my journey will start when I leave Singapore People will want to know where I come from, about my childhood, and why I’m not living there anymore after 17 years When you’re done chewing your gum, do you spit it out? 26 May 2021 Recently I interviewed Jane, a Singaporean woman who left her insurance career, car, condo, and marriage to live a digital nomad life in Europe. One of the biggest realisations she had was that all her old dreams and aspirations were in fact not hers, but those absorbed from the society around her.  When she came to visit Singapore after a year, the joy of seeing her old family and friends was trumped by sadness, a sense of feeling out of place.  “I love Singapore, and I love my country, but if I can’t feel at home there, then where can I feel at home? I felt sad because I knew I would no longer be able to fit in,” Jane said.  When I asked Masha what the scariest part of leaving was, she said something similar. It wasn’t leaving behind people or memories, as these can always be revisited. The scariest part was leaving behind a mindset, a way of living life she may soon outgrow. You can come back to people, but you can’t revisit a life you have evolved from. “I know once I’m out of this bubble my life will change 360,” she stipulated. “After seeing more of what life has to offer, I may not want to return, and I’m afraid of that feeling.” “That part is scary because that means I’ll have to put this huge chunk of my life—17 years—behind for good.” And how will Masha explain those years to new people she will meet? How do you explain to someone that you are Russian, but you feel more Singaporean, even though you can’t legally call yourself that, or live there? Until this day, her sense of identity has been heavily tied to being in Singapore physically. But once she steps foot on that plane, 17 years of life will have only existed in her memories and of those around her. How does one reconcile that? 2 Days “Why today so tired?” said Aunty Winnie from Cheers, who probably knows more about my everyday than the person next to me at work Aunty Winnie works at West Coast Plaza Cheers. When she found out I was leaving, she said “can give me something from Russia one? Souvenir?”  I told her I don’t have anything from Russia as I grew up here, but I will try to think of something “Never mind just pass me something before you leave”  I didn’t manage to catch her as she was off shift, so I passed her a letter and handmade bracelet through a colleague “Hey i know you r leaving Singapore this week, i’m so exhausted, can I just send courier to pass me back the powerbank?” A text from my ex-colleague and friend who’s known me for 5 years.

18,One Millennial Smashes Stereotypes In Her Quest to Save Disappearing Chinese Traditions,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-one-millennial-smashes-stereotypes-quest-save-disappearing-chinese-traditions/,"Culture, Events","Photography by Thaddeus Loh / RICE Media.  “Wow.” My jaw dropped open as I let my inquisitive eyes wander around … As I moved slowly through the space, I could not help but let my fingers touch the furniture as a sense of warmth swept through my body … I caught sight of my own reflection in the mirror. The opposite facing mirrors formed an infinitely smaller me in every reflection, as if revealing how minute one is in the universe. The black-and-white portraits hung on the walls smiled upon me, as if reassuring that no matter how small or misunderstood one was, one has a role to play and contribute.” Everyone has a defining moment in their life and, for heritage researcher Lynn Wong, this was one of those. Her short story—aptly entitled My Second Home—recounts the first time she visited a clan association at the age of 15. “I was there to learn kung fu and lion dance,” says Lynn, a fan of Wong Fei-hung and traditional martial arts since young. “But it opened my eyes to a whole new world.” The trip, you see, had been nothing short of an epiphany: “Before that, I was only able to learn about history through social studies and TV shows. Entering the clan however felt like entering a time capsule undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of modern Singapore.” The thunderstruck teenager began spending more and more time at the clan. In her story, she recalls a strained late-night encounter with her mother after one such incident: ““一个女生为什么要练到这么晚才回家?” (“Why does a girl have to train till so late?”) “I heard my mum’s disapproving voice as I unlocked the house door. I looked up at the wall clock while avoiding my mum’s intense gaze. It was already past midnight. “Because I’m not Cinderella,” I joked in an attempt to ease the tension. She was certainly not pleased with my reply … Growing up in a traditional Chinese family, coming home late was considered unacceptable for a girl, especially when the reason was training in martial arts late into the night at a clan association—a place stereotypically male-dominated and some say associated with secret societies.” Lynn had fallen in love without realising it. But unlike other childhood infatuations that are fickle and fleeting, this one would lead her to exciting new discoveries. Fast forward 17 years later to a typical weekday morning at the Kwong Wai Siew Lee Clan Association. All was quiet, except for the clicking of a camera shutter. Now 32-years-old, Lynn—who’s lost none of her youthful chutzpah—is busy capturing the clan’s sombre exterior with her camera. It is one of the handful of clans in the vibrant enclave of Ann Siang Road that have survived the onslaught of time. Clad in a cheongsam, Lynn is modern-day heroine, armed with more than just a clunky DSLR. She also possesses a psychology and business degree from NUS, several trophies in traditional Chinese martial arts, and a life mission. Only five years ago and with her parent’s full support, Lynn gave up her PhD at INSEAD to be a full-time champion of Chinese culture and heritage. She now holds a leadership position in five clan associations—including Kong Chow Wui Koon—and is in a race against time to document Singapore’s remaining clans before they disappear forever. For the uninitiated, clans once served as “embassies” for newly arrived immigrants from China, offering networking and commercial opportunities as well as lifelong friendships to those who have travelled far from home. Now stripped off of their original purpose, many clans are struggling to remain relevant. Lynn, however, believes they are more important than ever. “These clans existed to serve our forefathers,” she said. “They’ve touched lives and they’ve helped in nation building. I believe it’s our responsibility to preserve them, because they remind us of the struggle it took to get to where we are today.” Not many Singaporeans share her sentimentality. Of the 500 or more clans that were established in the country, only about 200 have remained, according to Lynn. “People often ask why is there a need to preserve so many clans. Why can’t there be an umbrella clan instead?” she says. “That’s because we’ll be losing a lot of diversity … China is so big, and each of these places have their own produce, festivals and language. Canton alone has at least 16 distinct districts.” These days, Lynn is all about damage control (“I thought I could revive some of these clans but I now realise how naive I was.”). She goes traipsing around the city salvaging mementos—badges, old photographs, even ancestral veneration scriptures—of soon-to-be shuttered clans. Recalling these incidents makes her grimace: “When I was at one of the clans, I spotted some old manuscripts in a trash bag. It turns out they were account ledgers from the Qing Dynasty! But the worst part was that the people who threw them away had no idea how precious they were.” “This is just the tip of the iceberg. So much is being lost every day,” she says, sighing. Of course, there are also intangible items like clan recipes and festivals that need to be recorded. Lynn whips out a photo album filled with fast-disappearing specialties like the Guo Zeng Zong, a type of pillow-shaped glutinous rice dumpling from the Song Dynasty, and the Mandarin Peel Duck, a duck-based dish featuring a golden broth, made from boiling the peel of mandarin oranges aged for 30 years. “It’s from Xinhui and was a tribute item for the empress dowager,” she says, referring to the latter. “The mandarin peel from there can be as valuable as gold depending on how many years it is aged. Unfortunately, the man who has helped me recreate the dish has passed away.” Lynn has compiled these recipes for Ho Yeah!, a Cantonese and Hakka food and culture festival she organised back in 2018. One of her biggest endeavours yet, it’s a subtle and clever approach to attracting the public’s attention, since food is a common denominator for Singaporeans. The next Ho Yeah! Festival—along with other heritage-related events and exhibitions she organized—was supposed to happen last year, but that was before a virus tore through the earth, leaving a trail of wrecked plans in its wake. It is now mid-afternoon but the Lee clan has received few visitors apart from the steady trickle of customers visiting the TCM clinic that’s discreetly set up in the back of the building. Many clans now survive by renting out available space, and this 147-year-old association is no different—apart from the TCM clinic, it also collects rental fees from an interior design firm occupying its upper floors. The clan’s main hallway—which is redolent of 1960s Singapore, with its mosaic floor, antique furnishings and Chinese lanterns—now doubles up as a waiting area for the clinic’s patients. Its walls are mostly adorned with framed monochrome portraits of men and women—portraits that Lynn helped to painstakingly restore—and the occasional Chinese poetry scroll. Among these, a photo of the late Lee Dai Soh hangs, his bespectacled face looking placidly upon those who may or may not recognise him as the legendary Cantonese storyteller at Rediffusion. Lynn is the only source of energy in this place—she’s now speaking with gusto whilst fiddling with her camera, oblivious to the inquisitive stares of the elderly patients. “Even though things have been done a certain way for so long, I think many clans now realise they need to change with the times in order to stay afloat,” she says. Sitting across from Lynn is one by-product of these changes. Madam Lee Swee Har, however, seems to be unruffled by the fact that she’s made clan history by becoming the association’s first chairperson three years ago. Things were very different when the 79-year-old was first introduced to the clan by her father at the age of 14. “The clan leaders were always male before this, but it wasn’t something I ever pondered over,” says the highly accomplished singer and chef in her native Cantonese. “There were more than a thousand of us, and we were all like brothers and sisters. We usually played music and sang when we got together, and also occasionally performed for the radio.” Lynn, on the other hand, isn’t impervious to this breakthrough: “Clans were once patriarchal, but I think there’s a trend towards equality. When I first joined the lion dance troupe in a clan, there was only one other female. It was even taboo for females to touch a lion’s head if it was new.” Today, membership numbers at the Lee Clan have plummeted to just above a hundred—its one and only youth member is in his 40s. It used to be that one needed to have the surname Lee and hail from one of three districts in China (Guangzhou, Huizhou or Zhaoqing) to be able to register, but since the clan’s very survival hinges on fresh blood, regulations have relaxed over the years. While Lynn herself isn’t a member, she is helping Madam Lee with a few events in conjunction with the Singapore Heritage Festival (most of these events are now cancelled due to the heightened COVID-19 restrictions). The pair first met back in 2017 while Madam Lee was giving a talk at the clan. “Lynn has done a lot for us,” says Madam Lee. “I think it’s really admirable to be doing what she’s doing in a capitalistic world. She’s not motivated by money. We need more people like her.” Beaming at the compliments, Lynn remarks: “It’s not that younger Singaporeans don’t care, it’s because they aren’t aware of all the things they could lose once these places are gone. I think we can all start by asking our family and relatives questions about our own ancestors – their name and where they come from before settling in Singapore. That way, it’s easier to find the clan you belong to. Lynn’s own story has come full circle recently, after she discovered the identity of her own great-grandfather in a clan register. “I never knew what he looked like until the day I saw his picture. I always thought I was a third generation Singaporean Chinese, but it turns out we’ve been here for longer.” Join Lynn Wong in a virtual talk entitled ‘My Journey as a Millennial Growing Up in Clan Associations’ on May 29, 10am.

19,"Ten Windows, Ten Perspectives on Phase 2",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-ten-windows-ten-perspectives-on-phase-2/,"Culture, Life","All images contributed by interviewees, with direction from RICE’s photo department. Responses have been edited for length and clarity. Over the last week, my colleague Zachary and I reached out to ten people all around Singapore, from all walks of life. We asked them to share a view from a window they spend a lot of time looking out of, and what’s been on their mind since Phase 2 (HA) kicked in. Had their routines changed? How would they describe their mood at this time?  Now that we’ve mostly moved our lives indoors, how do they feel when they look outside? The responses we got were thoughtful, conflicted, immediately relatable. Some talked about their anxieties; others shared what they’d been doing to pass the time. Often, they were as much about looking inward, or wondering what lies ahead, as looking out. (Many, too, alluded to the difference between looking and really seeing—being present, “standing still and learning to be astonished.”) Put together, we hope they bring a shared experience into view, and—in some small way—soothe your ache for the world outside by glimpsing it through someone else’s eyes. It’s amazing how quickly children learn things. One of the first ‘big’ words my son learnt was “coronavirus” (sadly enough). Unfortunately, they’ve also quickly learnt that this same coronavirus has a tangible impact on their daily lives.  Before Covid, we led quite active lives as a family with young children. We’d go swimming, visit the park, go for picnics and plane-spotting. Now they’re mostly cooped up at home, but they’ve been surprisingly sanguine about it, choosing instead to make even more of a mess in the house than usual. They’re quite happy to spend their time rearranging their bookshelves and taking apart their toys.  They’ve even learnt to say, “We need to stay at home, because of the coronavirus!” My husband and I, as parents, are the ones who feel as though their development is somehow being stalled and their enjoyment limited. Maybe we’re overthinking things, but when we had our children, we didn’t foresee that we’d be spending so much time at home with them, instead of being out and about. Before Covid, I was already wondering how I would guide my children in a world that was becoming unfamiliar to an old fogey like me. Covid will transform that world even further. Will we as parents be able to provide the necessary guidance? Will we be able to keep up? Such thoughts keep me up at night, sometimes. — Raaha is a freelance writer and editor who used to work in education. She took this photo a while back at her parents’ home in Bukit Batok. While it’s no longer her usual view, “I spent most of my youth growing up in that house. And my children spend a lot of time there as well, so it’s a view they are growing up with too.” This is my view on the way to work, usually in a Grab or some other form of ride-share as I don’t have my own car. Ironically, I enjoy these rides the most when the roads are empty, but that usually means the COVID situation is getting more severe. While I’ve gotten used to things like mask-wearing, the increased social restrictions are pretty frustrating. Most of my social circle is made up of other doctors working in different healthcare institutions, and because we’re discouraged from intermingling too much (to avoid a potential spread of the virus across hospitals), I haven’t seen a lot of my closest friends in person for months. It’s also very frustrating hearing about the cases of discrimination against healthcare workers, some of which have happened directly to my friends. I understand that the public is probably wary that we might be carriers, given the high-risk nature of our work, but it’s still disheartening to be ostracised when all we are trying to do is to get to work and deal with this ever-evolving series of events. Claps for support don’t mean anything when your actions suggest otherwise. — Shi Hui* is a doctor in a public tertiary hospital. Although she misses the fitness classes she used to go to to relax, she’s grateful for Netflix and her cat. Circuit breaker last year and this year are quite different. This year we [migrant workers] can still work, so it’s better in a sense. But because things were slowly going back to normal, I thought I could go home to visit my family. In January or February, I told them I’d come home in April. Then in April cases started to appear again, so I said change to August. Now it might be end of year, who knows. I need to make sure I can come back to Singapore as I’m the sole breadwinner, so if I get stuck in Bangladesh, my whole family will be in trouble. But it’s been hard to get them to understand. I’ve been busy studying for a diploma and taking courses for work. A few weeks ago, I bought Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons For The 21st Century from Kinokuniya. I’ve only just started, and it’ll take me a while to read it, so maybe Phase 2 will be over by the time I’ve finished. — Fazley Elahi Rubel is a migrant worker and advocate from Bangladesh. This is the view from outside his room, with his worksite in the background (he lives on site). I haven’t thought much about being stuck in quarantine, because I’ve just tried to get on with it. I’ve kept to a routine, and it’s kept me afloat.  In the mornings, I wake up, have breakfast, make the bed, shower, and get dressed. I never stay in a robe or pyjamas; I don’t even get back in bed till after work. But I try to spend as much time away from my screen as I can, so after work ends, I’ll stay on the balcony and listen to a podcast while looking at the view. Right now, it’s this one my friend’s friend made called Sentimental Garbage.  The balcony is the best thing about this room, because I’m one of those people that really loves sunshine and fresh air. I was so lucky to get it because I had this dread on the plane that I was gonna get the worst hotel, like, without a window even. When I got here, I was so happy, I was practically jumping up and down.  — Javid recently flew back from the UK to visit his family. When we spoke, he was on Day 19 of his 21-day quarantine. He had originally expected to spend 14 days in the hotel, but found out on Day 3 that it was going to be extended. Compared to a couple months ago, I’m definitely more worn out and resigned. It’s partially because a good part of my artistic practice involves performance-making. These last few months, it felt like live performances were slowly becoming possible again, so the sudden curbs hurt. They’re also a keen reminder that the timeline is not as linear as it has felt so far in Singapore, meaning the possibility of delay, cycles, repetition, going back and forth. It’s getting increasingly painful to contain my desire to move and perform. Some days, I struggle to write anything that feels meaningful. There is also an exhaustion that has endured though, somewhat independently of the changes in Singapore. Palestine, Myanmar, and India have all been on my mind lately. It stems from the helplessness of seeing not just the pandemic but also waves of political violence sweep up so many parts of the world. This exhaustion feels very palpable amongst my peers, a shared and growing grief. I tend to look out of my bedroom window throughout the day, but especially first thing in the morning, at sunset, and whenever it rains, which I love. I live on a fairly high floor, though, so I mostly look at the sky. I like the simplicity of this perspective. It helps me focus on things like how the clouds shift, especially when most of the time, I’m just busy learning how to live.  — Kia Yee writes poetry, reads books, and makes performances. Lately, she has also been playing Stardew Valley and spending time on Quanmin, a karaoke app. The hair salon I work in has coloured film sheets over the window and balcony doors, so it changes with the sun. During the day it’s green. At nighttime, it’s more pink. After work ends, around 9:00 PM, I sometimes come out here and have a smoke to relax. You can see the Pinnacle at Duxton and the Outram Park area from here.  It’s not so bad compared to last year, when we couldn’t open the salon. That was quite terrible. But I hope I can see my family soon. It was my mum’s 60th birthday last month and I had to miss that. We’re quite close because my parents divorced when I was 15. I did a video call with my family and my sister helped me buy a present for my mum, but I still have to pay her back for that.  — Tomoya, a hairdresser, is from Kanagawa, Japan. He moved to Singapore about four years ago. This is my bedroom window, which I tend to look out of throughout the day. The view makes me feel calm and happy. The block opposite my place is this beautiful teal and turquoise ombre, a bit like kueh salat. I also check that my plants are getting enough sunlight. I keep them in the corner near the window, and looking after them gives me a chance to unwind from how busy I usually am.  I’m quite grateful for this semi-lockdown because it forces me to take a break. I love my job, and I’m lucky that it both pays me decently and is stable enough that I don’t have to worry about losing it any time soon. And at least I still get to see a few friends for any emotional support I might need during this month. — Leticia is a teacher in an international school working with children with learning differences. She also runs a small craft business on the side, enjoys rock-climbing and long boarding, and collects tropical plants. My routine hasn’t changed much since Phase 2. I still wake up at 5:45 AM, wash up, catch the train from my flat in Punggol. The food court’s in Ubi so it takes about an hour to reach. I get there around 7:00 AM and help prepare the food. Lunch is usually the busy hour, but it’s more empty now. I leave around 3 or 4:00pm, and when I get back I spend time with my two-year-old.  The difference is that things are much more stressful. Since Phase 2 started, sales have been around 50% of normal days, but I’m still paying full rental and salaries for now. Delivery platforms aren’t helping much because most of our customers are walk-in. Plus we just moved into this flat a year ago, so there’s the loan. My son. Our helper’s pay. This is the main thing on my mind at the moment. — Yiping, an F&B entrepreneur, runs three stalls selling cai fan, Korean and Japanese food, and bubble tea in a food court in Ubi.  Before the circuit breaker last year, I didn’t realize there was a yellow flame tree outside my window. I thought the flowers were a trick of light from the golden hour. The window is in my bedroom and next to my desk, which I tried to avoid; I couldn’t bring myself to write there. Instead, I spread a yoga mat on the floor, and did sun salutations and read novels with my feet propped up on my chair. When I could no longer avoid my desk, I shut the curtains to cull the daydreams.  On the last day of CB, my brain was blocked. Lockdown had muted my ability to create spontaneously. In frustration, I flung open the curtains and noticed the yellow flame tree in full bloom. Sprouts of ochre showered the canopy, as if they had always been there, urgent and wonderful. I got some words on the page that day. In Phase 2 (HA), I’ve chained myself to this desk by the window again. The tree is in a period of transition: the bark is brittle and the boughs are bare, but up top, there is a smattering of flowers hanging on for better days. The yellow flame is battered but hopeful; I am the same. Now, I keep the curtains open. — Zachary H is a writer with RICE. Lately, he has moved his languishing to parks. My routine hasn’t had any big changes in Phase 2. I’m still going for my morning walks. I usually wake up at 5 and catch the first train at 5:47, then go to places like MBS or the green corridor. Lately, I’ve been going to the Kallang Riverside area, because I really enjoy the morning peace. Most people around me are running or exercising, but if you see the auntie snapping away with her phone camera, that’s me. Walking is very healing. I love to look at beautiful things and when I walk, I don’t have to worry so much. I just focus on enjoying the beautiful things around me. I take photos of everything— buildings, sculptures, nature, insects, the sky. Most of the time, I like to look up, because even if you’re in the same spot, the colours and clouds will change. If I take a picture from my window every day, it looks different each time. I never seem to get bored. After I come back from my walks, I make lunch and go over my photos, which is like getting to enjoy the route all over again. Maybe I’ll watch TV or play games on my phone, cook dinner, and then the day is gone. I don’t know where the time gets to. Time passes faster now that I’m older. When you’re looking forward to something, time passes fast, when you’re waiting for a bus and you’re in a hurry. You want it to come faster. But when you’re on the bus and want to enjoy it, you want time to slow down.  — Bee Cheng, a retiree, started off documenting her photos on a private Instagram account, but made it public at her son’s urging. She has enjoyed photography for a long time, and jokes that digital cameras are the best invention ever.  What are you looking at or thinking about in Phase 2 (HA)? Tell us at community@ricemedia.co.

20,Here’s What a Bonsai Master Taught Us About Pandemic Fatigue,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-heres-bonsai-master-taught-us-pandemic-fatigue/,"Culture, Life","This article accompanies our video interview with Mr Boh Twang Keng, Bonsai Master in celebration of Vesak Day. All images by Feline Lim unless otherwise stated.  Boh’s Bonsai is a home-cum-nursery tucked away in Lengkok Mariam. Mr Boh, Singapore’s premiere bonsai master, tends to his creations with a devotion that is rooted in Buddhist traditions. His fingers are long and nimble, his gaze is patient and discerning. “In a few years, you will be beautiful,” he says to a fledgling bonsai; with brittle bark and sparse leaves, it looks fragile and fussy to me. But Mr Boh is in no hurry to write off this bonsai’s struggle. “A single bonsai, seen from the perspectives of different people, can evoke a completely different response.” My assessment of this bonsai as fussy differs from Mr Boh, who views its growing pains as the source of all goodness. “Buddhism has many complex teachings, which require stringent studying to nurture a good heart.”  At Boh’s Bonsai, life is fragile. Without Mr Boh’s attentive care, the finicky bonsai’s will quickly perish. Often, they perish anyway, even under his watchful eye. His measured nurturing is sometimes futile, but that doesn’t stop Mr Boh from refining his craft or taking the time. His grounded approach to the art of bonsai reflects a central tenet of Buddhism, and a lesson for us at this point in the pandemic: the practice of heedfulness, also known as appamada in sanskrit.  The Spirit of Vesak Day  Yesterday, Buddhist’s celebrated the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha. For those who aren’t familiar with the meaning of Vesak Day, here’s a brief explanation: In Singapore, the celebrations begin on the second full moon in May. Vesak Day is a reminder of the universal law that all compounded things must disintegrate.  There are a few rituals which embody this universal law: deliverance of heavenly offerings like joss sticks and fresh flowers, singing hymns, eating vegetarian food, and making special efforts to bring happiness to the unfortunate. On Vesak Day, acting mindfully and with intention is paramount.  Venerable Muhinda, a Malaysian Buddhist monk explained the intentionality of the rituals on Vesak Day as such: “When we train our minds to observe the functioning of mental and physical processes we realise the true nature of our lives. We see how it is subject to change and unsatisfactoriness.”   In Phase 2 (HA), Can We Benefit From Heedfulness?  As I mentioned earlier, the art of bonsai and Mr Boh’s patience with the craft is one example of the practice of heedfulness. It’s the art of paying attention, which is the antidote to complacency. Because life is fleeting, heedfulness implores one to imbue each interaction with meaning and substance, to be vigilant of the possibility in every moment.  The observation of one’s own mind is a powerful tool that transcends religion—you don’t have to become a buddhist to pay attention. If you have meditated, then you know what heedfulness feels like. Now that we’re stuck at home with idling minds, perhaps we can harness some heedfulness to muddle through.  Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu is an American Buddhist monk, most known for his translations of religious texts. If sitting down to meditate feels overwhelming to you in this moment, he reassures us that heedfulness can be practiced even in the moments where we might not think to be mindful at all.  “We tend to kill the little bits of time. For example, waiting in the doctor’s office, sitting at a red light, or taking a break from work. There’s a lot that can be done in those little bits of time. Too often we think of the practice as what we do when our eyes are closed. But practice is practice everywhere. You’ve got the same mind, the same qualities of mind, that you want to develop, simply in different circumstances.”  The Power of Discernment  In Buddhist teachings, intoxication is used as a metaphor to describe the trappings of the mind. According to this metaphor, desire, cravings, and anxiety are forms of intoxication which lead to suffering. Discernment is the heedful, grounding force which frees one from suffering and fuels the enlightened mind.  How can we put this into practice? In the moments at home when we’re feeling damn sian, perhaps we can bring some awareness to the detours that the mind takes in frustration and boredom. In mindfulness exercises, to calm racing thoughts, you acknowledge them first, then give permission for them to leave.  It’s impossible to have racing thoughts or feelings of boredom at Boh’s Bonsai. Mr Boh is self assured and calm. Having spent years refining his finicky craft, he has realised something that we can all benefit from even while we’re stuck at home: “I have the chance to live a quieter, slower life.”  Watch the video here.  Do you subscribe to a slow life, or the practice of heedfulness?

21,"Pandemic Reporting Fatigue, As Told To Us By A Mainstream Media Journalist",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-pandemic-reporting-fatigue-mainstream-journalist/,"Culture, People","All images RICE file photos. Earlier this month, my colleague Sophie wrote an article about being sian during this long-haul pandemic. It was a colloquial way to say that we are sick and fed up with the virus. The New York Times has given a more fanciful touch to this emotion: languishing.  I get it. We follow the news, track the daily cases, learn about Covidiots flouting safe distancing measures, and get demoralised that the nightmare doesn’t seem to be ending. This is the news cycle we have been used to for more than a year, and we are exhausted. But what about the folks behind the bylines of news reports you read? Most of us have the luxury of ignoring Covid-related news if we want to, but for journalists covering the pandemic, they don’t get to choose. It is their bread and butter. After more than a year since the pandemic started, Covid-reporting fatigue has become a real problem.  The thing about journalism is that we often do not write about the difficulties of the craft. We take challenges in our stride and guard them as secrets, rather than putting ourselves in the spotlight. Our job is to tell the stories of others. To be fair, healthcare workers who are fighting the virus get it worse than us. But journalists are fighting another kind of fire, and it can be draining too.  In light of Covid-reporting fatigue, the following account is written from the perspective of a journalist, and is based on actual events that were shared with us.  The journalist is from the mainstream media, which covers the bulk of Covid-related news. The story has been condensed and compiled from a longer interview, with edits for length and clarity. While we recognise that this is only one individual’s point of view, and may not reflect the situation in its entirety, or the views, experiences, and practices of other mainstream media outlets, I believe this account provides a valuable look into the fatigue experienced by those who bring us constant news of the pandemic.  I have lost count of the number of stories I have written about the darn virus. Maybe a few hundred, since the pandemic started last January.  At the start, my colleagues and I thought this whole affair would blow over in a few weeks or months—similar to SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] in 2003 which started in March that year and everything was done and dusted by July.  This is why when it came to the daily compilation of statistics, it used to be just one of us handling it. These days, since the pandemic will be a long-drawn fight, we rotate among ourselves so it is less tiring.  Actually, reporting the statistics isn’t too bad. Stats are just stats and I report as it is. It is tougher to analyse and present facts about the virus in the simplest way possible because this is something that even top scientists are still struggling to grapple with.  I tend to doubt myself when reporting on Covid-related news. It is difficult to process what the experts say and churn a story out quickly. Moreover, as a mainstream media reporter, I face huge pressure to deliver the news accurately, since readers are taking whatever I report on as the gospel truth. Very often, I feel unprepared and have a sense of impostor syndrome.  And because I report on Covid-19 all the time, relatives and friends see me as a pandemic prophet, as if I know what is going to happen next.  “Will there be a lockdown?” “When will Sinovac [a Covid-19 vaccine developed by China] going to be approved?” The truth is: I don’t know! As if things are not bad enough, the Covid-19 situation is evolving rapidly. I have to be on alert and constantly monitor developments, which means I am thinking about work all the time.  I can never switch off from work, as long as the pandemic rages on. My line of work—to chase and report on news—is already intense enough but at least there used to be lull periods when nothing big happened around Singapore. With the pandemic, it has been a sprint all the way. For most of you, the pandemic is stressful enough, especially when you read about tighter restrictions or a lockdown. Just reading the news is enough to distract you and sap your morale. People wouldn’t even want to think about work. Instead, they would think about taking care of themselves and their loved ones first.  But for a journalist like me, news like this means I have to work extra hard to cover the stories. When the nation is reeling and recovering, I am forced to continue running. It is tough to beat this whole Covid-19 reporting fatigue. These days, I try to avoid responding to work messages on my days off. However, I always feel guilty, thinking that I’m not working hard enough.  
I’m sick of reporting on Covid-19 too. But it can’t be helped. Just because we don’t read or report on it doesn’t mean the pandemic is not happening.
 I even tried to wriggle out of Covid-19 reporting by requesting for opportunities to cover other stories. But I understand that covering the pandemic is part of my job. Moreover, everyone in the newsroom is already stretched. If I don’t do it, who will? Covering the virus has gotten to me: besides being more short-tempered and angsty, there were also times when I had anxiety and depressive episodes. My mental health certainly took a toll.  To destress, I exercise daily and spend time with my loved ones and friends. I also avoid reading the news unless absolutely necessary.  I know you are sick of reading those pandemic-related news reports. I’m sick of reporting on Covid-19 too. But it can’t be helped. Just because we don’t read or report on it doesn’t mean the pandemic is not happening.  As journalists, we are responsible for reporting on events that are happening. Although we might be tired of news relating to Covid-19, we still have the responsibility to report on key developments. People will still want to know; a drop in the amount of information we put out will be worrying.  I feel that people out there need to understand why we cannot answer every query readers have or report on every single Covid-related issue. We are just really, really overwhelmed. Like everyone else, I’m also struggling through this pandemic. Just because we’re always reporting on the challenges others face doesn’t mean we don’t have challenges of our own. In this time of crisis, let’s be kind to one another. Perhaps you can think twice the next time before you send out that nasty comment online or email to the reporters. There is always someone behind that byline.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co. And if you haven’t already, follow RICE on Instagram, Spotify, Facebook, and Telegram.

22,"The Future Of Leadership Is Vulnerability, And This Guy Has It",https://www.ricemedia.co/future-leadership-vulnerability-culture-people/,"Culture, Features, People","Photography by Wallace Woon. Mr David Chua, CEO of National Youth Council (NYC), thinks he’s far from perfect. “I don’t always know if I’m making the best decisions. But I suppose that’s life, isn’t it? Like most people, I’m figuring things out as I grow.” It’s likely that you’ve chanced upon NYC and the work it does in some form. But for those not in the know, it was set up back in 1989 as the national coordinating body for youth affairs with the ardent goal of developing future-ready youths committed to shaping a better nation. Future-ready youth I may be, I was caught off guard by the man’s raw display of vulnerability. It’s a touch of humanity that’s often unseen in typically stoic government leaders—not just in Singapore but across the globe. Higher-ups have the tendency to appear robotic, as though programmed to respond only through scripted answers. Even moments that are off the record seem staged at times. Decked in a plain casual tee, jeans and sneakers, David lacked the formality that comes with most leaders. Neither was he perfectly polished and rehearsed in any way. In fact, the 47-year-old apologised immediately for running late to our meeting. Just as we were about to begin, he admitted softly, whilst holding onto a cup of hot tea: “Aiyo, so formal ah. I don’t know if I’m ready for the interview.” Same, I remember thinking to myself. More than just a CEO: Vulnerable leader, ex-military man and father of four.  Admittedly, I knew almost nothing about David before working on this story. I was told that he’s “cool” and “interesting,” but that was it. Naturally, I turned to the next reliable (and millennial) solution: social media. Take a quick scroll through David’s Instagram and you’d likely see why he’s well-suited for a role in NYC. He engages in sporty activities like running, kayaking, and rock climbing—most of which are commonly associated with youths. I can’t help but notice other compelling posts; particularly memes of himself and wholesome family photos. Still, I wanted a glimpse into David’s personality beyond his grid. What is he like as a leader? Who is he really, when the lofty title of CEO is cast aside? I asked then, how he manages to keep up with youth trends. He simply shrugged and cited a time when his daughter pulled him to try “some TikTok thing.”  The way I see it, he had two choices: To dismiss TikTok as just another silly app—or to say yes, even if that meant making a fool of himself. He picked the latter. “It was fun, even though I didn’t know what I was doing.” Rather than shunning the unknown, he keeps an open mind in trying new things. Asked to describe himself as a teen, his answer was simple: “I was driven and competitive, especially in sports. I collected badges as a scout and played in the rugby team.” “Looking back though, I was highly ignorant about larger social issues. And I was definitely no changemaker.” Immediately, this elicited laughter in the room. Like me, his colleagues were intrigued by this earnest confession. Shouldn’t the CEO of NYC, by default, have been a passionate changemaker since young? But his point was clear: No one is perfect, not even someone of his current status. He explained: “Back then, there were no green or environmental groups. We were mostly enclosed in our school bubbles. My first encounter with e-mail was in 1993 when I was 19-years-old.” “The media landscape today is a lot more interesting … but it’s also very scary. It’s a different world.” David confessed that the notion of leadership didn’t come naturally to him. In fact, the desire to lead only surfaced after he started observing others in secondary school. “I looked up to senior scouts and thought: Man, I want to be like that person too.” And then it hit me: Not everyone is a born leader. People think leadership is innate, but leadership is a skill that can be built through practice. The only difference is that some of us never come close to uncovering that potential. As CEO of NYC, David is acutely aware of some missed opportunities that his children are choosing to forgo. “I’m very clear of what they don’t know—youth events and groups that they are not involved in, for example. Many youths are like them.” But as a father of four, he’s simultaneously exposed to the reality of youths. It’s clear that his role as a dad presents valuable insights into his line of work. He knows, for instance, that there are simply not enough hours in a day for youths to come close to doing everything perfectly. “Our education system can be very stressful. Naturally, this limits the mind space of youths. Being a dad, I’ve learned to suspend judgement. And hopefully, I’ve become more patient too.” Sit Down, Be Humble. Much of what bothers youths can be puzzling and hard to solve. This issue is compounded when a generational gap comes into picture. As a leader, David is confronted with similar roadblocks that stand between him and youths today. “Sometimes, I don’t know if my advice is even relevant.” Certainty and conviction are qualities that we often associate with strong leaders, but this self-awareness pushes him to ask more questions—better questions—creating room for new possibilities to emerge. Since his appointment as CEO in 2015, David began racking his brains to ramp up opportunities that would enable youths to thrive. These include programmes like the Youth Action Challenge, which encourage youths to take action, or the Asia-Ready Exposure Programme, designed for youths to gain social, cultural and economic perspectives of our ASEAN, China and India neighbours. The onslaught of Covid-19 has inevitably impacted Singaporean youths—especially those who are stepping into the workforce in such a precarious moment in their lives. Under David’s leadership, NYC has partnered with both private and public sectors to tackle issues such as job insecurity and upskilling among youths. Having said that, much of our nation’s concerns have snowballed. Some of these have grown so complex that it’s impossible for anyone to solve single-handedly. It requires great humility to overcome hubris, and David’s attitude was refreshing, to say the least. It strikes me as a unique form of power—for a leader to acknowledge the limitations at play. “It’s true that there is a very thick layer of pragmatism here. To create change, it takes the combined effort of all stakeholders. Youths, parents, employers, educators and policymakers must work together. We don’t pretend to do it alone.” Stumbling Through Uncertainty  Much later, during our photo-taking session, I observed how David playfully posed with hypebeast squats and peace signs. When I caught up with him in between takes, he told me that it took time before he started feeling comfortable in front of the camera. I soon discovered that he once took a personality test and it identified him as an introvert. “In the army, I didn’t have to interact with the public as much. It’s very different here in NYC so I wasn’t used to it initially. But I’ll take this as a sign that I’ve improved,” he laughs. Time and again, David actively places himself in zones of discomfort. He then asked about my career goals. To which I responded: “I don’t know, I’m still figuring it out.” Without a moment’s hesitation, he exclaimed: “And that’s fine! You can’t predict where life takes you. I didn’t plan on staying in the army, but ended up being there for 22 years anyway.” “To be honest, I just wanted an opportunity to travel. So I thought: Why not join and give it a shot?” The fact that he went into the army clueless, with little to no expectations, was both eye-opening and liberating. We are kindred spirits in that regard. Not every decision needs to be imbued with grand meaning and purpose. He went on. “I didn’t know that I’d be working so closely with youths one day too, but here I am. Most of us don’t know if we’re on the right path. Who knows where I’ll be years later?” The more I listened, the more it made sense. David is willing to face uncertainty head-on. He also grants youths the permission to explore and fail. At the end of the day, we all need the latitude to try new ideas. It takes courage to leave the land of certain outcomes, as shown by David’s journey thus far. But half the battle is won if we first resist the urge to judge our imperfections. Who knows what discoveries we’ll stumble onto if we choose to transcend the fear of failure? As David puts it: “Youths need to step into areas that are alien to them. It’s up to them to look, believe, and explore.” The man tolerates ambiguity, values progress over perfection. His path reflects a mode that he seems to operate on: Do it, even if it scares you. You’ll figure it out somehow and grow along the way. Maybe, just maybe, we ought to grant ourselves the same Get Out of Jail Free card. What makes a great leader? Let us know at community@ricemedia.co.

23,Singaporean Gen-Z Boys Don’t Want To Be Like Their Fathers,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-gen-z-boys-fathers/,"Culture, People","Top image: Shahzan Ariz. Photography by Marisse Caine. This is part one of a series of articles about Singaporean masculinity and how it is changing. In this episode we speak to Gen-Z boys who are confidently male, yet have an evolved idea of how this should be expressed. In the following episodes we will look at fatherhood, business execs, and fitness enthusiasts. I was scrolling TikTok the other day when I chanced on a young Singaporean teen saying: “If you’re Chinese and you have a perm right … you must be gay.”  While he meant it as a joke, it’s a mindset many of us are all too familiar with—men who hate on other men for dressing up because it makes them ‘feminine.’ Moments later, I stumbled upon another young Singaporean guy responding to that first video: “You could literally breathe wrong and these people will be like ‘eh bro, that’s gay,’” he said.  “We get it, you’re insecure and you want everyone to know that you’re straight so you avoid anything remotely feminine and gay,” he continued.  From #MeToo in the US to the ‘masculinity crisis’ in China, there’s been a global push to question—or enforce—traditional notions of who men should be. And locally, we have seen similar debates sparked by the rampant cases of sexual assault ever year, or even by how local ‘bro culture’ has turned toxic, perfectly exemplified by the hazing incident at Ngee Ann Poly where boys urinated on each other. Although I was thrown off by the fact that these jokes still get thrown around, like in the TikTok, seeing both videos get hundreds of comments and thousands of likes was proof that these debates are finally on the forefront of social discussions—especially among young people.  Why? Because masculinity is having a crisis.  Or, it can be seen as an evolution, the changes of which are most obvious amongst Gen-Z boys. The debate has existed long before they were born, but in a way, Gen-Z boys have been forced to confront it in an unprecedented way. Being digital natives, they have grown up on platforms like Instagram and Tiktok where these discussions are common.  Like the responding guy on TikTok, I have seen an increasing number of Singaporean Gen-Z boys shredding toxic expressions of masculinity, for example, by showing vulnerability or dressing in ways men traditionally shouldn’t. And seeing them I wonder how, when being raised by a conservative generation, did they get to where they are?  Singaporean Masculinity The ideal tropes of masculinity in Singapore can vary from race, religion, and age group, but there is a golden standard that seems to be pervasive: the successful career driven man that can support his wife, kids, and parents, while showing no signs of struggle or weakness.  When we asked our followers on the Rice Media Instagram page what they thought is considered unmanly in Singapore, multiple interesting responses came in. Many said that earning less than a female partner, or being supported by them, is unmanly. Others also said crying, caring about appearance, or caring about children can be seen as unmanly.  Overall, 86.7% of respondents said that they think Singaporean men are heavily impacted by toxic masculinity.  “I can only speak based on my own family experiences,” said 20-year-old Jonn O. in our interview, “but masculinity is providing for your family. It’s being the man of the house. It’s just how my dad has always been.” The same sentiment was shared by 18-year-old Tristen Tio, who said he grew up being taught that one day he would have to become a ”responsible man of the house” that could take care of his siblings, future wife, and parents.  And technically, one could argue that this vision is not necessarily bad, but it’s the way that boys are taught this as kids that is problematic. “Growing up, when you get punished and you’re crying, you’re told to man up and stop. That’s bad because you’re not taught how to express yourself and you essentially start bottling things up,” Tristen shared. Both Jonn and Tristen spoke about being forced to ‘man up’ time and time again and how it made that difficult for them to accept their weaknesses. And who was their role model of this? Their dads, because they embodied these teachings perfectly.  A Masculinity Crisis Is A Fatherhood Crisis Fathers are every boy’s first role model, which is a double edged sword depending on what example they set for their kids. Almost all the boys I spoke to mentioned how they struggle to have constructive conversations with their fathers, let alone get to the point of questioning gender and identity with them. When I asked Jonn why he can’t discuss masculinity with his dad, he said: “He’s just hard as fuck. You can’t crack him open. Any conversation like that he’ll just change the topic.”  But why is he (and so many other fathers) so adverse to discussing this? “Repressed feelings, and no outlet to express himself—especially at an age where he’s kind of set.” Basically, fathers are proof of what happens to men when they were taught since kids to man up—they struggle to access their soft, emotive side.  Telling your son to be a man implies that “a man is aggressive, emotionless and cannot cry,” said Dr Debmita Dutta, consultant and founder of What Parents Ask. “Parents need to realise that such an understanding of manhood can only harm their child in the process. Telling your son to be a man is a huge shortcut in parenting, without really understanding what he really wants.” For 25-year-old Harry Nayan, getting in touch with his own emotions was a long and tedious process of introspection. He told me how as a child, his father was always very closed off emotionally. Essentially, he was a victim of his own beliefs of masculinity—he was focused on supporting the weight of his whole family on his shoulders by travelling and working long hours, while being ‘strong’ for those around him and showing no sign of weakness.   “My grandfather moved to Singapore from India and he had to work hard to build a life for his family here. The same pressure to be successful was put on my father, and then on to me,” Harry shared.  “I saw the toll it took on my dad, he was working so hard, travelling everywhere, holding up so much without ever saying he was struggling. I didn’t want to be like that. It’s so taxing to bottle everything in the long run.” In a predominantly male household—Harry has two brothers—talking about feelings was rare, and by the time he hit his twenties, he struggled to do so at all. “Thanks to my ex-girlfriend and my current girlfriend, I was told I needed to open up and communicate more, which I have started doing.” Generational Gaps 19-year-old Shahzan Ariz currently studies fashion at NAFA, but getting to where he is now has been a difficult process because of his dad, who has traditional expectations of masculinity. From young, he was taught that being a good Muslim man entailed having to “provide, be dominant, be respectful and be the main breadwinner.” “I was always forced to play sports. Even if I like sports, it wasn’t something I wanted to do all the time.” His father always thought fashion was a ‘gay’ and ‘feminine’ passion to have, and he even told Shahzan he wouldn’t be a good Muslim if he pursued it. He eventually forced him to enroll in Multimedia Infocomm Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic, where he persisted for barely a year before dropping out and enrolling into fashion school.  “He thinks because I’m into fashion, I paint my nails, and I wear crop tops and skirts, that it’s just a phase,” Shahzan shared. “And I can’t really talk to him or anyone in my family about this or about my emotions.” “My dad has this egoistic thing where he doesn’t show emotions or can’t put himself down. I try to change my mindset to see his point of view, but he can never do that for us.” Like Shahzan, many boys of the boys I spoke to have realised that the role their fathers play—an often purely disciplinary one with little emotional connection—is harmful in the long term.  In 2019, the first longitudinal study that observed the paternal involvement of Singaporean fathers was conducted, and it found that local social norms often lead to absent fathers. This is not entirely the fault of the men themselves, but of cultural beliefs that place the mother as the primary caregiver for children, and the father as the one to handle the more practical necessities.  Speaking to TODAY Online about the study, one man said that emotional needs of fathers are not discussed enough because “our society still sees men as being strong.” Over time, this causes men to feel trapped by the expectation of them to be strong and never crack. And what we have seen with past generations, including many of our fathers, is how these beliefs turn into vicious cycles. The same issues that many fathers suffer from, like repressed feelings, are passed on to their own sons when raising them with strict gender roles. But now, with more open conversation on the matter, you could say it’s the first time we are seeing a drastic generational gap between young men and those who raised them.  The ‘Bros’ In School  The first taste of real life kids get outside of the house is in school. In school, “kids who are assigned male at birth learn through playground fights and so forth to see the world through the prism of winners and losers,” explains feminist Jonn Stoltenberg. “The one who wins is the one who walks away with the manhood, and the one who loses is the one who is made invisible and is feminized.”  In boys’ schools, which are not uncommon in Singapore, this dynamic is even more present. Tristen brought up how in his secondary school, boys would compete over who had had sex first or who had more girlfriends.  “It’s a big thing and you gain peer respect if you have a girlfriend or if you have had sex,” Tristen said. “And at the time, of course, I followed the same beliefs. I thought it was really cool as well, because that’s what everyone thought.” This ‘win-lose’ dynamic is also what leads to boys struggling to connect with one another on a deeper level. Suppressing emotions is seen as ‘manly,’ and many boys fear that showing affection to their peers will come off as ‘girly’ or ‘gay’. Some would argue that this is ‘boys being boys,’ but the over-emphasis on fixed definitions of masculinity can often have more serious effects. In 2019, the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) reported that suicides in Singapore are up 10%, and that the suicides rate of boys aged 10 to 19 are at a record high.  About the results, SOS senior assistant director Wong Lai Chun said that “we live in a society that stresses the importance of masculine qualities as a measure of success,” and that in men, “the slightest hint of vulnerability can be seen as an imperfection.” Talking about his experience at an all boys school, Jonn said that “there was no real conversation. It was just us fucking around the entire time. Once we graduated, none of us actually kept contact with each other.” “We didn’t develop a deeper understanding of each other. We didn’t recognise that we each had our own experiences and lives. It was just fun.” National Service One officially becomes a man once he has completed his national service (NS), right? Just look at Ah Boys To Men, one of Singapore’s most popular films, and what its title implies.  But it’s a pretty problematic notion, as it boils masculinity down to a simplistic set of traits the military teaches—patriotism, strength, aggression, and the win-lose dynamic I mentioned earlier.  “When I talk about NS, my family always says to ‘man up and go through with it like every other guy in Singapore has done,” Tristen said. “But I hate when people say that because if I don’t go through with it, does it mean i’m not a man?” Similarly, Shahzan shared how on multiple occasions he has been mocked by other guys for not having served NS yet. “When I have conversations with other guys about NS, there’s always one guy who comes in and says, ‘Eh, don’t talk about this kind of stuff. You never go NS you don’t talk. You’re not man.’” “Why does NS equal maturity? Why do you only become a man once you do NS? I can be mature or manly enough with or without NS.” Ah Boys To Men perfectly exemplifies what happens when boys are put in a predominantly male environment for two years. The fourth installment of the series casted a female soldier as a lead, unleashing a flood of sexist comments in both the film itself and by audiences online. The female lead and the different female characters in the film are often left to deal with catcalling and sexist comments—i.e. when they call a woman a ‘fat-rarri’. In 2017, writer Nelson Chong perfectly explained these problematic notions:  “They were the titular ‘ah boys’ who would be transformed into men. Three sequels on, the much-awaited evolution is nowhere to be seen … In a jaw-dropping minutes-long sequence, a long line of supercars form up to pick up a soldier who had been mocked and made fun of due to his slight obesity and awkward personality; and they drive off while the protagonists gape like 20-year-old recruits—no, more like pimply teenagers.” How Fashion And Style Has Emancipated Gen-Z Boys On one hand, fashion is a means for humans to express themselves. On the other, it’s also a tool for conformity and appeasing cultural expectations. Especially when it comes to gender, fashion has long been divided into an array of boxes divided by gender, stereotypes, and styles.  In Singapore, dressing like a man usually entails office wear or a polo shirt with berms/chinos. Even when dressing casually, it’s a t-shirt and shorts. While men don’t need to wear feminine clothing or dress androgynously to be liberated from toxic masculinity, Gen-Z boys are increasingly looking for the space to express themselves, including with style choices, without being judged or put in a box.  Slowly, this is happening. Every morning, the Gen-Z boys I spoke to make one crucial decision: to dress based on their personal taste, rather than by the expectations placed on them. They also dabble with more extreme styles out of their comfort zone. Tristen told me about how he models as a side-gig, which often entails outfits and clothes that are out of the norm. “Eh, why you dress like that, you gay ah?” is a comment he has gotten because of his modelling. “I know they are just trying to goof around, but there’s some truth that’s carried over with that statement. Like, they do believe it is gay.” “I don’t see anything wrong with being mistaken as gay,” Tristen continued. “What are you trying to prove by calling me gay? What are you trying to say when I look gay? A gay guy can dress like any guy, like an office worker wearing a polo shirt. They don’t have to dress like girls to be gay.” Despite his girlfriend encouraging him to wear crop tops and more androgynous clothes, he still doesn’t feel comfortable doing it out in public.  “It’s a really loud statement because it’s not something that’s normalized,” Tristen confessed. “People will stare and that’s when insecurities grow. I’m not in the headspace to not care yet.” Tristen told me he wished key male figures in Singapore would have paved the way, especially older ones. If you look at popular culture, it’s pretty hard to spot more than a mere handful of men breaking out of conventional stereotypes of manliness. And even then, Tristen admitted it would be hard to get over the stares from strangers. As someone who has tried to just ‘be myself’ when it comes to personal style, I completely understand where he’s coming from. I still remember the stares I got one of the first times I painted my nails. One morning, I was commuting on the MRT when an uncle sitting next to me spent the entire journey looking at my hands and shaking his head in disapproval.  For this reason, I have always complimented guys for dressing androgynously, even if they did it because it’s merely a trend. To me, what that does is just normalise apparel for being what it is—clothing—and not a statement to do with gender or sexuality.   “It can be horrible to paint your nails or wear skirts just because it’s a trend, but I also see the good side in it,” Shahzan said. “For every person that does it because it’s a trend, there’s someone else doing it because it makes them feel good about themselves, so it just normalises it.” Does healthy masculinity exist? One topic that’s come up repeatedly in my conversations with the different boys is whether healthy masculinity exists. The answer, unfortunately, is both yes and no.  Not all the traditional teachings of masculinity are bad, like providing, being responsible, being stable, strong, or successful. However, are these really qualities we should applaud only in men? Of course not. These are just traits of good human beings.  We can see that with the way women have started adopting these traits too in societies that are dismantling patriarchal norms. We don’t see women who are successful, career driven, and who support their children as ‘masculine.’ And I don’t think we should for men either. We should be judging each other on our values and how we are as humans, not on how well we conform to gender roles.  So as we move forward, maybe we shouldn’t be picking out what is healthy’ masculinity, but rather, shedding what we know is toxic about it. This way we create an environment where we are constantly questioning what is normal, accepted, or status quo, so we can be constantly moving and evolving.
