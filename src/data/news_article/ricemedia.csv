0,This Digital Gallery Is Shining A Spotlight on Tamil Women in Singapore,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-this-digital-gallery-is-shining-a-spotlight-on-tamil-women-in-singapore/,"Culture, Events","T:>Works is an independent performance company based in Singapore. It seeks to investigate the current urgencies of living in Singapore through different creative expressions in the public sphere. From 13-31 July, T:>Works presents ‘Festival of Women: N.O.W.’ a completely digital experience which makes the vulnerable and private public, to get to the heart of female intimacy.  Below is our conversation with Vithya Subramaniam, creator of Thamizhachi: A digital museum of Tamil Women Under Construction and writer-performer of Rasanai: An Invitation to Appreciate. She presents these pieces as a member of Brown Voices, a collective of Singapore Indian playwrights. We wanted to know more about Thamizhachi, the digital gallery that she curated which can be viewed here.  What was the inspiration for Thamizhachi, and how did the collaboration come about? In part, Thamizhachi: A digital museum of Tamil Women Under Construction is an expansion of my interest in the relationship between humans and  objects, and in the museum form. When the opportunity came to create a piece  through which the Tamil woman could be made visible, centering the work on  objects offered a way to demonstrate that her presence is profuse, it’s everywhere, it’s the everyday. The collaboration came when Brown Voices was invited to present a piece with  Festival of Women N.O.W. this year.  During COVID, traditional art experiences have been limited. What were the  benefits of presenting Thamizhachi as a digital gallery, did the boundaries of this  medium surprise or rejig the creative process?  On top of the practical benefits of being able to continue functioning in these  times, the digital format also means we can continue to take visitors and their  contributions for a really long time, far longer than we would be able to afford rent  on a physical venue. Importantly, in a physical venue, the museum will present as  a completed, authoritative collection. The digital format thus lends well to the ‘under  construction-ness’ of the museum in both function and form.  Can you describe Thamizhachi’s mission in three words?  ‘Thamizhachis are here’— and by that I mean that this piece is about  reminding us all that Tamil woman is and always has been here; it’s then about  making her presence visible; it also reminds us of the need to center the subject in  the process of making Thamizhachi, the digital museum. The Singaporean identity is in flux at the moment. COVID and the recent  outbursts of xenophobia, and racism have highlighted the dark side of nation making. Online, we’re seeing a collective push back against organisations such as  the People’s Association. Local officials are struggling to respond to criticism with  nuance. The Thamizhachi gallery cites identity as ‘perpetually under construction’,  how could this understanding of identity as an ongoing construction add to the  national conversation on racial harmony?  The Singaporean identity, as all identities are, is in flux… not just at this moment, but always. The sooner we recognise that we are all constantly negotiating  and making our place in an evolving idea of ‘Singapore’, the better off we will be. But Thamizhachi as a piece, is not a solution to our issues with racial harmony, it never set out to be. If we truly value our racial communities, we must value their works equally. Unless they set out to do so, we mustn’t burden the work by or about  minority communities with the mammoth task of nation-building. We must instead  actually listen to these pieces for what they are and what they set out to do. In this  case, Thamizhachi and the extended exploration, an one-night-only performance  Rasanai: An Invitation to Appreciate are works of recognition and appreciation of  the Singaporean Tamil woman. They are works of celebration. Sometimes, we just  want to celebrate ourselves, that is all and that is enough.    How did your respective fields of expertise inform your approach?  In anthropology, we try to stay conscious of the subject’s hand in the  production of our study. So, it was important to me that the subject of the piece, the  Singaporean Tamil woman, was herself involved in its making. That’s where the  collaboration through workshops came in. Having studied the history of the Indian  community in Singapore also meant that I came into this process already knowing  that we have a wide pool of possibilities to pull from. Ultimately, my task was to  present these possibilities to the participants and get a sense of their priorities in  this piece of representation that we were making together.  Was there a personal catalyst (an experience of othering or a conversation with  a friend/family member) which inspired the beginning of Thamizhachi?  That’s quite hard to pinpoint. It’s tempting to think of inspiration as linear  cause and effect, but it’s always there. I have always been and will always be a  ‘Singaporean Tamil woman’. Intentionally or not, the particular perspective afforded  by this way of being will never not inform my work. But something might happen at the right moment to remind us of what we’ve known  for a while. As we were considering what we might put up for the Festival of Women  N.O.W., someone told us that when they think of Indian women in the arts, they  don’t picture any of the Tamil women practitioners. Imagine someone telling you to  your face that, essentially, they do not see you. That episode reminded us that this is the way many people think across industries  and fields. Even when they know individuals personally, when it comes to the  collective group of ‘Tamil women’, this group is largely overlooked and worse,  looked right through. The irony may be that precisely because the Tamil woman,  the sari-clad Tamil woman, is the most visible token version of the ‘Indian’ figure,  the real breathing, variable, multidimensional Tamil woman becomes rendered  invisible.  Objects play an important role in this digital gallery, can you elaborate on the  importance of the material world in the construction of personal identity?  We live in a world where we are constantly spoken for by objects—our NRICs, ID and access cards, even tissue packets that speak for our impending  return. Material objects enact our ways of being all the time, naturally they enact  our identities and all the ways we construct ourselves. Instinctively, we recognise  this when we keep some things and trash others. Is there one particular object that captured your attention in a surprising way?  Initially I was weary of reproducing the token image with objects like the sari, thali, and pottu. But through the workshops, I saw how these Tamil women  themselves had complex, nuanced, long-lived relationships with these objects,  actively, consciously engaging these objects in their own construction of self. So  those surprised me, the objects that I initially dismissed as tokens.  What feeling or idea do you hope to leave viewers with as they view this exhibition? I hope visitors recognise that self-definition is in their own hands, that anyone has the power and resources to change the way they and/or their  community is represented.

1,Put Politics Aside And Bond Over Food: Can Chee Soon Juan Make This A Reality For His Cafe?,https://www.ricemedia.co/food-reviews-put-politics-aside-bond-over-food-can-chee-soon-juan-make-reality-cafe/,"Features, Food, Reviews","All photography by Marisse Caine for Rice Media When I learnt that Singapore Democratic Party’s Chee Soon Juan had opened a new cafe on June 25, I was in disbelief. Local celebrities, sure. Many have opened restaurants and cafes. But political figures? That’s something new. I had to visit the cafe, Orange & Teal, at Rochester Mall in Buona Vista, to take a look for myself. The first signs of the newly-opened cafe can be seen on the second floor of the mall: A row of about 10 congratulatory flower wreaths for Dr Chee from party members, friends, and organisations. Not bad for an opposition politician whom Singaporeans used to shun out of fear.  Inside the cafe Once inside, I’m mesmerised by the cafe’s vibes. The aroma of the cumin-spiced brisket, the dark teal interior, and the dim, warm lights remind me of a British pub. The piano and other household fixtures make the cafe even more cosy and homely. Like other customers, I’m hoping to catch a glimpse of the man. In many instances of celebrities’ restaurants, the famed personality simply appears once for a photo op, never to be seen again during daily operations. But not Dr Chee, who gets his hands dirty running the outlet. I am barely seated when he comes by my table, taps on my shoulder like a friend, and apologises for the wait. “If the food is good, let me know. If you want to complain, tell it to the kitchen,” Dr Chee quips. It is rare and refreshing to see this light-hearted side of him—so different from the grim-faced, combative political persona we’re so used to.  After ordering two plates of creamy butter tuscan salmon and poulet roti, I decide to explore Dr Chee’s mini library near the counter. You can learn much about a person’s character from his bookshelf. As a known bookworm, the books belong to him, with some contributed by party colleagues Wong Souk Yee, Paul Tambyah, and others. Not surprisingly, there are books on politics and world history, alongside other novels like those by Haruki Murakami and Veronica Roth. And yes, Dr Chee also features two books authored by him which he sells at $30 each.  The makan eventually comes. It may not be Michelin-starred quality, but the food is unpretentious. Western fare is offered here because it is easier to prepare, given the small kitchen. Speaking to the man But I’m not here just for the food. I want to uncover the restaurateur side of Dr Chee. He is a busy man. When he isn’t serving dishes, he is either expediting orders in the kitchen or taking selfies with customers. It is only when Dr Chee finally sits down with me for an interview that he catches his breath.  I’m surprised when he reveals that the idea to set up a cafe has been floating around for a decade, as he and his party members wanted a place for Singaporeans to connect. But they never got beyond discussions.  Then came post-GE2020.  “I told them if we’re going to get this done, let’s do it and stop talking already,” Dr Chee says. Together with investors and some party members, they chipped in funds to set up Orange & Teal. He makes clear that the cafe isn’t a party enterprise.  The money side of things, settled. What about location? Not easy. This is when I learn that the political climate of fear still exists. Dr Chee shares that Rochester Mall wasn’t his first choice. There were other places in mind, but when approached, landlords claimed they were taken. “Some saw me and didn’t want to do business with us. There was a point when I asked my wife to just go and see [the shops] and I don’t show up,” Dr Chee sighs.  The folks at Rochester Mall are more straightforward, and the paperwork was done uneventfully, he says. For a shop space of about 1,300 square feet, Dr Chee claims he pays about $7,000 per month in rent, an amount he deems as reasonable and allows him to keep food prices modest.  While footfall at Rochester Mall is lower than the adjacent The Star Vista mall, Dr Chee doesn’t think it is a problem.  After all, he doesn’t envision his cafe to have high human traffic, with customers fleetingly coming and going. Rather, he wants it to be a getaway for Singaporeans to slow down for conversations and coffee with friends.  Politics should be left at the doorstep, he adds. “You don’t have to be of a certain political stance to come here and eat. Just enter.”  Taking the chance, I tease and ask if anybody from the establishment has popped by for a drink. That would have sent a cohesive message that food can transcend political differences.   Not yet, he says. But he has a politically-bizarre idea: inviting Education Minister Chan Chun Sing to his cafe for lunch. After all, the minister’s office is just a stone’s throw away.  Challenge accepted, Minister Chan? Once the dust has settled, Dr Chee intends to develop the cafe towards a social enterprise model.  Ideas in the pipeline: giving local artists, musicians and writers a free space to showcase their work. Employing disabled Singaporeans. Inviting those invisible to us to eat at the cafe, such as cardboard collectors.  In fact, he has already done the latter, having treated cleaning staff at the mall to a meal at his cafe. “I want the cafe to not just be about dollars and cents. It should be a place where humanity counts,” says Dr Chee.  The man and his family While Dr Chee and I are chatting, the cafe continues to run with the help of his family. Everyone is involved: Wife Huang Chih-mei and their three grown-up children, An Lyn, E Lyn and Shaw Hur. The past week has been exhausting, but Dr Chee shares it has been worthwhile to do this as a family.  “When I first told my friends I’m opening a cafe, they said I’m crazy, given the current F&B situation. But I didn’t spring it on my family. They were unsurprised as they already knew I had wanted to do this for some time.” His 22-year-old daughter An Lyn, who handles the cafe’s publicity, says she feels bad for her dad and mom when she sees them working tirelessly to keep the cafe going.  True enough, Dr Chee hardly has free time these days. Before the cafe opened, there was much coordination to do. When not at the cafe, he walks the ground in Bukit Batok, the constituency he contested in last year. The cafe as a soft power? I’ve known Dr Chee as a confrontational figure. I have read about his arrests for illegal public assemblies, and his scathing criticisms of the government. I don’t always agree with his causes, but I respect Dr Chee’s tenacity. Realising combative methods and overly-ideological ideals don’t sit well with most Singaporeans, he changed tack.  During GE2020, he delved significantly into municipal issues instead of focussing entirely on national policies or “fighting for democracy”. Now, he has opened a cafe, apparently a first among local politicians.  Is this as a political move to gain goodwill from Singaporeans and rejuvenate his public image as a politician who experiences the first-hand challenges of operating a food business?   Already, I have observed that his cafe has attracted many middle-aged customers, which is peculiar since it is usually the younger ones who patronise cafes. Perhaps many are either his long-time supporters or Singaporeans who have been observing him for years and are curious what he has up his sleeves. Dr Chee has always been idealistic, be it with the causes he advocates for, or foraying into F&B during the pandemic when many in the industry are barely surviving. The profits from running a cafe aren’t high, more so with the way he intends to run it.  But I have to admire his perseverance, even with hurdles ahead. This is a trait worth emulating. Orange & Teal operates from 11 AM to 9 PM from Sundays to Thursdays, and till 10 PM on Fridays and Saturdays. The cafe is closed on Mondays. Address: 35 Rochester Drive, #02-12 Rochester Mall.

2,Why Do Christians in Singapore Venerate Religious Artefacts?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-why-do-christians-in-singapore-venerate-religious-artefacts/,"Culture, People","All images by Zachary Tang unless otherwise stated. Constructive discussions on faith and ethnicity can be tough when folks lack an understanding of cultural practices. So for this entire month, we’re exploring the history and use of religious artefacts across different religions in Singapore. After looking into how Hindu devotees connect with God, we now examine the iconography involved in Christianity and Catholicism. When we think of Christian art and iconography, the intricate frescos in the Sistine Chapel, or sprawling paintings like Cranach the Elder’s Altarpiece at Wittenberg, might come to mind. But religious items and articles, owned by individual devotees and meant for everyday use, are wrought with the same degree of care and beauty, and possess as much symbolic power. RICE speaks with Friar Aiden Peter, OFM (Order of Friars Minor), a Franciscan Friar of the Custody of Saint Anthony, as well as Bishop Terry Kee, Vice President of the National Council of Churches of Singapore, to learn more about the use and history of religious items in Catholicism and Protestantism, respectively.  Catholicism What is a rosary? The Rosary is a Scripture-based prayer. The repetition in the Rosary is meant to lead one into restful and contemplative prayer related to each Mystery. The gentle repetition of the words helps us to enter the silence of our hearts, where Christ’s spirit dwells. The Rosary can be prayed privately or with a group. How did this practice come about?  It is commonly held that in 1208 St. Dominic de Guzmán (founder of the Dominican Order) received a heavenly vision of the Blessed Mother, who instructed him to spread a new devotion called the Rosary. Ever since then, St. Dominic and his Dominican religious order have been associated with the invention of the Rosary and its spread throughout Europe. The Rosary remains a staple of Roman Catholic piety and is one of the most cherished and venerated prayers around the world. Do all Catholics wear the rosary? The rosary is an expression of piety closely tied to the Church’s sacramental life. Paragraph 1676 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church expresses the following about the practice of pious devotions (e.g., the rosary): “The piety of the people is a storehouse of values that offers answers of Christian wisdom to the great questions of life. It creatively combines the divine and the human, Christ and Mary, spirit and body, communion and institution, person and community, faith and homeland, intelligence and emotion.” Because of its great blessings, Catholics everywhere have found multiple ways to keep the rosary near them at all times, whether that be in their purse, on their car’s rear-view window or as a bracelet or rosary ring. Where can I get a rosary? You can buy rosaries from Catholic religious article shops in Singapore. Alternatively, you can order rosaries online. The price can range from as low as $2 to above $100, depending on the materials. After you buy a new rosary, many will bring it to a priest to have it blessed. The priest will say, “To the honour and glory of Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, in memory of the mysteries of the life, death and resurrection of our Lord, the same Jesus Christ, may this crown of the most holy Rosary be blessed and sanctified in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit”. Alternatively, the priest would use the following short blessing formulary: “May this (name of religious article, e.g., cross, rosary, etc.) and the one who uses it be blessed, in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen”. What is a Tau cross? The Tau cross resembles the crucifix and is often associated more specifically with the Franciscan order. But the Tau is based on Hebrew, so most may not recognize it, whereas more people are familiar with the crucifix as a Christian symbol.  “Tau” is the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet and was used symbolically in the Old Testament. It was already spoken of in the Book of Ezekiel and is also closely associated with the Greek alphabet’s last letter, which is Omega.  That reminds us that Christ is the beginning; he is the end, as it appears in the Book of Revelation 21:6; 22:13: “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water without price from the fountain of the water of life. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.” The Christians adopted the Tau because its form reminded them of the Cross on which Christ was immolated for the salvation of the world. Where can you buy a Tau cross? Like the rosary, Tau cross prices vary, depending on what they are made of; they are easily available in shops that sell religious articles. What about statues of Saints? A lot of people will have a dedicated space in their homes where they place statues of saints. These statues remind them of the great deeds done by the saints and renew their devotion to these saints.  But no, there’s no worshipping. Christians who pray before statues do so to honor God or the saints, praying to the person “behind” the image rather than the image itself. A Christian is not bound to the statue. It is simply a representation of God (or a saint) and is a material object that is shown respect to. Another way to put it is that statues are holy reminders of various saints and of God. They remind us of heavenly things. Statues are instruments, tools to be used in the spiritual life and not ends in themselves. What about relics? Relics include the physical remains of a saint as well as other objects which have been “sanctified” by being touched to his body. They’re categorised into three classes. Namely, First Class Relics (these are bits of the mortal remains of saints, e.g., bone, flesh, a drop of blood, or even hair), Second Class Relics (these are items of clothing worn by the saint or items used by the saint) and Third Class Relics (these are items that a saint touched or that have been touched to a first- or second-class relic of a saint). If you go to the Basilica of St Anthony of Padua in Italy, you would be able to see the incorrupt tongue of St Anthony. In Assisi, Italy, you would be able to find the remains of Saint Francis of Assisi kept in the crypt under the main altar in the Basilica. Here, in our Custody (Custody of St Anthony) we have fragments of bones of St Francis of Assisi and St Anthony of Padua.  Just like these statues, relics remind us of the exemplary lives of the saints which can give us much encouragement when facing struggles of our own. Where do you obtain relics? You won’t be able to obtain relics in any of the religious shops! One would have to write to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. They’re the official source in obtaining a relic. We place requests for relics of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony of Padua since our Custody’s patron saint is Saint Anthony, and Saint Francis is the founding father of the Franciscan Friars.

The interview has been lightly edited for structure and clarity.
 What are some religious articles or items common to Protestant Christians? In Protestant Christianity, it is common for Christians to place a cross by or at the entrance of their homes and Bible verses in their homes. Some Christians may wear or carry crosses around with them as a reminder or identification of themselves as Christians. Do all Christians follow this practice? Not all Christians adhere to this practice due to various differences in theological understanding and conviction of different denominations. One of the main concerns of all Christians is that these objects should not become idols for adoration and praise. Where can we obtain these religious items? It is usually available for purchase from Christian book and gift shops. The cost varies from a few dollars to a few thousand, depending on the material, craftsmanship, handcrafted or made by machine, etc. Do these articles need to be blessed before we use them? As we wear them mainly as reminders and identifiers, there is no need for consecration or blessings before use. How did this practice come about? In the early days of Christianity, there were some who believed that, similar to the idea of amulets, the cross offers the wearer protection from evil.   It is not known exactly when and how the practice came about but they are written evidence of the practices in writing and paintings dating back to as early as the 2nd Century CE. For example, Syrian Christians hung a Christian cross on the eastern wall of their house and prayed in that direction as early as the 2nd Century. However, after the Reformation in the 16th Century, there was no need to have charms or amulets anymore because of our belief that Christ is with us, even to the ends of the world, as he promised. So, for protestant Christians, the cross that we wear or hang in our homes now serves as a reminder to ourselves and an identifier to others that we are Christians. We are carrying the cross of Christ as he commanded us to. As seen above, the tradition and history of Christian religious artefacts are unusually wide and diverse because there are two major denominations of Christianity—namely, Catholicism and Protestantism. Having said that, the use of religious items in both denominations ultimately leads to the same destination: reminding the devotee that they are a Christian, a child of God.

3,"Singapore, If Xenophobia Determined Our Policies",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-singapore-xenophobia-determined-policies/,"Current Affairs, Features","All images from Rice File Photos. You don’t have to look hard to find strains and spores of xenophobia. It’s in your family group chats; it’s in local property listings; it’s in the forum letters published by newspapers; it’s in the comments section of viral Facebook posts. So despite the wave of public anti-foreigner verbal abuse and violence over the past couple of months, can we truly say that the magnitude of xenophobia in Singapore has increased during the pandemic? The undercurrent of jingoism has always existed—it’s just that people are intensely acting on their fears now, an extension of Covid-induced anxieties. Fear of immigrants takes different forms of course. There’s the distress about losing demographic ground to other groups; an outward resistance to the idea that the native majority will be overrun by the foreign population. I.E. the “bugger off, we’re full” platitude. Driven by racism, derisive comments and sweeping statements about foreigners are made to spread the idea that they’re not fitting in or refuse to assimilate with locals. True in some cases, I suppose, considering expat bubbles. But unfair to paint everyone the same colour. But the more formidable xenophobic anxiety is rooted in economics—the fear of losing jobs and suffering stagnant wages due to foreigners coming here to work. The misconception that the average immigrant in Singapore has an easier time finding work, pushing locals out of the job market. Or the misconception that the average immigrant gets paid twice as much, or gets more government assistance than native residents do. While the anxiety over shattered rice bowls and tougher livelihoods is understandable, the more extreme cases of xenophobia are more often than not rooted in uninformed positions on foreign labour and capital. These folks might not be aware of the vital, crucial importance of a free-market economy and free trade agreements, especially for a country as small as Singapore. One of the many agreements—but the most vilified one—we’ve signed is the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. Dubbed CECA for short, it’s been the rallying flag for some local circles to proclaim that Indian professionals have been stealing jobs and acquiring citizenship with the help of the government. Without getting too deep into the specifics, CECA was signed in 2005 to enhance bilateral ties between India and Singapore, spurring even bigger growth in flows concerning trade, investment and people. Tariffs, import taxes from either country, will be reduced or removed. Singaporeans and Indian nationals have an easier time conducting business and investments between both of their countries. Among other mutual economic benefits that have ensued since then. And yet, the discomfort over CECA persists, prompting the Ministry of Trade and Industry to issue statements to debunk prevailing misbeliefs like unconditional immigration privileges and over-concentration of Indian nationals. Which didn’t do much to allay fears when the Delta variant of Covid-19—first found in India back in April—arrived, aggravating the mistrust between the native population and Indian migrants in Singapore. Loud calls for draconian, anachronistic measures were made, like shutting down our borders to foreigners. Again, not a new concept. Conceding to Xenophobia Alright then, so here’s a thought experiment: what if the authorities relent and said fine, you nationalists win? The borders to Singapore are closed; no immigration allowed. Stricter border controls all around, make it impossible for outsiders to become new Singaporean citizens. Companies can only employ locals—in fact, foreign companies aren’t allowed to set up or invest here. Essentially, a Singapore exclusively for Singaporeans. Let’s look at the immediate impact. Many industries that employ a lot of low-skilled immigrant workers—such as construction and cleaning services—will face a phenomenal shortage of labour. Migrants tend to fill the labour-intensive, high-risk jobs that citizens don’t want to take for the pay offered. If we’ve sent all the foreigners back, who’s going to build that new BTO flat in Potong Pasir? Construction projects get delayed, including housing and other essential public amenities like MRT stations, schools and hospitals. Sectors like retail and F&B get hit too, disrupting the service standards that Singaporeans currently enjoy. Less manpower from abroad means lesser people in customer service after all, so it’ll be hard to find people to man counters, cook in kitchens or be waiting staff. And we all know just how much Singaporeans hate waiting too long for their food to be served. To fix this, significantly higher wages can be offered to attract more local workers to the service jobs that many immigrants occupy, be it nursing, domestic housekeeping or caregiving. Maybe if we’re earning big bucks to clean someone’s windows, we would. But higher costs borne from employing locals translates to higher costs for consumers. And if labour costs raises the price of medical treatments, fast food and houses, people will soon purchase fewer of them. Push up costs too much, and some jobs—like those in manufacturing and remote customer service—might disappear or move to other countries. That preferential treatment for local workers? Yeah, it’ll displace more jobs than create them in the end. White-Collar Woes Okay, so what if we run on the presumption that Singaporeans will only allow immigration when it’s convenient for them? Let’s say migrants are only let in to work in jobs like domestic helpers and construction workers. Locals will take everything else. On paper, it would seem like a win-win. In reality, we still need foreign professionals because (a) we’ve got too small a pool of domestic talent and (b) brain drain. Six in ten Singaporeans are willing to leave the country in pursuit of better opportunities, wages, living standards, or even socio-political climates. Indeed, many have found success and genuine happiness living abroad. So what does it mean for white-collar industries if we’re keeping it local? When professional talent becomes scarce, businesses can’t or grow without exceptional work output. And since the unique perspectives and knowledge of foreign experts and entrepreneurs are unavailable, businesses can’t innovate. We’d be stuck with Commodore 64s while the rest of the world run with Apple Silicon Macs. Let’s look at the big picture, then. Singapore runs on an export-driven economy, playing the intermediary role where we take in raw materials and raw ideas before turning them into better products to export. We’re a country-sized middle manager, shipping out electrical machinery, mineral fuels, chemicals and pharmaceutical products that have been transmogrified from materials provided by other resource-rich countries. Thus, the necessity of foreign direct investments and letting global companies site projects in Singapore. Scaring foreign investors, companies and entrepreneurs away will only serve to shrink the flow of our exports, resulting in a trade deficit. This, in turn, affects investor and consumer confidence, affecting our global financial standing. With our currency and financial institutions devalued, we pay more for imported products. We all lose when the economy gets stifled by xenophobia—less jobs, higher costs of living, and little hope at the end of the tunnel. Open Policies Of course, the hypothetical proferred above is a simplistic take on the state of xenophobia in Singapore, an elementary argument that pits locals against foreigners. Real life is complex, and so are our nuanced concerns about the approaches adopted and implemented by the government to strike an equitable sharing of economic benefits. On the most part, Singaporeans are fine with having foreigners working here. But are we relying too much on them? How do we ensure that those left behind due to immigration get to upgrade their skills for gainful employment?  Those questions—among many, many others—doesn’t always have clear answers. The underlying lesson here: Singaporeans have little choice but to rely on trade, foreign capital, investment, manpower for growth to gain preferential treatment in the global economy, including tariff-free access to overseas markets. And that means living with free trade agreements like CECA too. It’s completely fair for Singaporeans to feel edged out over losing jobs to foreigners, but without a workforce filled up by them, we’ll be in a far worse position. The global talent network needs to be accessed to learn from them to remain relevant and competitive. Truth is, Singapore remains vulnerable to international shocks and cannot lose any manner of competitiveness—we’re too tiny a domestic economy to stimulate local demand, unlike China, India or even Indonesia. Another truth: the Singapore government has actually tightened restrictions on foreign workers in recent years. Contrary to popular belief, it’s actually pretty hard to get citizenship here with immigration getting more restrictive. It got even more so over the last year due to the pandemic. So we’ve learned that a retreat from globalisation is not the solution, especially for small economies. Immigration and an open economy are not evil; Singaporeans have been reaping the rewards all these years, after all. We’re paying Value Dollar Shop prices for everyday goods, we’re enjoying a multitude of high-end services, we’re eating affordable food with ingredients sourced all over the world. For policymakers, their responsibility is to ensure that the benefits of letting foreigners into our fold are shared equitably among all. But on our end, it would probably serve us well to change our mindsets; even leverage on the opportunities of a global network. Also, why spend so much time and energy finding ways to sicken ourselves with toxic xenophobia? We’ve already got one global endemic to deal with, there’s no need to concentrate on another.

4,The CECA Debate Is Pointless If No One Understands How Immigration Works,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-having-a-debate-on-ceca-is-pointless-if-no-one-knows-how-immigration-works/,"Commentary, Current Affairs","Photography by Zachary Tang for RICE Media unless otherwise stated.  Last month, SingStat released Census 2020, a national survey conducted every 10 years on the key characteristics of Singapore’s population.   On the surface, not much has changed. Singapore’s total population grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, the slowest since independence. In line with the Government’s CMIO model, the ethnic composition of the resident population has also remained stable, with 74.3 percent Chinese, 13.5 per cent Malays and 9.0 per cent Indians in 2020.  But there are also worrying trends. Singaporeans are getting older, with seniors accounting for 15.2% of the population in 2020 (vs. 9% in 2010). As people have become more educated and career-oriented, they are also staying single for longer. Consequently, the nation’s total fertility rate (TFR) continues to decline below the replacement rate for the population.  This means that in the coming decades, Singapore’s resident workforce will be unable to support its economy. Foreigners and immigration will be necessary to fill in the gaps.  Intellectually, it shouldn’t be hard for Singaporeans to understand this mathematical reality. Since independence, the Singaporean economy has been built, in large part, due to its liberal immigration policies.  Yet domestic sentiment against immigration has deteriorated, with CECA being the most oft-cited example of how the Government is favouring foreigners for PMET jobs over Singaporeans. This has led Minister Shanmugam to issue an open challenge to PSP’s Leong Mun Wai to debate CECA on its merits.  This debate will likely occur in the coming weeks in Parliament. While I would like to see an in-depth policy discussion on, say, Chapter 9: Movement of Natural Persons of CECA, and to what extent ‘Expeditious Application Procedures’ differ from standard immigration processes, I’m also not holding my breath.  That’s because no one really understands how immigration in Singapore works.    Who Gets to Become a PR?  Imagine you’re the foreign spouse of a Singapore Citizen. You’ve been living in Singapore for at least three to five years. You’ve held your wedding ceremony in Singapore and registered your marriage with the Singaporean government. Both you and your spouse hold down steady jobs and are thinking of starting a family. Before you do so, you apply for PR.   How many tries should it take for you to get approved?  Rationally, you would think that the answer is one. That a foreign spouse of a Singaporean Citizen should automatically get their PR on the first try.  In reality this is not always the case. Despite having only lived in Singapore for just over a year, I personally know of three couples, where the foreign spouse was rejected at least once while going through Singapore’s immigration system.  After their applications were rejected, two of these couples attended a Meet-the-People session, where they sought the assistance of a prominent MP / Minister in their district. The MP wrote them a nice recommendation letter, whereupon their application was finally approved on the second or third try.  These are not isolated incidents. I’m sure many Singaporeans have heard of similar stories.  On the flip side, I also know a few highly-paid expats who got approved for their PR on the first try, after a mere two years in Singapore. Without throwing any of my friends under the bus, I know that many of these new PRs are aware that they can renounce their status at any time, and cash out their CPF for greener pastures.  For them, Singapore’s immigration system is a win-win proposition. Free money.  The disparity between these two immigrant experiences highlight several problems: 1. The fact that an MP or Minister had to be involved at all suggests that there are inefficiencies and gray areas in the current immigration system 2. It gives off the impression that a government bureaucrat is second-guessing a decision made by a Singaporean Citizen (i.e. who to marry), based on an unknown weighting of criteria 3. It creates the perception of an unlevel playing field, where there are ‘fast lanes’ for certain groups, and that entry into Singapore is based on ‘who you know’ rather than your intrinsic merits.  All of these points could very well be untrue. In fact, it is far more likely that these bureaucratic hurdles arose due to misalignments in policies and processes rather than some Machiavellian plot to replace Singaporeans with foreigners. But the point here is that nobody really knows exactly what those reasons are, and how each criteria or immigration scheme is weighed against the other. The three couples mentioned earlier received no explanation after their initial PR rejections.  Clearly, more can be done. The rest of this piece will examine some areas around immigration in which Singapore can afford to be more transparent, as well as the challenges that come with this.    The Ambiguity of Singapore’s Immigration System

When we look abroad, countries like Australia, New Zealand and Canada have adopted points-based immigration systems with a more transparent rubric on how points are awarded.  This gives both citizens and prospective immigrants a clearer idea of which criteria carry more weight in the application process. Countries like Canada have also incorporated labour market testing processes, so that the onus is on the employer to prove that the requisite skills cannot be found in the domestic labour market.  None of these immigration systems are perfect, but they do contain elements of checks and balances, transparency, and a more consultative approach to public policy.   By contrast, the evaluation criteria underlying Singapore’s immigration system is more ambiguous.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the preferred path to PR is through the Professional, Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers (PTS) Scheme, where immigrants arrive into Singapore on a Work Pass first, before being eventually approved for Permanent Residency.  The current PTS scheme, however, seems to give undue preference to short-term factors like current salary, type of work pass, and the standing of their current employer, which may not necessarily align with the long-term needs of Singapore’s economy. While basing immigration decisions on economic growth and productivity is sound in theory, it assumes that the labour market is efficient and that the HR recruitment process is devoid of any bias. It also fails to consider the externalities such policies create, like rising land, housing and real estate prices disproportionately hurting the poor and middle-class among the resident population. All of this is further complicated by the CMIO Model in Singapore. While many suspect that race is an important criteria in the immigrant approval process, no one really knows how it is being applied in practice, and to what extent an applicant’s racial category might supersede all other considerations.  In the absence of greater transparency, accusations of an unlevel playing field—or even systemic bias—will persist. This is deeply counterproductive, and only serves to erode the trust Singaporeans have in their institutions.   Are Singaporeans Ready for Transparent Government? However, when it comes to greater transparency on immigration, I’m more sympathetic to the Government’s position than most. For most government bureaucracies, transparency can often be a lose-lose proposition. To acknowledge, in the general sense, that a system can be improved is one thing, but to unilaterally reveal to the voting public concrete examples of your own incompetence is basically political suicide.  And yet, inefficiencies and mistakes are features in all organisations.  Perhaps this is why most governments with any political capital at risk would infinitely prefer closed-door reviews over public consultations. Because to ‘check oneself’ publicly, would be to confirm the worst suspicions of your political opponents, while reaping none of the benefits of open disclosure.  In the last decade, you can argue that the government has made attempts at some transparency when it comes immigration—only for it to backfire on them spectacularly.  Take the controversial Population White Paper (PWP) published in January 2013, which outlined the Government’s plan to address Singapore’s declining birth rate by planning for a population “in a range between 6.5 and 6.9 million by 2030”.  Immediately, the PWP was met with swift anger from Singaporeans, sparking a rare mass rally of over 4,000 protesters at Hong Lim Park. It became such a defining issue in the months leading up to GE2015 that PM Lee Hsien-Loong had to walk back the projection.  Reading the PWP today, the tone adopted by the Government was actually quite balanced; it recognized the need to address the reality of an aging population and skills shortage in the labour force, while acknowledging the growing discontent among the Singaporean core.  But the public outcry against the PWP may have taught the Government all the wrong lessons.    So What’s the Solution? And yet, the decision between top-down paternalism and a more decentralised approach to governance doesn’t have to be binary. It can come from a gradual process of opening up.  It may not even be necessary to abandon the current immigration model altogether. Instead, modest adjustments can be made:  First, start with the low-hanging fruit. Most Singaporeans would probably support expediting the PR process for foreign spouses of Singaporean citizens. If Singapore wants to address its low TFR, removing this bureaucratic hurdle should be a no-brainer.   Beyond this, a working paper published in 2018 by the Cato Institute offered the following recommendations:  1. Increase worker portability: allow Work Pass holders to change jobs without impacting their immigration status. By empowering workers, this will create better working conditions for everyone and a more efficient labour market. Local employers will have less incentive to exploit or under-pay foreigners (relative to hiring locals). 2. Encourage upward visa mobility: instead of constantly importing new foreign workers to address short-term needs, provide the foreigners who are already here with a more viable path to stay — conditional upon education, skills and other requirements.  3. Allow all Work Pass holders the option of becoming entrepreneurs: currently, the Government has a separate immigration scheme for entrepreneurs. But given that it’s notoriously difficult to pick winners in advance, why not let everyone in Singapore have an equal shot at job creation?  Now you might disagree with the above proposals, but at least now we’re having an argument based on policy rather than conjecture or emotion.  In order for this to happen, all politicians need to ground their discussion based on facts, data and a rigorous study of existing immigration schemes. For the Government’s part, it must recognise the vital role it can play in facilitating such debates, by offering equal access to information to all parties that want to contribute to the discussion.   Likewise, it is the responsibility of elected Opposition MPs to frame the immigration issue in a constructive manner, without stoking populist or xenophobic sentiments. Whether this will happen in the upcoming CECA debate remains to be seen. But the sense I get from Singaporeans is that they are tired of the political rhetoric and jargon from their MPs and leaders.  Both sides have a part to play in building a political culture where it’s possible to have open, fact-based debates on sensitive issues, so that the level of discourse on immigration and employment can finally rise above mere speculation and rumours.

5,She Faced The Threat Of Deportation. Her Crime? Being Pregnant,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-pregnant-crime-deportation/,"Current Affairs, Features","All images are RICE file photos.  In the cramped bathroom of a condominium apartment in Singapore, Annisa stared at the pregnancy test she had purchased from the Guardian pharmacy. She had suspected she might be pregnant, having missed her period by a week, then two. Now, the double pink lines were incontrovertible evidence. She felt no joy, only terror. She was alone—her brothers and sisters were a thousand miles away in her home country of Indonesia and her mother had been dead for eighteen years. The embryo in her womb was proof she had committed an offence that, if discovered, could lead to her losing her work permit, her job, and her future prospects of working in Singapore.  It was November 2014. In January, she would have to go to a neighbourhood clinic for her regular medical examination, mandated by the Singaporean government for all foreign domestic workers. There, the government would find out she was pregnant and deport her.  Under the conditions of the work permit issued to Annisa and the 261,800 other live-in domestic helpers like her in Singapore, Annisa could not marry a Singaporean citizen or permanent resident without government approval. Employment regulations further state that “If the foreign employee is a female foreign employee, the foreign employee shall not become pregnant or deliver any child in Singapore during and after the validity period of her work permit,” unless she is already in a government-approved marriage to a Singapore citizen or permanent resident. The pregnancy restrictions were implemented in 1986, two years after the government pushed out the now-defunct “Graduate Mothers’ Scheme.” The controversial policy was designed to boost Singapore’s talent pool by promising graduate mothers with at least three children top priority in the stressful primary school registration process. Meanwhile, the government offered ten-thousand-dollar deposits into the Central Provident Fund mandatory savings accounts of couples under 30 who both did not have any Ordinary Level (a national examination administered at the end of secondary school) passes, had two or fewer children, and agreed to be sterilized. Fresh off public allegations of eugenics, the ruling People’s Action Party government enacted a pregnancy ban on low-wage foreign workers that would apply even after they cancelled their work permits. Over three months in late 2020, I spoke to five migrant social workers and fifteen foreign domestic workers, twelve of whom were in romantic relationships of more than a year, about the challenges of dating, marriage and pregnancy in Singapore. From the Singapore to Dubai, Hong Kong to Malaysia, female migrant domestic workers are relegated to the position of second-class household servants and barred by reproductive restrictions, lack of maternity protections, or social stigmas from enjoying the fundamental human rights of childbearing and of love. From her bathroom window, Annisa (whose name has been changed to protect her from legal repercussions) had a view of Bukit Batok, the Singapore neighbourhood where she had worked since arriving four years prior. Here, unlike in her hometown of Semarang, native rainforest trees like angsana and mahoganies did not grow unruly and wild but were planted along well-paved roads and in housing estates. The condominium she lived in was easily taller than the tallest building in her birthplace, which was a four-star hotel. A small-boned Javanese woman with glossy waist-length hair, pecan-coloured skin and a thick Indonesian accent that made her self-conscious, Annisa had come to Singapore to work hard, pay off the bank loans she’d taken to support her husband and two sons, and keep her head down. Pregnancy was not part of the plan.  The Ministry of Manpower requires all domestic workers to undergo medical examinations twice a year, to be conducted by any Singapore-registered doctor. The women would be tested for pregnancy and syphilis twice a year and HIV and tuberculosis every two years. At a clinic, Annisa would be required to sign away her medical privacy rights, pee on a stick and have blood drawn. If any results were positive, the doctor would be obliged to report them to the Ministry of Manpower. The state enforces the policy with an iron-fist: two doctors faced disciplinary inquiries from the Singapore Medical Council in 2000 for failing to report pregnant domestic workers they treated during the Ministry-required check-up. Annisa needed to be sure she really was pregnant, so she did something her friends called “stupid.” She went to a doctor. While doctor-patient confidentiality should ensure that Annisa’s doctor was not required to report her, since the visit was not one of the government-mandated medical examinations, domestic workers often fear that they will be reported anyway. Annisa counted herself “lucky” that the doctor didn’t inform on her. She paid fifty dollars out-of-pocket for the doctor to confirm: she was expecting.  An abortion would cost 500 to 1000 dollars. Even if she chose to have one, she didn’t have the money for it. She earned about 600 Singapore dollars a month and sent most of it home to her two young sons in Central Java, Indonesia. Her insurance policy wouldn’t cover it either. The Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations require employers to purchase personal accident insurance for their domestic employees but stipulate it must not cover “any pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, abortion, sterilisation, menopause, or any complication arising from any of these conditions.” In the eyes of the law, pregnancy is a legally prohibited act that should be punished, not insured. Annisa remembered a classmate from the English language course she attended at a Queenstown neighbourhood mosque who got pregnant. Afraid of being sent home, the woman underwent an abortion at Lucky Plaza. Many domestic workers know that if you don’t have the money for an abortion, you can use a quick-and-dirty, clandestine solution: abortion pills. It is “a do-it-yourself method, which involves looking for somebody who would give you a tablet,” said long-time migrant worker activist John Gee. A Filipino domestic worker told me of a friend who “drank something just to get rid of the baby” and started bleeding uncontrollably from her vagina as a result. A case manager at a domestic workers’ non-profit recounted another case where a domestic worker was hospitalised for trying to use a metal tool to get rid of the foetus.  Annisa never contemplated such gruesome means of solving her problem. She knew her religion, Islam, forbade abortions. “God will punish me next time if I do this,” she thought. “Every day, I cry, cry, cry, especially at night,” she recalled. Sometimes she called her friend from English class who would cry with her. Did she want to go back home, leaving the country before her employer could find out and report her to the Ministry of Manpower, where she’d be blacklisted from returning to Singapore to work again? Did she want to have an abortion? She didn’t know. “If I want to go back to kampung,” —village—“I got no face,” she said. In the Javanese village where she grew up, her husband, who only messaged her when he needed money, lived with her two teenaged sons. Her reputation would have been stained if she returned with another man’s child. She had a friend from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, 15 years her senior who was like a mother to her. The friend urged her to make a decision and said, “If you want to do abortion, find abortion. If you don’t want to do, then quickly fly back, because no time already,” Annisa recalled. Weighing only 83 pounds, Annisa at two months pregnant had a stomach as flat as a canvas. But she knew the baby was not getting smaller. Every day she waited was one more day that she could be discovered and deported. She was not led to this situation by ignorance. Before arriving in Singapore four years prior, she had spent a month at a center in Jakarta undergoing training organised by her employment agency. There, maids learned English and received training in elderly care and infant care, laundry and ironing, cooking and cleaning. Staff drilled the newly-recruited domestic workers on the rules: “cannot get pregnant, cannot make relationship with Singaporean people. They call it “house break,” Annisa recounted. They were not to participate in “illegal, immoral or undesirable activities, including breaking up families in Singapore,” as the regulations put it. About one hundred of 200,000-odd domestic workers who work in Singapore are sent home each year for getting pregnant, according to the latest government-provided data from 2015, though the number could be much higher given unreported cases like Annisa’s. The Ministry of Manpower did not respond to my repeated requests for more up-to-date statistics or the policy’s rationale. The public is reminded of these women’s existences mostly through news fragments and provocative headlines. “Maid hides her stillborn baby in drawer,” read one newspaper article from 2015. When the foetus was found, the 33-year-old Indonesian maid was arrested for “concealment of birth by secret disposal of a dead body” and investigated by the police. Another pregnant domestic worker threatened her employer and her employer’s eight-year-old with a knife when she did not allow the worker to return home in May 2019. At six-months pregnant, she was sentenced to four months in prison. Self-induced abortions, knife threats, and concealment of stillborn babies are just some of the ways that these desperate women try to fix their desperate situations. Many, like Annisa, cannot afford to lose their jobs in Singapore. A domestic worker who gets pregnant risks being blacklisted by the Ministry of Manpower from ever returning to Singapore to work. Four of the fifteen domestic workers and three of the five non-profit workers I spoke to know about the “blacklist”, though no one knew how long the ban would last because the list is unofficial. When I asked for confirmation on the existence of the blacklist, a Ministry of Manpower spokesperson pointed me to the Ministry website, which states that domestic workers who break any of the work permit conditions “may not be able to enter or work in Singapore” in the future. “I think this law is really wrong,” said a former domestic worker who now works at Yayasan Dunia Viva Wanita, a shelter for stranded domestic workers in Batam. She added, “Being pregnant is not criminal, not like stealing.” 1. The Unpaid Debts Before she came to Singapore to work as hired help for a Singaporean family, Annisa worked in a canning factory five minutes from her home in Semarang, Indonesia, tinning mushrooms for an American food company. She had gotten married to her secondary school boyfriend at fifteen, after her conservative Muslim father told her to get married if she wanted to continue seeing him. The boy, three years older than her, made her feel protected in a way she hadn’t since her mother died of a heart attack when Annisa was thirteen. But the young couple’s married life began to crumble under financial strain, especially after Annisa gave birth to her second son. Every month, she would have to visit the bank to take out a loan. There was never enough money to pay rent, the water bill, her sons’ school expenses, and allowances to her mother- and father-in-law. “Lucky I never suicide, hang myself and die,” she told me. When her debt swelled to eight hundred dollars, “then become big problem.” she said. “Then all the family blame me. Then after that I want to run away.”  She decided to find work in neighbouring Singapore as a domestic maid to pay off the loans. She left her two sons with her mother-in-law, packed her bags and departed for the wealthy island city. Annisa found employment with a Singaporean-Chinese couple whose daughter, coincidentally, was adopted from Indonesia because the mother could not have children. Looking for an employer is like entering a lottery: Some bosses beat and verbally abuse domestic workers, withhold their wages, or confiscate their phones. Yet other employers treat the hired help as part of the family, bringing them on vacations and instructing the children to call them “auntie,” a nod to their roles as second mothers. Annisa got lucky. During Hari Raya, the Muslim celebration commemorating the end of the festival of Eid, her boss gave her fifty dollars in a traditional red envelope, called a “hong bao” in Mandarin. She fondly remembers giving massages to her Ma’am, the lady boss, who had pancreatic cancer, and feeding the family’s small dog, who she treated “like my child,” she said. At the end of the two-year contract, she managed to pay off the eight-hundred-dollar loan. Around that time, she met the man who would change her life in the best and worst ways.  
Singapore’s Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations state that a work permit holder “shall not go through any form of marriage or apply to marry under any law, religion, custom or usage with a Singapore citizen or permanent resident in or outside Singapore, without the prior approval of the Controller” of Immigration. These rules apply even after the work permit is cancelled, unless the worker acquires a S-Pass or Employment Pass, which are work visas for more highly skilled and highly paid foreign workers.
 The day before she graduated from her mosque class, Annisa decided to visit the neighbourhood market to buy a new watch; she hoped to look nice for the graduation photographs. She weaved between the throngs of Saturday shoppers, racks of clothing, mounds of garlic and ginger, and frozen heaps of fresh fish, to a small watch shop. She picked out a cheap one, which at just six dollars was within her modest budget. Then she noticed a tall Chinese man with thick forearms, a crown of silver hair, and the sun-kissed skin of a day labourer staring at her.  He said he wanted to buy the watch for her. He asked, “How much is this one?”, she recalled. “Six dollars?” he said, apparently incredulous. He bought it for her, but not before slipping his number into her Nokia cellphone. She never got his name and so saved his number as “Bapaku,” meaning “my father” in Indonesian, so that when he called, her friends wouldn’t ask questions. The nickname felt appropriate and made her laugh. After all, he was in his mid-fifties, around her father’s age, and made her feel cared for in a way she hadn’t since her father remarried. She also would get “malu” around him—slang for ‘embarrassed’— “like he was my own father,” she said.   Eight years later, Annisa would speculate that he wanted her because “he think I small small girl, haven’t married.” With a petite 4-foot-9 frame and big, doll-like eyes, Annisa had a ferocious energy and cackling laugh. She started calling him “darling” and he reciprocated with “sayang,” a Malay term of endearment. His English was poor and so was hers—sometimes she would not understand his text messages. But they still wished each other good morning and sent kissy face emojis. After a year of Annisa talking to him almost every day, her friends asked her why she didn’t save her “darling’s” name in her phone. Annisa said she didn’t know it. “I think it’s not important. He call me ‘sayang’ and don’t know my name,” she recalled years later, laughing.  One Sunday two years after they first met, he pulled up outside her condominium in his Hyundai—a car he bought on his crane operator’s salary, which Annisa said made him seem “like he’s rich people.” He had taken to ferrying Annisa to her weekly English classes at a mosque in Queenstown. She slid into the passenger seat, and he pulled out two crisp Singapore fifty dollars bills, slipping it toward her bag. “I give you,” he said. Annisa asked him, “You give me this for what?”  “Ya. Never mind, not a problem. To buy things with,” he said, she remembers.  After class that day, she went to Clementi, a residential and shopping neighbourhood with two of her friends and spent all the money on food, a new T-shirt, and a pre-paid StarHub card to send 20 dollars of text messages. She lent fifty dollars to a cash-strapped friend. That night, she could not sleep, the thought of the unpaid debt growing weightier in her mind. As a Muslim, she believed that “I cannot take the money free,” she said. But she also could not afford to return it. She even contemplated asking her boss for a loan. After several sleepless nights pondering this question, she decided to become his girlfriend. The debt had to be repaid somehow. It was only right.  Later, when they had been together for six years, she would stress that she did not just love him for his money. “I became very in love with him, love like ‘black magic’,” she said. “I don’t go to other boys.” Annisa would occasionally wonder about the deeper psychological reasons she had for loving him. One of her speculations: “I had no love from my father and mother, so maybe I want love like this.” They started having sex, meeting on Sunday afternoons at Hotel 81, a budget hotel chain best known for being the location of choice for paid sexual rendezvouses in Singapore’s red-light district. For 30 dollars, they would get two hours uninterrupted in a soft bed—a rare chance at privacy. Being intimate in her employer’s home was unthinkable and showing affection in public even more so. Sex with her husband had been very different, she said. “He is Muslim, when make love is simple one.” But with this much-older Singaporean-Chinese man, she experienced for the first time intimacy with someone that “wants to make me happy,” she recalled. It was during these afternoons, sealed off from the rest of the world, that Annisa fell in love. When he fell asleep, she would study his bare feet. They were extremely small in contrast to his tall Herculean build. “I see the feet, then I like, very pity him,” she recalled years later, laughing. “Maybe I like him because he sayang like that. I fall in love with him because he is good.” Whenever Annisa had sex with her boyfriend, he would give her a pink-and-white blister packet of two round pills, reassure her that it wasn’t poison, and tell her to take one before and one after sex. She complied. It was Postinor-2, also known as the “morning-after-pill,” which prevents pregnancy with minimal side effects. The problem? Both pills are meant to be taken after sex; one within 72 hours and the other less than twelve after the first.  Less than two months after they started having sex, Annisa learned she was pregnant. She consulted her auntie, her mother’s youngest sister, about what she should do.  Her auntie told her over the phone, “Then you have the kid. I look after for you, then next time you can come back to Singapore to work,” Annisa recalled. Her friends from the English courses at the mosque encouraged her to keep the baby. “The Chinese baby will grow up beautiful,” they said. Annisa concurred: she envied fair skin.  She decided she would return home to give birth. To protect her ability to return to Singapore to work, she lied to her employer and told him that her mother died and that she needed to return home (the same mother who had died almost two decades earlier).  “He was sad because his wife died, and I looked after her and his mother. So he believe me,” Annisa recalled. “He said, ‘You good to my family, I also want to return you back.’” Annisa asked him for a loan of a thousand dollars. She needed the money to pay for prenatal care and the birth. He gave it to her, just as he had given her a red packet four years prior. The debts owed were an unspoken promise between them that she would return again to work for him. She left Singapore on a plane to Jakarta with a secret growing inside her. Women who are less fortunate than her, with less sympathetic or gullible employers, get sent by ferry to the nearest Indonesian island of Batam because it is the cheapest way to repatriate someone. Like Annisa, they are often alone and ashamed to return home. A staff member at Yayasan Dunia Viva Wanita, the Batam shelter for domestic workers, said they would house about ten pregnant women each year, feeding them, bringing them for medical appointments and when the time came, driving them to the hospital to give birth. The last Annisa had spoken to her boyfriend, the muscular man with the small feet, he had said he didn’t believe her, that the morning-after pill should have worked, that the baby must be from infidelity. Enraged and indignant, she told him, “You don’t believe me? I’ll go back, give birth, and be healthy. Never mind you never take responsibility for me, never mind, as long as God give me long life and health, then I can go back to kampung and give birth.”  2. A Strain On the System Even if Annisa wanted to marry her boyfriend and even if he could divorce his wife, the couple would face immense legal challenges. The reason dates back to 1973. Singapore, then an eight-year-old, newly independent country, was facing “a big shortage of servants,” according to a newspaper report in the nation’s second-largest English paper. Amidst rapid post-independence economic development, locals aspiring to the middle-class did not want to work as low-paid domestic help. Singaporean women torn between the competing demands of being mothers and being productive workers were increasingly hiring foreign maids as a solution to their childcare needs. They were aided by the 1978 Foreign Maid Scheme, which allowed locals to import foreign maids on special visas, subject to less stringent work regulations. Within ten years from 1978 to 1988, the number of foreign domestic workers would grow from almost zero to 40,000 and with it, so did the number of romantic relationships between Singaporeans and foreign workers.  To control legal immigration into the country—a nation the size of New York City— the government decided to restrict the ability of low-wage migrant workers to marry into Singapore’s resident population. Thus, the government unveiled the Marriage Restriction Policy of 1973. The law is enshrined within Singapore’s Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations, which state that a work permit holder “shall not go through any form of marriage or apply to marry under any law, religion, custom or usage with a Singapore citizen or permanent resident in or outside Singapore, without the prior approval of the Controller” of Immigration. These rules apply even after the work permit is cancelled, unless the worker acquires a S-Pass or Employment Pass, which are work visas for more highly skilled and highly paid foreign workers. In effect, work permit holders face a virtual lifetime restriction on marriage to locals.  On 28 March 1985, then-Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law Shunmugam Jayakumar delivered a speech in parliament justifying the marriage restriction policy. It was the second of many parliamentary addresses made by ruling party politicians over the years that would appeal to pragmatic, Singaporeans-first justifications for excluding low-wage, low-income foreign workers from the right to marry Singaporeans. “Is our policy strict? It is strict.” said Jayakumar. “But for whom is a strict immigration policy designed? Is it designed for me? No. Is it designed for the Cabinet Ministers? No. It is designed to promote the well-being of Singapore citizens.”  The island-state had to avoid being “swamped with hundreds of thousands of people who want to come to Singapore,” who would “put a strain” on the country’s resources, minister Jayakumar said. Yet, the country seemed to have ample space when it came to marriage for the rich—the criteria for immigration was one’s potential to contribute to Singapore’s “economic advancement,” Jayakumar said. Today, more highly paid foreigners seeking to marry Singaporeans need only find a fiancé, file a notice with the Registry of Marriage, and hold a solemnisation ceremony.  In contrast, the application for work permit holders to marry more closely resembles a welfare application than one for wedlock: the couple have to submit pay slips and education qualifications. The local fiancé has to hand in their income tax bills and statements of Central Provident Fund contributions, which are government-mandated savings for working Singaporeans and residents. A ten-minute-long online application form and four-week wait later, the couple will receive an email informing them of the outcome. Although not explicitly stated in the government regulations, the factor that determines whether couples can marry is not strength of love or length of relationship but the income level of the Singaporean or permanent resident spouse. One Singaporean man who applied to marry his Filipino domestic worker girlfriend was rejected 20 times over four years by the Ministry of Manpower. He was told that “his monthly $1,700 income was deemed too low to support a family,” according to a 2008 article published in the Singaporean newspaper The New Paper. Despite the government’s attitude that long-term romantic relationships were a privilege, not a right, for women like Annisa, she found love anyway. But she knew her relationship would invite judgement and even condemnation. Once, a neighbour spotted her having dinner with her boyfriend at the nearby food court and informed her employer. Annisa defended herself, said that the man was a stranger and “not the meaning that I makan,”—eat— “with some man is my boyfriend.” Her employer believed her and said that as long as she only makan with a man, they would have no problems. “Inside you can feel romantic. Outside is never hold hand, never anything,” she recalled. “He has family, wife and scared. I have employer, and he scared my employer will see me got problem.” 3. The Marriage Chore Legal barriers aside, Annisa saw marriage as more trouble than it was worth. Even if she were free to marry without government interference, she is not sure she would have wanted to marry her tall boyfriend with the small feet. “Next time husband not good, I also suffer,” she said. Her estranged first husband had taken a second wife and used to regularly ask her for money—Annisa had paid for his motorbike in monthly instalments. “That’s why I single. Better independent. Independent, happy, good working, nobody control.” Six of the twelve domestic workers in relationships who I interviewed wanted to be married to their long-term Singaporean partners; one already was. But only three had gained government approval to do so. One who didn’t was Dian, a 36-year-old Indonesian domestic worker with a Skrillex haircut, who did not want her real name published. She realised that to marry her boyfriend, she would face a troublesome array of obstacles, which caused her to give up her dreams of a Singapore wedding. In 2017, a year after Dian met her Singaporean partner, a 56–year-old university social studies professor, the couple decided to get married. She loved how he would deliver kueh—Malay cakes—to her ahmah, the elderly woman she worked for, to win her over. He gave her old Indonesian novels which she would carefully store in her suitcase, wrapped in plastic, to add to her treasured book collection back home in the rural province of Lampung, Indonesia. But she heard from friends who were married to Singaporeans that the process would involve being unable to work for at least six months, during which she would not be able to support her two sons from a previous marriage. (She would have to cancel her work permit, apply for a long-term visit pass, wait up to six months for it to be approved, then wait another three months before being eligible for legal permission to work.) “I don’t want to make my boyfriend support my sons, because this is not his sons. This is my sons.” Dian said. For now, Dian and her partner have their hearts set on a new dream: getting married in Indonesia and settling down in her hometown after he retires. He had fallen in love with the laid-back “kampung” lifestyle, Dian said, and liked hiking the padi fields and mountains surrounding her village when he visited. In preparation, she is teaching him the local dialect, Javanese, so that he can speak to the neighbours. Dian will be taking a risk by getting married without the Singapore government’s permission, which is required even if she gets married overseas. If found out, her privilege to work in Singapore could be withdrawn and she may be prevented from entering Singapore for a period of time. “Every human should have that kind of right to have relationship with anyone,” Dian said. “The law should not be driven by MOM,”—the Ministry of Manpower— “or the status of you working as domestic worker. I feel very sad about that. I feel so dispirited. Because I’m a domestic helper, it’s very difficult for me to get married to people who we love to.” What might have happened to Annisa had she been married to her boyfriend when she got pregnant with his baby? A foreign woman who marries a local gives her future children the full privileges enjoyed by citizens as they will be Singaporeans by blood. But Singapore, unlike the U.S, does not guarantee foreign spouses of citizens the right to permanent residency or even to remain in the country. If the foreign wife makes a mistake, the promise of protection can evaporate in an instant. That is what happened to Anna and Derek Ong. Anna, a slim Javanese woman from Sumatra, Indonesia, with sparkling eyes and an infectious laugh, arrived in Singapore as a domestic worker in 2011 before getting married to her Singaporean boyfriend, Derek, in 2016, after a half-year-long process of applying for and gaining government approval. The Controller of Immigration must have decided that Derek’s salary of $2100 at an IT services company was sufficient to support Anna. In a newly built three-room public housing flat in Tampines, a large residential estate in Singapore, the married couple now raise five cats, dozens of plants, and their three-year-old daughter. On the wall, colourful craft paper hearts encircle a photograph of their daughter receiving her crimson-coloured Singapore passport. Born premature at 26 weeks old, she was immediately admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Singapore’s oldest, largest and best hospital, Singapore General Hospital. Within 99 days, she was released, healthy.  “Luckily my baby is Singaporean, so the government helped,” Anna said, her voice grim. “That’s why I owe a life to Singapore. Because the child who died was in my country. That one I can’t forget.” Her first son, who was born premature in Indonesia four years prior, did not survive past his first day.  When they first got married, Anna, bored and stuck in Derek’s parents’ Singapore home on a tourist visa, decided to work two cleaning jobs to supplement the couple’s income. Unbeknownst to her, she was not authorised to work. In September, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority found out she had been working illegally and told her could not return to Singapore for two years, she recounts. And so, three-months pregnant with Derek and her first child, Anna retreated to Batam, Indonesia. Anna gave birth to her first son on Christmas day 2016 in Batam at a small, three-storey hospital. Born after 27 weeks and desperately premature, he needed to be put in an incubator. But Anna had no Indonesian insurance, her and her husband’s wallets were empty as they had maxed out the daily ATM transaction limit paying for the delivery room, and because it was Christmas, no bank was open. The hospital refused to move their son until they paid up. “Because of the stupid money, I tell you everything is money,” said Anna. “When this stupid money doesn’t come out of the deposit for the baby room, they don’t put in incubator immediately.” For hours, her son went without an incubator. He died that evening. “That day, 25 December, made me realise I don’t want to stay in Indonesia anymore,” she said. “You got money, you can live. All my life…I’ll pay for it in my heart.” Anna witnessed first-hand how money and citizenship wielded power, but Annisa would never get th",FALSE
6,Here’s Why Pregnant Singaporeans Are Hesitant About The MRNA Vaccine,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-pregnant-women-vaccine-singapore/,"Commentary, Current Affairs","As the restrictions have eased and a road-map to post-pandemic life is drawn, a sense of optimism has taken hold. The MRNA concoction is like ambrosia—a tincture which promises strength and longevity, or at least a ticket out of this ongoing instability. But for some, the vaccine is a threat and not a solution.  “There seems to be an active campaign to spread misinformation about the MRNA vaccine,” said Professor Hsu Li Yang, the Vice Dean of Global Health at NUS, in conversation with RICE. “Prior to this pandemic, I don’t believe that we had much systemic disinformation. What’s happening now is quite astonishing.”  Misinformation spreads like wildfire on social media. This is partly due to the quicksilver nature of the pandemic. Even credible sources like the WHO have amended prior guidance in accordance with new scientific evidence, which has led to confusion about which sources are trustworthy. Though vaccine misinformation is actively combatted by social media platforms, there are places that content moderation can’t touch—prominently, private Facebook groups and WhatsApp chats. It can’t rewrite history either, which is where a lot of the modern anti-vaxx rhetoric comes from.  It’s easy to write off misinformation campaigns as the incoherent ramblings of inherently suspicious anti-vaxxers. But it’s not just the anti-vaxxers who have reservations about the MRNA technology: pregnant women in Singapore are nervous about getting jabbed too. We spoke with two prospective mothers to hear out their concerns, and while the particulars of their stories varied, there was a common thread: they’re unsure of which opinion to trust.  Why Are Pregnant Women Hesitant About Getting The Vaccine?  In general, vaccine reluctance is tricky to analyse because there isn’t a universal catalyst. However, for parents, there is the anguish of deciding on the behalf of a child. Parenthood is a high-wire act of risk negotiation. Do I let my kid get chickenpox now so it isn’t lethal in the future? And so on. This parental anxiety (which is thought to be evolutionary) can push the brain into a state of hypervigilance. When misinformation greets the anxious parent, logic takes a backseat to emotion.  For example, in 1998 a prominent medical researcher published a paper which suggested that the MMR vaccine increased incidents of autism in children. His findings made headlines around the world. Parents were terrified and subsequently in the United Kingdom, immunization rates dropped by up to 50%. In 2004, several independent literature reviews concluded that there was no causal link between the MMR vaccine and incidents of autism, and the researcher was forced to retract his work. Despite the retraction, the damage of this researcher’s fear mongering has continued. In 2008, (for the first time in 14 years) measles was declared endemic in England and Wales. It’s clear from this debacle that misinformation has tangible negative outcomes on public health. Is Vaccine Hesitancy A Problem in Singapore?  Before the pandemic, not so much. “Like any other country, we have our share of pro vaccine advocates and outright refusers. Even as we’re seeing more anti-vaxxers now, the proportion of refusers is smaller and less organised than other countries in Europe or in the United States,” Professor Hsu noted. In Singapore, childhood vaccines have reached 90% coverage due to a high level of trust in government health projects. However, it’s become harder to encourage adults to get vaccinated. “Before COVID, we hadn’t campaigned very hard for adult vaccinations.”  Iffy, the first expectant mother we spoke with, cites this novel attempt to vaccinate adults en masse as a contributing factor to her vaccine jitters. Before her pregnancy, Iffy took the flu jabs and received all of the mandatory childhood immunizations. But pregnancy has made her cautious. “There’s no urgency for pregnant women to get vaccinated. Other groups are strongly encouraged to get jabbed: the elderly, students, and people with underlying conditions. Who is specifically targeting us?”  At 5 months pregnant, a perceived lack of clarity on the safety of the MRNA vaccine in pregnancy, combined with this non-urgency, further complicates her decision. “We have no local studies. Relying on overseas data, though I know it’s sound, makes me feel less confident. I trust our local research efforts much more. I’ve also heard one or two incidents of pregnancies being lost as a result of the vaccine.”   We were unable to verify that any pregnant women have miscarried because of the vaccine in Singapore. With that aside, we relayed Iffy’s other concern to Professor Hsu. “It’s true that there are no clinical trials in pregnant women. In any medical trial, they are last on the list, because the stakes are very high. But we’re receiving more data as the vaccines are used on pregnant women in the United States and Israel, which shows that the vaccine is safe, and there are no effects like teratogenicity, where the baby is malformed or stillborn.” But still, he understood Iffy’s hesitancy. “The data is coming out slowly, and Singapore has targets who are at higher risk.”  Mixed Signals Despite her misgivings, Iffy is open to receiving the vaccine before delivery. Ultimately, she’s going to make a decision based on the expertise of her gynaecologist. Another expectant mother, S, who is currently in her first trimester—is not open to persuasion. Before her pregnancy, she had pre-registered for the vaccine. “After trying to conceive for almost three years, I finally got pregnant. Now, my priorities are different. I think there isn’t enough evidence and research done on a larger sample of pregnant women, which is why I daren’t take the risk of getting vaccinated now. Nothing will sway my mind.”  Though Iffy and S have different outlooks, both mentioned that they felt the public health messaging on the safety of MRNA vaccines for pregnant women was vague.  For S, her personal experience with health providers differed from the official guidance. “MOH says that the vaccine is totally safe, but then tells pregnant women to consult their doctors. While I was undergoing IUI treatments, my doctor told me not to get vaccinated. Many of my friends have been told by their doctors not to get vaccinated as well. Others have said it’s okay only after the first trimester.”  Professor Hsu agreed that the messaging can be more clear—“In Singapore, we have wanted to be safe. Our messaging relies on data. It takes time to collect data, and the results vary.” This process of waiting and  analysing before reacting informed Singapore’s approach to vaccine outreach. “I think what the government agencies tried to do was to wait for more data to come out from the countries that were vaccinating faster. That can be counterproductive, because the data and guidelines are volatile. Thus, the guidance changes over time.”  As the guidelines shift, the consensus among practitioners has become unwieldy. “The practitioner has their own opinion, right? It’s not an overall consensus. There are personalities and beliefs involved. In Singapore, there are even some medical groups which are campaigning against the MRNA vaccines and pushing Sinovac instead.”  Where Do We Go From Here?  Vaccine efforts succeed when citizens trust that the government is taking appropriate measures to ensure their safety. While battling misinformation campaigns, gaining trust can be difficult, and consistent guidance is of the utmost importance. “The government agencies and the ministry have to take a consistent position, and relay that position clearly to health practitioners.”  Updating health practitioners with pertinent information on a regular basis, is key for pregnant women who are nervous about the vaccine. “OBGYN doctors are important. They meet regularly with their patients, and are viewed as highly trusted medical professionals. It’s imperative that they are able to give their patients updated information on the safety of vaccines, and can speak to them about which type of vaccine will suit them best.”  How are your loved ones feeling about getting jabbed?

7,Seeing the Face of God in a Seed: How Devotees Connect With God in Hinduism,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-how-devotees-connect-with-god-in-hinduism/,"Culture, People","All images by Zachary Tang unless otherwise stated. This article on Hindu religious artefacts is part of a series that explores the history and use of religious artefacts across different religions in Singapore. “When we perform a puja, it’s a means for man to connect to God via prayer,” S. Ravenderan, (also known as Ravi) former Vice-President of the Hindu Centre, tells me. “But the steps for performing a puja are the same you take when you are welcoming a friend to your house. So worshipping God is akin to seeing God as a dear friend whom we are inviting to our house.” It is apt for Ravi to begin our conversation with an account of inviting friends over, for I am currently at the Hindu Centre—a handsome shophouse located near Farrer Park MRT station—at his invitation. My purpose here today, like my prior trips to Central Sikh Temple, Gaden Shartse Dro-Phen Ling, and Thong Teck Sian Tong Lian Sin Sia, is to find out more about the use and history of religious amulets, so as to chart a fuller understanding of how Singaporeans practise their religion in their everyday life. Ravi brings up the puja—a worship ritual performed by Hindus to offer devotional homage and prayer to one or more deities, to host and honour a guest, or to spiritually celebrate an event—to explain why some Hindus adorn themselves with religious items even though it is not compulsory in Hinduism. The rest of this story is told from Ravi’s perspective. Japa Mala (Chanting Beads) “Japa” means repetitive chanting; “mala” means garland. Basically, “japa mala” is just “chanting beads”, akin to the meditation beads in Buddhism. People sometimes wear the japa mala around the neck. During a puja, they take it out to assist in their meditation, after which they wear it again. So the purpose of the beads is practical: it provides a convenient aid for you to keep track of your chanting. Sometimes the japa malas are given to them by a guru, who would have sanctified it in a puja. Who are gurus? In Hindu tradition, gurus are guides, experts, and masters. As the definition suggests, there are different types of gurus. Some are teaching gurus who devote their life to spreading knowledge to people. Others are spiritual gurus. They embark on a life of penance and become spiritually evolved. A popular type of japa mala is the rudraksha, a type of japa mala that is made from the seed of the rudraksha tree found at the foothills of the Himalayas. ‘Rudra’ is one of Lord Shiva’s Vedic names and ‘akṣha’ means teardrops. Thus defined, the name literally means ‘Lord Rudra’s (Shiva’s) teardrops’. Typically, there are 108 beads in a japa mala. Why 108? Did you notice that if you add up the digits in 108, it gives you 9? Essentially, multiples of 9 always add up to 9. That number is very significant in Hinduism. No matter how you multiply the number 9, it continues to retain its original character. Nine is the substratum. This mirrors how, in spite of the large amount of creation and destruction you see taking place all around, there’s a permanent entity whose existence transcends time. That is always there in the past, present, and future. And that entity is what we call God. Navaratna (Precious Gems) To understand the history and use of the navaratna, which means “9 gems”, we have to go back to the Vedas. What are the Vedas? They are a body of literature that form the basis of sacred Hindu scriptures. As they were composed approximately three to four millennia ago, later readers started having difficulty understanding the Vedas. To help them interpret the Vedas, Hindus of that time developed supporting texts known as the Vedanga. One discipline of the Vedanga, known as Jyotisha, focused on astronomy. It instructed devotees when an auspicious time for a ritual is, based on the movement of astronomical bodies. It started with astronomy, but the Jyotisha led to astrology. People began using the position of planets and stars to read the course of someone’s life. This is what the astrologer is doing when he is reading your horoscope. It can also be retrospective too. Sometimes the astrologer will tell you, “Oh, you had a bad time from this period to this period.” This is how we authenticate if the astrologer is good or pulling a fast one on you! When someone is going through a bad time, it means that the positions of the 9 planets (grahas) of Hindu astrology—which are different from those in Western astrology—are unfavourable to them because of their karma in a past or present life. In Hindu tradition, it is believed that the colour of the gem and the vibration of the gem, arising from the nature of the gem, can affect the human body. Thus, an astrologer will instruct someone who is suffering from a bad time to wear the navaratna, which can be in the form of a ring inlaid with 9 gems representing the 9 planets, to ward off the negativity. Kaapu (Ritual Protection Thread)  “Kaapu” is a Tamil word that means “bangle”. But it also means “protection”. You know how you see Indian ladies wearing bangles? The kaapu is just like that.
The kaapu is tied on the wrists of devotees by these spiritual gurus: traditionally the right wrist for males, and left for females. Sometimes, temple priests tie kaapu on devotees too. But it’s not as common in Singapore because being a priest is a profession and his primary job is one of handling the religious services in the temple as he has certain skillsets for that. I see the kaapu more frequently in the temples in Malaysia and India. You keep it on all the time. Because it’s for protection, you are not supposed to take it off, even when showering or sleeping. But if it drops off—which does happen after wearing the kaapu for a long period of time—you just get a new one. It’s not a big deal. [laughter] Bhasma ­­(Sacred ash) Many Hindus apply ash on their forehead after participating in pujas, whether at home or in temples. Devotees who want a sense of security may carry ash from an elaborate puja or a sacred place, like a holy temple in India, around in their wallet — or they may give it to people who need blessings. For example, if you visit someone sickly in the hospital, you can pray for them and give them the ash to protect them from further ill-health. Most of the ash is prepared in India. It’s basically cow dung, burnt with herbs, wood, ghee, and honey. Cows are herbivores, so their dung is relatively clean. Anyway, since it’s all burnt, the bacteria are killed. It’s just ash. The ash production is purely commercial. It is imported to Singapore by the metric tonne. You can buy a packet of it at Serangoon Road for about $3. Only during a puja is the ash sanctified. What does the ash symbolise? Hindus cremate. So the ash signifies that our body is going to turn to ash. It is a constant reminder of the impermanence of life and thus the permanence of God. These are some religious items that Hindus carry with them. But in Hinduism, there’s no hard and fast rule about adorning yourself with religious items. It depends on your habits, lifestyle, and beliefs. I don’t carry anything with me because I perform pujas regularly. However, I make my children wear amulets like the kaapu. These items are helpful in offering protection, but at the end of the day, they cannot replace the pujas we perform, which are the means through which we connect with God.

8,"Before NTU, There Was Nantah. Have We Forgotten How Students Struggled To Save It From Demise?",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-culture-people-before-ntu-nantah-forgotten-students-struggled-save-from-demise/,"Current Affairs, Features","Top image: NanyangDaxue.Sg (Facebook) My Chinese teacher once warned me not to equate Nanyang Technological University with Nantah. Making that connection would anger many from the Chinese community who lived through the 1960s and 1970s, he said.  But aren’t both the same? Whenever I read the Chinese newspapers, headlines often abbreviate NTU as Nantah.  Apparently not.  After some digging, I discovered that although NTU celebrates its 30th anniversary today, its origins started way before that with Nanyang University, also known as Nantah in Mandarin. Opened in 1956, it was a different entity from the current-day NTU. Based on official narratives, such as those by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in his memoirs, and numerous committee reports which reviewed Nantah, the university merged with the University of Singapore in 1980 to form today’s National University of Singapore because fewer students wanted to study there.  After all, Nantah was a Chinese-medium university, and increasingly, fewer students were attending Chinese-language schools. Under these circumstances, then PM Lee announced the merger. NTU is 30 years old today, but to focus only on the university’s post-1991 history will be an injustice to the Nantah years—and also to its former students, many of whom are still with us. It is crucial to narrate their stories and understand the sacrifices they were forced to make in Singapore’s pursuit of progress, before it is too late. Nantah: The Stormy Years I decide to find out more from Mr Yap Kin Loon, whom I meet at his fairly-spartan flat in Ang Mo Kio. He studied in Nantah from 1964 to 1966. Interviewing the 80-year-old self-employed accountant, it is clear that Nantah had a tumultuous and controversial past which runs contrary to official narratives—a sentiment similarly shared by Professor Tan Kok Chiang in his 2017 book, My Nantah Story.  Speaking in Mandarin, he tells me: “When I entered Nantah in 1964, the situation on campus was already tumultuous, with the protests and all.” In his time at Nantah, Kin Loon majored in Chinese language and Culture, and prior to that, he studied at The Chinese High School (today’s Hwa Chong Institution).  He furthered his studies to have an easier time finding a job later. Considering it was less common to study in a university then, I reckon Kin Loon performed very well in school (he denies this); his tuition fees were also paid for by a bursary. From the onset, Nantah already played second fiddle to its counterpart, the University of Singapore, as its degrees were not officially recognised until 1968. At the time, the colonial government was worried the university would breed leftist radicals to advance pro-communist ideas and subversive activities. Then there was the Wang Gungwu report, as Kin Loon recalls, which caused a groundswell of dissent among students. Prof Wang, then a history professor and dean of arts at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, helmed the Curriculum Review Committee formed by Nantah in February 1965. In his report, Prof Wang recommended language reforms in the university, which included not making Mandarin the only medium of instruction. Kin Loon says the government felt that the Chinese language did not reap any benefits internationally then. “We were all very against it, as Chinese-educated students. All of us wanted to protect the Chinese language,” he says.  With that reform, Nantah’s raison d’etre as an institution which used Chinese as the principal medium of instruction and its reputation as the highest-level institution in the Chinese education system would have been lost, according to Tan Kok Chiang’s My Nantah Story.  The students went as far as to stage a protest against the recommendations, and as a result, 85 were expelled from Nantah. These demonstrations continued from the early to mid-1960s, and students deemed pro-communist were continually arrested during raids.   Merger Of Two Universities The writing was on the wall, however, and despite an exchange of letters between the government and university management (which included prominent businessmen Wee Cho Yaw and Lien Ying Chow), and a petition by the student union to protect Nantah’s autonomy, the university eventually merged with the University of Singapore in 1980.  Going by the official narrative, Nantah was merged because of its declining enrollment. Intentionally or unintentionally, the merger also quashed any political uprisings from the left-wing faction of the Chinese community. Kin Loon confirms that many in the university were leftists.  The decision was framed as a merger instead of closure. “The Government did not want to be seen as eradicating Mandarin—that’s their motive,” he says.  I feel his sense of helplessness, as he explains that the merger was beyond anyone’s control. They were more heartbroken than angry.  He and his friends from Nantah did all they could to protect the university which they were fiercely proud of, because it was built brick by brick with contributions from all walks of life in the Chinese community, from towkays to rickshaw pullers.  There were Chinese high school graduates who put up a concert that raised $62,596 and 1,200 trishaw drivers who raised $21,535, and they donated the money as part of a crowdfunding effort to build Nantah.  Not only was Nantah the pride of the Chinese community, as a ground-up university funded by people themselves, students also felt that Nantah’s demise meant a blow for Chinese education and culture as their roots would get cut off, according to Tan Kok Chiang. They didn’t want this cultural identity to be lost.  
What’s admirable about these Nantah students, however, is their fighting spirit. Although the future of their school looked bleak, they fought for what they believed in by protesting and demonstrating, even if they had to pay a heavy price.
 But their efforts were for naught.  “The Government’s power back then was too strong. There is no way for us to really fight back. If we don’t listen, we will get nabbed,” Kin Loon says. Arrested With such a history, I wouldn’t be surprised if the government then perceived Nantah students as troublemakers or anti-establishment.  Students like Kin Loon himself. In fact, he reveals that he himself was arrested back in 1966 during a police raid, with eight others. The Malaysians among them were banished from Singapore and permanently disallowed from re-entering.  When the raid occurred, Kin Loon was staying in the school dormitory. He recalls police officers surrounding the campus in the dead of the night, and making their way up to the rooms. Knocking on their doors, the officers stormed in and arrested the students.  The Internal Security Department told him he would be detained and labelled him as one of the masterminds behind a demonstration over PM Lee’s earlier visit to the university. On 30 October 1966, Lee had visited Nantah to open a new $1 million library building, and many students were up in arms against his visit because they were upset over unfair treatment by the Government towards them, in particular over language policies.  “But on that same day, I was participating in a sports meet as a long-distance runner. There was no way for me to be involved in the protests,” Kin Loon claims.  The officers did not believe his words. He was thrown behind bars and expelled from Nantah. His bursary was revoked. Kin Loon was only in his third year of his four-year course.  “I really didn’t know what I did wrong. I didn’t interact with the radicals on campus either.”  He seems quick to distance himself from the so-called “radicals”, an unpalatable label often used by the establishment referring to activists who resort to social movements when pushing for reforms, although it remains unclear if they were really radicals or simply passionate students protecting Chinese culture. At the time of arrest, Kin Loon was merely a member of the university’s Chinese cultural society, where like-minded students got together to analyse literary works.  He wonders if his membership in that society had anything to do with his arrest, although the society he was in was innocuous and its members did nothing sinister.  Another possible reason: an act of sabotage by peers in school who did not see eye-to-eye with him and snitched on him to the authorities. “Maybe they think we attended some illegal activities—that’s my guess,” he says. Life was not tough inside prison, Kin Loon says. But little did he know how things would change after his release. Life After Detention Two months later, when the authorities no longer perceived him as a threat, he was set free.  Expelled from university, there was only one thing he could do: work. He took up logistics and warehouse management jobs in Jurong, which paid him about $100 per month. But he kept encountering roadblocks, thanks to his stint in prison. Each time, he would start work at a company, only to be dismissed a few months later due to his imprisonment record. Wash, rinse, and repeat for two to three times.  “I asked for the reason behind my dismissal and they kept mum about it. But I understood,” Kin Loon laments with a palpable sense of helplessness. The next two decades were a tough ride for him. From the 1970s, Kin Loon took up accounting courses and became a certified accountant, working at smaller accounting firms which, strangely enough, did not take issue with him being blacklisted. It was an easier way out to be an accountant, and the money was decent too, he says.  Eventually, he set up his own accounting firm, IPT Services, in 1999. The springy senior citizen is still working there till this day, with his son helping out.  “Time To Let It Go” Before interviewing Kin Loon, I expected to meet an old man still resentful over what happened to Nantah and the treatment he got from the government. This is still the case for some of his friends, where the mere mention of “government” is enough to provoke them. These former Nantah students are still angry after all these years because they perceived Nantah’s closure as politically-motivated, and also an abolishment of their language and cultural rights by the government. As for Kin Loon, I see a zen-like man who seems to have put those episodes aside—even though he was detained, expelled from the university, and had career plans thwarted (he wanted to be a teacher).  Whatever happened decades ago no longer affects him now. His children lead uneventful lives, unaffected by the blacklist which plagued their father. It seems the struggle behind Nantah belongs to a bygone era.  Although Nantah is history to us, it is a lived reality for many others. The university was an entity built by the Chinese community and a source of identity for them. Yet, it was taken away from them 24 years later.  Many had difficulties finding jobs and were looked down upon by certain segments of society because of the prejudice created from persistent fault-finding with Nantah, according to Tan Kok Chiang.  Even without the “leftist influence” conspiracy theory behind the merger, Nantah’s days would still have been numbered as Singapore developed into a predominantly English-speaking society. The demise of the university was inevitable, and a generation of students had to be sacrificed for the greater good of progress.  In recent years, the Government has tried to make up for the blemishes in Nantah’s history, be it efforts to resurrect the “Nanyang University” name or the creation of a Chinese Heritage Centre at the former administrative building of Nantah. But reactions to these attempts have been mixed.  What’s admirable about these Nantah students, however, is their fighting spirit. Although the future of their school looked bleak, they fought for what they believed in by protesting and demonstrating, even if they had to pay a heavy price.  
NTU is 30 years old today, but to focus only on the university’s post-1991 history will be an injustice to the Nantah years—and also to its former students, many of whom are still with us.
 Before the ISD knocks on my door and nabs me for attempting to incite unrest, let me reassure you that I’m not asking everyone to take it to the streets to protest against the next government policy we are unhappy with. We must understand that those acts of civil disobedience took place in a different era under a very different political context.  This is why Singapore’s move towards English as a lingua franca—a policy we take for granted—was not smooth-sailing and was met with resistance. It happened at a time when the Singaporean identity was still in its infancy, and the Chinese had a stronger tribal attachment to its own ethnic group, culture, and language.  Today, even though he remains heartbroken over the Nantah affair, Kin Loon no longer bears grudges towards the Government. He sighs and gives a philosophical response, typical of those from the pioneer generation with a can-do spirit: “In life, people have different fates. You just face and deal with whatever that comes in your way. There is no benefit to grumbling over it all day long and I have already let it go.”  What do you know about the history of Nantah?

9,Behind The Scrubs And Masks: What Do Healthcare Workers Do After Work?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-what-do-healthcare-workers-do-after-work/,"Culture, People","All photography by Thaddeus Loh for Rice Media. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.  The pace at our hospitals has been unrelenting: Intubating patients, changing colostomy bags, and resuscitating the stricken. Doctors and nurses go through 12, 13 hours work-days, sometimes going for more than a week before getting a day off. And with extra measures imposed by the pandemic, many of them get their noses poked (swabbed) more often than they like.  It has been a tough ride so far, with no end in sight. But these people are not just mere digits or faceless figures whom we classify under a collective “healthcare workers”. Behind every medical gown and mask is a human being we don’t always see. Like us, they too have emotions and a life outside the doctor or nurse persona.  Earlier this month, we caught up with four healthcare workers (two are twin brothers), some of whom only started their jobs recently, and they gave us a snippet of what a typical workday is like, what they do after work, and on their well-deserved rest days. WHO: Zeng Ding, 26, Junior Doctor at Sengkang General Hospital “It may be my birthday today (5th June) but work goes on. Celebration with the family comes later in the day. Fortunately, Saturday’s a half day for me so it is a 6 AM to 12 PM shift. I’ll shower and have lunch at home later on, and watch some of my Youtube videos. I might also hit the sack if I’m feeling tired later on. Day-offs are supposed to be once per week but once in a while, it gets eaten up by work. It’s not uncommon for junior doctors to work 12, 13 days a row, including being on call, before getting a day off. But the hospital tries to avoid that. Anyway, since it is best to stay home as much as possible, I spend my day-offs catching up on much-needed sleep.” WHO: Ong Jing Long, 26, Junior Doctor at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital “Work has been hard. These days, at work, we get swabbed regularly and don our PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)—the gown, goggles and all, in these extraordinary times. But the work has been satisfying. While senior doctors have high expectations of us, I understand they do so to maintain high standards in our healthcare system. It really feels good to work in a team with numerous healthcare workers playing different roles. You get a one of a kind feeling to be part of a collective that cares, and that is what drove me to be a doctor.  Even though it can be busy as a junior doctor who is still learning, I make a point to find time for important things in life, like my health and spending quality time with those whom I care about. There must be a proportion in life! I have had time to think about how to make the time with my family and friends more meaningful, and more present through shared experiences like cooking a new dish or exercising together. Or engage in deeper conversations with them to learn about their motivations for life. These require more thought put into my gestures and actions. When I’m not working, I try to make the best of the little time I have—exercising, having some ‘me time’, planning mini goals and reorienting what I would really want to achieve in life. Of course, there is always time for some Netflix. I have been watching documentaries recommended by my friends, such as Seaspiracy. A real eye-opener!” WHO: Nicholas Han, 28, Nurse “These days, whenever I am off work after spending long hours at the hospital, I try to spend more quality time with my family—having meals with my parents and elder siblings or watching action movies and documentaries on Netflix with my wife. Keeping myself fit and healthy is also important, especially during a pandemic, so I work out with my dumb-bells at home.” WHO: Ong Jing Zhi, 26, Medical Officer (Emergency Medicine) at the National University Hospital “It’s 12.30 AM and I’m Grab-ing my way home now, after seven, eight hours of continuous work at the emergency department, on a Saturday evening. A silver lining that our rides home on weekends are claimable, so I can catch forty winks after a tiring shift.  Today’s shift has been an ‘interesting-chill’ one, where patients that came through had significant problems that were diagnostically stimulating, but the workload remained somewhat manageable. This is different from ‘boring-busy’ days where we are flooded by a high volume of patients with vague and non-emergent issues that could have been managed by our robust primary care colleagues in outpatient clinics. Once I get home, the first thing I’ll do is to get a good shower. Infection control is one thing, but also, getting out of scrubs is as shiok as taking off your socks after a long day. Then I’ll follow up with some casual Netflix binging or reading my fiction novels, before drifting off to sleep. Not every day is work-sleep-work, of course. On day-offs, I might go to the gym, exercise, go out with friends, play computer games or jam on my guitar at home. Those in the emergency department or working on shifts, our rest days come at rather regular intervals irrespective of weekends, while my colleagues in the wards generally get 1.5 days off a week (we work one half day on either weekend) unless we are on call (at which we work overnight till the next morning).” What more do you want to know about our healthcare workers?

10,Struggling To Keep The Flame Alive: A Collection Of Wild Pandemic Dating Stories,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-wild-pandemic-dating-stories/,"Culture, Life","Since last year, our social lives have been largely shaped by social distancing restrictions. We went from complete lockdown to being able to meet in groups of five, then eight, then back to five, then to two, and now five again. But since the Circuit Breaker, and even when rules were at their strictest, at least two people have been allowed to meet. With this, dating has been one of the main forms of social interaction for single Singaporeans trying to keep some excitement in their lives. Globally, apps like Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid have seen the highest numbers of swipes on their apps since the pandemic started. And in Singapore, unconventional means of dating have increased in popularity as well. Websites like Maybe.sg, that offer girlfriend experiences, have seen a surge in client sign ups. And similarly, Sugar Baby dating websites have seen user traffic skyrocket throughout the pandemic.  But with increased dating also comes a higher chance of finding oneself in a sticky or unpleasant situation. We were not disappointed when we asked our readers and friends for their worst pandemic dating stories, so here’s a select few you to make you feel better about your own life as a single in a global crisis: The Married Man When I matched Alex on Bumble, he was serving his quarantine in a hotel after returning from a trip abroad. Our conversations were flowing smoothly, so I continued chatting with him until he got out. On our first date after his quarantine, he told me that the name on his profile was fake, and that I should call him Deryl instead. I didn’t think much of it at the time, so I started calling him that name from that point on. A few days later, we had another date at a park, after which we headed over to his apartment where I spent the night.  Just as I thought things were starting to pick up, he called me to say that he had to go to Indonesia for work and would be uncontactable for a few weeks.  At first I didn’t think much of it, until I saw him out on a date with another woman in town. When he saw me, he came up to me and told me he was having a work meeting—I didn’t believe this as it clearly looked otherwise. Then, he disappeared again for another week.  I got suspicious at this point so I Googled him, and I was horrified to find out he was married. I stalked his social media accounts, his wife’s profile, and even a website they had made together for their wedding photos. I immediately unmatched him on Bumble and deleted all our texts, but I soon found out he had made a new profile. I felt vengeful, so I agreed to meet him again just so I could collect evidence. After a few more dates, I wrote out the entire story and sent it to his wife via email. She’s heartbroken and in disbelief, but I think she believes that I have no reason to lie to her.  The Rude Girl I broke up with my ex a few months ago, and have started feeling really lonely since. I decided to give Tinder a shot, and to my surprise, I matched with a girl I thought was really sweet. This was my first time online dating ever.  After chatting on Tinder for a couple of days, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie together. She agreed, and we met up.  At this time I was a fresh PES E recruit in the army, which I had mentioned to her previously. While we were walking to the dinner spot we decided on, she asked me why I wasn’t fit. “You’re kind of fat,” she said. The irony was that she didn’t exactly look like her profile pictures either, but I didn’t think it would be right to call her out on that. Instead, I laughed it off and explained yet again that I didn’t actually have any combat activities where I was stationed. At dinner, she started asking about my siblings, what they do, and how old they are. I was suspicious but I went ahead and told her that all three of them were in high paying roles, like healthcare or law.  Her immediate response was to ask me why I fell off the wagon and why I wasn’t as successful as them. At this point, all I wanted was to get the hell out of there. I pushed through with the date, left, and never saw her again. I haven’t been on online dating apps since.  The Foursome I went on a date with a guy from Tinder to get drinks, and I texted my best friend to let her know the location as a safety precaution. She planned to grab a drink nearby in case things went south and I needed her.  An hour into my date with this guy I realised we weren’t clicking, so I suggested I invite my friend over. So I did, and a few more drinks later, I asked my date if he had anyone to introduce to my friend. He proceeded to show us a photo of his roommate, who she liked. We took a cab and went over to their place for more drinks.  While their flat was gross, we decided to stay for a few drinks because the guys were hilarious. At one point I left to get water and when I came back my friend was kissing the roommate on his bed. My date looked at me sitting on his bed and said, “well are you going to leave me hanging?” So I went to him and we started kissing. I didn’t think things would develop with all of us in the same room, but they did. They started having sex, and so did we. Eventually, we started sharing the same bed then sharing each other.  Afterwards, I begged my best friend to come sleep at mine because my parents are really strict and I didn’t want to get scolded.  In the cab my friend said “I can’t believe we just had a foursome,” which of course caught the attention of the driver.  He continued to closely listen to every word of our very detailed recount. Upon reaching my block, he very blatantly turned around to say bye to us so he could get a good look at our faces.  Overall it was gross, funny, and fun. The Love That Got Deported I’ve been single for years so I’m a serial dater. My friends even call me the dating queen because I refuse to give up on the search for love. While I have ramped up my dating efforts in the last year, I can’t say it has been successful yet.   At the end of last year, I started talking to a guy on a dating app. We really got along so we eventually moved over to calling each other, and we continued to speak for over a month. When we finally decided to meet up, he dropped the bomb on me that he was actually living in Malaysia. At that point I was in too deep, so I decided to keep the conversation going with him. Sure enough, he eventually made it back into Singapore. The excitement didn’t last long, as on our first date, I realised he was a massive fuckboy. A few dates later I had been reduced to becoming his booty call before he eventually ghosted me.  Back on the dating apps, I started talking to a new guy and we were really getting along. We went on a few dates and we started getting closer. I saw a future with him, but soon after we met he got himself in a legal situation to do with COVID restrictions. I was hoping for the best, but the worst actually happened—he got deported. I was heartbroken and upset. Dating in a pandemic is hard enough as it is. I was so frustrated when I finally found a decent partner and he was forced to leave.  Now, I’ve just accepted that maybe I should be single for a while. As my friends say, love always comes when you least expect it. So here I am now, away from the apps, with zero expectations. Do you have any wild stories we should publish?

11,"Until Our Politicians Talk About Race More Meaningfully, This Conversation Isn’t Going Anywhere",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-politicians-responses-to-racism/,"Commentary, Current Affairs","Top image: Screencap/Mediacorp  – Although our politicians have always condemned racism, they have hesitated to discuss it in substantive or meaningful ways. This silence at the top has not kept pace with how conversation on the ground is evolving. – Focusing only on obvious examples of racism limits progress, and avoids responsibility for how these outcomes are the result of political or policy choices. – Nonetheless, recent shifts in how our leaders talk about race point to opportunities for change. We explore how the different political parties in Parliament might achieve this. If there was a playbook for how our politicians respond to racism, it would go something like this: Condemn racism while recognising its continual threat. Affirm the public space as one for all Singaporeans. Cite the pledge. Appeal for mutual respect and understanding. End off with something along the lines of “racial harmony is a work in progress, but we can always do more”. Minister Lawrence Wong’s speech at the IPS/RSIS conference on Friday followed this template, but with several noteworthy additions. In it, he called on Singaporeans to recognise that minorities face difficulties ‘in all aspects of daily life’, and spoke of the ‘real hurt’ that discrimination can cause. Significantly, he stated that we should be “upfront and honest about the racialised experiences various groups feel’ and ‘begin civilised discussions’, grounded in empathy, good faith, and a willingness to listen to all. It’s a thoughtful and earnest speech, and a step in the right direction. Nonetheless, one can’t help but notice that at the state level, several of the biggest and most controversial incidents of the last two years—the ePay mess, the investigation of Raeesah Khan, and most recently, the PA/Sarah Bagharib debacle—yielded scant progress in how we talk about race. Rather than fruitful discussion, it is more common for a news-making incident to end in police reports and ‘missed opportunities for dialogue’. For the most part, the developments in conversation on the ground —or appetite for this—have not been matched by our leaders. No politician has denied that racism exists here, or portrayed it as anything less than unacceptable and dangerous. However, this is often softened with qualifiers that the vast majority of Singaporeans are not racist, that racism exists in every country, and at least it’s not as bad here as it is elsewhere—the race equivalent of ‘not all men’, if you will. Earlier this month, I argued that the Dave Parkash incident exposed some double-standards in how we think about racism. We can observe a similar divide at the state level, where politicians leap to denounce racism, but hesitate to weigh in more meaningfully. Tan Boon Lee’s harassment drew unanimous censure, with all three parties in Parliament citing a zero-tolerance stance towards racism. However, few examined the notion of ‘preference’ in interracial unions, and whether such views are acceptable today. While there was agreement that the PA was wrong to use Sarah Bagharib’s photos without her consent, politicians side-stepped the question of whether the affair was racist or merely ‘culturally insensitive’. Notably, MPs from the PAP and WP declined to comment on the incident when approached by TODAY. It’s fine that there’s no public consensus on how to define racism—our understanding of the concept is still evolving. The problem is that almost no politician dares to push these boundaries. With a handful of exceptions, few politicians have dared to go beyond the obvious, and examine racism as outcome- rather than intention-focused, systemic, or explore how it intersects with class and other social determinants. This goes beyond interracial marriage and squabbles over ‘cooking smells’. Questioning the financial outcomes of HDB’s Ethnic Integration Policy, for example, remains a minefield, as does exploring links between socioeconomic factors and racial disparities in health outcomes, or income gaps. The recently released 2020 census showed that the average household income of Malay families is the lowest of all ethnic groups, which has not changed since 2010. The thing is that the government has long recognised that disparities exist, and taken some steps to look into these. Most recently, in the last couple of months, workgroups were set up to explore health outcomes in minority groups and to boost home ownership amongst Malay families.  These would have been valuable conversation starters on the material aspects of racism. Working towards solutions is important, but implicitly recognising that a problem exists is not the same as ‘being upfront and honest’ about it. Skipping this just looks like avoidance. Nonetheless, in the last couple of months, there has been a subtle shift in how racism is framed.   Minister Wong’s speech is the latest example, but Minister Shanmugam’s comments following the Dave Parkash incident raised some eyebrows. In a longer post on cohesion, President Halimah reflected: 
Such displays are so hurtful because we thought that we had done so much to protect our cohesion until we are shaken from our belief … We wonder whether these are one-off incidents or reflective of a larger problem.
 Despite this, there has been little acknowledgement of the accounts of everyday racism flooding social media. While these were referenced in Minister Wong’s speech, and younger politicians, like the PAP’s Nadia Samdin, WP’s Nicole Seah, and Jess Chua, leader of the PSP’s Youth Wing, have posted statements on social media, many more have remained silent. It’s understandable why no one wants to open Pandora’s box. Racial and religious harmony are the most out-of-bounds of the OB markers. Nobody wants to be accused of playing identity politics, grandstanding, stoking ‘culture wars’, or risk alienating voters.  Ultimately, however, the milquetoast ‘we must do better’ comments enable self-preservation. If the focus remains on incidents of obvious malice, this allows deeper questions about racism to go avoided and unanswered.  Probing further entails recognising that outcomes are the result of choices. It also raises expectations about when these choices will be reviewed, and who will be responsible for this. Here, the PAP’s history works against them: as the ruling party since independence, they shoulder the most responsibility going forward. As a start, they will need to introspect on, and acknowledge, Lee Kuan Yew’s troubling views on race and eugenics as well as past comments by its MPs. They will need to examine how portrayals of race in their communications can be less one-dimensional, including guarding against stereotypes about the ‘Malay problem’.  More significantly, where evidence points to racial inequalities (such as in housing, educational outcomes, and income), nuanced and thorough reviews should be conducted. As the dominant party, many of the gateway actions to doing this—such as making more race-based data publicly accessible—rest with them.  None of this needs to amount to fuelling tribalism or pretending race doesn’t exist. For example, Minister Wong is right to say that Chinese privilege can’t be addressed without involving generations still aggrieved by the loss of Chinese-medium schools and dialect erasure (decisions which, it must be noted, were the result of government policy). But what if reviewing SAP schools was framed as increasing educational access for non-Chinese students, rather than attacking Chinese-ness? Or the EIP about mitigating inequality, rather than a premature rush towards race-blindness? Opposition parties might have limited decision-making power, but they are neither blameless nor helpless. Chiefly, they need to not only condemn racism, but acknowledge their culpability in allowing it to fester. As a party, while the PSP has come out multiple times to denounce racism and xenophobia, it has not acknowledged how its supporters’ enthusiasm for reviewing CECA often shades into these, or attempted to rein them in. Nor has it addressed how its own politicians’ remarks sometimes veer into dog-whistle territory, like Leong Mun Wai’s hand-wringing over hawker centres serving ‘more and more foreign food’, or ‘recouping’ Singaporean rice bowls from foreign PMETs. This has to stop. Letting mutters about ‘CECA personnel’ pass unchecked is only a few rungs down from Nigel Farage’s legitimising of ethno-nationalism—the kind that started with ‘British jobs for British workers’ and ended in minorities being told to ‘go back where you came from’ post-Brexit.  (For that matter, the PAP is equally guilty of ignoring the politicking carried out by groups like Fabrications About the PAP. Despite all the talk of mutual respect, I have not seen one politician publicly call out Shamsul Kamar.) The WP, meanwhile, has been ultra-cautious about stepping up to the discussion. While several of its members have made statements on social media, and Raeesah Khan recently asked several Parliamentary questions about racism in schools, the party has said nothing groundbreaking since Sylvia Lim’s speech on a post-racial society last September. The proposals in that speech, which argued for a review of the CMIO model, the EIP, and community self-help groups, amongst others, should be revisited. After all, their GE2020 campaign was based on the checks-and-balances pitch; this is the standard they will be judged by. This dynamic is hardly unique to Singapore. Worldwide, political willingness to move on controversial issues is often dictated by the public mood. Politicians don’t usually take a stand until it becomes more disadvantageous to keep quiet than speak up.  All the same, the issue is gaining momentum, and by waiting too long to say anything meaningful, everyone stands to lose: the PAP’s potential for a rebrand, Opposition parties who market themselves on progressivism, and the country as a whole, for a chance to learn together. The irony is that silence from the top is the ultimate indictment of the state of Singapore’s social fabric: if harmony is as valued as all have claimed, then we should survive talking about this.  Shattering the taboo around race will be both uncomfortable and politically risky, but it can only make this country stronger. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate real leadership.  If you have thoughts on this piece, a tip-off you’d like to share, or just want to say hi, drop us a message at community@ricemedia.co.

12,"So, What Do Retired Grandparents Get Up to in a Day?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-people-retired-grandparents-get-up-to-in-a-day/,"Culture, Life, People, Sponsored","All images by the authors. Lives begin at different starting points. The more financially assured are symbolic of hares — folks with a better head start in life. On the flip side, most average Singaporeans (like the writers of this story) are born tortoises — we hustle steadily and slowly save to get through the much-dreaded #adulting. Depending on one’s circumstances and family history, resources—and in turn, lifestyles—can greatly differ. In the classic tale of The Tortoise and The Hare, the biggest lesson is about the consequence of complacency. Tortoise, hare, or human, no one comes out on top from getting lulled into sleepy comfort and contentedness. The same can be said about building capital for retirement and beyond. Stay complacent enough about the amount of savings you have, and everything could be wiped out on a rainy day. That leaves little money for oneself, much less money for the next of kin. In other words, don’t be foolish enough not to plan for the future. We speak to two grandmothers in divergent circumstances to see how their senior years turned out in the end. All the Money in the World
Written through the perspective of Ilyas.
 The first thing that Madam Saleha asked me after I salam her (that Malay ritual where you kiss the hands of your elders) is if I wanted to order some Thai food on Grab. She insisted on the cash-on-delivery option, wanting to pay for the pineapple fried rice, mango salad, minced beef with basil, and other items that amounted to nearly $80. Too late. Her granddaughter refused to let the 79-year-old retiree dole out a single cent and had already tapped the order button with the payment charged to her card. It’s a pretty standard scene that plays out among Malay families: the younger kin refusing to let their elders pay when it comes to meals. “Hehe, thank you!” the septuagenarian eventually relented, settling back into her armchair, holding a wad of $50 notes in her hand—the cash that her granddaughter just gave as a monthly allowance. Filial piety and all that jazz. Saleha isn’t her real name though; she requested to keep her identity anonymous. What I can tell you is that she and her husband have been together for 60 years. I can tell you that they both live with their daughter, son-in-law, four grandchildren, domestic helper, and a bunch of cats in a capacious HDB apartment in Pasir Ris. l can also tell you that the cupboard where she stores her baju butterfly is the same place where she has $12,000 in cash squirrelled away. That’s about a thousand times more than what she had in her bank account when she got married at 19 years of age. “I wanted to climb out of that situation,” she recalled about the days with little to her name, pledging to hustle hard to build a family. And hustle she did. Like most people in Singapore’s pioneer generation, Mdm Saleha took on a multitude of jobs—any jobs—to sustain her family. While her husband went into education and shipping, she climbed her way into managerial roles in logistics, catering and hospitality.  She forgets how much she earned in those jobs (“So long ago, how to remember!”) but it was substantial enough for her to start investing and buying up multiple properties in Singapore, Malaysia and Jakarta. Honestly, it’s impressive. And they’ve all provided a sweet return on investment, though she hesitates to reveal just how much she racked up.  “I just managed to do it,” she says with more than a twinkle in her eye.  Putting the hows aside, I asked her about the whys. The sparkle in her eye turned watery. All that hustling, all that strategic asset planning—it was always for the kids; their two daughters who grew up in comfortable environments and now have families of their own.  These days though, she has given it all up to live a simple life with her daughter and grandchildren. Surprisingly, as someone with hundreds of thousands of dollars stored in her accounts after cashing in on her investments and properties, Mdm Saleha and her husband live modestly. They share a double bed in a spartan room with a small television. Medication, pills and supplements are tucked away on a small table. Their daily routines revolve around playing with their young grandkids, short walks around the neighbourhood and watching whatever’s on the telly.  There’s a reason behind living frugally — all the wealth that she built could be undone without thoughtful planning or lifestyle adjustments on her end. As we tucked into our desserts, it’s clear that they’ve never fancied the high life. Macaroons, panna cottas and parfaits? Nah, just chendol and some durian for them, thanks. Perhaps it’s this hardline principle towards prudence that enabled her to accumulate assets so easily. To Mdm Saleha, money is no issue at all. There’s the occasional splurge to go on holidays overseas during The Before Time, but that’s pretty much it. Otherwise, the money stays in her bank account (and her cupboard) to stretch out as long as possible throughout retirement. As confident as this grandmother was in her savings—she’s got more money to her name than the funds of both her daughters combined, she reckoned—there’s always the danger of having it all obliterated by unexpected financial burdens. Leaving little to pass on to her children and grandchildren. I have to admit, I struggled to even broach the subject of legacy planning, the financial strategy to bequeath assets and wealth to the next of kin after death. Culturally, it’s just not good etiquette to talk about death—much less post-death affairs—with an elder. After some poor attempts to dance around the subject, she gets the hint. “I haven’t really planned anything, to be honest. I trust my daughters to split my assets equally because I raised them to be sensible people,” she affirmed. In the hustle to snowball enough funds for a decent livelihood for the family, the official affairs of her wealth after going beyond the veil had not mattered that much to her. But it does matter, I brought up. Tailoring exactly how she would like to distribute her assets would at least give her peace of mind about how her kids and grandkids will carry on. If she has the capacity to plan things out, why not? She laughed it off. For Mdm Saleha, there was never a doubt that her daughters and their families will get along just fine even without her help. Like her, they’ve learned to be fiercely independent women who aren’t dependent on anyone else but themselves. She does know, however, that her middle-aged kids will end up inheriting a substantial amount that’ll ensure they continue living in comfort for the rest of their lives. Leaving the HDB flat with a sense of admiration (and more than a tinge of envy) over her nonchalant frame of mind towards wealth and assets, I wonder what the thought process is like for other retirees who aren’t as privileged. Last in Priority: A Frugal Approach to Modest Living
Written through the perspective of Eve.
 Nothing means more to Mdm Sally Chan than her family. At 73, she continues to be a selfless giver. 
 
As I entered her 1-room rental flat, it wasn’t so much the tight quarters that caught my eye. Neither was it the quirky decorations that colour the interiors. Rather, it was the word ‘love’ that marked Mdm Chan’s otherwise plain t-shirt. It is perhaps the most accurate term one can use to describe her.
 If I were to track Mdm Chan’s career path, it’d be a long list of odd jobs. There were so many that she could barely recall them all. 

Since her twenties, she had worked as a babysitter, packer at the wet market, mixed rice stall helper, chicken rice seller, office cleaner and quality control inspector at a factory.

Some of these were part-time jobs that paid $40 a day; others were monthly gigs that provided a couple of hundreds. The highest was a contract job which offered approximately $1,300 a month.  As a divorcee and single mother raising two young children back then, Mdm Chan exclusively picked jobs that required little travel time. They had to be flexible enough so that she could still keep a watchful eye on her children.  The hustle life plopped her into a busy, recognisable routine: Work hard. Money in, money out. 

Despite having little to spare, Mdm Chan made it a point to allocate a portion of her earnings into a bank account. Never mind that those savings got wiped out when her son needed it for school. Never mind that she had to give up her dream of living in a 5-room HDB flat with a balcony.
 Having sold her first house after the divorce, Mdm Chan had to live with her daughter for a period of time before moving to her current rental flat. 

Her daughter, also a divorcee, was busy earning dough for her family and had little time to care for the kids. Mdm Chan then quit her job, stepping in to care for her grandchildren as a paid caregiver.

Retirement only began at 66, when the family’s financial situation stabilised. Life is a lot less hectic these days. Every day, she wakes up at 7AM to prepare breakfast, before walking to a coffee shop to buy lunch around 12PM. She then cares for her plants, does some housekeeping and watches TV before preparing dinner. 
 At times, medical ailments like knee joint pains arise. Doctors have made in-house visits, while social workers check in occasionally. There are trips to the grocery store too, but that wraps up her daily routine.

The plan was to stay for dinner. Rather than opting for food delivery options, Mdm Chan insisted on a hearty home cooked meal. We weaved through the tight walkway, chatting as she turned her attention to boiling soup in the kitchen. Through it all, a loud Hokkien tune played on the radio.  Discussions about death may be disconcerting and even morbid for many. When prompted for her thoughts on the topic, she remarked: “Aiyo, What’s so scary about death? We all die one day.” When people spend their most productive years fulfilling familial responsibilities, this causes them to neglect their own retirement and savings. In wanting to provide for her loved ones, Mdm Chan has left little for herself. She was never a top priority. While Mdm Chan is content with living a modest life, she sometimes worries about her dependents; and wonders if they’ll get along fine in the future after she passes on. “I don’t have much to give them, and I’m lucky that they have stable incomes. But worrying has always been part of my nature. Good thing I’m healthy. At least for now, ” she laughs. Silence descended momentarily, and there seemed to be a collective tenderness between us. Even in the absence of words, I knew that the situation would be vastly different if a serious illness ever came knocking on the door. Coming from the pioneer generation, she depends on a small allowance from the government and some pocket money from her children. These quickly go into her monthly rent and daily expenses, leaving little to spare for other luxurious wants. She rarely pampers herself with anything — no annual vacations, branded handbags, fancy high tea sessions, or anything of that sort.

As we sat down for dinner, Mdm Chan acknowledged that she’s considered fortunate despite having little left for retirement. In fact, some elderly have it worse. Others may be in a similar financial predicament, but with the added adversity of being sickly and no family members to rely on. With no safety net, retiring comfortably would be the last thing on their minds.
 Over the course of my stay, I noticed how one neighbour casually stepped in the house twice — first to collect some leftover red bean soup; second to distribute some rice dumplings. I get the sense that social ties are thicker here than in wealthier, more affluent neighbourhoods — there seemed to be an unspoken, mutual dependence between the old folks. 

Retirement planning is akin to winemaking — the process is slow and requires a long term view. The finished product, however, will be well worth the wait. Surely, not every person gets the luxury to plan ahead, like in the case of Mdm Chan. But oftentimes, it is lack of foresight that holds many back from going forth with an official long-term strategy such as legacy planning, like in the case of Mdm Saleha. 

7PM arrived in a blink of an eye. It was two hours before her bedtime; a cue for me to head off. 

She catches my eye and smiles. A genuine, kind smile. 

“To be honest, I don’t have great advice for young people, except that if you have the ability to save or plan ahead, then do that. These are habits that I believe should be imparted from a young age. I tell that to my grandchildren too.”

“If you have $1, spend 70 cents and keep the rest. You’ll be surprised by how these things add up.”

Who doesn’t wish for a comfortable life after slogging for years? With so much to consider (and life getting in the way), planning for retirement and beyond can get overwhelming. But in dreaming about the life we envision, not all of us are actively thinking about ways to make it a reality. Ironically, we could end up being our own villains by holding ourselves back from the life we seek. Take it from the grandparents then: live old, plan young.    This story is published in partnership with AIA Insurance.

13,"A Journey Through The Only HDB Estate In Siglap, The Lesser-known Dakota Crescent",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-journey-hdb-estate-siglap-lesser-known-dakota-crescent/,"Culture, Life","Photography by Eliza Ho.  What does it mean to be Singaporean? Many will say that being Singaporean means speaking Singlish, or being kiasu. But in recent years, it can feel like being Singaporean is all about being in a constant state of change—constantly measuring trade-offs against bets on future growth, having to re-establish our identities as the spaces around us face a seemingly never-ending cycle of being torn down and built up, taking with them intimate memories and slices of our culture.   This story is part of a series where we explore the spaces, subcultures, and stories of Singapore that may no longer exist as we pursue urbanisation and progress. It’s not just about conservation and nostalgia, but also about understanding why, as a nation, these transformations are sometimes necessary.  Golden shafts of light line the pale pink walls, casting quivering shadows of trees jingling their sleeves of green. As the mynas trill, a sense of peace settles snugly over a cluster of five-storey HDB blocks in Siglap. Supposedly due for demolition under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) in 2015, the four, stout blocks still sit solemnly along East Coast Road today, its empty hallways and vacant grounds a queer sight amidst the neighbourhood. This curious compound is very much the lesser known Dakota, sporting the same apocalyptic qualities, now that residents have all but emptied its quarters. Dated posters are splashed against dusty storefronts, obnoxiously publicizing telco offers or coyly showing off the latest sultry hairdo. Void of their original inhabitants, mailboxes are stuffed full with an assortment of leftover flyers, plastic bottles, and other alien intruders. A mishmash of wooden boards are deftly nailed to windows and entry ways, while hefty locks coil around grills with their paint peeling off, a warning to the stray explorer. A former kampung, the Siglap flats were built in response to a case of Chinese New Year festivities gone awry, when a blazing fire in 1962 consumed several attap houses. The new flats to rehouse affected residents were completed in 1964, consisting of a mix of residential units and shop spaces.  Setting up Framer’s Choice some 20 years ago, Mr Kadir was one such former tenant before he moved to a corner unit at Siglap Centre. With a wealth of experience in frame making, Mr Kadir is one of the few craftsmen in what he labels as a dying trade.  “Last time when I’m missing a material, I can just call my frame making friends to ask if they have spare. But now, less and less friends,” Mr Kadir muses. He is seated amid a stack of frame samples lined up like a searing arrow, with a jumble of tape, receipts and other handy tools crammed on the neighbouring shelf. Mr Kadir’s brother was the one who first showed him the reins, and the two shared a frame making business together.  “It was tough at first when I didn’t know anything”, Mr Kadir shares. Gesturing to his palm, he explains, “I would get my hand cut on glass, cut here, cut there, all bleeding.” Mr Kadir has framed all sorts of knick knacks, from Ming dynasty replicas to Nyonya beaded sandals. He claims there is no secret to frame making, but expertly recommends a medium tone wooden frame with a thin gold line for the chinese calligraphy scroll I brought.  As talk turns to life at the Siglap flats, a glimmer of nostalgia enters Mr Kadir’s voice. “All the ground floor shop owners were friends,” Mr Kadir reminisces. “Dr Wong, his clinic was just beside my shop, so he actually helped me to get many customers. Whenever people visit him, they would see there’s a frame shop next door and come in to enquire.”  “When I had to move out, I felt, how to say,” Mr Kadir ponders, searching for the appropriate word. “Uneasy, I felt uneasy.”  I ask if he still keeps up with the other folk, but he shakes his head, telling me that they all lost contact. “Every now and then, I’ll hear that someone passed away,” he says softly. “Like that la, old already.” One friend, however, made the move to Siglap Centre with him, setting up a salon in the basement of the creaking building. Always sporting a hat of some sort, Uncle Sam, as he is affectionately known by his customers, is an unmistakable sight at the salon. Picking up the tricks of the trade from his father at the tender age of 18, the exposure sparked off a journey that would see Uncle Sam move from salon to salon to garner experience, before finally opening Siglap 5 as his own.  He readily offers an explanation for his shop’s name, pointing to a framed poster of a Malay band.  “My friend’s band back in the day was called Siglap 5 and I really liked their music,” he says.   Stepping foot into his salon is akin to taking a trip back in time, with walls peppered by retro looking posters of local bands from the 60s and old school barber tools strewn over the counters. He even has a sleek, black electric guitar hanging on the wall, a relic of his distant musical past. “Now my hands cannot press the chords la,” says Uncle Sam.  In fact, Uncle Sam used to belong to a band, but he abashedly brushes me off when I ask about their songs, insisting that it was merely for fun. “It’s just for the photo,” he humorously quips when I point out his guitar wielding self in the faded print.  A constant stream of customers flow in and out of his shop, “How are you”s and smatterings of Malay echoing throughout the basement. Experienced folk help themselves to plastic stools stacked by the side, and sit by the corridor waiting for their turn on the black leather chair. The tune of Seruling Anak Gembala, one of his favourite tracks, reverberates as he nimbly works scissor and razor.  Malay tunes are swapped out for cartoons on his iPad when little Nicholas gets his hair cut. Uncle Sam personally hoists the young boy up on the barber chair, and confidently snips away. I ask Nathaniel, his older brother (who has been narrating an adventure from The Land of Stories to me), why he likes coming to Uncle Sam.  “Because …” he says shyly, “he gives me sweets!”  I wonder how the move to Siglap Centre has been for them. “Totally different,” says Mr Kadir as he shakes his head, forlorn. “Last time, I can just go out under the big tree and sit at the chess table outside, chit chat. Now here I feel so cramped,” he adds, gesturing dispiritedly at the tiny corner his shop now occupies.  In a bid to reminisce about old times, we cross the street to walk along the foregone pathways of the Siglap flats. The faded storefronts bear testament to the life that once existed, an ode to the hair salon and the photo studio, the coffee shop and the violin store. The banter flows naturally between the two, with Mr Kadir impishly dishing out a schoolboy refrain of I don’t want to sit near him when I ask them to pose for a photo together. On our evening stroll, we discover one of the doors left ajar, and cautiously peer in. I am beyond myself with curiosity, but the two of them are nonchalant.  “This one the owner pass away already,” Uncle Sam says. Surprised, I ask how he knows, to which Mr Kadir interjects, “This fellow knows everyone here!”  When asked about the kampung spirit, the pair enthusiastically gush about the good old days, voices overlapping one another as they speak. The kampung spirit has always been a rather elusive concept to me, a distant mantra rather than a lived experience, an elevated synonym for courtesy and awkward neighbourly bonding.  “Kampung spirit is real, you not part of kampung you don’t know,” Uncle Sam chides. “Last time 5km down the road, whose son whose brother I also know.” “Next to my shop, there was this auntie selling joss sticks and traditional Chinese items,” Mr Kadir said. “She would always help to jaga my shop when I need to go out, and when customers come she will help me to tell them to wait. After the work day finishes, she’ll always tell me to go home safely, I always remember that.” We hear of a neighbourhood’s demise all the time. A season ends, shops shutter up, residents move on. In my own homeground of the Siglap-Katong area, storefronts are always changing rapidly, with new tenants swiftly occupying jilted spaces in hopes of a different fortune. With the kaleidoscopic changes come an amnesia that seeps in unconsciously, often climaxing in the shuddering realization that we no longer remember what previously occupied the space where the shiny new cafe now sits. While I welcome the plethora of coffee options now bestowed upon us east siders, I cannot help but feel a pang of worry about the creeping homogeneity slowly encroaching neighbourhoods like Katong. It is the relentless tug of war, the tension between preserving a slice of old history and welcoming a new chapter of modern development.  There has always been a tint of artifice to nostalgia, a lament for the bygone days seen through rose tinted lenses. We clamour for second hand bookstores to stay open even though we rarely patronize them. Or bemoan the loss of kampungs we have never set foot in. Yet, there exists a group of people who are well justified to lament, a community for whom the treasure trove of memories does not simply exist as a caricature. Places breed relationships, and the relationships fostered at Siglap flats are real to both Uncle Sam and Mr Kadir.  In Tan Pin Pin’s film In Time to Come, the fanfare accorded to stately milestones is contrasted with the ordinary, quotidian moments often swallowed by the headstrong rush toward productivity. The glittering sea of camera flashes anxious to capture the opening ceremony of the Downtown Line is contrasted with a mundane shot of commuters sprawled on the train, a subtle critique on our biased curation of what is “worth remembering”.  The film goes on to chronicle the exhuming of a time capsule from the past, and a making of a time capsule for the future, where the objects both uncovered and prepared are ironically the inconsequential—a telephone book filled with obsolete addresses, a life jacket peppered with unidentifiable signatures. It is regrettable that when in preservation, focus is given to the ordinary, yet in present life one remains shockingly unconcerned about the commonplace. Thankfully, the excavation of a place is rarely sufficient to uproot the totality of memory, as Mr Kadir and Uncle Sam have so proven.  “Of course sad,” says Mr Kadir when asked about how he feels now, but then adds, “so that’s why you must give me the photos you take.” “You must be happy when you’re cutting hair,” Uncle Sam chirps, “cannot be unhappy.” Is there a place in Singapore that’s about to be forgotten?

14,Inside Singapore’s Thriving Black Market: Is It Time To Rethink The Vape Ban?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-inside-singapores-thriving-black-market/,"Commentary, Current Affairs","Have you walked through a cloud of sweet smelling, fast dissolving smoke lately? At this point, I’d bet that you have. It’s no secret that vaporisers and e-cigarettes are prevalent in Singapore. Their presence has been discussed ad nauseum in mainstream media outlets. From cautionary tales penned by health experts to school teachers who are concerned for the wellbeing of the Singaporean youth. The consensus (from the media at least) is that vaping is scary and bad.  There are a few reasons cited by the well intended fear mongers: unstudied long-term health effects, dubious marketing materials aimed at teens, and vape related fatalities overseas. It seems all parties can agree that vaping is rife in Singapore. What goes unremarked upon, though, is the immediate health threat that unregulated black market products pose to the public. A Thriving Black Market
 Channel News Asia reported that there is a plethora of digital avenues to access illegal vaping devices and accessories. In fact, if one knows where to look, it isn’t hard to find them at all. Sellers mostly hawk their wares on Telegram (which has end-to-end encryption), but listings for vape products have popped up on Carousell, Lazada, and Shopee too. Non-encrypted technologies and online public marketplaces are easier to police, and in 2020, the HSA collaborated with social media platforms to remove over 2,000 of these listings.  What exactly is the scale of the black market, though? CNA mentioned there were several groups with up to 10,000 members, which RICE has verified in our own investigation. At press time, some groups have grown closer to 20,000 members. Inside these group chats, new listings and offers are posted every second. Clearly, the removal of listings by HSA (presumably off non-encrypted platforms) has not significantly dented the black market activity on Telegram and WhatsApp.  It’s hard to describe the scale of the black market without getting into specifics on what’s available, but here’s a non-exhaustive list of what can be found on Telegram: DIY vaporiser tanks, reusable coils, disposable (one use) vapes, a home delivery service which refills the disposable (one use) vapes, reusable vape devices with nicotine salt cartridges, cartridges from established overseas brands, cartridges from dubious brands, e-juice in any flavor you can imagine, chargers, and bundles with combinations of any of the above.  Because the market is overflowing with suppliers, pricing has gotten competitive. From our own research, we’ve witnessed a significant drop in cost over the last six months. When the market was nascent, a pack of vape pods cost close to $30. Now that the pool of suppliers has expanded, the same amount goes for >$25. Due to market growth, sellers are upping their CX. One can pay extra for same day delivery, or fetch a discount by self-collecting an order from a pick up point.  The bootleg products seem to be arriving on all fronts. In October of last year, more than 5,000 vaporisers & paraphernalia were intercepted at Tuas Checkpoint by ICA. Despite the border closures, products seem to be making their way through to Singapore in Malaysian – registered lorries. On the same day as the Tuas Checkpoint seizure, there was another catch of 24,000 vape products at the Changi Airfreight Centre.  Black markets thrive when consumer demand overlaps with hard regulation. In the past five years, the e-cigarette industry has exploded with popularity. Globally, the industry is expected to have a valuation of USD $45,000,000,000 by 2026. Singapore is not immune to global trends, and this is clear through the thriving black market.  In 2018, local authorities quickly clamped down on the sale and use of e-vapourisers in Singapore. A lack of clinical research and some unexplained vape related fatalities were cited. However, for Singapore, it might be worth considering regulation at this juncture instead of only doubling down on the outright ban.  There are a few reasons which justify regulation at this point: firstly, the scientific evidence has advanced tremendously in the past three years. It has since come to light that the vape-related fatalities cited by the authorities as a reason for prohibition, were induced by toxic levels of Vitamin E and THC in unregulated black market products. In fact, current medical science indicates that while it’s not harmless, vaping is almost certainly healthier than smoking. In the United Kingdom, the PHE has identified e-vapourisers as a safe and key component of their national tobacco cessation strategy.  Another concern which would be solved by regulation: Youth access to e-vapourisers. Implementing appropriate taxes, enabling oversight by local health authorities, and designating specific points of sale, would help deter young people from participating. Regulation would also make a dent in the black market and reduce supply, which is where young people have the most immediate access, anyway.  Ironically, Amrin Amin (Secretary for Health and Home Affairs) made this point while using the tobacco industry as an example. “The banning of cigarettes, given the existing pool of smokers, will give rise to black markets and increase the flow of smuggled cigarettes into Singapore.” The same logic can be applied to the local vape black market as well: The banning of vaporisers, given the existing pool of vape users, has given rise to black markets and increased the flow of smuggled vape products into Singapore.  The final reason why the black market continues to thrive is the lack of harsher punishments for offenders. Illicit vapes are not treated with the same severity as Class A drugs. Perhaps, this is because the market is hard to trace. On end-to-end encrypted services, it’s near impossible to surveil offenders, and much harder to prosecute. The vast majority of the black market operates on Telegram, and the reported offenders who have been fined were caught selling on non-encrypted platforms like Carousell, Lazada, and Instagram. Though there are hefty fines for repeat offenders, those charged with first time possession are typically fined $500 and jail time is rarely handed down for either offence.  What Are The Health Risks On The Black Market?  In the absence of regulation, the black market is run by anonymous sellers who stock a wide variety of products. In our investigation, we found the most commonly available products are created by a mammoth Chinese e-cigarette manufacturer. According to our research, the laboratories of this Chinese manufacturer have a stringent, 18 step quality control process. The company invests millions of dollars into R&D, while engaging medical experts and scientists to manufacture products which are safe for use.  When the Chinese products are purchased from a verified source, they are labeled with QR codes which inform the user where the product was manufactured. This includes batch numbers and expiration dates. However, these safety measures undertaken by the company are flattened on the unregulated black market.  If the consumer has never encountered a legitimate product before, realistically, how can one deduce whether it is counterfeit or not? Copycat devices and accessories of this Chinese brand are rife in the Telegram chats. To the untrained eye, tell-tale signs of a counterfeit are tricky to spot. Moreover, the majority of copycat products are compatible with the legitimate devices, which further complicates the buyer’s discernment.  In April 2020, the Chinese manufacturer conducted an investigation into the contents of counterfeit pods. The results were concerning. Nicotine percentages were 58% higher than the advertised 5%, and the levels of Toluene (which can cause central nervous system depression and arrhythmias) were concerningly high. In their report, the Chinese manufacturer included pictures of the dangerous counterfeit products. Are these counterfeits circulating in Singapore as well? Without a ‘safe’ standard to refer back to from regulation, it’s impossible to tell.  Is There A Path Towards Regulation In Singapore?  We spoke with Sean Ang—a community pharmacist and smoking cessation counsellor to gain a better understanding of how Singapore could proceed with e-cigarette regulation. From his perspective, even if e-vapourisers were legalised,  “it would likely be used as a prescribed cessation tool’’ as this approach “requires medical testing, to ensure that the products are consistently effective.”  Mr. Ang further noted that local health authorities are hesitant to normalise addiction. “Take smoking for example. If cigarettes were banned tomorrow, there would be riots. It’s hard to get the public to abstain from something which has been normalized. In my opinion, shisha was banned for this reason, so that it wouldn’t become normalised.”  When we asked about regulation for commercial use, Mr. Ang believed this was a pipe dream. “Because the medical literature on vaporisers (even as a cessation tool) is nascent, if they allowed it now and discovered down the line that it was extremely harmful, then decided to impose a ban—it would be tough to get people to stop.”  Mr. Ang went on to comment on the lack of urgency on this matter, despite the expanding black market. “Nicotine addiction is not a pressing issue. We have fairly low rates of smokers, which is why our cessation efforts are no longer excessive. I think the black market problem extends beyond the e-vapourisers. Look at it this way: no matter the price of an illicit activity, there’s always demand.”  To play devil’s advocate, RICE mentioned to Mr. Ang that Singapore could tackle the problem of e-vapourisers with a harm reduction approach. The principles of this public health ideology respects the autonomy of the substance user, and works to facilitate safe substance use instead of imposing harsh restrictions, which drives the user to the black market. Though it sounds straightforward and utopian, Mr. Ang rebutted that this notion is incongruent with Singapore’s hard-line stance on substance abuse in general. It’s also a contradiction to the extensive efforts which the HPB have taken to install nationwide cessation programs. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s not worth considering, given the health risks posed by the widespread sale of black market products. Ultimately, the discourse on e-cigarettes strikes at the central conflict of policy makers in Singapore. Is it possible to be progressive and pragmatic? If not, what takes precedence? If we continue to de-normalise and ban vape use, we will expose nicotine users (close to 3% of our population) to black market products which carry substantial health risks. On the other hand, it’s worth considering if a more enlightened approach can be adopted, to regulate e-cigarettes as we already do with cigarettes, minimising black market risks and ascribing accountability to stakeholders.  What are your thoughts on these developments?

15,Asexuals in Singapore Tell Us How It Feels To Disappear,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-asexuals-singapore-tell-us-feels-disappear/,"Culture, People","All images by Feline Lim for RICE Media.  A few years ago, on Valentine’s Day of all days, I was grabbing drinks with an old friend of mine at a bar near the foot of Ann Siang Hill when, apropos of nothing, she came out to me as an asexual.  This news came as quite a shock. Because for as long as I’ve known her—going on fifteen years now—this friend had always been a notorious flirt in her social life. An extravert who would crack obscene jokes in front of total strangers, ones that made grown men blush. This was my favourite quality about her; she was often inappropriate, but never boring.    In short, she was the last person I expected to learn was asexual. While I knew she had no reason to lie, I confess that my first reaction was not acceptance, but skepticism.  So my natural follow-up question was:  How do you know for sure?  How to Disappear Completely To this day, ‘how do you know’ is perhaps the question that plagues the asexual community, or ‘ace’ for short. To openly address it is to run the risk of being ridiculed or dismissed.  Asexual women are typically written off as frigid and repressed. Asexual men, on the other hand, are laughed at. They have failed the unspoken test of what it means to be a ‘real man’, which perversely, means having the innate desire to fuck anything that moves. The implication here being that there’s something wrong with the asexual. That at some point in their life, something must’ve damaged them. That this can’t be who they really are. While many in the LGBTQ+ community experience similar prejudices, the asexual struggle stands apart. This is because the lack of intrinsic sexual desire can never be ‘proven’ or ‘shown’ to the outside observer, so it’s often conflated with social factors like a repressed childhood or simply not having met the right person. By contrast, when a gay or lesbian brings home a partner of the same sex, or when a transgender individual chooses to undergo hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery, these are all observable facts. Whatever our prejudice, we can’t deny the commitment.   Asexuality, on the other hand, is like Schrodinger’s cat. From the outside, we can’t know whether the cat in the box is dead or alive. Only the cat knows.   Which is why asexuals are arguably the hardest group for even reasonable people to accept. Some don’t believe asexuals exist in the first place. It’s a fake. Yet another fancy label the strawberry generation made up just to get more attention.  In essence, the asexual’s struggle is the minority’s struggle writ large: because to truly accept a person, we have to learn to see them first. But how do we ‘see’ someone whose sexuality is defined by its absence? Linda’s Story “I think I’m on a different wavelength from most Singaporeans I know,” said Linda, an asexual Singaporean who was born and raised in Singapore, and now resides in the United States.  “But timeline-wise, I have had a very conventional Chinese Singaporean high-achiever life.”  For Linda, doubts about her sexuality started creeping in during secondary school/JC, when puberty hit.  Like many others in the LGBTQ community, it starts with the realisation that there’s a disconnect between external appearances and your inner reality. It’s a vague feeling that’s hard to put your finger on. To further complicate matters, it can be difficult to distinguish whether this feeling is part of the normal confusion of puberty or something that’s separate and distinct.   “One very distinct memory for me is around 15 or 16, hearing a friend saying “(this celebrity) is so HAWT” and me not knowing how to respond to that,” said Linda. “I felt like she was talking about something that I couldn’t access at all.” A few years later, Linda stumbled upon the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) community online.  “The moment I read their FAQ page a lightbulb went off,” said Linda. “And I knew, deeply and instinctively, that I had found something that described me in some way.” At this point in our interview, I could already anticipate the skepticism from some readers. Who’s to say that the FAQ didn’t warp her views, causing her to stray from the ‘normal’ path of sexual development? This is an argument offered by some conservative groups, who believe that Singaporean youth are being corrupted by dangerous foreign ideas.  Of course, there’s also an irony to this line of reasoning. Because what exactly makes the traditional mindset on sex so healthy and normal?   Growing up in Singapore, Linda got the sense that abstinence-only sex education and chastity/modesty culture has led a lot of young adults to becoming strangely obsessed with sex in sometimes unhealthy ways. These issues are often left unresolved as they enter university and into the working world.  “The major misconception about asexuality is that we’re sexually repressed,” said Linda. “Believe me, I have been checking to see if this is just a phase for about a decade now.” It would have saved her a lot of stress and heartache. Because to come out as asexual to family and friends is to open yourself up to unsolicited advice and questions, ranging from the well-intentioned to the disturbing: The most common response that Linda gets is that this is just a phase. Others have suggested the possibility that she’s a closeted lesbian who’s forcing herself to be with men. One friend jokingly proposed corrective rape.  ”Needless to say, we are no longer friends,” said Linda.   But like most people, Linda still longs for a romantic life partnership. What she wants is not so different from the norm: marriage (or equivalent), family, romantic gestures, and the works. So if what she wants is the same as everyone else, why is her asexuality even an issue?  The answer is simple: there’s more to a functional relationship/marriage than just keeping up appearances. If finding a compatible partner is hard enough in traditional relationships, being asexual makes it that much harder.  “I would say that asexuality has impacted my dating life significantly and negatively,” said Linda.  “Feeling ‘unwanted’ or like your partner is ‘neutral’ is, of course, a great way to turn off any attraction a non-asexual partner might have towards you.”  This is why some asexuals limit their dating pool exclusively to those who also fall on the asexual spectrum. Others pursue romantic bonds with non-asexuals, but allow their partners to fulfill their sexual needs outside of their partnership.  “It certainly narrows the dating pool available to you because I don’t feel that primal need to come on to another person.”  Without broader understanding of asexuality as an orientation, it can be hard for asexuals to find their bearings, intensifying their feeling of isolation.  “Back when I was using dating apps, I had my profile set up to show me matches from anywhere in the world,” said Linda.  It came back with only five matches.   A Case For Labels Linda identifies as 99% asexual and demisexual. This means that while she has no intrinsic sexual desire (asexual), she is not averse to having sex once a deep emotional connection has been formed (demisexual).  “While I enjoy having the option of having sex as a way to deepen an intimate bond with someone I love, the reality is that there’s a 90% chance that sex is never going to be something critical to me in a relationship.”   For many in the ace community, these labels and definitions are essential. They serve as reference points for asexuals to communicate their experience—while at the same time acknowledging that there are various shades of gray.  “In the end I see these as useful labels for helping a partner understand me,” she explained. “They have been also not-so-useful at times as well, as they don’t capture the fluidity and openness of how I feel about sex.” For members of the older generation, this proliferation of sexual orientations, spectrums and pronouns is a lot to take in at once. The first impulse might be to dismiss these out of hand. Is there even a need for such labels? Can’t we all just identify as human beings?  This is the Catch-22 for many minority groups. For the asexual community in particular, to abandon all labels is to become unmoored, to lose a common language to talk about their experiences with each other and convey that invisible feeling to others. Yet to champion these labels is to create new vectors to be ridiculed and attacked. To be ‘woke’ is to draw backlash to ‘woke culture.’ Similarly, ‘critical race theory’ has drawn an equally strong backlash from venues like Zaobao, who ironically parrot U.S. right wing talking points in erecting CRT as a straw man against liberal ‘snowflakes’ and foreign influence. These are the ways that language and politics lock things down. It takes what is complex and turns it into a series of talking points and jargon. Its goal is to preemptively shut down conversations that challenge the norm. But it is the exclusive privilege of the majority to eschew labels and definitions. Examples of our normalness are all around us. Everything from media portrayals to education to government policies are designed to validate the ‘correctness’ of our identity and life choices. What the asexual community illustrates is that having a language of your own is not just a preference for minorities, but a matter of survival, without which, their experiences would disappear into the realm of the shapeless, the unseen, and the unspoken.   More Than Words  If we made the effort, it’s not that hard to relate to the asexual community’s feeling of loneliness and isolation. Most of us probably harbour a secret that we find difficult to share with even those who are closest to us—for fear of being ridiculed or dismissed. Some of us will keep it bottled up inside, and for the rest of our lives, we’ll carry it like a weight around our necks. This feeling may not have a clear outline, and words may be insufficient, but at the same time, it’s quite fundamental to everything that makes us human. Despite the noise and trolls, civil society in Singapore is slowly moving in a positive direction. Just as we now know that the ‘power of positive thinking’ will not cure our depression, many have come around to the idea that homosexuality and transgenderism are not lifestyle choices. Instead of intellectualising serious issues away or erecting strawmen to shield ourselves from discomfort, what the asexual community can teach us is how to listen, reciprocate, and reflect. Maybe then we can all attain the liberating feeling of finally being seen.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

17,"Meet Beckie, The Swimwear Designer Who Left Singapore For the Surf Life in Bali",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-meet-beckie-swimwear-designer-left-singapore-surf-life-bali/,"Culture, People","Immigration has become a hot topic in recent months. But thus far, the discussion has largely centered around foreigners that choose to come to Singapore. But what about the other side of the picture? In this ‘Singaporeans Abroad’ series, we share with you the stories of locals who—thanks to living in a globalised world—have found success in different corners of the globe, whether financially, romantically, or for the pure joy of adventure.  Recently, we met Jane, the insurance agent who gave up her career, marriage, and condo to be a digital nomad and Weihui, the Singaporean working with refugees in Syria.  Now, we bring you Beckie, the NUS communications & new media graduate who created a sustainable swimwear brand and surfs for Team SG in Bali. This is how she fell in love with the sand, the slow life, and created the sea-sterhood.  Some part of me always knew that the traditional expectation of a ‘good life’ in Singapore wouldn’t fulfil me. I studied communications and new media in NUS, and for a while, I followed what everyone else was doing: I did some internships and tried out the office lifestyle. My parents didn’t place a lot of pressure on me, but I was very influenced by my peers and their choices. I got caught up in the stress of securing the next best opportunity.  When I was younger, I watched a lot of Lilo and Stitch. I was drawn to the slow pace of island life, so I spent some time in Bali when I finished my O Levels to experience that peacefulness. There, I discovered surfing and it clicked. On the water, I just felt free. It’s meditative to be away from your screen for two hours, studying the waves and tuning your body to the rhythm of the ocean. It’s an experience that you literally can’t find in Singapore because there are no waves.  In my second year of university, I knew that a 9-5 wouldn’t give me the purpose I felt while I surfed. So, I started to make a plan for what my life in Bali could look like. Obviously, an office job wouldn’t facilitate the freeness I desired, so I started designing swimwear for surfers. I stayed up until 2 or 3 AM working on new styles and figuring out what patterns and materials would look good, but also stayed put while catching a wave. I never felt tired or burnt out, because I was deeply passionate about this venture. I felt hopeful, actually.  In Bali, I found a production company which shared my vision of sustainability and lean business practices.  This was a difficult process, because I wanted to make sure we could produce quality products in small quantities. Finally, I found the right person who took a chance on my vision for Haikini. We’re a fully e-commerce company, and the pouches which hold our products are made from repurposed dead-stock fabrics. We don’t use any plastic in our packaging. To reduce our waste, we take pre-orders and custom orders, then produce according to the demand.  I think my love for surfing and swimwear helped Haikini to take off, because I wanted to foster a sense of community in tandem with the business. I’m in touch with my customers, and we call each other seasters, aka sea-sisters. In 2019, I hosted a surf camp, where I taught some girls from Singapore how to surf and showed them the spoils of island life. It was an amazing experience. I got to know their aspirations and dreams. Many of them started side projects after this experience, and I’m happy that I helped facilitate that by showing them the surfing culture in Bali.  I felt lonely at the start of my surf journey. In those days, it was pretty rare to see a girl on the water. It’s definitely a male-dominated sport. Part of my mission with sharing my life in Bali and creating Haikini is to encourage more women to join the sport. It’s empowering to stand up on a wave, and it helped me feel more confident in my body. However, I’ve noticed that men can be aggressive on the water. There’s surf-etiquette, and I always joke with my girlfriends that this etiquette is better performed when girls are in the line-up.  Just last week I was surfing with some girls on an island off Bali, and there were two guys who kept cutting in front of us to catch the waves. There were only five of us there in total, and they refused to practice the surf-etiquette, which is quite rude. I’ve learned to be more assertive when I’m in the line-up and waiting to catch a wave. I feel nervous, almost like I have to prove that girls can surf too. This feeling propelled me to compete in the SEA games and represent Singapore in 2019.  That experience was exhilarating, but incredibly stressful. Which is kind of ironic, right? Surfing is supposed to be peaceful. But it’s still a sport which requires a high level of skill. It’s difficult to get funding for a new sport, and to be honest, I didn’t receive any when I was representing Singapore. I chose to invest in a coach, so that I could be prepared for the competition. I even went to the competition site a month early to learn the waves. I had a lot of breakdowns at that time, because Haikini was still growing, and I was having to spend so much on training. I remember telling my friends: “I don’t know how this is going to turn out.”  Ultimately, I’m proud of my performance. I was so close to winning the bronze in the Philippines, but unfortunately, I didn’t make it. Next time I’ll train harder. It also meant a lot to compete as the first female longboard surfer. Since this sport is an integral part of my life, it doesn’t feel daunting to put in the work to improve. Unfortunately, there were no games in 2020. But I can’t wait for the next opportunity to represent Team SG. I felt so proud holding the flag, because we were the only competitors who came from a country with no surf.  I’ve learned some life lessons through surfing. A few weeks ago I was trying to master this trick. The thing about surfing is that every wave is different, so you have to be patient and find the right moment to do a trick like a nose ride or a hang five. Throughout this session, I tried so hard to force the trick and it didn’t work. During a break, I realized: Why am I trying to force this? I can’t control how the waves break. If there’s no opportunity to do a trick, I can’t do anything about that. When I got back on the water, I stopped trying to force it. Finally, I managed to do it. There’s a lot of things in life that you can’t force. It’s not always about going with the flow, but working with what you have the best that you can. This relates to COVID as well. What can I do about COVID? I can’t change the external factors. But within myself, I can try my best to work with what I’ve got.  In Bali, I try to embody this lesson. It would be hard to maintain this attitude in Singapore. When I come back, I remember why I left, although I do love visiting my family and friends. It’s so fast paced, I feel that I’m never doing enough. I have friends who thrive in this environment but it doesn’t work for me. There’s a comparison mindset, where we’re encouraged to replicate the success of others. I think often you’ll see someone else’s triumph and think: I want exactly what they have. But in that thought process, there’s not much room to dream.  What do you actually want to achieve, what hobby or practice fills you up?  I’ve modeled my business and my life in Bali around this question. Even when I was pressured to do an internship and follow the corporate path, I kept my true passion at the front of my mind. Then, I made an action plan. A lot of people message and ask me how to replicate my life. But what I really want to advise them to do, is to take stock of what gives them a sense of purpose. I think people are drawn to the freeness I’ve found, not the exact circumstances I have. Unfortunately, I can’t tell anyone how to do exactly what I did. When it comes down to it, you’ve got to put yourself in a position where you have no option but to follow your own path.  If you’re not happy in your job or your relationship, you can change that. Of course, it doesn’t happen immediately. For some people with a lot of resources, it might be easier to accomplish. I was forced to make this work because I left myself with no other option: I had to build a company to support myself and pursue island life. Before I moved to Bali, I spent a few years shoring up my ability to do this. I don’t think that uprooting your life will solve any problems. Think deeply about what makes you happy, and work around that. A change in circumstance is not a magic wand.  With that being said, there’s power in taking a leap of faith. In general, I think Singaporeans are overly focused on having a ‘safety net’. We’re taught to think of the worst case scenario and be very risk averse. I struggle with being risk averse myself. Sometimes, I get scared of investing a certain amount of money for Haikini’s marketing or logistics. This thought echoes in my mind: What if I lose it all? Everything I have right now could go away. But, I’ve found that the greatest things happen when you surrender to the process. Serendipity can only be found in the unexpected.  For example, when I first came to Bali I went through a breakup. I was a bit bruised, but still, I was open to finding a connection with someone. Randomly, I started searching through mutual friends on Facebook and found this surfer who I thought was really attractive. I added him and forgot all about it. A few weeks later, I ventured to this beach where the competition is really tough and the surfers can be hostile. I was in the line-up for a wave and I noticed this guy in front of me: I saw his back and his hair and thought he was good looking. Then, he turned around and said “Are you Beckie?” It was the same guy I added on Facebook.  We met in February 2020, and we’ve been together ever since. He’s half American and half Indonesian, and he came to Bali to enjoy the surf and the slow life. We spend three days a week apart to maintain our independence, which I think is important, so that we still cultivate our separate identities. It’s been so easy and natural with him, and we’re very well suited to each other. None of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t surrendered to the process and made room for serendipity in my life.  My grandmother still asks me when I’m going to come home and get an office job. But I’d rather see where the slow life takes me. My day-to-day life is fulfilling. Depending on the tides, I catch a surf in the morning for a few hours, then go for lunch, visit my production house and work on a new bikini design in the afternoon, then I end the day walking my dog on the beach at sunset. It’s a low maintenance lifestyle, and it’s fairly easy to live comfortably in Bali for a fraction of the cost-of-living in Singapore.  Though I don’t feel called to go home, I’ve found a community of Singaporeans in Bali. Most of them are not surfers: some own restaurants, do personal training, or build villas. I have to do a lot of code-switching, because Singlish can be hard to understand, so it’s nice to have people to lah and lor with. This connection to home while I’m away is valuable. At the end of the day, we’re all following the path of experiencing something different and searching for a purpose. That’s what binds us.

18,This Is What Girlfriends-For-Hire Really Think Of Their Male Clients,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-this-is-what-girlfriends-for-hire-really-think-of-their-male-clients/,"Culture, People","Top image: Erika. Photography by Thaddeus J Loh for RICE Media.  This story is not affiliated with, or sponsored by, Maybe.sg.  On a rainy January afternoon, Erika paced up and down Victoria Street looking for a hotel where she was expected by her date. She didn’t know much about him, only that he was wearing a dark blue shirt. She hadn’t even seen a photo of him or been told his name. Naturally, her nerves were starting to kick in. This was her first time using Maybe.sg, a platform that, according to its website, gives you access to a range of personalities for on-demand social experiences. While clients can pick a girl (or guy) for a date, their information won’t be shared with them until they arrive at the meet-up point.  Upon entering the hotel and approaching the restaurant, Erika was greeted by a receptionist who asked her who her date was.  “I haven’t met him yet,” she responded, held back by the question. The awkward encounter was quickly interrupted when Erika’s date recognised her and brought her to his table.  It was awkward at first, Erika described, because “we were just not on the same wavelength.” But a bottle of wine later, the conversation was flowing smoothly. “It was like hanging out with an uncle,” she said, referring to how Maybe’s no-touching policy keeps the dates friendly and casual.  The Growing Demand For Girlfriend Experiences Erika is one of the many new sign ups Maybe.sg has seen since the pandemic started. A Maybe representative told me that there has been a drastic increase in clients, and speculates that the boredom from being stuck in Singapore has led to more men and women looking for people to enjoy recreational activities with.  For Erika, there’s a very practical reason why she joined Maybe: acting is her passion, and the platform offers her a more flexible way of earning side income as compared to a 9-6 job. Especially during COVID, stable sources of income are harder to find.  Chrissy, another Maybe girl I interviewed, said that the platform is a way for her to gain professional guidance while earning extra income. So far, she has met men who have taught her about trading, crypto currencies, public speaking, and who have even told her they would help her network and invest in any businesses she wants to start.  What Do These Men Truly Want? While there have been a minority of clients who have made uncomfortable propositions, both Erika and Chrissy said that the vast majority are “really sweet.” Generally, the archetype is a post-break up man who needs a listening ear, or one who has been single for many years and is craving a sense of intimacy with someone.  Erika recalled meeting a guy who asked her if she would be willing to make an arrangement with him to offer the ‘girlfriend experience.’ “He said he just wanted someone to hold when he dances,” Erika recalled.  But by far, the most memorable date for Erika was when a divorced man with two kids invited her to  the Wild Wild Wet water park. At first, she thought it was a ploy to get her in a bikini, prompting her to wear a long sleeve surf shirt with swim shorts. But on the date, she found out the man had very different motives.  “I chose Wild Wild Wet because I used to come here with my kids and I really miss it. None of my friends want to come with me,” he said.  While Chrissy told me about various dates that consisted of visiting upscale restaurants where expensive sushi and red wine were ordered, it’s the men who were vulnerable that she still remembers today.  One of these dates came as a surprise when she saw she was invited to a bak kut teh restaurant by a man in his early thirties. They spoke a bit and he opened up to her about his ex-girlfriend, after eventually just asking her if they could play chess.  “I don’t think he wanted anything but company and someone to hang out with,” Chrissy said. “So we played chess for most of the two hours. It was so wholesome.” The Role Mainstream Dating Apps Play In Pushing Men To The Fringes The modern world of online dating has made matchmaking a superficial ordeal. On apps like Tinder and Bumble, users choose potential dates based off of a select set of profile photos and a short biography. Naturally, appearance is the main deciding factor—followed by career, and fun facts about the person. While this format works for some, it leaves out a portion of people who may not benefit from the way dating apps emphasize the importance of looks.  “With dating apps, like Tinder, you need to be somewhat attractive, or young, to find matches in that circle,” Chrissy said. “And if you’re not, it’s going to be harder for you.” In one of Maybe’s first promotional videos from 2019, this cycle is perfectly exemplified. The video starts with Cedric and Aloysius, two good friends since young. Cedric is athletic and is presented to be more attractive, while Aloysius is described as a “geek who prefers to stay at home.” Both friends swipe on a dating app together, but only Cedric gets any matches. “I swipe swipe swipe so many times, one match also cannot get,” Aloysius complains. “Life is unfair sometimes,” Cedric responds. Aloysius deletes the dating app from his phone, but his eyes light up as he mutters “Maybe” under his breath. A few minutes pass and an attractive young girl walks towards the two. Cedric prepares himself to greet the date he assumes is his, but to his surprise, she is there to meet Aloysius instead. It’s a continuous cycle: men try to find companionship online, but this fails, eventually pushing them to turn to hiring girls online instead.  “Sometimes I think about how lonely they must be to have to hire somebody for companionship,” Erika shared. “Some of them are not the society standard of attractive, so it lowers their chances of finding somebody.” “I have friends who are in relationships with people they didn’t find physically attractive at first. But they fell in love with them because of their personalities when they met. Now, with how the dating world is changing, this is happening less and less. There’s less opportunity for showing your personality.”  Does The Paid Girlfriend Experience Help These Men? When Chrissy and Erika told me about the lonely men who turned to Maybe after failed attempts with other apps, I struggled to consider it a viable solution.  If they can’t find love on mainstream apps, do apps like Maybe not just reinforce the idea that they will never find love unless they pay for it? And while this is not the fault of Maybe girls—they are just supplying a service there is a demand for—it does raise some important societal questions.  In the long term, what is the impact on these men who know that their dates were only nice to them because they were paid? “Look, I know this isn’t a real date,” one client told Erika. “I know I’m not your type. I called you because I was bored and lonely.”  Hearing men say this only reinforces Erika’s belief that an app like Maybe is good. She told me that because she is open about her social escorting gigs on social media, she gets a lot of responses from followers online. Of which, some have told her how grateful they are for apps like Maybe because it gives them the option to pay for someone to hang out with rather than be completely alone.  Erika admitted that on paid dates, there is a lot of acting involved. At the end of the day, she needs to deliver a service—a fun, enjoyable time—which doesn’t always come naturally depending on the person in front of her.  “But it’s also not always sad and lonely guys. It can be super fun,” Erika reassured me. “Some of them really just want a bigger group of people, so they hire more to join, that’s it.” For example, some rich men want to fill out their yachts. Others just want more buddies to drink with.  “What is the bigger issue for me is the judgment we get,” Erika confessed. “We get comments saying that renting a buddy is just PG-13 prostituion. So many people think women on Maybe are just tools, but it’s not like that at all.” Have any tip offs on stories we should cover? Tell us at community@ricemedia.co.

19,The Digital Future Is Now: How The Pandemic Has Re-Energised Local Theatre,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-online-theatre-pandemic-evolution-change-community-digital/,"Culture, Life","Top Image: 3 Cups of Kopi If there is one thing that has really irked me during this pandemic, it’s the assumption that our theatre industry has met its demise. Things like live performances and exhibitions may not be feasible in these trying times, but a closer and more nuanced investigation into the heart of our theatre scene reveals that it is anything but going extinct. Despite the struggles and challenges posed by the pandemic, local theatre has been taking these obstacles in good stride. Companies have continued experimenting with ways to adapt their works, and upgrade their skills to push out pieces that will not only tide through this difficult period, but will also remain relevant post-pandemic. Case in point: 3 Cups of Kopi, a group that specialises in Playback Theatre—an applied form of theatre where participants are invited to share their personal stories and have trained actors play back the different emotions, thoughts, and feelings associated with the story—has found innovative ways to incorporate their art form into the online medium of Zoom.  In essence, an online version of Playback Theatre generally operates in the following manner: after inviting a participant to tell their story, the facilitator summarises it and signals for the actors to begin performing. Using common household items such as pots and pans, small whiteboard markers, and even zoom filters, the emotions and thoughts that accompany the participant’s story are represented by the actors and “played back” to the audience. The entire experience is quite surreal indeed, bringing to life an almost invisible, untold layer of the story that imbues it with new meaning and empathetic connection.  While this is certainly somewhat different from how Playback Theatre would function in person, it by no means points towards the inferiority of online theatre. To start, it helps to recognise that online theatre is more than just a substitute for live performances. It is a completely different medium that has its own unique ability to bring people together and touch the lives of many.  Certainly, having a physical process, such as purchasing a ticket from a booth, entering into a space guided by an usher, perusing an itinerary, and even exiting the space after the performance is over may be valuable to the overall experience of theatre. However, while this is understandably important in establishing a sense of ritual and ambience for the performance, who’s to say that these acts of ritual and process cannot take place online?  Offstage 3.0, a production by Emergency Stairs, incorporated this very line of inquiry into its performance. Using multimedia tools such as laptops, phones, and live-streamed videography, the performance, which was performed online in December 2020, sought to challenge the need for a physical presence in arranging a theatrical production. This was just one of the many innovative ways that theatre companies have adopted a fairly optimistic perspective when dealing with the pandemic.  They’ve seen it as a catalyst for innovative change rather than a circumstantial hindrance. Online and digital theatre has become increasingly common as a result of the pandemic. As technology continues to upgrade itself over time and change the way we live and interact with one another, so does theatre reflect this dynamism in its dramaturgy and style. With the spotlight being drawn towards avant-garde theatre companies such as New York-based experimental theatre company The Wooster Group, which specialises in multimedial performance and digitalisation, the rise in technology as a whole as pivoted our focus towards what is particularly relevant to us – which oftentimes takes the form of technology as a whole. In essence, the times have been, and are always changing. What the pandemic has done effectively to catalyse this move forward for all of us. While this transit may have been unexpectedly sudden, it is nothing completely unforeseen. Theatre groups in the past have been dabbling with the incorporation of new forms of technology into their performances, and will continue doing so even after the pandemic blows over.  As our local theatre scene embarks on this journey of reformation and evolution, the last thing they need right now is for audiences to shun their digital works, and mistakenly trivialising them as being inferior copies of the real.  Here are three reasons why we should celebrate this rise of online theatre. 1. Accessibility Holding a performance in an online format has the significant benefit of allowing more and more people to access these performances from the comfort of their own home. This is especially important when we consider things such as individuals with physical disabilities, together with well, just the thought of having to physically travel down to watch something.  Clicking on a Zoom link and participating in an online performance from one’s own home makes online theatre and performance far more accessible than it otherwise would have been pre-covid. The migration of theatre towards the online form also allows for participants to attend workshops and performances from all over the world, as long as their time zones match, of course. Participants not only enjoy a greater diversity of online shows to choose from, they also become part of a global community of audience members when participating in online performances. In effect, a global tapestry of theatre is sewn together as a result of this unprecedented level of accessibility.  
You can’t help but be changed by so many stories that are being told and shared at the same time, because now [theatre] is everywhere
 By allowing for a greater diversity of audienceship as well as performance groups, theatre productions experience an unprecedented range of views, expectations, and awareness as a whole. To learn more about the community’s perspective of diversity in moving towards the online format, I spoke to Michael Cheng, the artistic director of Tapestry Playback Theatre and Adjunct Lecturer at Singapore Polytechnic. He explains that this diversity is necessary in communicating an even greater sense of empathy and connection with groups of people we may not otherwise have the opportunity to engage with on an ordinary basis:  “I would have Palestenian friends, Arab friends, so on and so forth,” he says.  “And you think about how politics has impacted lives, and how many different perspectives there are. Yet I can choose to say that every one of those views are valid because they are the realities for each of these individuals.”  “It just makes you appreciate how complicated situations, moments, and politics can be. But at the same time it impacts individuals, and that’s where I think a lot of us need to be more aware that things are rarely so black and white. There are always more sides to the story.”  For most of us, theatre is about bringing people together. It’s about sharing stories, experiences, and perspectives with one another. It’s about community building. If we accept that all of these are important to theatre, then surely it is through this transition to the online form that we better achieve this greater diversity where perspectives and opinions all across the world are shared and embraced.  2. Affordability This is the part that some of us may be the most concerned with. Yes, shows and performances have mostly become more affordable and cheaper with the migration towards online platforms. Performance groups and troupes are able to save on things such as securing physical venues for rehearsals and the actual performances, as well as the additional logistical support that comes with hosting a live performance.  Gone are the days where expensive lighting and sound equipment had to be rented or even bought to facilitate performances. This inevitably means that ticket prices are considerably cheaper than before, which only serves to make attending an online performance an affordable and meaningful way to spend your weekend nights. More importantly, being able to save on venues and physical logistics also means that performance groups are able to invest more time and resources in continually being innovative and finding new and creative ways to execute their performances. Expenditure on things like skills upgrading workshops for performers to accommodate the new online format for instance, are now more accessible to even smaller theatre companies.  By investing in IT skills upgrading and proficiency, theatre companies are not only able to find more creative ways to express their art over the online form, but are also able to future-proof their performances for the long run. Online theatre will not be going away even after the pandemic tides over, and these skills will ensure that their art remains relevant and up to date for the long haul.  3. Interactivity and Intimacy While arguably the most controversial aspect of online theatre, with many criticising the form for its lack of personal connection and feeling, perhaps a more nuanced discussion on this needs to be had to explore this further.  In the same way that performance groups rely upon a certain ritual (be it curtain calls, physical gestures, or even setting a particular ambience) in order to create a sense of connection with their audience members, online theatre brings with it its own set of processes and facilitation techniques to re-create this sense of ritual, and bring the heart of the performance to its audiences.  
Some of us are holding onto the perspective that online theatre is a temporary substitute. But really, a lot of us are also enjoying the online platform because there’s so many opportunities now.
 3 Cups of Kopi for instance, in holding their online playback performances, still preserve the ritualistic aspects of ice-breaking activities, physical warm-ups and use of key words such as “let’s watch” that are all integral to their art form. These are all necessary steps in order for a firm emotional connection to be established with their audiences to facilitate the sharing of personal stories and experiences, which forms the backbone of their performances.  Especially in interactive performances that require participants to speak up and interact with the room, doing so in a physical space with people around you may be daunting for some. This pressure and fear is often assuaged when one is behind a computer screen. Having attended a live Playback performance in the past, I can attest to the fact that speaking up in front of a crowd about my own personal story can be incredibly intimidating. However, when attending an online version of the performance recently, I found myself more willing to share. The fact that the facilitator also requested other participants who were not sharing their story to turn off their view cameras also helped create a more intimate and personal experience between myself and the performers alone. Some online Playback Theatre groups have even opted to incorporate technology as means of ensuring greater interactivity with handicapped or disabled groups. Take Karnataka-based Playback group YoursTrulyTheatre for instance, who are currently embarking on a performance project catered to the visually-handicapped community. With the transition to the online platform, they are now able to use applications such as Clubhouse, which allows for audio-only discussions to take place, creating conducive spaces for members of the community to participate and engage in the performance.  Ultimately, ensuring intimacy and engagement still boils down to ensuring that the basics are done right, and that facilitation methods are kept relevant and meaningful to all participants and audiences. The Way Forward Online and digital theatre as a whole is nothing new. Performance groups all across the world have long been incorporating the virtual space as a core part of their shows; hybrid or otherwise. The only thing that has really changed is the surge of this very genre and the necessary transition towards it.  While the pandemic has indeed been difficult on our local arts scene, it is perhaps through the efforts of groups like 3 Cups of Kopi and T:> Works, who will be hosting their online exhibition and performance Festival of Women N.O.W 2021, which begins on the 13th of July, that we observe how the pandemic has actually been a period of critical evolution and change for our local arts scene. You can find out more about T:> Works’ upcoming works and projects here.  While the transition towards the online form undeniably brings with it its own unique set of challenges, there is an optimism that these groups carry with them that truly exemplifies the undying spirit of our local theatre scene.   This is a period of tumultuous change and uncertainty. The specific requirements that go into instrumentalising the online platform as a medium for performance may indeed be challenging, but this is precisely also what demands our respect for the form—that this is far from being a temporary and inferior substitute to live theatre. Rather, it is a unique genre on its own that boasts distinct benefits, charms, and poise. By embracing this major transition towards the digital, theatre groups all across Singapore ensure not only their survival during this trying period, but also guarantee their relevance as technology continues to evolve and alter our expectations and attitudes towards life in general.  Performances that incorporate advanced technology such as augmented reality and virtual reality have been on the rise over the past decade all across the world, and artists have been continuously finding new and innovative ways to express their art with changing mediums that grant increasingly diverse opportunities. We need to carry this optimism forward within our local communities in receiving the works of performance groups who take the bold leap forward.  Their undying spirit for evolution and change is the torch that lights the way forward, piercing through the miasma of the pandemic and bringing the future to us. We ought to be there with them as they do so. Do you think going online is the future of our local theatre scene? Tell us what you think at community@ricemedia.co Author © 2020 Rice Media.

20,"Oh Nothing, Just Me and My Mum Trying Out Vulva Care Products Together",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-me-and-my-mum-trying-out-vulva-care-products-together/,"Culture, Life, Sponsored","Photography by Zachary Tang. These days, talking about our bodies isn’t as taboo as it was anymore. Even in conservative Asian cultures such as ours, we’ve shifted towards franker discussions of our relationship with sexuality and self. In our ‘Intimates’ series, we’d like to kickstart open conversations about the wellness of our private parts—in both the physical and psychological sense. In this piece, we explore the perspectives of a mother and daughter on femininity and self-love… through the art of vulva care. “Mama, it’s okay if you don’t want to, but do you want to do an experimental article with me? The story will feature you… and our opinions on trying vulva care products together.” Sitting in a restaurant with my family, I expect some resistance from my mum. Even though she’s down to talk to me about anything, she prefers to keep private discussions, well, private.  She breaks into a cheeky grin and says: “Why not?”  My mother and I talk about everything — and I really mean everything. I could only ask her to take part in this unusually intimate story over dinner because that’s far from strange in my household.  To put things into perspective, here are some of my family’s casual conversation topics: shaving, butt hair, and douching.  But simply talking about vaginas brings on the giggles, so holding discussions about vulva care products are bound to be awkward. Right? I put that to the test by spending some quality time with my mum while trying out TWO L(I)PS products together. The TWO L(I)PS Experiment Even as someone who writes about fitness, wellness, and lifestyle for a living, I have to be honest — I’ve never really been that familiar with vulva care products until I got this assignment. Never have I given deep thought about treating the skin below the belt any different than the rest of my body.  As a fitness nut who’s always breaking a sweat though, I totally get it. The exterior areas of female genitals — the vaginal lips, the vaginal opening, inner thighs and the flesh over your pubic bone — are highly sensitive areas. Granted, the vagina is a “self-cleaning oven”, but the external bits (i.e. the vulva) do need to be kept clean and washed regularly.  There needs to be a delicate balance though. Neglect the area? A build-up of sweat, bacteria, dead skin can nestle in the folds of the vulva. Clean the area too much? It might strip your skin’s natural oils away or disrupt its pH balance. This can lead to dryness, skin irritation and other discomforts. In the cross-junction of maintaining this balance sits vulva care products that are formulated with an optimal pH range for skin on your vulva. Like TWO L(I)PS, for example.  TWO L(I)PS, as its name cheekily/cleverly suggests, has something to do with the female nether regions. The company touts itself as the “world’s first luxury intimate care range” and that’s evident from the array of products — balms, cleansers, scrubs, serums — meant solely to give vulvas a five-star skincare treatment.  I mean, just looking at the range of goods available on the TWO L(I)PS website was overwhelming enough. Who knew that our external genitals needed such TLC?  There’s a prebiotic range to feed the skin on your vulva the nutrients it needs while keeping pH values perfectly balanced (as all things should be). There’s a Vitamin C serum that brightens dull skin. There’s even an overnight repairing mask to leave on your intimates so your vulva can get nourished and restored while you rest.  Again, these are sensitive areas, so it was good to know that TWO L(I)PS products are gynaecologically and dermatologically tested and made free from sulphates and parabens. Honestly, that’s a load off me and my mum’s mind as we embarked on this intimate experiment together.  On Femininity Everyone tells me I’m a carbon copy of my mother but I’m sure she disagrees. She was a lot less coarse and liberal in her twenties, she often says.  While we do have our fair share of ideological differences there is one unequivocal physical similarity: We both have vaginas. I remember telling my mum I couldn’t wait for my periods to be permanently over. She was horrified, because “a woman blossoms with the arrival of menstruation and it’s a gift to be fertile”. During her time, Asian society and culture dictated that a woman’s main priority is motherhood.  As we move away from that conservative mindset, starting a family is now met with more hesitance. With the increase in economic competitiveness, cost of living, and global warming, many women are (understandably) postponing motherhood.  Our pick of period products echoes our upbringing, too. Like everyone else, I was introduced to pads and pantyliners, but I fell in love with the convenience of menstrual cups.  While some people shy away from internal sanitary products, the application or insertion of period products doesn’t matter to me — what’s important is that it works. Converting to a menstrual cup was a no-brainer because I no longer need to worry about period stains, constantly changing sanitary pads, or making sure the bathroom is stocked with pads. My mum, however, remains unconvinced about shoving anything up there, so she’s sticking to pads. Until menopause hits, that is. Regarding hair on intimate areas, I only tried shaving because my mum taught me to.  Her traditional mindset makes itself visible when she tells me she feels weird showing her private parts to strangers. I’m much more liberal about the feminine area because I don’t think there’s anything pure or holy about it.  For me, it’s just another part of my body. But as a “no sex before marriage” and “I married my first boyfriend” kind of lady, my mum believes you should shelter your private parts as they should only be seen by your partner.  Even though both of us don’t use other hair removal methods, my reason for sticking with shaving is more practical — it’s the most painless, convenient, and cost-effective option. To be honest, my mum and I don’t do anything special for our vulvas. The only thing my mum does is use a feminine wash now and then. Me? I’m too lazy.  In my defence, I believe hygiene is the most important thing when it comes to vulva care so I keep my nether regions clean by wiping from front to back, ensuring they’re dry after exercise, and opting for cotton undergarments whenever possible.  Yes, that’s pretty much the extent of our glamourous vulva care routines. Generational Self-Love As a busy mother of three, my mum has never really prioritised self-care. I, on the other hand, am all about that self-care life. I attend yoga classes every day, head down to the pool to journal every morning, and allocate some time to read before bed.  Many people in the older generation see self-care as indulgent and unnecessary, while those in the younger generation believe it’s vital to honour our bodies and take care of our mental health.  Despite this disparity in how we define taking care of ourselves, my mother and I have never tried any vulva care products.  We changed that by spending a relaxing Sunday evening giving TWO L(I)PS products a try together. We started with Blackout, the Activated Charcoal Mask, where my mum and I ended up in positions for prime birthing while we peered over our bellies to look at each other. Although the new experience put us in awkward positions that made us stare at each other’s vulvas, we did enjoy the hilariously intimate activity. We both love the smell and feel of the mask, and how refreshed we felt after using it.  For the rest of our bodies, we love the skin-soothing effect from Ice, the lightweight Calming Rescue Cream, and the hydrating whipped butter texture of Juice, the Prebiotic Body Balm. Both products earn bonus points because they are made for use on the face and body (and not just the vulva) which simplifies our self-care routine. I suppose it’s impossible to keep clean 24/7 because of (a) my active lifestyle and (b) Singapore’s hot and humid weather. But the difference in hygiene between the days before TWO L(I)PS arrived and after is positively palpable — I now realise how important vulva cleansers are in a woman’s arsenal of self-care products. Goodbye to rashes and weird bumps around my intimate area. Take it from me: give some love, care and attention to your privates even if you’re not feeling any discomfort down there. Vulva Vulnerability After a week of chatting about intimacy while trying out vulva care products together, honestly, I’ve never felt more comfortable and open with my mum.  Also, who knew that using vulva care products would feel so lush? Just one week of being on top of our hygiene and vulva care left our nether regions feeling fresh and smooth, without any sticky residue. Our vulvas have never felt better. It looks like vulva care will be a normal part of our daily routines now — a healthy habit that should transcend any generational misgivings. Although it’s no surprise that my mum and I see femininity and intimacy from different perspectives, it was enlightening to see how her generation’s conservative upbringing and environment created this dichotomy in how we treat our private parts.  Self-care and self-expression might not be familiar concepts for her and the rest of her generation — a generation that didn’t have the freedom, time or exposure to such notions. Though my mum found it strange that luxury intimate skincare products exist, she’s glad that women today have the opportunity to indulge in things like masks and serums made specifically for vulvas.  Opening the floor for vulva care discussions is empowering and change-making because many women have burning questions that go unanswered. If chatting about intimacy isn’t seen as taboo, women everywhere would be able to attend to their vulvas with more care and confidence. I’ve never been afraid to bring up sensitive topics when I’m with my mum, but now both of us recognise the behavioural norms that dictate our respective generations. Which makes communicating our different perspectives a lot easier.  Plus, we’ve literally stared at each other’s vulvas, so we don’t know what the word awkward means anymore.

21,A Snowflake’s Guide to Talking About Racism,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-snowflake-guide-racism/,"Commentary, Current Affairs","Rice file photo. There are some diseases you just can’t get vaccinated against. For instance, racism. Or at least the unwillingness to have an open discussion about race relations and the existence of ingrained cultural blindspots. Sure, it’s uncomfortable. But one of the major blocks towards reducing biases both unconscious and intentional is something called “conversation”. Why would anyone avoid it? Human beings have held conversations for centuries, and everyone’s better off from it.  Race relations in Singapore; now that’s a conversation we need to have after a few (extra) exhausting weeks for minorities here. And we already have—from our double standards in calling out racism to the need to shift the definition of Singapore’s take on racial harmony.  But now we need to talk about how a certain statutory board—established to promote social cohesion and multiracialism—dug itself a deeper hole after a recent oversight that saw a Malay couple’s wedding portrait reduced to a trite caricatural prop. How the organisation refused to engage further with the people they wronged and went on to invalidate their distress over the experience. How the organisation missed out on an opportunity to address the issue head-on, dismissing the chance to hear out the concerns of citizens they’re supposed to engage with.  We also need to talk about how a certain public figure probably made things worse. How the former political representative, lacking a sense of nuance, branded the wronged party (or anyone seeking open conversations) as unscrupulous. How he failed to see the irony in calling for grace while simultaneously telling someone to stop being an easily offended snowflake.  Folks like Alfian Sa’at and Firdaus Daud have already touched on the flaws of cherry-picking quotes and offered thorough analyses on what the government body got wrong with its response. What we’re offering on our end: three branches of a dialogue tree the next time government bodies, political figures or anyone else find themselves in a position where they have to issue a defensive statement about race relations. Since respecting racial diversity is such a “work-in-progress” in Singapore, these would eventually come in handy sometime. The Wrong, Chaotic Evil Path • “Stop rocking the boat to preserve our fragile racial harmony.” This is the most common take on social media. No matter how genuine the concern is, the importance of preserving the status quo outweighs uncomfortable discussions on racial relations. Often accompanied by callbacks to race riots in the ’60s.  • Utilise hostile, defensive language. “We reject”, “without basis,” “at any cost”. • Alternatively, passive-aggressiveness. “We find this odd.” “This is untrue.” • Explain away the racism or resort to semantics. “Let’s not go overboard and call this racism, this is more like insensitivity”. “It’s just a mistake what, move on”. • Play the devil’s advocate. Personal lived experiences need to be debated, apparently. • Shut down honest conversations by blaming it on Critical Race Theory, Cancel Culture or anything deemed as Western ideology. • Call people snowflakes. The Lawful Neutral • Cautiously acknowledge the matter at hand, offer broad recognition that Yes, This Is A Problem. • “We don’t have all the facts” or “I’m not at liberty to say”. Thereby relinquishing any need to take a position or a stance right now. It can wait until after investigations have concluded or after people have forgotten about it. • Form sentences that don’t really say anything specific. Offer overly general solutions that could fix any problem. Hope for the Barnum effect. • Evade talking about the deeper issue and make generic calls (for society, community, species, etc) to do better for one another. The Constructive, Neutral Good Road • Fully acknowledge the issue, follow through with a sincere, unconditional apology where needed. “We take full responsibility for the oversight.” No “sorry, but…” • Be open to criticism and be the bigger party/person, no matter if one feels personally attacked. Take the high ground and stay classy. • Display some sensitivity to the emotions of the affected minority party. Accept that blindspots exist and that nobody should brush off another’s experience when it comes to racial affronts. Understand why they feel that way. • Realise that racism is not binary. It’s not about deciding if the person/action should be deemed racist or limiting racism to typical acts of abuse, harassment, or violence. • Don’t make assumptions about hidden agendas. Don’t make assumptions at all. • Advance the conversation by opening the floor to others to have their say about their concerns, preferably IRL instead of written messages. Provide opportunities for them to share. Hear them out, not speak over them. • Actually put the things learned into practice and keep at it. Then perhaps diversity and inclusion wouldn’t be such a mountainous climb even after all these years. The point here is that you can’t push any constructive discussions forward if these incidents devolve into an argumentative skirmish that ends in a winner-loser situation. In the process of edging out the last word on the issue, the conservative party invalidates the other’s experiences just so they can stick to the safety of their current worldview. But for a proper, productive conversation to happen, we would need to start thinking instead about how we would want to be spoken to if we were on the other side of it. Would you want your experiences and emotions questioned and discredited? Or would a willingness to acknowledge, learn, and make amends establish the social cohesion and harmony to cure the ills of racism? Have something to say about snowflakes?

22,Gym Bros Are The Face Of Toxic Masculinity. True or False?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-gym-bros-are-the-face-of-toxic-masculinity-true-or-false/,"Culture, People","Photography by Marisse Caine. This is part two of a series of articles about Singaporean masculinity and how it is changing. In this episode we unpack whether gym bros are the face of toxic masculinity. We speak to fitness enthusiasts about their experience in the gym, exercising with other men, and their personal journeys with body confidence.  Gym regulars should be familiar with that type of gym bro. The one grunting excessively while curling heavy dumbbells, furiously dropping them on the floor upon reaching the end of his capacity. The one who walks around like they own the place, needing everyone to know he is the most jacked in town.  The moment I started this series on Singaporean Masculinity, I knew there was something to unpack about the gym, a place where men sometimes go to assert their dominance or masculinity.  At the same time, the reality is that the vast majority of men in gyms are not that kind of gym bro. They have personal goals, enjoy pushing their bodies, and genuinely want to improve their physical strength. But there is still something about gym environments—the judgmental stares from the ultra fit guys, the cliques, and the hogging of equipment—that can reek of toxic masculinity.  What do the men who live and breathe in these environments really think about it all?  “I started gymming when I was about 20 because I felt the pressure to look good and have big arms,” said 29-year-old fitness trainer Lokies Khan.  Lokies and I discussed how we both hated PE in school, but eventually felt pressured to go to the gym like many other boys our age did. Unfortunately, this is a far too familiar tale for many men and women who start their fitness journeys. And for many, these endeavours do evolve into a love for sports and fitness in their own right, which is healthy. But at adolescent ages, this is often not the case.  The Irony Of The Female Gaze  Take Brent, for example. The 25-year-old NTU student said that he started gymming because he was an overweight child. “I always thought men had to be muscular,” he explained. On top of wanting to get fit, Brent started becoming an avid gym-goer to attract girls. “I only ended up attracting other guys,” he laughed. Ironically, guys are more amused by muscles than most girls are.  In a poll we ran on RICE’s Instagram, more than 50% of the men who responded said they felt the pressure to be muscular. Only 23% of our female respondents said that they would prefer to date a muscular guy.  A TikTok I saw encapsulated this dichotomy perfectly. In the video, the TikTok user Cassandra said that most straight women she knows find celebrities like Conan Gray or BTS members attractive, while the men she knows perceive them as feminine.  “Men assume this is what women want,” she says, plastering a photo of Chris Hemsworth (who is extremely muscular as Thor) behind her. “But again, this is the male gaze, not the female gaze,” she continued.  “While the male gaze is heavily rooted in physical appearance, the female gaze tends to centre around how a person’s character makes you feel emotionally.” Cassandra’s explanation encapsulates how the male gaze has instilled in them an idea that physical appearance trumps everything else. But digging deeper, where does this gaze come from? Unhealthy Representation Partly, it’s from the men we look up to as a society. Surprisingly, the vast majority (86% of our respondents) voted that the men portrayed in mainstream media are unhealthy role models for young boys. The men I interviewed said the same.  Brent mentioned how he grew up watching The Terminator and joked about all boys growing up wanting the dream “Arnold body.” Similarly, 32-year-old trainer and sports science lecturer Sufian Yusof said that seeing muscular men on the covers of magazines like Men’s Health while growing up a sports enthusiast skewed his understanding of what being fit is supposed to look like.  “Porn definitely influenced me too,” Lokies offered candidly. “It was always big muscular men that were being featured and glorified.” He shared about the added pressures that come from being in the gay community too. Fit, muscular and straight-acting men are often the preferred type in the community. It is a regular occurrence to find men plastering phrases like ‘masc4masc’ (which basically means a muscular man only wants another muscular man) on dating apps like Grindr. But gay or straight, social media has amplified the unhealthy representation of bodies for everyone. Fitness influencers and Instagram models are inescapable on newsstands, television, and social media. And while it’s not necessarily bad or harmful to consume fitness content, it’s the body standards younger audiences may internalise that can be toxic.  There is a flip side to social media too, of course, like the body positivity movement. Yet, our obsession with fit bodies still seems to be “rooted deep inside,” Lokies said. “Even with the awareness, it doesn’t disappear.” When It’s Never Enough No matter the intention with which one starts their fitness journey, there is no escaping the positive reinforcement from others—which is usually a good thing. For example, Lokies told me that when he started working out, he started receiving extra attention from people around him. “I rode on it and I enjoyed it,” he recalled. “My self-confidence changed because I grew up hating sports, so the fact that me, of all people, pulled a 180 degree was unexpected.” While compliments help keep us motivated, they can sometimes keep you chasing an endless goal. All the guys I spoke to—be it gym-goers or those who work in the fitness industry—said they often feel like they need to get stronger and bigger with no endgame in sight.  “Sometimes when I am on some guys’ Instagrams, I wonder how nice it would be to look that good,” Lokies shared. 
“If you’re not happy without abs, don’t expect to be happy with abs.”
 I stared back in disbelief. How can this man, who has the epitome of the Instafit body, not think it’s enough? “Maybe the guys I see on Instagram also feel the same. This spiral is not talked about enough,” he continued.  “I’m trying to not attach myself to the image that ‘I am fitness’. It is what gives me purpose, but it shouldn’t be my identity. I don’t know how all the kids are coping now with the overload from social media. If it was me, I’d be pretty fucked up.” Similarly, it took Sufian many years to break out of this mindset and gain a more nuanced understanding of personal fitness journeys.  “When I was younger, I was influenced by what I thought men should look like,” he said. “Eventually, in my late twenties, I started questioning whether I was conforming, or setting my own rules.” After studying psychology and researching mental health, Sufian decided to live by a personal metric that fitness is what your body needs at a current point in time.  Like one of his mentors told him when he was training: “If you’re not happy without abs, don’t expect to be happy with abs.” The Connection Between Toxic Masculinity and Gym Environments In our conversation, Sufian questioned whether it’s the way “men bottle everything up” that is somehow related to why some men overexert their physical presence.  “There’s a stereotype Asian guys play into,” he said. “I grew up in a traditional Singaporean household where parents don’t express love to anyone. My dad shows strength in character, not by expressing himself. Seeing men bottle everything up was considered normal, and I saw that in my dad.” In his experience, Sufian has observed how this culture of strong but silent manhood is intertwined with gym bro culture. At the gym, everything is expressed from a physical standpoint, and rarely from within. So if you were raised to be strong and not show emotion, the gym environment would likely make you feel relatively comfortable.  This has a domino effect on a variety of issues. For example, the fact that men tend to be less introspective means they are less likely to point out problematic issues within the fitness community. Or within themselves. If a woman eats very little, people are very quick to question whether she has an eating disorder. But when was the last time you heard someone question a man for having an eating disorder because he eats eight times a day to grow bigger? “When you start seeing food as your enemy, or as something you need to be so calculative about, then it can be toxic,” Brent explained.  If someone eats too much or too little to the point they feel sick, or feel like they can’t engage in social activities with their friends, it’s an eating disorder. “Call a spade a spade,” Sufian added.  Yet men don’t realise their relationship with food is toxic, because addressing an eating disorder would probably open a Pandora’s box of insecurities (and other mental health issues) they are not willing to explore. So what is healthy masculinity? “What is the opposite of masculine?” Sufian asked. “Being feminine.” “But what is it like to be feminine? We have a predisposed idea that being feminine equals being weak or vulnerable. But being feminine actually just means understanding your insecurities and showing emotion.”  Nothing and no one is 100% binary. Where one pushes themselves to either extreme of the spectrum, it can lead to unhealthy decisions, spanning from having a bad relationship with food, the bottling up of emotions, or even the abuse of substances like steroids.  Gymming to look hyper-masculine doesn’t necessarily mean you are pushing yourself to an unhealthy extreme, but the journey to get there and the environments you are in can be. For this reason, Lokies said he often tries to counter ultra-masculine environments by showing his fun, feminine side.  When he used to work at annual CrossFit competitions—where dozens of ‘manly men’ convene—he would have a little fun by throwing on a crop top, booty shorts and a wig on. “That’s a part of me I never let myself feel pressured to hide just because of the environment I’m in.” For other guys, having a healthy relationship with their masculinity doesn’t necessarily have to come in a visual expression of the opposite. It can also mean understanding that everyone is different and has different needs.  Currently, ‘feminine’ and ‘masculine’ are seen as polar opposites, with a set of defining characteristics for both. But as we continue to deconstruct our conventional understanding of gendered behaviour, perhaps we should be looking to both deepen and expand these definitions of, and see them as less binary, contrasting, and mutually exclusive. At the end of the day, both sides encompass characteristics that we all share, albeit in different amounts. And all of that is completely okay. What are your thoughts on masculinity?

23,The Sandwich Generation: What Being Caught in the Middle Feels Like,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-sandwich-generation-caught-middle/,"Culture, People","All photography by Thaddeus Loh for Rice Media. By the time Christina Quah departed from her job as an auditor more than a decade ago, she was already burnt out from juggling the long, unpredictable hours of her job. As much as it was a lucrative career that would have seen her yearly income balloon generously if she carried on, the constant crunch time to meet tight auditing deadlines meant sleeping overnight in the office on the regular.  Was that considered normal for people working in the audit industry? “Define normal,” the 48-year-old laughed. Sleeping in the office lounge, waking up under fluorescent office lights — that lifestyle, as it turned out, wasn’t fun. Neither was it a sustainable one after Christina got married and tried to conceive. Facing complications during her pregnancy, she decided to quit her job and focus on her health. With two sons, now 12 and 13, there was no remorse for not missing out on her boys’ formative years. Shortly after becoming a full-time homemaker though, her father-in-law fell ill from diabetes. Her own mother, who resides in Malaysia, was just as medically fragile too — she had to undergo a hysterectomy. Suddenly, being in a single-income household wouldn’t be so prudent. Christina and her husband would have to care for two dependent generations. A Generation Caught in the Middle Christina and her husband belong to Singapore’s sandwich generation—the group of middle-aged Singaporeans undergoing financial strain to simultaneously support growing children and ageing parents. The physical and emotional toll, on the other hand, can be downright taxing.  “I wouldn’t lie to you lah, it was stressful,” Christina remarked on the tumultuous time when she and her husband had to care for her ailing father-in-law, who has since passed away.  While they were lucky enough to have his medical expenses subsidised under a pension scheme, there was the matter of logistics: the couple lives in the northeast, while Christina’s parents-in-law lived out west. Travelling took up a lot of their time, with constant visits to the National University Hospital and, later on, a rehab centre in Ang Mo Kio where the father-in-law underwent physiotherapy following a leg amputation.  “We were just running around a lot. And at the same time, we were trying not to show the stress on our faces—that we were tired and things like that,” she recalled. Thousands of Singaporeans like Christina have found themselves inadvertently caught between two sets of dependents, making single-income households almost impractical these days. Back in 2019, a survey by NTUC Income revealed that 94 per cent of parents aged between 35 and 55 already feel the squeeze of having to financially support their growing children and ageing parents.  And by the looks of population trends, the strain will only get worse. Singaporeans are among the world’s longest-living people (84.8 years in 2017 compared with 76.1 years in 1990), and by 2040, the average Singaporean lifespan is expected to hit as high as 85.4 years.  Live longer lives? Sure. But does one really want to, especially if you’ll be ridden with health complications? Harsh, I know, but the quality of life in the latter years inevitably declines when we could be outliving our retirement savings. The potent combination of rising costs of living (who knows what a pack of chicken rice will cost in the distant future) and the constant threat of chronic illnesses (or future global pandemics) would put even heavier burdens on the working population to care for the elderly. As far as Singapore’s readiness for an ageing population goes, the government has been prepping for the upcoming paradigm shift since the 1980s. The youth of the nation, on the other hand, are coming to terms with the fact that they would have to finance—fully or partly—their parents’ retirement. They’re even foreseeing having to downgrade their lifestyles, have fewer children or even none at all to relieve the future pressures of supporting two sets of dependents.  Such is filial piety among Asian families. And the actual law that requires Singaporeans to financially support their parents.  The Art of Caregiving For Christina these days, the pressures of supporting her family aren’t as tough as it was before. Her father-in-law passed in 2016; her own father passed recently; her kids are getting more independent and can take care of themselves without her around the house.  For many others, however, the role of caregiving duties still weighs heavily on them, especially so for those with parents who can’t carry out activities of daily living (ADL) independently. The children of these seniors would have to play vital roles when their parents can’t function — eat, dress, shower and even use the toilet — without assistance.  The conundrum here is they can’t be around all the time. The carers would need to work, or even work longer hours, to continue having the resources to support their ageing parents. The implication here? There will be little choice but to get professional help. By some cosmic coincidence, Christina joined the very service that would have alleviated her caregiving anxieties when her father-in-law was around. Three years ago, she joined Homage, an online provider of on-demand caregiving services. A Grab for trained care professionals, for lack of a better analogy.  Homage operates primarily through an app, which means getting personal care, nursing services, rehabilitation therapy and medical consultancy are a couple of taps away. Users get to read up about the licensed care professionals — dubbed Homage Care Pros — after they’ve been assigned according to the needs of the job. Communications can be done in-app, so client and caregiver get to brief one another directly.  Landing a job as a freelance Homage Care Pro was kismet for Christina. While looking to get back into the workforce as an accountant once again, she came across Homage job ads while browsing online. She thought to herself, might as well try applying.  The response was pretty immediate and she was called down for an interview. Having passed it (unsurprising, considering Christina’s infectiously bubbly demeanour) she quickly underwent the onboarding process, getting trained in various home nursing skills like proper bathing techniques, physical therapy and first aid. She remembers the up-skilling opportunities as well, such as attending a dementia caregiver training course through a collaboration between Homage and the Alzheimer’s Disease Association. It was a hard pivot from her number-crunching days in the finance industry, but she enjoys the process. It was a reminder of her time as a Junior Red Crescent in her secondary school days in Malaysia. “Meeting other caregivers, learning how to take care of seniors and people in need… you find that it’s quite meaningful. I fell in love with the job lah, I’d say.” Of course, as a caregiver, she would need great interpersonal skills as well, like empathy, patience and positivity — all of which Christina had truckloads of, based on our conversations. They proved to be pretty useful in the first-ever case assigned to her. “This Ah Ma had just come out from the hospital after a fractured collarbone and was staying with her son. The son felt shy about bathing his mother, so he engaged Homage. I was pretty nervous, you know, first time on the job. But it turned out well—we chatted, we laughed, we sang. We spent so long in the bathroom until the son had to knock on the door and ask why we were taking so long!” The Ah Ma enjoyed her company so much that her services were booked on the regular. As I learned from Homage, the Ah Ma wasn’t the only one—Christina soon became one of the more hotly demanded Care Pros. Not only was she fulfilling the caregiving roles that the patients’ children would not be able to; she was also improving the mental wellbeing and happiness of the seniors.  She does downplay her popularity, pointing out that her fellow Homage caregivers (who do their jobs in full-time capacities) are just as commendable. The network she forms with her colleagues is important, she says, as they exchange notes and discuss the best techniques to care for challenging medical conditions, like clients with chronic itching or how to handle dementia-driven meltdowns.  Reflecting on the abrupt switch in career, Christina realises that the job she once stumbled on has been a calling after all.  “After I took on my first case, I liked it instantly. It was a very heartwarming experience for me.” The fulfilment on Christina’s end is palpable—she constantly finds joy and warmth when she makes care recipients smile.  The passion shines through the care she tailors specifically for each client. In the case of Uncle George, who is illiterate, she assessed his strengths and weaknesses to customise his activities accordingly. Sessions would involve arts and crafts and running through simple workbooks together on top of more unorthodox undertakings, like singing karaoke while guiding him through light physical exercises.  Christina feels accomplished when speaking to their family members after each care session too, informing them of what she observed, the progress made that day and suggestions on what they can do next.  Sharing the Load It’s this kind of care for ageing parents that Christina and her spouse would have appreciated during their hectic caretaking years. Being in the sandwich generation herself, the struggles of other Singaporeans in that position are more than familiar. Now, as a caregiver herself, she’s relieving the pressures of families who might have it harder than she ever did.  “All I can say to them is ‘Hang in there, you’re doing a good job!’” Christina enthused. “I know that sometimes they need to take a break, so just take a break.” “If they need to focus on work or maybe want some variety of activities to engage their loved ones … sometimes they could be facing personal difficulties or they need some respite care… that’s where we come in!” This story is published in partnership with Homage.

24,"After Music Dreamer Cafe Closes, What’s Next For The Xinyao Scene?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-music-dreamer-cafe-closes-whats-next-xinyao-scene/,"Culture, Life","All photography by Music Dreamer cafe and taken before the pandemic, unless otherwise stated. Top image by Music Dreamer cafe (taken during Phase Three) I felt a tinge of guilt stepping into Music Dreamer Cafe for the last time on May 12 this year. A few days later, this last local folk music cafe shut its doors for good. It had been hard to sustain the business with an insufficient budget, according to media reports.   What’s the big deal over this cafe, you might ask. Don’t we have the likes of Timbre and Blu Jaz Cafe already?  They are not the same. Music Dreamer Cafe occupies a special place in the hearts of Mandopop and Xinyao fans like me, as the cafe was less boisterous with performers belting out soothing Chinese classics such as Mavis Hee’s Moonlight In The City and Liang Wern Fook’s Friendship Forever.  “Chey, people closing down then you visit and bemoan its loss, where were you all these while?”, a friend quipped upon knowing I was visiting for the last time.  He wasn’t wrong.  I used to visit this cafe often, especially in its previous location at Marina Square. It moved to Kallang in 2014, when the mall underwent a revamp. But the same life narrative repeated itself: Life caught up, friends didn’t have time to turn up with me, too sian to travel there; pick a lame excuse, and I had it.  I kept thinking to myself: “It will still be there. Why the rush? I can always go the next time. Let me make a mental note of it.” Except now it is gone.  I was back here only because the cafe was shuttering—a typical Singaporean who takes the existence of some places for granted and swarms them only when closing down. Places like Waffletown, Robinsons, and the McDonald’s outlet in Ridout Tea Garden. This cafe had been a homely refuge whenever I was stressed or jaded. Its old-school vibes provided me with comfort, as I immersed myself in music and reminisced about a time when life was more carefree.  It didn’t even matter that the cafe’s 30-odd performers were part-time singers/musicians. To me, it resembles lunch-time concerts during my junior college days, where some students would gather and do an open-mic while others watched. At the cafe, customers like me could also request certain songs to be played. When I was “lucky” enough to encounter a more humorous performer, he or she would playfully tease me from the stage about my choice of song. “Ah boy, you picked this oldie? How old are you? This song is your generation one meh?” But it was all in good faith to liven up the mood. This sort of audience interaction can never be re-created for online live-streams of music performances. The Lady of The House My parents first brought me to the cafe as a little boy in the 2000s during family outings, and that was when I knew its owner Sally Leong. Growing up, I called her Aunt Sally. Behind the petite 54-year-old figure is a story of strong-willedness, persistence, and determination. By the time Music Dreamer cafe started in 1997, it had already missed the heyday of Xinyao and folk music cafes. But it was a sense of mission which spurred Sally to take over the cafe when its previous owner called it quits. Speaking in Mandarin, she shares that others were approached to take over, including the owner of another music cafe Lao Di Fang, but the owner was not keen.  Eventually, together with some music-loving friends, they took over in 2000, even though it was not the most profitable business to go into.  “It was out of fate that I took over. I felt strongly that we shouldn’t let such a music cafe disappear,” she says.  Back then, besides Music Dreamer Cafe, there were about five to six other similar cafes, such as The Ark and Lao Di Fang. It was The Ark that first introduced this concept of a folk music cafe from Taiwan in 1993. During those days, people would flock to these cafes to hear the latest hits if they were unwilling to buy a CD album or wait by the radio player for the song to be played. Because they were popular, folk music cafes also became incubators for up-and-coming performers to showcase their talents. Some of them even had their own followers, who would tag along to whichever music cafe they performed in.  Just in Music Dreamer cafe alone, there were well-known figures who used to perform there, such as radio deejay Chua Leelian (known for her Guan Huai Fang Shi duet with Chen Hanwei) and singing group MICappella (which sang at a national day parade before). Another fun fact: Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng once held a theatrical production at the cafe in 2005 before entering politics the following year. But along the way, with more entertainment options, people’s enthusiasm over these cafes faded. For performers, there are many other online platforms these days where they can showcase their music talents. The physical stage is no longer as appealing, especially when they can reach out to more viewers online.  Even though they had their fair share of publicity, be it via word of mouth, school outreach programmes, or a cameo in television drama Crescendo, it was still not enough for Sally to pull through. If it is that difficult to sustain the business, why not pivot (a catchphrase these days) and sell booze to increase sales?  But nope, she chose not to.  “There were youngsters who came and U-turned when they realised we don’t sell alcohol,” Sally says. “But no, I’m not budging.” I assume she was stubborn or even silly. But this is where I saw the principled and insistent side of her, when Sally reveals why she chose not to do so, even towards the end when the already-declining business was struck with Covid-19 restrictions.  In theory, there might be more income from selling booze, but the clientele of customers would change, she says. There might be fewer customers with the genuine intention to appreciate music. Families with children in tow may choose to avoid the cafe.  Not only that, Sally was also worried the cafe’s ambience would be altered. The same warm and homely vibes might be lost as it was possible for the place to be rowdier and less rustic with the influence of alcohol. Her cafe would no longer be differentiated from the rest. Ditto for her performers, Sally says. They didn’t want their performances to be merely background music, as seen in many pubs with live bands. These performers took pride in their music and wanted an audience who could truly appreciate it. “You must know what you are doing and what you want from it. Once you get that aligned, you won’t be swayed no matter what,” she adds. But for her regular customers: no alcohol, never mind. It didn’t matter for long-time supporters like Hendry Toh, 47, who had patronised the cafe since it first started. Compared to other cafes, the former teacher feels the performers at this cafe were friendlier as they also interacted with customers on and off stage, instead of only sticking to the stage and maintaining an emotional distance.  Hendry specifically mentioned the genuinity of owner Sally, who treated her customers as friends and even kept his spirits up when he was ill. He also fondly remembers the time when he sang Guan Huai Fang Shi (Manner of Care) with Chua Leelian on stage, which must have been an honour given her fame.  Over the years, he says, many performers became his closest friends, even spending weekends at chalets together during his younger days. I’m not surprised, especially after Hendry shares that he used to visit the cafe once or twice a week when it was located at Marina Square.  “It’s a shame this place has to go, given the amount of memories I had here. Everyone is sincere and warm. In fact, I feel sadder for Sally [the owner] than the demise of the cafe because she has put in blood, sweat and tears into this,” Hendry laments.  What comes next in the Xinyao and Mandopop scene, now that Music Dreamer cafe has called it a day? While Sally and her performers soldier on with live streams, I hope this is just a temporary arrangement due to Covid-19, and that this genre of music does not get relegated permanently to the online world.  It will be a pity if that eventually happens, because the joy of Xinyao and Mandopop is not just about the music but the accompanying camaraderie too.  Currently, some schools such as Evergreen Secondary School and Temasek Junior College incorporate Xinyao in their curriculums, which is an initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning under the Education Ministry.  It is good to promote Xinyao as part of our cultural heritage, even though it might be ironic, given that Xinyao started off as a ground-up initiative by students in the 1970s and 80s.  As ironic as it may be, if a top-down approach can keep the Xinyao culture alive, why not? While there might be some cajoling on the government’s end now to get the young to buy into this genre of music, in time to come they might grow to love it genuinely instead of perceiving it as class work.  My final visit there in May felt poignant; it was my first time back since 2018, as I was overseas and soon after, the pandemic struck and the cafe had to close during the circuit breaker.  While it was the same cafe but with all the safe management measures, I couldn’t help but feel the place was under siege. My friends and I had to keep a distance from other customers. We were further away from the stage. We could no longer chomp on tapioca chips and sip on bubble tea while swaying along to the music as food and beverages had to be consumed before performances started.  But I should count my blessings. At least I could bid this teenage stomping ground of mine farewell, after Sally went through much hassle to get permission from the authorities to conduct live performances. When performances started at 8 PM sharp, I experienced the same sense of solace which I always had when I visited the cafe. Although the bottom half of everyone’s faces were covered, I knew there were smiles behind those masks, be it customers who immersed themselves in the melody or the performers who sang with gusto.  I approached Aunt Sally when the performance ended, with an irrational sense of remorse, to catch up with her. After all, it had been a long time since I patronised the cafe.  “Wah, how come you didn’t come for so long,” she said achingly. I could only manage a giggle and admitted that I had been busy.  Deep inside, I felt guilty for not patronising this lovely place for a long time, and only did so when it was shutting down.  Go ahead and accuse me of living in denial, but I hope the day comes when Xinyao and its music cafes are revived. People are social creatures who relish a sense of fellowship, and Xinyao has the magic to cultivate this feeling.  Not everything can be replicated online and I’m confident when this hell of a pandemic is over, such cafes will sprout again. With some luck, maybe a Xinyao-themed one like Music Dreamer cafe will appear again.  Do you have any memories of these folk music cafes? Tell us about it at community@ricemedia.co.

25,The World Can Be Kinder When There’s a Unifying Threat. So Says A Quiet Place Part II,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-a-quiet-place-part-ii/,"Culture, Events, Uncategorized","Production stills courtesy of United International Pictures. A competitive society makes us selfish at the core. Agree? From wrestling for the last chicken drumstick to being first to grab a cab, Singaporeans are familiar with the inclination to be first in line. Doesn’t matter what’s at stake. We cannot lose out to others. Take Malaysia’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak: the Movement Control Order. A cordon sanitaire that has been implemented more than a few times since last year. When Malaysians were stuck at the border and effectively rendered homeless, what were some nasty Singaporeans saying on the Internet? Stranded Malaysians were lambasted for “taking jobs” and earning up to three times their local currency. When the Singapore government offered $50 a day to help employers house displaced Malaysian workers, the chatter grew. Some complained it was a waste of tax money. From the pockets of discontentment, several Singaporean samaritans emerged, opening their homes to workers: some for a small fee, others for free. Few offered food, cooked for them, provided towels and toiletries. All to ensure they too could rest, eat and work well day-in, day-out. These Singaporeans understood what it meant to be left out of one’s home, with family they cannot see and embrace. Malaysians are, after all, just as crucial in Singapore’s workforce as locals—they take up jobs as factory floor workers, cleaners, bus drivers, waiters, healthcare workers and much, much more. If not for these few good folks and the generosity of several companies and the Manpower Ministry, Singaporeans were at risk of being seen as selfish in the eyes of our neighbours up north. During this time, I caught A Quiet Place Part II. Contrary to sceptics (my office colleagues inclusive), there were similar themes in the movie that resonated with me. The film markets itself as an emotional survival-horror film, but I think it’s about collectives—a me-versus-us theme. It’s kind of like, do I see Malaysians (and all other foreign workers here) as part of us, or do I treat them as outsiders? Strength in Numbers Through 110 minutes of the film, the questions explored are similar, except on a smaller, familial scale. Emily Blunt plays Evelyn Abbott, the protector-mum to her three children. If you’ve not seen the first film, you probably should, because the film continues exactly where it left off (after a brief backstory). There’s Regan, Evelyn’s deaf daughter, who communicates through sign language. Millicent Simmonds plays her like an old soul, and she’s deaf in real life. Marcus is Evelyn’s oldest son, but he has to work on his confidence issues to fill big brotherly shoes. Then, there’s Evelyn’s newborn baby, conveniently there to drive me crazy whenever he wails (the monsters are blind but they’re attracted to the slightest sound). John Krasinki, Blunt’s real-life husband, briefly reprises his role as Evelyn’s husband, Lee Abbott. While he does more backseat writing, co-producing, and directing this time, he shines in his scenes, because he’s the most selfless guy in both films. If you’ve seen the original, he made many selfless acts, including diverting his son Marcus away from danger at one point, just to make sure his family gets through the day. Sadly, in this sequel, he isn’t around as much. So, without Mr Selflessness to string his family along, what is Evelyn Abbott to do? She does it through self-discovery and soul-searching, after lots of, shushing, Twister-like limb movements, and blood-curdling screams. Oh, and she also has four mouths to feed. I’m not going to sugar-coat it. In times of disaster, whether the monster is a blind creature with hypersensitive “ears” or a virus I can’t see, it is tempting to distance oneself and think only about me. I call it Quiet Distancing. I socially avoid everyone, but I’m also out of sight. In A Quiet Place Part II, Evelyn is Mum Solo. She has no husband to fall back on. She has to pull herself together, corral her kids, coo her noisy newborn, and distance herself from the kaypoh monsters. I’m not sure if I can do the same if I’m in her shoes. I might just break down, huddle inside a locker, and pee/poop myself to death. Yet, where there’s collective strength, there’s redemption. We find it within us and among us. What’s cool about acts of selflessness is when there is a pay-it-forward effect. One act of human kindness within you generates multiple impact on others, doesn’t matter if it’s towards your children, friends or strangers. A Collective Kindness In hard times, pockets of society gravitate towards the greater collective. If this collective is governed by acts of selflessness, the social impact grows exponentially. If a majority of its members decide to be selfish, chaos ensues. Real-world examples: peace protests dissolving into riots or supermarket queues turning into panic-buying. In A Quiet Place Part II, it’s as basic as deciding if you should help a hungry bystander, or approach a lost, little girl. One bad choice means monsters emerging to tear you to pieces. Throughout the film, as Evelyn struggles to fit in Lee’s shoes for the sake of her children, the effect rubs off on her daughter. Regan remembers her father’s selfless acts, steps up to help her mother and distracts the monsters. That’s two selfless individuals against one selfish creature. The equation improves. It’s all very Aliens’ Ripley-and-Newt stuff, but with additional feels. Then, there’s Cillian Murphy. He plays Emmett, an Abbott family friend turned broken man. He remembers the Abbotts but stops short of bringing them under his care. What if I’m in his shoes? Living alone, having figured out ways to beat the system, staying off-grid? What if I’m already living in an uninterrupted world, away from the authorities (or the monsters in this case)? Would I open my doors when acquaintances beg me to let them in? What would it take for me to do so? They have to give me something in return, yes? Something I feel will give me, or them, or all of us, a better chance at survival. It’s the same way with taking exams. If I’m failing my tests, I would observe how the smart-alecks do it. If I can take shortcuts and copy their answers, maybe I’ll have the upper hand. Or I can ask them to teach me and join in their discussions. In reel life as it is in real life, we’re always one choice away from making the wrong decision. Sometimes we don’t know it. But wait. Remember my theory? If the collective is mostly selfless, and I’m the only one being selfish, do I continue being selfish or join them in selfless acts? The longer they stay with me, the deeper I’m pulled into the collective. It’s infectious (sort of like a virus) but in a positive way. What if Emmett builds a bond with Regan? Does she see him as a man still in touch with his past, a substitute father figure compared to her exhausted survivalist mother? The small, selfless acts Regan makes to keep everyone alive depends on whether she trusts Emmett as part of her collective. Emmett’s selfishness will keep her second-guessing his motives. Is he truly helping or is he out to save his own skin? Naturally, as the collective grows, I mix with more people. I encounter strangers and question their intentions. Do I welcome them into the collective, or take a step back? In my earlier example, let’s assume there’s no virus and no border lockdown. Would I open my doors to a Malaysian man in need willingly, if he asks if I have a place to stay? Should I be wary? Or shut the door in his face? Sometimes it takes a unifying threat (like a virus outbreak or real monsters) to really tip our scales. The combined selfless or selfish acts from Evelyn, Regan, Marcus and Emmett, demonstrate this impact, and the scale of lives lost, for better or worse. A Quiet Place Part II has its tender and tense moments. It keeps the familiar, human beats from the original by anchoring the children’s anxieties around Evelyn Abbott. It ups the tempo by introducing Emmett, tossing everyone into situations where anxiety, distrust and panic mean certain and often gruesome death. The situation gets dire when they encounter strangers (humans and monsters) and have to decide whether to be selfless or selfish. These moral choices keep the film engaging, and force us to question the extent we’ll go to protect ourselves as individuals or as a group. Every day, I deal with my own sets of monsters, psychologically and emotionally. People close to me do so too. The Abbotts deal with real monsters, but the symbolism remains the same. With what’s been happening within and beyond our borders since Covid-19 (our common threat at the time of writing), there’s a little bit of Emmett in all of us. I struggle between individuality and collectivism everyday, deciding if I’m selfish or selfless. This will be put to the test, when people like Evelyn and Regan come knocking on my front door, begging for help. Catch A Quiet Place Part II in cinemas now.

27,"Love, Death and Fungi: What Mushrooms Can Teach Us About Our Relationship With Nature",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-love-death-fungi-mushrooms-can-teach-us-relationship-nature/,"Culture, People","All photography by Marisse Caine for Rice Media After a heavy rain, the forest lights up with foxfire.  From the hillsides of Bukit Batok to the green lung of Macritchie, clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms appear seemingly from out of nowhere and all at once, like psychedelic beacons in the darkness. This phantom light draws in the critters and insects of the forest, which helps the mushroom to cast its spores across Singapore like an invisible spell.  For the average city-dweller, the mushroom feels rather alien and unnatural. It is by turns attractive and disgusting; beautiful, yet vaguely unsettling. We fear it for its poison even as many fungi like lingzhi are prized in TCM for their rare healing properties. It’s the yeast that raises our bread and the mold that spoils it.  It exists in a liminal space between the living and the dead.  As Nature’s decomposers, mushrooms break things down. They remind us of things we’d prefer not to think about—death, disease and decay—even as they facilitate the most vital parts of life.   So much about the mushroom remains shrouded in mystery. In recent years, scientists have discovered an ‘internet of fungi’, a communication network made up of fungal threads called mycelium that’s buried beneath the soil like fiber-optic cables, connecting the forest together.  Through this network, large trees can donate essential nutrients to younger seedlings in the shade. Plants can warn their neighbours against predators or disease by sending chemical signals through the mycelia.  This network has existed for thousands of years. And even as we clear our forests to make way for development, most Singaporeans remain largely ignorant of the ancient mysteries buried beneath their feet.  Which begs the question: is it the mushroom that is alien or are we as human beings just alienated from Nature? Have You Met the Mushroom Man?  “For many years in my 20s I was just floating around in life,” says Ng Sze Kiat, 41. “I guess I was looking for something that I could dedicate myself to. Then one day, mushrooms came into the picture and I fell in love.”  This might sound like the opening monologue of a tree-hugging hippie, but a quick tour of Kiat’s lab at the heart of Bukit Merah quickly dispels this notion.  As the one-man R&D team behind Bewilder, the man knows his science. His primary occupation, that of growing mushrooms, is an intense and carefully tuned process.  First, Kiat collects mycelium samples from the wild and clones them in petri dishes in his lab. Once the mycelium starts to run cleanly, the cultures are then used to inoculate a container full of millet, where the web-like mycelium colonises the grain. Finally, the colonies are transferred to even larger bags of sawdust and wood chips, from which mushrooms start to fruit.   This is work that requires precision. One false move could contaminate the entire batch and undo weeks of work. So it’s strange, then, that Kiat would prefer to call himself an artist and his lab, a ‘mushroom design studio.’ Looking around, I can see examples of his artwork: unsettling sculptures of mushrooms growing out of replica human skulls and lamps with protruding mushrooms hanging from the ceiling.   “Growing mushrooms is as much about feel and intuition as getting the measurements right,” Kiat explains. “Fungi are fickle organisms. I know some scientists who can’t fruit mushrooms to save their life—even when they follow a fixed formula. On the other hand, some artists can grow mushrooms with one eye closed.” This kind of intuition has been honed through over a decade of experience. Before starting Bewilder, Kiat worked on a local farm, where he cultivated mushrooms from waste substrates by converting two disused toilets into his personal R&D lab. “I moved into the men’s toilet and covered the entire room with duct tape and plastic sheets,” he recalls wistfully. “The samples I kept in the urinal.  It was terrible because there was no ventilation in there. I had to step out every half hour just to get fresh air.”  These years of experimentation and play have made Kiat who he is today. Three years ago, the farm shut down and all of his cultures—a two-door fridge filled with them—were thrown away, leaving him to start from scratch again. For many, this would be a failure, but to Kiat, it held the promise of a blank canvas. Now in his early 40s, he no longer feels insecure about calling himself an artist.  “Looking back, I wouldn’t exactly call it an illustrious career,” says Kiat. “I guess I always had a rebellious streak. A bit stubborn. I don’t really fit the mold of your typical Singaporean.”  Despite his personal passion, mushrooms are only a means to an end.  Kiat’s primary goal is to educate the Singaporean public on the environment. As a business, Bewilder is structured like the mushrooms he grows: there’s an education component, where Kiat holds mushroom workshops with the public. The second spore is the R&D that goes into creating sustainable materials using fungi, a technology that could one day replace materials like styrofoam. Finally, there’s the F&B component, where he plans to supply top-quality mushrooms to high-end restaurants.  “Right now I’m in the colonising period,” says Kiat. “On one hand, it’s tough to do this because no one else in Singapore does it. It’s just me. But that’s cool. I get to play around. I get to shake things up. People in Singapore aren’t used to seeing this kind of stuff, so straight away, it attracts attention.” Ultimately, Kiat wants people to be more eco-literate at a younger age, to understand that we are all part of something that’s bigger than ourselves.   How Singaporeans Treat Nature A tree falling in the forest is a momentous event.  It provides much needed sunlight for saplings on the forest floor to grow. The trunk of the fallen tree becomes home to insects and fungi. As the tree decomposes, it becomes fertile soil for the next generation of life.  But in Singapore, who shows up first? The saplings and fungi? Or does NParks show up with a team to remove this ‘dangerous obstacle’?   “Singapore sells a pretty picture of green spaces and people living in harmony with nature,” said Kiat.  “A part of this is true. We’ve done a great job at putting greenery all around us. But do we really live in it? I don’t think so. When you look at parents and their kids at our crowded parks, it’s almost as if they don’t know how to interact freely with the natural world.” Garden City is both window-dressing and a clever marketing campaign for tourists. In reality, when a tree grows out of line in Singapore, we trim it. When there’s a hole, we fill it. Every bump in the road is smoothed over. Every risk and uncertainty is made more predictable.  We plant non-native trees along the roadside and are surprised when the roots don’t run deep and end up falling over.  But it wasn’t always this way. Singaporeans are just two generations removed from people who still know the names and uses of certain native plants and fungi. These traditions are kept alive in the makciks who still forage on Pulau Ubin today, and the villagers in remote corners of Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, these are largely oral traditions. They are not documented anywhere. In another generation, Singaporeans will become tourists in their own land.  “That’s what I feel angry about. In Singapore, it’s all about producing results,” says Kiat. “What’s the yield of this land? How much money can this make? When will it be ready to be consumed?“ “But hey, slow down, you know? Let’s try to understand the land we live on first, instead of thinking that we already know everything. That it’s all just there for our benefit. It’s so arrogant to think that way!” If there’s one silver lining to this pandemic, it’s the kick in everyone’s ass. We’ve been forced to slow down and confront the sometimes uncomfortable things about ourselves. It’s making us question the important things in life.  “Don’t get me wrong,” says Kiat. “Making money is important but it’s not the most important thing in the world.”  “Ultimately, we as human beings are the biggest problems on the planet. We are the cancer. So we need to find ways to keep ourselves in check.” “Besides that, I don’t have any easy answers.”   Please, Accept the Mystery “I fell in love with mushrooms because they both scare and excite me,” says Kiat.  ”When a fungi sample gets contaminated in my lab, it freaks me out too, okay? There are some molds that are so vile and toxic it’s almost too repulsive when you’re confronted with it. But at the same time it’s a push and pull thing. Why am I so repulsed by something so natural? It makes me want to understand it even more. That’s the contradiction. Everything in life is ultimately that lah.”  This attitude of curiosity and exploration feels out of place here.

There’s this tendency in Singapore to put people and things into boxes. You’re an artist. She’s a scientist. You belong in this box. She belongs in hers. This is the yield the land can generate and this is the economic value you can create. The line ends here. No trespassing. We rush to make ourselves useful without taking the time to truly come to terms with who we are and what we actually want.  As a result, Singapore’s brand of resilience is a fragile and stage-managed one. The constant interference with Nature and in people’s lives stunts their ability to innovate and adapt. It creates comfort without intimacy, safety without connection.  The roots run too shallow and the soil lacks the essential nutrients of life.  We’ve become disconnected from the land we live in and our memory and knowledge of it is fading faster than the forests are disappearing.  But if Covid has taught us anything, it’s that there’s no hiding from the uncertainty of the world. As the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.   There’s also no running away from ourselves.  “This is the way I see the world,” says Kiat. “There’s good stuff and bad stuff in it, but there’s no true good or evil. It’s all just one big mishmash of everything that’s constantly moving and changing.” As human beings, we have to remember that we’re part of this evolving mystery too.

28,Through Their Lenses: Teenage Mums,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-teenage-mums-disposable-camera/,"Culture, Life","A week after Raj asked her to be his girlfriend, Gerry discovered she was pregnant. She was 16 at the time, and had been sure she’d wanted an abortion. But she went on to miss every appointment made with the clinic (they only had early morning slots, and she kept oversleeping) until it was 5 months into the pregnancy, and the doctor told her that they’d have to kill the foetus before aborting. Raj and Gerry left the clinic, cried, smoked, and decided to keep the baby.  Belle was studying for her O-levels when she found out. The child became the single most important thing in her life, and she ditched her studies and started planning how she could raise him. People at school called her a disgrace for keeping the baby, and a slut, even though the father of her child was her first sexual partner. Autumn cried when she moved out to live with her in-laws. She used to be her parents’ little girl, and all of a sudden she had to be an adult and move out, without having given anything back to her own family.  Today, at 19, 20, and 22, Gerry, Belle, and Autumn couldn’t be happier to be mothers. All of them, in their own ways, agree that their lives have been made better for it, despite what were mistakes in their teenage years.  For this photo series, we gave the three of them disposable film cameras to capture their experiences being a young mother in Singapore. GERRY “The pregnancy was a very, very difficult part of my life. Raj and I were new to the relationship and had to settle into a fully committed one. We were still maturing individually, and there was a lot going on around me … I wasn’t on great terms with my family.  Those were very sad days, I couldn’t go out much because I’d get looks from the public, being so young, visibly pregnant with tattoos and all. I didn’t want to take public transport, I just cooped myself up at home, and I don’t know, they were sad times. But at the same time it felt very wholesome, feeling Asher’s kicks in me.” “Seeing Asher and Raj fall asleep together really warms my heart. Just knowing that someone else loves this child as much or more than I love him. I think about him in the future, about how he’ll see me and Raj. And that motivates me to want to continue with my education. I don’t want him to have to worry about our survival.” “It’s always close to sunset around the time we pick Asher up from preschool. There’s pretty skies, everyone is there with their kids and their dogs, doing their own things. Three of us would just get on the swing and chill for a while. It’s times like these, in our little bubble just for that 10 minutes or so, where I feel like our lives could be so much better if it was just the three of us, in a place of greenery.  I don’t like the environment that Asher is growing up in. Everywhere you look, there’s fucked up things happening. Around the world, and just downstairs. I wish I could give him better.” BELLE “I’m really glad I brought them (note: Belle is a mother of three boys, of whom the younger two are twins) into the world and I would do it over again.   I’d just like to say that young mums are just as capable as, if not more than, regular mums. Physically, because our bodies had to go through something meant to be experienced in adulthood, and mentally, because of the judgment we had to face. I wouldn’t say I’m the best mum in the world but I’m pretty sure I’m the best mum in their eyes. We’re very close.” “My twins have never really been outside because of Covid, it’s quite sad, they only know how our void deck looks like. For my eldest son, we used to bring him out a lot, now he can’t even go to school and everyday he’s saying he wants to go. Now my hubby and I usually dabao food back for the whole family. We also just like to go riding around on an e-bike.” “This picture of the sky was actually taken early in the morning. I hadn’t slept; I usually look after my kids at night, pat them to sleep, and change their diapers in the middle of the night. When my helper and grandma-in-law wakes up, then I’ll go to sleep. So this sunrise is the last thing I see before I sleep. If there’s work the next day sometimes I just don’t sleep.” AUTUMN “Being a mum at any age isn’t easy. If a woman is willing to go through that nine months then that child must be very precious. I believe these photographs tell a story, and when Grayson grows up he can see how much he’s loved.” “Grayson is like a treasure, he’s something that I didn’t ask for but he’s here for me. If I tell him that my leg hurts he will try to massage it; he’s very smart, we tell him things once and he will listen and learn, like when I sing him the ‘sun, moon, and stars’ song he will look outside the window and say ‘hello moon!’. Even the teacher calls me and says he’s very cute, clever, understanding.” “I don’t know why but I feel like he is the happiest thing. He brings a lot of joy everywhere he goes, and his presence bonds the family more, even our extended family. Everyone looks forward to seeing him, and being the first grandson he’s showered with a lot of love and attention. I used to be very insecure about my voice because people said it sounded cartoonish, and I was afraid to speak out. After having Grayson I feel more courage, like I can take on the world for him. To all the young moms out there, I’d say that being a young mom is tough, but definitely worth it. You don’t have to worry about other people’s judgment, because 在妈妈的眼里只有小孩 (in the eyes of a mother, there is only her child).” Author © 2020 Rice Media. All rights reserved ",TRUE
29,How We Must Redefine ‘Racial Harmony’ for Singapore in 2021,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-redefine-racial-harmony-singapore-2021/,"Current Affairs, Features","All images from Rice File Photos unless otherwise stated. No one can seem to agree on what exactly racial harmony is. Or at least, what Singapore wants it to be.  Online discourse over the past few months has been a massive feedback loop of disenfranchisement. The recent spike in COVID-19 cases and its rapidly spreading B1617 variant has not only emboldened some Singaporeans to express noxious racist and xenophobic comments on social media but has also fueled public cases of unbridled targeted physical and verbal attacks. The latest lightning rod of controversy comes in the form of a Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer’s unprompted racist tirade at an interracial couple. In a video shared by Dave Parkash, the man accuses him of predatory behaviour, doubling down on shaming and hurling racist insults at the interracial couple even after being confronted. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam then responded, saying: “I used to believe that Singapore was moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony. Based on recent events, I am not so sure anymore. It is impossible to ignore the irony of a senior educator clad in a shirt with ‘Singapore’ emblazoned across his chest uttering typically implicit, veiled racist sentiments out loud. While nothing new, these long-simmering hostilities seem to be exacerbated by the profound exhaustion of the past year—and the seemingly never-ending, ever-mutating virus that has indirectly called into question the optics of Singapore’s racial harmony. Sure, there’re government benchmarks measuring its success based on abstract markers like being comfortable with having a neighbour of a different race and the lack of racial or religious tensions in our daily lives. There’s also the florid spiel we hear in school about how Racial Harmony Day commemorates the race riots of 1964. Never again, they say. Similarly, Singaporean youths can’t quite reach a consensus on what they want the idea of racial harmony to mean. “I would say that within Singapore, or around the globe, no country has reached racial harmony,” one remarked in a group discussion with Rice.  As disparate viewpoints accented the conversation, a small but diverse set of young Singaporeans cycled through their various interpretations. For a country whose national identity hinges so much on this indescribable, infinitely debatable concept, why do recent trends reveal a Singapore that is not, in fact, racially harmonious at all? CMIO CMI Plumbing into the depths of racial politics, the group first turned a gimlet eye upon the country’s unique structural relations.  One suggested that perhaps the vague notion of racial harmony can be read as moving past race entirely, that it should be a non-factor in the way we treat each other. Another attributed the current surge in blatant xenophobia and racism to our rigid understanding of race, an unfortunate and pervasive byproduct of the CMIO Model passed down from Singapore’s colonial past. In a survey conducted by Institute of Policy Studies and CNA, six in ten respondents indicated that race was important to them, which seemed to suggest that the Singaporean identity is still greatly enshrined in the CMIO framework.  While race-based policies such as the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and the reserved Presidential Election ensured minority representation in various institutions, it has, more importantly, been emphasised as a key structural reinforcement for minorities to practice their cultures without feeling like they would have to conform to the practices of the majority race. “What we struggle with is that with CMIO, you lose a lot of resolution in the form of racial subcultures … It’s not about ignoring race and pretending that (overlooking race) is understanding.” However, racial categorisation in Singapore is not something that is self-identified but is assigned by the state based on paternal lines of descent. “We are measuring today’s problems with yesterday’s policies,” he elaborates. Zeroing in on the Ethnic Integration Policy, a scheme enacted in 1989 to ensure a balanced mix of ethnicities in HDB estates to “promote racial harmony and strengthen social cohesion”, he laments that these goals don’t quite translate. Rather, its mechanical and impersonal design lends itself to a lack of organic, communal understanding. His peer chimes in that despite being surrounded by a diverse set of neighbours, he still keeps to himself. As for those who already confine themselves within their racial bubbles, the lack of meaningful interaction in HDB estates exacerbates things. This illuminates the glaring fault lines between the different racial groups. No Country for Old Values Most strikingly, the youths were especially eager to distance themselves from the inflexible ideologies that have come to be characteristic of older generations. “I think it’s easier for (my grandparent’s) generation to have the tendency to rely on race as an excuse”, one participant observed. This, as the group identified, is a double-edged sword that could result in one of two outcomes. These racist sentiments could either internalise themselves, passing through the generations, resulting in an infinite cycle of ignorance and intolerance. Or it could spawn a new batch of vocal and educated youth willing to acknowledge their culpability and challenge the prejudiced assumptions of the older generations. “I remember my father mentioned that (I) cannot take the lift (by myself) because the cleaners are foreign workers and therefore it is not safe. It is only when I started volunteering with migrant worker enterprises that I realised they are extremely precious. But it really stems from these organic opportunities,” commented a participant. Either way, it is hard to ignore that race will always be the first mark in the face of uncertainty and discomfort. The overarching narrative of racial harmony has, after all, been central to our country’s self-conception, making it an easy and inevitable scapegoat to avoid uncomfortable conversations about more complicated underlying issues. Take for example the inflammatory remarks made by local creative director Eugene Chong, who asserted: “The noisy minority must be discouraged from playing the race card.” Likening our heightened cultural sensitivity to an unwelcome disruption in our country’s racial harmony, he epitomises the wider inclination for Singaporeans to remain silent and plaster a feeble band-aid on a gaping wound, shying away from informing themselves and speaking up in the face of discontent. Singapore Social… Studies Just as the participants were quick to point out that the key difference in the current generation’s multifaceted perspective of race is due to more comprehensive education, many of them also recognised that national education has been crucial in moulding their perception of racial harmony.  Taught in schools and reinforced in the larger rhetoric, this simultaneously prioritises and hinders the way they view how various aspects of Singaporean life intersects with race. They enriched the discussion with personal anecdotes of institutional successes and missteps. One shared her coddled experience in a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School, which presented a Singaporean experience that was predominantly Chinese. It was only when she entered polytechnic that she became cognizant of her shallow depth of racial awareness, inadvertently tinting her new experiences with peers of different racial groups with an air of ignorance—even if it was in good faith. Another added that some SAP Schools have also been taking steps to actively combat their lack of racial diversity, introducing tailored programmes like Exploration in Ethnicity and Faith. Through their curriculums, they aim to provide a safe environment to facilitate much-needed conversations with young students. But if such supposedly fundamental ideas have to be supplemented, or what more specifically taught, does that indicate a larger failure to weave nuanced racial awareness and sensitivity into our social etiquette? An Identity Crisis A participant puts forth the assertion that although racial harmony has always been Singapore’s defining feature, this does not actually equate to most of our lived realities. “Whenever we have national performances, our national identity is that we’re racially diverse. Other ASEAN countries are amazing in their cultural performances, but in Singapore, we struggle when we sing Munnaeru Vaalibaa.” His peer agreed: “I think national identity is sort of amorphous, it’s something that when you go out chasing, you will never get.” Moreover, celebrating racial harmony in its current manner may also belay the attainment of true harmony, whatever that may amount to. “When a new culture enters, we stereotype them based on the jobs that they take up, whether blue or white collar, based on a handful of individuals. So, for example, if they’re taking particularly high paying jobs, Singaporeans will say these people are stealing our jobs.” Another shared that many still colloquially refer to Changi Business District as Chennai Business Park because of the high density of Non-Resident Indians living and working in the area. This diagnosis of poor cultural awareness signals a wider obstacle of pervasive and prevalent stereotypes, and how easily that could curdle into active discrimination. As the conflation between race and nationality bounced back and forth, it was, frankly, a much-needed reminder that it is easy for many to swap them out almost interchangeably. Ironically, being constantly reminded to look beyond the superficial instead reveals an attempt to codify experience. It is just as crucial to understand that many intersecting factors such as class, nationality, and even gender colours individual perspectives. Though Singapore’s foreign workers more often than not fit into CMIO moulds, they seem to be socially exempt from fully integrating into the racial fabric of the country, assuming a certain uniformity of experience that separates locals from “outsiders”. The same youth points out that this has driven the manner in which discrimination is pegged to job opportunities. “Purely pursuing racial harmony because it’s something we want or something we value may make less sense than identifying the problems and frictions that may emerge because of clashes and tensions between races. If we take a problem-driven approach to help address some of these race-related problems, challenges, and tensions, perhaps it may also be worth taking a look behind the frustrations and anxieties.” Promising Young Nation “The more we talk about identity, it becomes a lowest common denominator thing. And if it starts splintering and decentralising amongst each of us, the idea of the self is broken into all these small little pieces that form our identity. How can we come back together if all we worry about are these small pieces?” posited a participant. Broad solutions were thrown around, some suggesting a more empathetic approach from an angle of diversity and inclusion. This includes fostering a welcoming environment for Singaporeans to ask questions, without fear of hostility or retaliation. Courage and critical thinking should also be encouraged to challenge the existing assumptions and beliefs that drive outright bigotry. “My hope is that the idea of identity as the key thing that differentiates us becomes the key thing that brings us together,” another remarked. While education remains vital, many agreed that more emphasis should be placed on illuminating the set of challenges minorities face, addressing the root cause of current-day animosity head-on instead of shying away from “taboo” topics. Or maybe the answer is a lot simpler: It’s time to move past the narrative of racial harmony entirely. As our country progresses and our youth evolve accordingly, they hold the power to redefine what racial harmony could be, something that is neither fixed nor absolute. Just as their perceptions of racial harmony are currently varied and conflicting, their concepts of it are sure to change accordingly in the next decade. Even though our future feels more uncertain with each passing day, pre-existing racist and xenophobic sentiments coming into sharp focus should be more than enough to mobilise our youths to affect tangible shifts in attitudes in the larger community. But if there is one thing we can all agree on, though, it’s this: These issues will definitely not be met with yet another generational shrug.

30,"With Dining Out Restricted During Phase 2HA, How Have Singaporeans Been Coping?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-dining-restricted-phase-2ha-singaporeans-coping-outdoors/,"Culture, Life","Photography by Zachary Tang unless otherwise stated. Outdoor Dining, But Where?  With the introduction of measures in this heightened version of Phase 2, diners all across Singapore have found themselves stranded and uncertain on where to head for their weekly date fix, be it with a friend or special other. In light of this, public spaces such as park benches, steps, playgrounds and even backdoor alleys are now playing host to diners who wish to have their take-away meals outside the confines of their home. Couples armed with cooler bags and take-away boxes seem to flock to these places in recent times in hopes for a short getaway from their back-to-back Zoom meetings during the day.  Fascinated by this rising trend, I decided to scout out other notable spots where diners have opted to have their meal outdoors in the city, in hopes of capturing similar vignettes of how Singaporeans have found ways in coping with these heightened safety regulations. The First: A Drive-Thru Escapade  The first locale of note I visited was tucked away in an open-air car park in Kallang, conveniently located near a McDonald’s drive-thru and a KFC outlet.  The wide expanse offered by the parking lot in the area ensures that visitors who patronise either the neighbouring fast food outlets are guaranteed to be able to find a cosy spot to enjoy their meal in the comfort of their vehicle. Be it with the windows down, sunroof open, or air-conditioning on full blast, dining in one’s vehicle is indubitably becoming a popular option for those looking for an “outdoor” dining occasion for two. Just be mindful of spillage and crumbs in the car.  For those wanting to replicate the ambience of al fresco dining, I was slightly bemused to observe couples bringing foldable chairs and a makeshift table to the car park with them. It was not a rare sight to witness visitors reclining in their chairs under trees in the car park, cups and snack boxes in hand.  The Decathlon store nearby provides the opportunity for pairs to walk off the grease from their fast-food meal and seek some air-conditioned respite from the heat outside. Just a cautionary note, however: be prepared to expect decently strong sentiments of post-indulgence guilt in the face of ab-rollers and yoga mats.  The Second: RoofTop+  One of the more popular options for outdoor dining finds itself situated cozily above the mall of Bugis+. Accompanied with the fairly calming ambience of carpeted grass and trees, the wooden floorboards that cover the rooftop veranda provides an almost oasis-like atmosphere for diners in search of a quick respite from the air-conditioned retail shops that lie below.  After a quick menu deliberation with my dining companion, we eventually decided on having our dinner at this very location.  Awkwardly struggling with our purchases of tako-yaki and a selection of finger food, we made our way to the mall’s rooftop veranda to host our meal. Pairs of diners were sparsely strewn across the entire area, paper bags with snacks just like ours. Others cradled precious lunch boxes and tiffin cans drawn from cooler bags, complete with metal utensils and personal hand sanitisers. One couple at the far end of the patio even basked in the tiny flickering glow of an electronic candle as they chatted over their supermarket haul.  Comfortably nestled on the rooftop of the mall, this locale boasts relatively scenic views of the surrounding areas. The synthetic foliage that surrounds the veranda also provides some shade from the elements as well, offering sporadic shade to diners who opt to lounge on the synthetic grass. Of note however, would be the exhaust pipes and vents that line the walls of the shopping mall – this may not be the ideal location for the picky or those with sensitive noses. Nevertheless, the unique ambience and wide expanse still makes this a note-worthy dining spot, with adequate space for couples to maintain social-distancing with each other and other diners without having to jostle for spots.  The Third: Diner’s Bridge The CBD itself plays host to unique ad-hoc outdoor dining spots while boasting mesmerising panoramic views of the bustling city. If the grounded feel of Kallang’s open-air carpark doesn’t cut it, the bridge across Raffles Boulevard offers a more scenic alternative. Embarking on the short stroll down from Millenia Walk and onto the white-tiled bridge, it would be difficult for one to avoid the unique and rounded seating areas that pepper the vicinity. The circular formation offers evening diners privacy from other bridge-goers, while at the same time guaranteeing an almost unobstructed view of the city. Food options in the area, however, appear to be far pricier than in other places. An inevitable cost of getting a bite within the CBD area.  While still relatively picturesque and scenic during the day, its lack of shelter and covered areas left visitors like me absolutely scorched in the afternoon sun and scampering back into the air-conditioned comfort of Millenia Walk. For thrill-seekers and the dauntless who are willing to brave the afternoon heat however, the brilliant lighting in the afternoon makes for excellent keepsake photographs that accommodate shots of the Singapore Flyer.  Alternatively, the cool evening winds and stunning nighttime views of the city that this spot offers makes it a brilliant locale for an impromptu al fresco dinner to recuperate from the ubiquitous zoom meetings that occupy the most of our days.  A Better Tomorrow?  Be it dining on mall rooftops, upon bridges or even in car parks, outdoor dining has undeniably taken on a new meaning and perspective in recent weeks. The truth of the matter is, this phenomenon paints a particular picture – one that details our perseverance in sticking close to our love for food and communal interaction. It is also perhaps within these short glimpses of normalcy as we dine outdoors with our companion, that we seek some brief respite from the perilous reality we know as normalcy today.  That aside, safe distancing still takes priority. Even in the absence of the watchful sentinels that were the ubiquitous safe distancing ambassadors in red, I found that these outdoor diners were often responsible and space themselves (and their vehicles) far apart from each other. What the world had once brushed off as a temporary ailment has now evolved into a lived reality for all. It is indeed fortunate then, that the vast majority of us have come to accept and internalise this new iteration of normalcy, and this is perhaps the first crucial step towards a better tomorrow. Perhaps it is not so much the environment per se that is important, as much as it is the company that we share with our dining companions and friends. Regardless of whether you opt to indulge your outdoor meal on a cush  rooftop, fancy bridge, or even an open-air carpark, it is arguably these precious moments that are shared over food and drink that truly make for the most indelible memories, especially during this trying period. While you do so however, do be mindful that we are still a ways to go before we can fully enjoy this same experience in the future, but with more company then. We are not out of the woods just yet and there still remains work to be done. Until then, here’s to safety a la al fresco.  Do you think outdoor dining will be here to stay for the long term?

31,The Dave Parkash Video Shows Our Double Standards In Calling Out Racism,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-dave-parkash-video-double-standards-racism/,"Current Affairs, Opinion","Top image: Dave Parkash/Facebook. For the last couple of days, the Internet has been abuzz over the video of a couple being harassed by a Chinese man, simply for being mixed-race. I’m sure we’ve all seen it by now, so I won’t rehash all nine excruciating minutes. The video has gone viral and drawn condemnation all around, but it’s worth scrutinising what exactly this is directed at. The responses to it are telling about our current politics of acceptability, and what gets to ‘count’ as racism or not.  One response, typified by Minister K. Shanmugam’s, is first and foremost appalled by the shamelessness of the Chinese man — namely, that he actually came out and said those things in public.  What could he (and people like Beow Tan and the Choa Chu Kang attacker) have been thinking? Where are all these people coming from, and what has emboldened them to come forward and spew filth so openly?  I’m no proponent of thoughtcrime, but I think we can all agree that the litmus test for whether something is racist isn’t whether it’s aired in public. Racist statements are just as racist even if they’re muttered over the dinner table rather than hurled in the street, or silently brushed off rather than blowing up on social media. (Even, for that matter, if they’re unintentional.) To that end—as minority Singaporeans and residents, in particular, know all too well—racism is neither a new nor surprising phenomenon here. Videos like Dave’s only make it more difficult to pretend that Singapore is a racially harmonious, cosmopolitan utopia, but it shouldn’t be news that many people (especially Chinese people) have long gotten away with expressing similar prejudice. And in many cases, what they got away with was exactly the same as the man in the video: objection to interracial relationships. 
This leaves us with a curious double-standard where incidents like what happened to Dave are quickly condemned as racist, while we contort ourselves into all sorts of mental gymnastics trying to explain how others are not.
 In the video, the harasser draws on the trope of ‘Indian men coming to prey on Chinese girls’. It’s racist, sexist, and utterly cringeworthy, but show me a Chinese girl who hasn’t heard this at some point growing up. Unfortunately, sentiments like this are all too common. My parents were horrified by Dave’s video, and they have welcomed and adored my friends and exes of all races and backgrounds. But years ago, before I went off to university, they, too, implored me to ‘try not to come back with a Black guy’. It’s a difficult and ugly memory to grapple with, though part of me recognises my parents were probably only repeating what they had heard all their lives. Tropes like the apu neh neh, the predatory Bangla, thieving Africans—these were probably recited by their parents, too.  All the same, the problem can’t be easily dismissed as generational. You only need to look at dating apps, and the many accounts of minority Singaporeans being rejected by people who don’t want to date outside their race, to see this. It’s just explained differently: writing someone off on Tinder, rather than cussing them out in the street, gets to be justified as ‘personal choice’.  This leaves us with a curious double-standard where incidents like what happened to Dave are quickly condemned as racist, while we contort ourselves into all sorts of mental gymnastics trying to explain how others are not.  Heckle a mixed-race couple in the street: racist. Not wanting to date someone of a different race: personal preference. Attack an elderly Indian lady out for a stroll: racist. Refusing to rent a flat to an Indian tenant: personal preference. Post a job ad for tuition teachers saying ‘no minorities allowed’: racist. Explaining that ‘the parents are more comfortable with a Chinese teacher’: personal preference. (Chinese person intimidates someone from a minority race: racist. Minorities call out racism: racist!) Part of the problem is, perhaps, the reluctance to recognise that small things add up, and that playground slurs and familial warnings help prejudice take root. Part of it is a climate where dog-whistle racism is increasingly spouted by politicians and the press. But part of it is also that we conflate degrees of harm—which can exist on a spectrum— with whether something is racist or not. There shouldn’t be a gray area there. Clinging to arbitrary standards, where conduct only deserves censure if it breaches social norms like politeness and non-aggression, does nothing for understanding and unity. Socially endorsed racism is still racism, and a quiet bigot is just as concerning as an unapologetic one.  Calling what happened to Dave and his girlfriend a ‘wake-up call’ doesn’t do justice to how minorities have long put up with things like this. But if it does achieve anything, perhaps it’s exposing the false binary around what is unacceptable and what can be tolerated. To paraphrase the famous line from Animal Farm: all forms of racism are racist, and some are not more racist than others.  And for what it’s worth: we really need to get over this obsession with other people’s relationships. Whether the parties are of different races, the same sex, have a 20-year age gap, or are into bondage and food play— hell, even if someone is single and not dating anyone at all— it’s really no-one else’s business.

32,"These Stalls Used To Fuel Workers At Industrial Parks. Now, They Are Barely Surviving",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-stalls-fuel-workers-industrial-parks-barely-surviving/,"Current Affairs, Features","All photography by the author for RICE Media. Top image by Tey Liang Jin. Three words: They are screwed. With most of us forced to work from home, the de facto circuit breaker we are experiencing now has been a nightmare for stallholders at industrial parks. This is pretty much a death knell since their businesses cater mainly to workers there. It is 2.25pm on a Tuesday. I’ve decided to visit the 280 Cafe coffee shop at Harvest@Woodlands, which is located in Woodlands Industrial Park.  The journey there takes me more than half an hour from Woodlands Bus Interchange, as I board bus 858 and alight seven stops later. After alighting, I walk for another 15 minutes before arriving. Given how far-flung the coffee shop is, it is no wonder places like this get overlooked unless one works there.  As if the restrictions were not damaging enough to the stallholders there, they were dealt with a Covid-19 cluster from the same building during the last week of May.  The coffee shop is eerily quiet, with sound coming only from the humming of the large overhead fans. Among the beige tables taped with the familiar red-white barricade tape, I spot 31-year-old Jomin Goh taking a breather in front of her noodle stall.  1. Noodles are difficult to takeaway – Jomin Goh, 31 Dressed in a red, short-sleeved qipao top, Jomin tells me the deserted scene of the coffee shop is a daily sight—even during lunch time—since May 16 when Phase Two (Heightened Alert) started.  Normally, Ms Goh doesn’t even have time to rest because long queues are a constant when she whips up piping hot bowls of fishball noodles or bak chor mee from 8 AM to 7 PM daily, except on Saturdays (when she operates half-day) and Sundays (when she closes).  Her business used to flourish, selling more than 150 bowls of noodles daily. Those were the good old days when office ladies, who make up the majority of her customers, had lunch at her stall.  But sadly, most of them are now forced to work from home and Ms Goh struggles to even dish out 80 bowls per day. She said men cannot be depended on either—gastronomically speaking—because they usually prefer heavier meals such as cai fan (economic rice) over lighter fare from her stall. Ms Goh forks out almost $2,000 a month for rent and other miscellaneous fees. Last year, she received relief during the circuit breaker and paid about $500 a month after accounting for the subsidies—which was still a burden since she barely sold 20 bowls a day then. I asked her: Why don’t you hop onto the delivery platforms? Isn’t this the most logical thing to do?  Food sellers like Ms Goh are not stupid. Obviously she is aware of them. Due to poor business during the circuit breaker last year, she applied for her stall to be listed on Grab, FoodPanda and Deliveroo. But she lamented that none of them got back to her due to the large volume of applications.  Ms Goh did not follow up with the application process after the circuit breaker because business gradually picked up. She reckoned that by accepting online orders from those platforms, she would struggle to cope as there were already many orders from customers at her stall.  Little did she know the same fate would befall her again this year with the dine-in restrictions.  I can see she takes pride in her noodles, as she describes enthusiastically that the chilli paste, fried shallots and crispy pork lard are all prepared in house once every few days—less commonly seen these days as many hawkers take the easy way out and buy them from a supplier.  And it is this same pride which makes her reluctant to embark on delivery platforms: her food was never meant to be dabao-ed in the first place. She wants her customers to feel satisfied eating her noodles.  By the time the delivery person in the signature green long-sleeved shirt arrives and hangs your bag of mee pok tah (dried noodles) on the door, the noodles would have gone soggy and become an inseparable lump of mess. This is not the kind of food Ms Goh wants her customers to chomp on.  I pity Ms Goh, who is a working mother of four children, aged four, five, six and 10. Life is not easy for this Malaysian here on a long-term visit pass. Her Singaporean husband, 51, used to help her at the stall but has gone to look for other jobs in the past year to supplement the family’s income. He is now working as a linen attendant at a hotel.  Like me, Ms Goh has her fingers crossed that restrictions will be lifted on June 13, because things are not looking good should there be an extension.  “If this situation persists for another two to three months, I might consider closing down the stall,” she says.  2. A double whammy for HMJ Malay Cuisine – Razali, 58 At Gold 186 Food Court, I get hold of 58-year-old Mr Razali at his corner stall and he immediately tells me the no dine-in rule is a double whammy. He is a newcomer in this F&B business—at least in the coffee shop industry.  The opening of his stall after Chinese New Year this year was actually a pivot from his previous business of wedding catering, which he was running for 15 years. Due to the pandemic, he found it untenable to continue his family business of more than five decades.  With the current restrictions which only allow customers to take away their meals, he claims his sales have plummeted by more than half, with barely enough money left to pay his rent of about $4,000 a month.  Meanwhile, it does not help when he—as well as other stallholders—depends on workers from the nearby semiconductor factory Micron (a 10-min walk away) to have their lunch here.  According to him, due to the pandemic, Micron has instructed their staff—some of whom are still working on site—not to leave the workplace for meals and consume food sold in the factory instead. The factory did not respond to queries on this as of publication time.  The HDB dwellers in Woodlands don’t patronise his stall either.   “HDB there already got makan, they want to come here for what? So leceh, ” Mr Razali says. He opens his stall only on weekdays, from 6.30 AM to about 3 PM in the afternoon. Even among the few who drop by his stall, such as taxi drivers, they pick fewer dishes for their nasi lemak than they normally do. Not because Mr Razali’s food is unaffordable (his prices are modest at $3 to $4) or that people are tightening their belts. But these customers who have to eat their meals in the car prefer to keep it simple. Maybe one chicken wing and a fried egg to go with their rice, tops, so the packet of food is easier to hold onto on the go, Mr Razali says. But Mr Razali is not one who throws in the towel easily. Instead of moping when his catering business became untenable, he opened a food stall. Instead of swatting flies at the coffee shop, he dabbles a little in his old trade by preparing bento sets for couples who push on with their weddings (solemnisations can still take place, within limits). Better to have bread crumbs than nothing—an attitude I see in Mr Razali.  Then what about food delivery platforms, I ask him. “You ask the claypot guy lah, he uses all these!” gesturing me to another stallholder a few tables away who sells claypot dishes.  3. Business is still horrible despite being on three delivery platforms – Au Chee Meng, 39 I walk over to the Claypot Delight stall, and clearly, its stallholder is a forward-looking one. Mr Au Chee Meng, 39, has numerous food delivery labels attached to his stall-front—GrabFood, foodpanda and Deliveroo.  Not bad, I tell myself, business should not be too bad. Online, commentators have lauded the usefulness of these delivery platforms in the—pardon the cliche—pandemic new normal. Statistics from SingStat have also painted an optimistic picture, with Enterprise Singapore funding 5% of the commission cost charged by four food delivery platforms—including Bungkus—until June 15. These platforms usually impose a charge of about 30% of the total food order.  The Infocomm Media Development Authority also launched the Digital Resilience Bonus cash grant last year to help stallholders like Mr Au to go digital. But if food sellers are indeed benefitting from food delivery apps, Mr Au isn’t one of them. He claims his business has fallen by 70%, selling only 20 to 30 claypots worth of food a day. This is a blow for someone who used to sell more than 100 claypots.  “I don’t even know how to think anymore,” Mr Au sighs. He said his rent and miscellaneous fees which add up to about $3,600 have been weighing down on him.  He blames his dismal business on the inaccessibility of the coffee shop. While it may be convenient for workers nearby to pop by for a meal, residents don’t do so—the nearest flats are a kilometer away and walking there takes you 20 minutes. Food delivery riders are not keen to serve this area either, Mr Au says.  Like every stall in the coffee shop, he also relies heavily on his customers from Micron. Before the restrictions, the coffee shop would normally be packed to the seams with more than half occupied by Micron workers. But the crowds are no longer here.  Despite the difficulties, Mr Au soldiers on. He continues to dish out piping hot claypots of curry chicken and tom yum soup every single day, from 11 AM to 9 PM.  He’s also gotten creative with his outreach efforts, getting his friend who is an insurance agent to advertise for him. His clients who order those claypot dishes from Mr Au enjoy a 10% referral discount. For the past few weeks, I have read countless stories online about the plight of hawkers, especially those in the central business district. Like stallholders in the industrial parks, they are also suffering from a dearth of customers as most of us are working from home. Some even chose to shut during this period of tighter restrictions.  For now, they stand to benefit from a one-month rent waiver and full subsidy of table cleaning and centralised dishwashing services from the government if they are managed by the National Environment Agency.  CBD stalls have also had their fair bit of media coverage in recent days (here and here). The more well-known ones in the area—numerous of them—may have loyal customers from other parts of the island patronising them, even if they don’t have their usual clientele of office-workers.  But those stalls nestled deep inside the industrial parks are usually nondescript and cater specifically to workers who work in the vicinity. Few of us would make a trip down to these food establishments to have a meal because of how inaccessible they are.  When the government imposed the no dine-in rule, these stalls suffered, even with measures such as the Job Support Scheme and Covid-19 recovery grants.  The road ahead looks bleak too: for coffee shops not under government agencies such as JTC Corporation and Singapore Land Authority, they will receive only half a month of rental relief instead of a month’s worth.  And only from mid-August this year will the taxman dole out the rental support cash payout directly to coffee shop operators and their stallholders. These stallholders also do not receive any waiver for dish collection services (or any other miscellaneous fees for the matter) from the government, which is understandably so for privately-owned coffee shops. If they do, it is usually due to the goodwill of their operators. I’d say the odds do not seem to be in their favour. These are stories of persistence, determination and maybe even desperation. We can only wish them all the best in surviving the rough journey ahead. After all, they are the ones who keep the industrial parks fed and running.

33,What Goes Into a $5 Hor Fun?: The Economics of Running An F&B Business In A Pandemic,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-food-the-economics-of-running-singapore-f-b-business-pandemic/,"Culture, Food","Photos by Liang Jin Tey; annotations by RICE’s photo department. If COVID-19 has rallied us around anything, it’s local F&B businesses. The pandemic has already claimed countless eateries, many of them beloved (RIP, Thaipan and your glorious butter squid). Since the start of the current ban on indoor dining, social media has been abuzz with campaigns aimed at averting further losses. This said, most of us, myself included, know butt-all about restaurant economics. We cringe if our local bak chor mee stall raises prices, or at shelling out $15 for avocado toast, just because we know what we’d pay for the ingredients at NTUC—but this doesn’t account for all the costs that go into making a dish, or how much restaurants can make at the end of the day.  So armed with an empty stomach and a list of questions, I set out to eat my way around Singapore in search of answers. The idea: get F&B owners to break down the costs and challenges of staying in business, using a dish from their menus. The 4th Gen Zi Char Hawker: Tang Kay Kee  Debbie, the upbeat 4th-gen owner of Tang Kay Kee, perks up when I arrive at her stall around 3:00PM. “I thought you were a customer,” she explains. The business was started by her great grandfather in the 1940s, before moving into fixed premises at Hong Lim Centre. Today, Debbie’s great-aunt owns the business, and she and a cousin came on board a few years ago. On top of zi char dishes, they offer a limited lunch menu of items like rice and hor fun bowls. Ingredients (approx. 27% of gross margins) Zi char places make most of their profits on dishes like har cheong gai or cereal prawns, compared to ‘main’ carbs like fried rice. Debbie illustrated this with their popular Mixed Hor Fun lunch bowl: ingredients alone cost the business nearly 50% the menu price ($5). In absolute numbers, there’s not much profit to be made. “For lunchtime, people go for ‘filler’ items like carbs, and my grand-aunt always gives people more because she doesn’t want customers to go back hungry,” says Debbie. “But per head spending for these is a lot lower than if people get dishes.”  Moreover, zi char is usually only ordered at dinnertime— the period of their business which has been worst hit. While they are getting by at lunchtime, thanks to lingering office workers in the area, dinner takings have plunged about 50% without families and large groups coming in. Overheads Rent: Approx $2,000 a month for two stalls. Debbie considers them lucky, because this is cheaper than what many surrounding stalls pay: as an older-generation hawker business, their rent is partially subsidised. (As tenants in an NEA-managed hawker business, their rent is currently being waived during Phase 2 (HA)). Cleaning charges: $800 for two stalls ($400 each). While these have also been waived during Phase 2 (HA), she isn’t sure how this will change when the upcoming measures to get diners to clear their own trays at hawker centres take effect. While this would reduce the need for a clearing service, they haven’t heard if the charges will be slashed accordingly. Packaging costs: With the entire F&B industry pivoting to take-aways and deliveries thanks to the pandemic, packaging costs have shot up, pushing their operating costs up as well. Due to a shortage of white cardboard boxes (8-10 cents per piece), they had to start using more plastic takeaway containers (14-17 cents per piece).  This is partially passed on to consumers: they now charge a flat rate of 30 cents for takeaway packaging, including disposables like cutlery, though this is waived for large orders. “My aunt wasn’t happy about this, but I explained that we really don’t have a choice,” said Debbie. “We just couldn’t keep absorbing the costs. Some of our regulars weren’t pleased too, especially older customers, but most younger consumers seem to recognise it’s necessary.” Given how rare young hawkers are, I’m curious as to why Debbie joined the business, especially after she shares her hours: 8:30am to 10:00pm most days, although she has breaks in between. The punishing schedule means late nights out and impromptu meals with friends are rarely possible. She shrugged. “I’m with my family, so there’s a stronger incentive for me to keep doing this. My grand-aunt has been doing this for a long time, and she keeps us all grounded.” Nonetheless, she knows exactly how hard it is to find staff, having struggled with hiring challenges even before Phase 2. NEA-managed hawker stalls like hers are only allowed to hire Singaporeans and PRs—but given the pay, unsociable hours, and perceived lack of prestige, few locals want the gig. “I think this is why a lot of hawkers, especially elderly couples, just do what they can and close up when they’re done for the day,” she surmised. “If they had higher labour costs, this would drive up the price of their food, and I don’t think Singaporeans are willing to pay more just yet.” The Small Dessert Shop: Merely Ice Cream Things were grim at Merely Ice Cream, a small-batch ice cream shop with two branches. “I don’t see an endgame any time soon,” says Ying Wai, the owner, as we chat by the glass shopfront of his Sunshine Plaza outlet. Since the start of Phase 2 (HA), takings here have plunged around 70-80%, while their Tampines outlet has fallen 60-70%. Of the three places I interviewed for this story, they’ve taken the worst hit. Being in the middle of the museum and university district, the branch used to attract significant footfall from office workers, students, and—pre-pandemic—tourists. Today, I’m the sole customer in the store, and the only people outside are delivery riders walking past.  Ingredients (approx. 27% of gross margins) If there’s a silver lining in all this, it’s that ice cream is a relatively flexible product. Production can be adjusted depending on demand, and sudden changes don’t result in the same amount of scrambling as highly perishable cooked food, like cai fan. “Although walk-in demand was hit badly, most of our ingredients have a longer shelf life of a few weeks to a few months, so there’s less wastage and you don’t have to throw everything out at the end of the day,” said Ying Wai. To adjust to the falling demand, they’ve consolidated their supply orders for the two outlets. Still, I can’t help but wince as he shares some numbers: where they used to order 8-10kg of pasteurized egg yolks per outlet per week, they’re now getting by on 2-4kg. Overheads Rent: Approx $6,000 per month for a ground floor, street-facing unit in Sunshine Plaza, a strata mall. Due to the prime location, this is on the high side for the area.  (Financial assistance measures for Phase 2 (HA) were announced shortly after our interview. Ying Wai is still working out how the business will benefit from these, but expects to receive rebates of 50% and 100% for the Sunshine Plaza and Tampines outlets respectively.)  Labour: While they’ve benefitted from the Jobs Support Scheme, this has been limited by a snag: the rebate only applies to full-time employees, and the bulk of his staff are part-timers. (PT staff earn about $7.50-$8.50 an hour, depending on shift, experience, and commitment.) “I feel really bad not being able to give them shifts, because many of them are students paying living expenses and so on,” said Ying Wai. “I’d been planning to expand the team before Phase 2 kicked in, but that’s on pause because there’s simply no work.” Delivery: Both outlets are on Grab and Deliveroo, for which they pay around 30% commission. They also take in-house orders via their website, sent out via Lalamove (flat delivery fee of $12, waived for orders above $45). While Ying Wai finds the app charges bearable, on the basis that they get marketing and exposure on top of delivery services, the clear preference is for in-house orders. Orders tend to be larger, and even if they waive the delivery charge as an incentive, “all in, it’s still cheaper than using Grab or Deliveroo.” To my surprise, he explains that despite the push to #supportlocal, delivery demand has actually fallen compared to last year. Since the start of the pandemic, the whole food delivery business has become more competitive. Operators—including home-based businesses— have proliferated, and everyone is competing for a slice of the pie. Moreover, the ‘gifting novelty’ of circuit breaker, which was enough to tide them through last year’s closure, has worn off. “Last year, people couldn’t see each other at all, so the volume of gifts was much higher. People would send ice-cream to their friends, boyfriends, as Mother’s Day gifts, and so on,” he explained. “That’s dropped off now.” The Institution: Warong Nasi Pariaman For my last stop, I wanted to look at something different: an established restaurant with a decades-long history and a loyal customer base. Warong Nasi Pariaman, located a stone’s throw from the Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam, is said to be the oldest nasi padang restaurant in Singapore. The business is currently helmed by Mr Jumrin and his family, whose father set up the restaurant in 1948. Ingredients (% of gross margins: …it’s complicated.) Despite his gentle, fatherly air, Mr Jumrin looks exasperated— as far as I can tell behind his mask, anyway — when I ask if he can break down a standard nasi padang order. He gestures to the bento box in front of us. “Sophie, look at this. Got so much. How to break down like that?”  Looking at the tray, I concede he has a point. The mix must contain at least 20-30 ingredients — and there are at least another dozen dishes at the counter downstairs. What he can tell me, at least, is that the cost of ingredients has skyrocketed over the years. Mr Jumrin still goes to Tekka Market early in the morning to get some groceries, and where $400 or $500 would cover this in the past, he now forks out as much as $1,000. They manage the volatility of market prices by relying on suppliers, some of whom they’ve worked with for years.  Although he says they’re not doing too badly in Phase 2 (HA), business has still suffered from the various restrictions.  Extras like drinks and rice top-ups are where they make the highest margins, but those have vanished with the loss of dine-in customers. During Ramadan, bulk orders for iftar also fell, and they no longer benefit from walk-in customers stopping in after prayers at the Sultan Mosque. “Normally, that mosque has a capacity of 5,000,” says Mr. Jumrin. “Now, it’s more like 50 or 150.” Overheads Rent: Although he declines to share the exact amount on the record, the business pays a sizeable five-figure sum for two units. (While they used to allow dine-in customers on both floors, the upper storey has been closed for the last year.) Labour: Costs here have grown, albeit not due to the pandemic. The business employs a handful of work permit holders, and the local qualifying salary—ie. the minimum amount that a local worker must receive in order for the business to be allowed to hire foreigners— has been increasing. (It is now $1,400, up from $1,200 previously.) “So for example, for five local workers, that’s an extra $1,000 a month. Small things like that, but they add up.”  Other costs: The business budgets for tax duties in their cash flow, on top of regular utilities like electricity, water, insurance, packaging, and delivery costs.  Throughout our interview, Mr Jumrin keeps stressing that making ends meet is enough. His priority each month is just to break even with no debts, and ensure that all the staff are paid. Nonetheless, the sustainability of the business is a growing concern. “Frankly, if you ask whether we still can make money, yes,” he says. “But margins are very, very small compared to my father’s time.” “ I’m here because I’ve been here for 30 years and I am committed to it. Older generations like me, we just keep going. It’s just the way things are now, but young people don’t want to start a traditional business like this. So what to do?” By the end of my eating tour, I was stuffed, sweaty, and fighting a losing battle against my food coma. (Digestion: 1. Deadline panic: 0).  Even with the urge to nap, however, one thing was clear: while the loss of dine-in customers has blown a hole in business’ balance sheets, many of the underlying challenges also preceded the pandemic.   In fairness, it’s no secret that F&B has always been one of the hardest industries to make a buck in, but COVID-19 has made it painfully clear how these businesses are vulnerable to forces beyond their control. While margins on ingredients are generally good, prices are volatile to supply shocks like trade disruption and climate disasters. After that, overheads like rent and labour gobble up most of what’s left. While all three places I spoke to have raised their prices over the years, this is barely keeping pace with costs.  Moreover, even after COVID-19 recedes, issues like labour shortages, business sustainability, and the difficulty of changing customers’ mindsets will persist. There’s no clear way of solving any of these. If, like a vaccine, a pill could be developed to cure the delusion that hawker prices can stay fixed for all eternity, I’m sure Debbie would love to hear about it.  So even if it’s really sticking a band-aid on the problem: #supportlocal. Buy from your favourite places (and get a takeaway or their in-house delivery, if you can). Suck up that extra packaging charge, or bring your own containers.  It’s the least we can do.

34,Should Sex Offenders Receive Treatment Instead of Punishment? A Psychotherapist Weighs In,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-sex-offenders-treatment-or-punishment/,"Current Affairs, Features","Top image by Marisse Caine. Last week, Leonard Teo Min Xuan, the administrator of the obscene chat group SG Nasi Lemak, was sentenced to a year of mandatory treatment. The verdict came after a report by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he suffered major depressive disorder that impaired his judgment, and led to him committing the offences.  Teo’s case brings to light important questions on whether more sex offenders should be made to go through mandatory treatment, and whether we should be treating sex offences as a public health issue as opposed to a criminal one.  Psychotherapy and addiction recovery can be important tools in the treatment of sex offenders, and many professionals in the field believe that a treatment approach can help to address the underlying social issues behind rampant sex offence cases. To gain further insight into these issues, we speak to Andrew da Roza, an Addictions Psychotherapist at Promises Healthcare, who has experience working with sex offenders. He explains why we should explore treatment as a default response to sexual offences: Rice: Do you advocate for sex offence cases to be treated as  mental health issues, rather than criminal offences? Andrew da Roza (ADR): Where possible, yes. But we need to differentiate the presentations of sex offenders.  It is possible to separate sex offenders into two categories: sex offenders who are unlikely to respond to treatment, and individuals diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD)—who are susceptible to treatment. CSBD is defined as an impulse control mental disorder by the World Health Organisation. There are different therapists and therapeutic interventions for these groups. If a client has CSBD and their sexual behaviour is confined to Internet porn only, and this has led them to join “homemade” platforms like SG Nasi Lemak, it is likely that treatment will be effective. It does depend on their motivation and their response to therapy.  However, clients who present with more severe forms of sexual behaviour—such as rape, sexual assault, and the exploitation of vulnerable people (such as children, the elderly, and those with severe mental or physical disabilities)—treatment is less likely to work. In some cases, the only option may be to protect society from their behaviour by incarceration and close monitoring in the community.   Rice: How do we differentiate between sex offenders who deserve treatment, and those who don’t?  ADR: A sex offender who is unable or unwilling to take on recovery will commonly present with personality disorders such as Antisocial Personality Disorder. They are likely to lack remorse, guilt, empathy and compassion. Their actions are exploitative and tend to be malicious and premeditated. They may also be indifferent to the consequences of their actions and may feel entitled to act in the way that they do.     These individuals are less likely to connect and cooperate with their therapist or see that their behaviour is harmful, and therefore, do not have the motivation to change.  Recovery work involves joining peer-led, 12 step recovery groups like, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Such sex offenders are likely to be resistant to joining or even be disruptive within such groups.   Individuals with CSBD who do not suffer from Antisocial Personality Disorder tend to be more suitable candidates for treatment.  They may have underlying mental health issues that led them to sexually acting out. These could be, for example, major depressive disorder; general or social  anxiety disorder; borderline personality disorder—which are treatable. Some may also suffer from addictions.  These individuals tend to be significantly distressed by their sexual behaviour and the damage it is causing in their lives and in the lives of others.  They may often be ashamed and even loath this side of themselves. The therapist will then seek to treat their underlying disorders, as well as CSBD.  Rice: How does one get a Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder from watching porn? ADR: Broadly, the same dynamics occur across addictions—whether it be porn, gambling, or drugs. Some of the factors that make a person vulnerable to CSBD also make them vulnerable to other addictions.     Compulsivity occurs when the “reward centre” in the brain is “hijacked” by the behaviour, such as porn watching, if the behaviour is frequently repeated over long periods of time.  Growing tolerance and withdrawal will feed compulsivity, so over time, more porn of more novel, exciting, disgusting or dangerous nature will be needed to get the same effect.       The porn industry knows this, so they  will ensure that a porn user transitions from one porn genre to another until they land on problematic genres such as  non consensual porn, revenge porn, under age porn, and violent and abusive porn—which were the genres discovered on the Sg Nasi Lemak chat site. As the brain gets desensitised to the genres, the porn user may eventually find themselves watching a genre they don’t even enjoy or a genre that would have disgusted or even alarmed them in the past. 
For example, I have worked with men who are not homosexual but end up getting aroused by homosexual porn because of this spiral.
 There are also men who have watching child pornography, but who in the “real world”, would never consider acting sexually with a child or fantasize sexually about them.   However, if someone goes straight to this kind of content, it may be a much more complex issue that may not be a result of CSBD.   Rice: It sometimes feels like the online space is becoming increasingly dangerous, and filled with places like Sg Nasi Lemak. Why is this happening? ADR: To understand why these spaces are rampant, we need to look at why they grow in the first place. Porn addiction cannot be looked at in a vacuum, as it is tied to a spectrum of familial, religious, social and cultural issues. The first of which is the lack of appropriate sex-education throughout children’s development.  Currently, sex-ed is not taught in schools at every level in a way that appropriately addresses sexuality, intimacy, respect, and consent. And when sex-ed doesn’t teach these things, but only emphasizes how ugly some STDs are and the dangers of pregnancy, children will internalise the notion that sex is always a disgusting, horrible, dangerous and fearful act.  Without appropriate sex education, children and teens turn to porn for their “education”. Porn is “educating” children to objectify men and women, to accept and normalise non-consentual sex, and to believe that abusive sex is appropriate. It may also give children unrealistic expectations or demands of their future sexual partners.  Similarly, if sex is a taboo topic at home, it’s hard for children and teens to gain a healthy understanding of consent, sexuality, sensuality and intimacy. Parents who only talk about the dangers of sex and solely focus on sexual abstinence take the risk of further instilling the idea that sex is ‘dangerous’ and ‘bad”, immoral and unhealthy. Their children’s healthy sexual development will suffer and this may lead to fractious, difficult and unsatisfying relationships when they become adults.  Rice: Why do we see more men turn to these toxic outlets, like porn or group chats, as compared to women?  ADR: If we add  the lack of adequate sex education, with socially perpetuated toxic masculinity, we have a recipe for disaster.  Social and cultural norms pressure boys to be strong, tough, self-reliant, and to show little emotion. This creates men who feel isolated, lonely and incapable of expressing and managing their emotions in a healthy way. They become vulnerable to “self-medicating” their loneliness, emotional suffering and frustrations by turning to addictions like gaming or porn.  Another issue is that male dominant environments often  make matters worse. From NS to boys schools, the prevailing narrative towards women can quickly turn to objectification, disrespect,  competition and conquest. And in chat groups like SG Nasi Lemak, men egg each other on by normalising and encouraging what is abnormal and destructive behaviour. Rice: How do we start addressing these sex offence cases with public health in mind?  ADR: If we treat all sex offenders  the same—as criminals—we miss the opportunity to treat those who can be helped; and we risk ignoring the social and educational issues that may be at the root of the problem.  It would be helpful for all men who are investigated for sex offence cases, such as being online predators, to be given a psychiatric evaluation.  From there, clinicians can determine whether the offender can be treated and is willing to take action to recover. If they have spiralled in their sexual behaviour because of CSBD and other conditions, they should be given an opportunity to recover. In these cases, a mandatory treatment order may be helpful.  If they are simply incarcerated without treatment, they are likely to relapse on their release, once again exposing the community to danger.    Rice: On a macro level, how do we start addressing the increasing number of sex offence cases in society?   ADR: A socio-cultural approach needs to be taken to target underlying social issues. This should start with research on porn use and its effect on children and youth.  For example in collaboration with schools, the SAF, and institutes of higher learning, independant researchers could ask students anonymously, what they know about sex, what sex means to them, whether they use porn and if so, when they started, and so on. Research like this will give the Government and those in the mental health treatment space an idea of the scale and severity of the public health problem, and what resources to apply to it.   This research can also  be used to create robust sex eductation initatives, to teach children, youth and adults about mental health, sex, sexuality, sensuality and intimacy; and how to avoid, manage and seek help for CSBD when it arises. With this information, men can learn to be more aware of their peers’ behaviour towards women,  call each other out on disrespectful and damaging behaviour, and most importantly–be aware when they themselves are falling into toxic spirals.

35,"After Dover, Will Clementi Forest Be Next On The Chopping Board?",https://www.ricemedia.co/dover-will-clementi-forest-next-chopping-board/,"Current Affairs, Features","Trudging through the maze of vegetation, we brush off waist-high foliage lazily trawling our sides, gingerly setting shoe to soil until we finally emerge into a landscape reminiscent of Jurassic Park. With the ethereal morning mist draped across the valley of lush greenery, it is a marvel that this terrain sits next to a bustling tarmac road.  Elliott and Inez, a pair of self-professed nature enthusiasts, have brought me out to trek Clementi forest in the wee hours of the morning. As nature guides and educators, they belong to a burgeoning group of Gen-Z environmental influencers. From Tik Tok dances (“I am a reluctant participant,” says Elliott) to speaking at seminars (cue the recent Singapore Heritage Festival), the lovebirds have taken the cause of championing our local habitats to heart. We’re in Clementi forest today because the couple wants to show me what might be disappearing next.  Earlier this year, the outcry over Dover Forest sparked waves of action, from petitions to parliamentary speeches. While a laudable milestone in the uphill battle to protect our green spaces, Elliot maintains that Dover is a unique case study.  “Dover was unprecedented because prior to this, so many of our forests were disappearing but not as many people cared about the issue. But with Dover, it was the residents living in the area who didn’t want to see it go. That’s not always the case with other green spaces,” Elliott muses.  Inez nods in agreement. “Have you heard of Tengah forest?” she asks, to my puzzlement.  Tengah forest is (or was) an approximately 700 hectares patch of greenery teeming with life, housing predators of the air such as the near-threatened Grey-headed Fish Eagle, as well as land troopers like the critically endangered Sunda pangolin. Sitting snugly between the Western Water Catchment and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, it also serves as an important connector facilitating the migration of wildlife from one forest patch to another.  Unfortunately, being located remotely meant that there was little fanfare when it was announced that the forest would soon give way to what was termed the “Tengah Forest Town”, an HDB residential estate resembling the size of Bishan. In fact, slots for the upcoming Build-To-Order (BTO) flats recently opened up in May 2021. Not lost on me is the irony of its name or its tagline where future residents can experience being “At Home with Nature”.  Inez is quick to reassure me that rather than a mercenary bulldozing, there were indeed mitigation measures announced like the setting aside of a 5km long, 100m wide green corridor to ensure connectivity between the catchments, as well as a wildlife shepherding exercise to safely relocate the animals to neighbouring habitats. But can we really heave a sigh of relief and congratulate ourselves on acquiring these concessions?  Woefully inadequate, is how the folks at the Nature Society of Singapore puts it. The land area of the corridor, which totals only 10% of the original forest or less, is inadequate in accounting for the volume of species present, while the mere 100m width of the corridor will see the slender strip being sandwiched closely by the Kranji expressway on the northern flank and disturbances coming from a dense housing estate on the southern flank.  “We also need to think about the journey once wildlife exits the green corridor,” Dr Ho Hua Chew, vice-chair of the Conservation Committee of the Nature Society, says. Highlighting the fragmented connectivity to surrounding reserves, he elaborates, “Currently there are only segmented green patches here and there, not a complete passageway to safety. In essence, an animal still has to cross the Kranji Expressway to get to their next destination.” This is why Dr Ho and his team have advocated for building further eco links and preserving two core areas of forest patches on either end of the green corridor. “It’s a pitstop for them to take cover and get back their confidence before pushing on through the corridor,” he explains. Constantly relocating wildlife is proving to be a feeble solution too. In fact, Dr Ho posits that wildlife may have originally entered Tengah Forest as the carrying capacities of other forests were likely exceeded. As we tear down more and more, we will be left cramming our wildlife like sardines in a can to whatever green space is available. After all, we guided animals out of Lentor Forest into the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and then, later on, decided to run the Cross Island Line (albeit 70m down deep) through said reserve. As it stands, the current fate of Tengah is uncertain, a common refrain when it comes to most of our forests. The obscurity of our natural spaces is what drives Elliott and Inez to frequently lead tours to uncommon habitats like forests or coastlines, in hopes that getting acquainted with an area would help people care deeply about it. “People get so stoked just getting to hold a starfish in their hands,” Inez says. “There are actually so many cool things in Singapore that people don’t know about, so I love that I get to help people discover this side of our island.”As we continue our hike, they point out the richness of biodiversity with ease. Did you hear that? It’s the straw headed bulbul, Elliott says breezily. Elsewhere, Inez is admiring a leaf she’s picked up from the ground. It’s not every day you hear someone describe a leaf as cute. To understand more about the success of mitigation measures, I ask about efforts at re-planting when a forest is cleared, such as in the recommendations following the Cross Island Line saga. “It takes a long time to engineer a regrowth forest, and no matter how well you do it, you can never get back the same makeup of biodiversity. It’s effective if you’re talking about carbon offset, but it’s a loss on the biodiversity front,” Elliott patiently explains. A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.  My interest is piqued on this topic of biodiversity. To the layman, the case for biodiversity just seems like preserving for the sake of variety. Is it just so we have cool things to gawk at?  Both of them react viscerally to my insinuation, to which Inez flatly responds, “if there’s no biodiversity, we’ll all die.”  The two try to paint it for me simplistically.  Bats, like the fruit bat or the cave nectar bat, are indispensable in the pollination of the nation’s favourite fruit (subject to personal discretion)—durian. Wipeout its habitat, lose the bat, and we will have no more green, thorny shells to crack open.  To find out more, I turn to Dr Andie Ang, a Mandai Nature Research Scientist and President of the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore). “Firstly, I just want to say that tree planting is great, it really is,” she says with gusto over our Zoom meeting, hands clasped anxiously to reassure me she is not a tree-planting hater. “But planting a million trees is not the same as keeping a million trees.” Newly planted trees are usually scattered around different landscapes, such as in a housing estate or by the roadside. The outcome is far from replicating the dense, rich environment of a forest primed to support existing biodiversity. From acting as a natural water filter against flash floods to curbing sweltering temperatures, the benefits of strong ecosystems are endless.  “We have to look at forests as a whole and not in compartments. You cannot talk about intact forests without talking about the wildlife that lives in the forest. So even if you preserve a green corridor or a strip of greenery, but if it’s an inadequate space for wildlife to really thrive in, that’s not fully protecting our biodiversity,” Dr Ang says.  Dr Ang would know. She has devoted her time to conservation efforts for the Raffles’ banded langur, a jet black monkey whose home has been constantly threatened on our shores. Amid deep sighs, Dr Ang tells me about a roadkill incident of one such langur in 2017 on the BKE. The langur was most likely attempting to cross from the Central Catchment Nature Reserve to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and video footage showed the langur perched on the central divider in the middle of the road, wavering in its course of action.  “It might have tried to cross, realized that the traffic was too busy, tried to go back, and then, bam,” Dr Ang says sadly. Ironically, the kill spot was only 650m south of the eco-link corridor. “That’s the thing right, it’s not like animals can read signs telling them that there is a safe corridor further down the road,” Dr Ang laments regretfully. “If we’re removing someone’s home, we need to think about how to provide proper alternative homes.” Back at Clementi, Elliott is making me squirm with a story on how baby wasps feed inside figs.  “Only certain species of wasps, the fig wasps, can pollinate fig flowers. The wasp mum will crawl inside, lay her eggs and then die. The inside of fig fruits are food for her little grubs, so if you take an unripe fig fruit and peel it open, you’ll see all of them wriggling inside.” Upon seeing my appalled face, Elliott laughs. “Yeah, it sounds quite gross. But once they mature, they all fly out of the fig fruit, and that’s when we pick it and eat it. And figs, in turn, are important food sources for other animals, like birds, monkeys, even bats.” Talk about biodiversity.  “I think our generation has a lot of nature influencers talking about climate change, like reducing plastic and all that, but I do think biodiversity has been largely overshadowed,” Elliott quips.  Karl Png, 24, from the Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity, is certainly well versed to speak on Gen Z advocacy. A two-year-old organisation, the youth team behind SYVB boasts an impressive roster of advocacy work, from organizing youth consultations and forums to participating in international roundtables.  The idea of advocacy can bear a bitter taste in the sceptic’s mouth, so I question if he gets jaded hearing about these cases with very little fruit over and over again. Does the work put in actually equate to a proportionate outcome? “Let’s just put it this way,” Karl responds. “I am not certain of the fate of Dover forest, but it’s way better than if it were business as usual.” As we speak, Karl and his team are in the midst of finishing up an infographic on yet another case of undue clearance at Sembawang Woods, where an 800m section of the North-South viaduct is slated to pass through the forest patch. Karl gives an approving nod to the mitigation measures taken in this case, albeit calling for connectivity corridors to be sufficiently vegetated and widened.  “The thing about biodiversity that people don’t always grasp,” Karl states, “is that we are part of it. It does take a toll seeing spaces get culled all the time, but the motivation comes from knowing that it’s these organisms that feed me and give me clean air and water. It’s that gratitude I have toward nature because of all the underappreciated services it provides.”  Elliott echoes a similar thread. “We always try to frame it as saving wild spaces for animals, but in actual fact, it’s saving these spaces for people too. We always benefit when we preserve natural spaces. I think people tend to forget that until it’s something closer to home.” The sky is turning an ominous grey as we near lunchtime, so we decide to head out before the imminent downpour. As we skirt back out onto the main path, construction fences loom on either side, housing excavators donning a faded shade of green. In land-scarce Singapore, how are we to satisfactorily balance conservation with the need for development? “Land use is a touchy topic,” Karl acknowledges. “We’re not saying you cannot do this or that it’s morally wrong, rather, we’re trying to pose a set of questions that can result in more robust decisions. Have we considered all options of other usable areas? Have we allowed ourselves to study the forest in question?” For instance, Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, had previously pointed out the availability of neighbouring, vacant sites in the Ghim Moh area as a substitution to clearing Dover Forest. Similarly, Elliott and Inez clarify that their stand isn’t a brusque opposition to development, but rather the need for a more thoughtful and intentional approach to it. “In fact, when there’s clearance to be done, I actually think we might not always need to preserve the whole area,” Elliot offers. “But we hope that there can be consultations at the start, not just when the clearing happens and consultations are only to salvage or remedy.” Dr Ang thinks there needs to be a mindset overhaul on the ways we approach land use. “Rather than mitigating the impact, it’s about not even incurring this impact. I know it’s challenging to say you want to be involved right in the beginning, but I really feel it’s a missed opportunity to not be more consultative at the start.” The recent erroneous clearing of Kranji Woodlands is a testament to the mantra of too little too late. Adding on to the list of umbrages is the shock clearing of Lower Seletar Reservoir, a move that the Nature Society of Singapore has indicated they were uninformed about. Within the nature community, calls for an Environmental Impact Assessment law, or EIA law, have been circulating as well.  Elliott explains that in the case of Dover, only a baseline study was conducted, which is not the same as an EIA. While a baseline study outlines what kinds of flora and fauna are present in the forest, EIAs assess the impact on the habitat when construction works are made and present recommendations to circumvent those effects. Simply put, knowing what is in the forest does not equate to knowing how it will be affected.  Pointing out the presence of EIAs that have led to mitigation measures in the Cross Island Line and Bukit Batok Hillside Park cases, Inez says, “we’re really gunning for a law that would make EIAs mandatory, and that the findings would be made transparent to the public.” On the flipside, Dr Andie Ang and Karl are more cautious about the push for legislation. “Do we really have to go down the fine people route?” Karl laments, yet acknowledges that enforcement might be inevitable if patterns of careless clearing persist.  “What I would really like to see is more education upstream,” Dr Ang counters. “Teach about our local forests in the kindergartens, so that there is an early appreciation of it. Ultimately, you can only care about the things that you know.” With all that is on the horizon, do they still feel hopeful? Across the board, all unanimously agree that the recent attention on green spaces merits great encouragement. Recounting how she recently heard some elderly folk complaining about the Kranji Woodlands clearance at the kopitiam, Dr Ang says, “previously, it was always the converted talking back to the converted, but for the story to reach a 70-year-old uncle, that’s really on the ground.” “I just hope more people go out into the green spaces near them and enjoy them. Have a stake in our natural spaces, so that when the time comes, you’ll be a voice for it,” Elliott challenges. “I won’t stop advocating,” declares Dr Ho, “because nature is so fundamental to a meaningful life.” After all, as Dr Ang reminds me, our flora and fauna can and should be coined a part of our heritage. “Our natural heritage is part of our national heritage too, it’s what we have and share. I hope we get to preserve that.” The ecofeminist scholar Donna Haraway talks about the concept of making kin, where kin are defined to be “those who have an enduring mutual, obligatory, non-optional, you-can’t-just-cast-that-away-when-it-gets-inconvenient, enduring relatedness that carries consequences.”1 For Haraway, she found kin in Cayenne, an Australian shepherd dog with whom she had a relationship founded upon mutual respect. She posits that if we have kin with another, then we carry accountabilities and obligations that are steeped in sites of attachment and relationship. Indeed, we make kin unknowingly with the creatures and critters that surround our atmosphere day in day out, painfully unconscious of the ways in which our ability to breathe and move are, in part, attributed to their continued existence on this planet. We would do well to acknowledge and honour these threads of kinship, treating them with a dutiful reverence and safeguarding them with a discerning will, before these threads are irreparably severed. Or, as Inez simply puts it, “You got to respect the forest man, these guys were here before us.” Citations

36,"We Went Languishing Around Singapore And It Was Terrible, But Perfect",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-we-went-languishing-around-singapore-and-it-was-terrible-but-perfect/,"Culture, Life, Travel","All images by Feline Lim.  In April, the New York Times termed the latest stage of the pandemic fatigue as languishing. The thinking goes: We’re not burnt out, depressed, or anxious. We’re joyless, aimless, stagnated and empty.  “[Languishing] feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life in a foggy windshield.”  We’ve all felt like we’re just muddling through, right? Even when the restrictions in Singapore were eased, there was a distinct lack of spontaneity, adventure, and excitement. It almost felt normal to sit in a restaurant with a group of eight friends. It was something like freedom but not quite. There was a roadblock to joy. It could be remembered but not replicated.  Now, in Phase 2 (HA) the slices of normalcy that eased our languishing are gone. There’s nowhere to hide. We can’t meet more than one person at a time. We can’t travel anytime soon. Essentially, we’ve regressed to a point in the pandemic that we wanted to forget. The languishing article I mentioned above offers some antidotes: give yourself uninterrupted leisure time, focus on a small goal. These strategies might feel implementable in the United States, where mass vaccination is steadily easing restrictions—but in Singapore, we’re a few months away from returning to the spoils we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Though hope is on the horizon, until later this year, we’re in a semi-pleasant purgatory.  So, in the absence of an imminent end to the pandemic, I wanted to try something different. Instead of rejecting this mid-point between flourishing and depression, I indulged it. Here’s how I intentionally languished around Singapore.  Where Should One Languish in Singapore?  Firstly, languishing is neither pleasant nor destructive. When researching the term further, I learned that it is “an apathy, a sense of restlessness or feeling unsettled, an overall lack of interest in life.” To languish appropriately, I thought it best to select places where not much happens, and there’s nothing spectacular to see or do. In fact, when scouting for locations, I wanted to make sure there was nothing excitable at all. The whole point of languishing is to embrace a low-level of dread. So, with that in mind, I picked three areas of Singapore which are not featured in tourist brochures: Tuas, Sembawang, and Yishun. Of course, I was still writing an article—technically a photo essay, with pictures from my colleague Feline Lim. We needed some nice visuals, so I found some photogenic spots in these unremarkable places. Does glamourising languishing defeat its purpose? It could have, but it didn’t. Here’s what happened.  Missed Connection: The Lalang Field  Initially, I selected the Raffles Marina lighthouse as our first location to languish—there was an idyllic shot I had in mind: a silhouette of myself or a stranger gazing at the sea while the sun set on the water. Unfortunately, the marina was closed to non-members. The security guard shooed us away as we approached the gate.  A bummer. But I had another place in mind: the famous Lalang Field in Tuas South Avenue 4, the backdrop of many wedding photoshoots. “What do we do when we get there?” Feline asked me. I told her that we were going to languish and she would know how it felt when we did it. Though, at this point, I wondered if I had pitched an article I couldn’t write. We drove in circles around the area where the Lalang Field was supposed to be. It was fenced off with barbed wire.  “Where do we go now?” Feline asked and I shrugged. I ran out of options. We meandered on the empty sidewalks, submerged in a cloud of dust stirred up by a lorry on the road. It was late in the afternoon when we stumbled on a dehydrated field of nothing.  There, I laid down on a spikey patch of grass, and closed my eyes. The sun roasted my skin and a swarm of midges buzzed in front of my face. With the lorries rumbling in the background, and the afternoon heat on my neck, I felt uncomfortable but not uncomfortable enough to change position. I laid there and thought how nice it would be to sunbathe literally anywhere else.  “Okay, we’re losing the light, shall we go somewhere else?” Feline called from afar. Sure, I thought, without saying anything. I was overcome by the need to stay where I was, to indulge the discomfort. But we had an article to produce.  In Pursuit of Nothing: The Break Down in Tuas  The next port of call in Tuas was Lamp Post 1, a landmark for cyclists at the westernmost point of Singapore. Lamp Post 1 is outside the Tuas Checkpoint and home to a collage of stickers and trinkets put there by the cyclists. I thought it would be heartwarming, but upon closer inspection there were ziploc baggies of cigarette butts and used masks taped next to the inspirational quotes. It was a nonsensical place to spend more than a few minutes, given the heavy traffic, grimey litter, and noisy construction beyond the checkpoint. There was no good reason to hang out there, yet there we were; languishing. I felt annoyed and slightly serene.  In the car, I talked with Feline about how frustrating it was to find a ‘good place’ to languish in Singapore. “There are no open spaces.” She remarked while switching lanes. “Before, there were places you could go to make your own fun. You didn’t have to buy, eat, or drink something to participate. There was no price to pay.”Feline mentioned the plot of reclaimed land where Gardens By The Bay now exists. It used to be a wide, open space of nothing. Yet, it was made useful. Both of us remembered the afternoons we spent flying kites and picnicking there. It wasn’t special or remarkable, but it was unspoiled and free.  Before we went home, we stopped by Long King Canteen—which had an excellent selection of Bangladeshi cuisine. There were some migrant workers there (on their own, or in pairs) collecting refreshments. They too, seemed to be languishing. We took our food across the road, to another stretch of dehydrated grass that faced the water. There, we watched the sunset. In the distance I noticed Forest City silhouetted in the sky. Forest City comprises four man-made islands in Johor, billed as a “smart and green futuristic city.” It’s a copycat version of Singapore opposite our own shores. Forest City looks a lot like Dubai. While admiring it, I thought: I would really like to be in Dubai. Or, again, anywhere but here. With great effort, I could swim to Forest City from Tuas. Seeing another country up-close and personal made me think about how arbitrary travel restrictions are.  Technically, I could have booked a flight from Changi and gone somewhere the next day. But I didn’t. On the way home, the car broke down. Feline wrestled with the spare tire, then we waited two hours for help. The entire trip had been kind of a bust, all of our preferred locations were closed. We sat on the side of the empty road, in silence, apathetic and disinterested.  Long story short, Tuas is ripe for languishing.  Go Forth and Languish at Sembawang Beach and the Yishun Dam  Sembawang Park was crowded when I arrived. Uncles huffed and puffed through their masks as they shuffle-jogged around the beachfront, which was also under construction. On the pier, a small crowd were fishing. “Fishing is kind of like languishing, right?” Feline asked as we watched the fishermen stare expectantly at the filthy sea.  A man waded into the sea to cast a big net. Time and again he threw it out, then pulled it back in. We watched for half an hour and he didn’t catch anything. The other fishermen observed from the pier in silence. “Yes, fishing is definitely a kind of languishing.” I said to Feline.  Sembawang Beach was covered in plastic bags, empty cans, and food waste. It was not an idyllic spot to relax. Yet, there were quite a few pairs sitting on stone benches and smoking cigarettes. I wondered: Why did they choose this place? Singapore is full of manicured, pristine nature. Were they deliberately languishing, in a setting which suited the mood? The hulky port disturbed what could have been a nice view. Though there were many people around, I never heard any chatter.  Yishun Dam was our hail mary for one good picture. Feline said the sunset on the water was unreal. We arrived early and sat in silence for some time, dodging insects and watching a hawk swoop down from the sky to catch a fish. “Sometimes I come here with my boyfriend and we bring a portable chess table.” Feline exhaled. I thought this was another example of languishing.  When the sun finally set, it was too cloudy for the pretty colors to break through. The sky went dark without warning. As we called our cabs to go home, we counted the hours spent chasing nothing this week. I disagreed with Feline on how long, exactly, we had spent in Tuas. “Surely, it was only an hour,” I said, but she seemed to think we had been there for three or four hours.  In the car on the way home, I thought: we wasted a lot of time on something that is not interesting. But, isn’t that how most of the past year has been? Sitting around, trying to unearth diamonds from the rubble, and forgetting how long it took.  Yes, we had wasted the whole week languishing. And it felt aimless and joyless, but appropriate.  Found any good spots to languish in Singapore? Write to us community@ricemedia.co.  Author © 2020 Rice Media. All rights reserved ",FALSE
37,Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Follows the Money (Part 2),https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-movie-reviews-jack-neos-ah-boys-to-men-franchise-part-2/,"Culture, Events","The following is Part 2 of a two-part review on Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men series. You can read Part One here. By the mid-2010s, there was a noticeable shift in the global culture towards more socially progressive causes, driven largely by the internet and social media. As Disney’s Marvel franchise and movies like DC’s Wonder Woman (2017) would go on to demonstrate, there was now an easy buck to be made from taking a stand on social issues.  The formula is simple: just slap a <insert minority> into a lead role, write some generic dialogue about empowerment, add a dash of 90s nostalgia, then have said minority kick the ass of their historic oppressor … and voila! The audience can now experience the catharsis of shattering the Grand Illusion, while enriching the coffers of global MNCs. Everyone wins. Coincidentally, this sudden whiff of profits also made these ‘Western’ ideologies more palatable in Singapore. This is reflected in the final two movies of the Ah Boys Franchise — with mixed results.  Ah Boys to Men 3 (2015): Every Seamen’s Fantasy  In the Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen, Jack Neo uses the Time Stone to transport his characters back to an alternate timeline where they enlist in the Naval Diving Unit (NDU) instead — in order to produce propaganda for the Singapore Navy. The early films’ success at the box office is reflected in the now bloated runtime of two and half hours.  Supported by an even more massive budget, the audience is treated to yet another CGI opening sequence. This time, our heroes board an ocean vessel, where a group of United Colours of Benetton terrorists have taken the crew hostage.  To be honest, despite the CGI fireworks, it’s getting late and I find myself nodding off within the first few minu— HOLY SHIT. NEVERMIND. A Chinese female terrorist just got shot in the face! “There are no female crew on the list,” said the naval commando to his subordinate. “Do your homework.”  Duly reprimanded, I’m now wide awake. The threat of terrorism in Singapore is no laughing matter. Like the Spanish Inquisition, it can pop up in places where we least expect.  Unfortunately, this headshot is also the highwater mark of this movie. Perhaps this is due to the limitations of the alternate timeline, where the characters must retrace the exact same arc, albeit with a few adjustments. Wayang King is still very wayang, but in this timeline, he actually fights back and stands up for himself. Meanwhile, Ken Chow’s girlfriend leaves him again for being too childish.  “I need someone who’s stronger, who’s able to protect me, love me, care about me, understand my feelings,” says his girlfriend. “I need someone who is more determined and mature.” “You’ve been watching too many movies because that person doesn’t even exist!” yells Ken.  Ooh, nice. This movie is breaking the fourth wall to gaslight the audience.  The only standout scene is a genuinely touching storyline of Lobang and his mother, who struggles with drug addiction. One night, as his mother goes into a fit of withdrawal, Lobang is forced to break out of Tekong. He then makes the heart-wrenching decision to turn his mother into the police in order to save his sister.  Back at camp, the whole platoon is brought before the encik to be held to account for this dangerous safety breach.  “How do we choose between doing the right things, and doing things right?” asks the encik.  Astonishingly, this scene ends with the encik admitting to his own mistake of not understanding Lobang’s family situation and giving himself 100 push-ups as punishment. This inspires the rest of the platoon to follow his example. TL;DR
Leaders showing accountability? This really is the alternate timeline.  Ah Boys to Men 4 (2017): Joking Only One. Women Cannot Take a Joke Meh? By 2017, the culmination of three instalments and half a decade of character development finds the ah boys mature into fully-fledged uncles, as they sluggishly report for their fourth round of reservist duties — this time to the armoured division. When the movie first came out, a RICE contributor dubbed Ah Boys to Men 4 ‘pure sexist trash’. I disagree. The most egregious examples of sexism actually took place in the first two instalments. By the fourth instalment, the franchise is, on the contrary, attempting to pander to the increasingly lucrative trend of female empowerment.  Unfortunately, this attempt fails miserably.  The introduction of the first real female character in Lieutenant Zhang Xinyi, played by Apple Chan, arguably sets womens’ rights in Singapore back another generation.  It’s not the actresses’ fault. For all the controversy her character generated, Apple Chan is given almost nothing to work with. Her defining personality trait is that of a hardass with no sense of humour, and her hobbies include making the reservists write lines as punishment.  That said, as misogyny goes, it’s pretty toothless stuff compared to previous iterations. The entire cast and production feels tired, sad and low energy.  Sure, there’s a confrontation between IP Man and Apple Chan, where the familiar refrain of ‘can’t women take a joke?’ is trotted out. But even this movie is self-aware enough to have the other characters call IP Man out for sexual harassment.  The bigger problem is that despite all the hullabaloo about a female ‘lead’, Apple Chan’s character is still just being used as a prop — except now she’s a prop in the foreground instead of the background. Having her beat up IP Man is supposed to be one small step for all womankind, before the movie takes three giant leaps backward when the screenwriters awkwardly pair her up with Second Sergeant Alex Ong (played by Tosh Zhang) by the end of the movie.  The writer / director even had to work Apple Chan’s mouth like a puppet for a final time with this cringey piece of dialogue: “The power of brotherhood is really amazing. I will definitely want to learn more from you guys.” Thanks Jack. Very nice.  TL;DR Can someone explain why this is the last shot of Ah Boys to Men 4? Why is Singapore burning down? Is it a metaphor? Like…the true enemy was inside of us all along? I’m genuinely lost and concerned.  Together We Will Chiong. On and on and on. Once you remove the bad CGI and outlandish plot developments, Ah Boys to Men is less a slapstick comedy and more a cultural record of the times. Its primary value lies in documenting the shifting cultural priorities from 2012 to 2017, from open misogyny to insincere pandering to women’s rights.  Like the franchise, it’s a bit pathetic to call this progress, but one can’t deny that for the past decade, ‘socially conservative’ Singapore has been dragged kicking and screaming into the modern era.  Arguably, the government’s support for Ah Boys has less to do with outright sexism so much as risk aversion and political expediency; it seems that the authorities always have a knack for following the prevailing wisdom of the times, even if it means hitching their wagons to declining cultural and social trends.  Maybe what Jack Neo has really taught us is that you can’t lead a country based on the nostalgia of out-of-touch uncles, where NS was always ‘so much tougher’ back in their day and gender roles were easier to understand. After all, NS was never just about national security. According to LKY, it is also about building a national and political consciousness. While I take umbrage at always placing the blame on the authorities, we already have a few recent examples of how SAF culture might bleed into the civil service or corporate boardroom — with negative social consequences.  So instead of always rushing to wait and waiting to rush, perhaps some initiative and leadership are in order. Perhaps it’s time to actually chart a course for the type of society Singapore wants for the future, instead of just acquiescing to the prevailing winds of the times.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

38,Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Is A Cultural Treasure (Part 1),https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-classic-movie-reviews-jack-neos-ah-boys-to-men-franchise-is-a-cultural-treasure-part-1/,"Culture, Events","All images taken from Netflix.  The consensus at RICE is that Ah Boys to Men is a terrible franchise. That its director Jack Neo is a hack who has really jumped the shark from his early decent films like Money No Enough and I Not Stupid to directing big-budget B-movies that are essentially commercials for the Singapore government and corporate brands.  Jack must be wiping away tears with money at our disapproval because the S$30MM in local box office receipts tell a different story. Every couple of years, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans willingly part with their hard-earned cash to attend these cultural events.  If it isn’t the quality filmmaking that draws them in, something else must have struck a chord — enough for them to overlook the blatant MINDEF propaganda.  But debates about quality aside, all films are also time capsules. And it’s precisely this combination of government backing, corporate sponsorship, and mainstream appeal that makes the Ah Boys franchise so interesting for the armchair anthropologist (i.e. me).  When you read between the lines, the true value of this franchise is that it tells us what the powers-that-be in Singapore accepted as ‘normal’ and ‘uncontroversial’ between the years 2012 and 2017.
 This is especially relevant in light of the recent proposal by AWARE chief Corinna Lim to let women serve NS, in order to address the ‘toxic masculinity’ problem in SAF.  So what I want to know is this: does Ah Boys to Men depict a problematic NS culture? Does the series actually deliver on its promise of turning boys into men? And if so, what kind of men do they turn into?  Let’s find out.  Ah Boys to Men 1 (2012): Sponsored Sexism In 2012, Ah Boys to Men was the highest-grossing Singaporean film of all time.  It also finds Singapore’s media authorities asleep at their terminals.  Because forget the Hollywood movies depicting drug use. The opening montage to Ah Boys to Men is the biggest threat to Singapore’s national security.  Within the opening seconds, we learn that Singapore is under attack by a mysterious military force. The brain-dead responses from Singaporeans, however, is like an invitation for Singapore’s enemies to actually invade.  Watching civilians, including women and children, get gunned down or burned to a crisp with bad CGI shouldn’t be this funny, and it borders on treason that Jack Neo has managed to make the death of innocents look so corny. But fear not, in the ultimate non-sequitur, a GAME OVER sign flashes across the screen, and we find out that the past twelve minutes was actually … a video game all along? This is a worse plot device than ‘it was all a dream.’ It’s more upsetting when you consider that a big part of the film’s S$3M budget must’ve been spent just so that Jack could go pew pew pew and make explosion noises like a 5-year old boy playing with LEGOS.  Who said there wasn’t patronage of the arts in Singapore?  But to quote HBO’s Chernobyl, “Reality is the most horrifying genre of all.”  After this Ready Player One ripoff, we are introduced to the main character Ken Chow, whose entire personality revolves around being a rich brat who really hates NS. His girlfriend is leaving to study overseas, but the patriarchy is holding him back.  In a rage, Ken stops traffic and ends by kicking over a garbage can, before being arrested by SPF. This isn’t just your run-of-the-mill rich boy fit, it’s the kind of tantrum deserving of execution by firing squad.  What follows is your standard NS enlistment process, where we are introduced to a cast of colourful characters: Lobang (the ah beng with a heart of gold), IP Man (the playboy), Aloysius Jin (aka Wayang King), as well as the Indian, Malay and PRC stereotypes who serve as comedic wallpaper for its four Chinese-Singaporean main characters.  Sounds about right.  Partway through the movie, Ken’s worst fears finally come true. His girlfriend leaves him. After the breakup scene at Benjamin Sheares bridge, she hops into the passenger seat of a mysterious Mercedes, whose owner is presumably a richer white man with a ten-inch penis, thus confirming the darkest fantasies of incels on SammyBoy and EDMW. But by far, the worst advice on women in this movie comes from the father figures.  During training, the boys are constantly mocked for being gu niang (ladies in Chinese). Government-issued rifles are compared to wives: “After tonight, we are all married men. This wife is a pain. She sticks to you wherever you go. You’ll be punished for mistreating her. And she has a loud voice, ‘Bang!’ You can’t say no to marriage and you can’t get a divorce. Worst thing is, you can’t even go to bed with her.” In case you think I’m cherry-picking, I present you with the CB leaf. Here are some other classic Boomer pearls of wisdom that cleared Singapore’s media censors in 2012: “Women are like clothes, ready to be worn and discarded when you’ve worn them. Why must you insist on wearing this one?” “Next time, when other guys pick her up, they’ll be like rag-and-bone men. Because she is used goods.” If I can sum up the internal logic of this movie it would be as follow:  Younger women are possessions with sell-by dates. They have unrealistic expectations and are overly materialistic. “90% of recruit girlfriends” will confirm cheat on you (mutiny / bing-bian) when they get the chance.  Middle-aged women are shrill and naggy mother/wife figures that should not be taken seriously.  But don’t fret, women become lovable again once they become Grandma, whose only purpose in life is to spoil their grandsons and fall ill.  As for the female siblings? Forget it. Just let them do housework. The twins from The Shining had more to do than the actresses playing Ken Chow’s sisters.  Finally, the movie drags on with tedious Boomer flashbacks on how NS was so much tougher back in their day, ending on a cliffhanger after Ken’s father has a stroke/heart attack while driving to the hospital to see his shithead son.  TL;DR
Singapore in 2012 was basically an EDMW forum in real life.  Ah Boys to Men 2 (2013): Know Your Role and Shut Your Mouth Meet the second half, the same as the first half. In 2013, the second instalment of Ah Boys picks up where the first one left off. After his father’s accident, Ken Chow makes an about-face and is now on the straight and narrow path to OCS. Another recruit, IP Man, gets cheated on by his girlfriend. Because women, amirite?   Meanwhile, Wayang King’s wayang skills have gotten so powerful that the whole section ends up hating his guts. In a hazing incident worthy of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, they sabo him by putting a stone in his field pack during a march across Singapore.  Here, the father figures in these movies have another chance to shine. At FoodRepublic, Wayang’s father provides Wayang with more nuggets of wisdom lifted straight out of a HardwareZone message board. His advice for dealing with bullies? The best way to fight is to not do anything.  Say what? He goes on to explain this ‘logic’ in the most convoluted way possible with, of course, yet another CGI set-piece courtesy of Jack Neo.  But maybe Wayang’s dad has a point. Later on in the film, we are introduced to the concept of being ‘marked’ by a superior officer, a practice that’s reminiscent of Jack Nicholson and A Few Good Men. Allegedly, it’s an unofficial way that superiors can punish recruits they don’t like by always volunteering them for the toughest tasks. Everyone knows it’s a punishment and yet no one can acknowledge that it exists. Since it’s off the books, there is no way of proving that this actually happens.  Which is why under these (alleged) conditions, Wayang Father’s advice of keeping your head down and avoiding the spotlight is actually a pretty good one.  TL;DR
 Fall in line, soldier. Don’t be such a lil bitch and just STFU. The manliest thing you can do is keep your head down and allow problems to slowly fester beneath the surface.  The Story So Far This concludes the first part of this review on Jack Neo’s Bohemian Rhapsody for Boomers.  My verdict so far?  On one hand, it’s hard to get worked up over something this juvenile and pathetic. Some might even argue that I’m reading too much into a slapstick comedy. Normally, I’d agree with you. After all, freedom of artistic expression should cover terrible artists as well. But culturally, these films become significant once you consider the context in which they were made.  While many misogynistic movies aimed at a broader audience were released in the early 2010s, only the Ah Boys franchise can boast this level of private and public support — to the point where the likes of MINDEF and other local brands had no problems slapping their logos on it.  Other movies have been banned for less. In a country like Singapore with tight restrictions on ‘controversial’ content, the fact that Ah Boys 1-2 was considered ‘normal’ is truly an indictment of the times.  Stay tuned for Part 2 tomorrow, where the writer reviews Ah Boys to Men 3-4. In the meantime, Ah Boys 1-2 are available on Netflix.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

39,Antique Warehouses Along Turf Club Road Is What We Need To Stave Off Historical Amnesia,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-antique-warehouses-turf-club/,"Culture, Life","All photography by Marisse Caine for Rice Media Unless you know the specific warehouses that operate there, few would have even heard about Antique Row. Even this name is a moniker Singaporeans attach to the antique warehouses along Turf Club Road, rather than an official title. I would not have known of Antique Row’s existence either, if not for my cousin who took a wrong turn while driving to Rider’s Cafe, which is about a 15 minutes walk away. This treasure-trove located in an ulu part of Bukit Timah is a quiet playground for scavenger hunters, never mind that the building is dilapidated. Who knows, the unpretentious state of the building might be what aroused visitors’ curiosity to the warehouses in the first place, which, by the way, are open to the public till evening. The four antique warehouses are hidden out of view within the secluded Bukit Timah Saddle Club and Turf City area, flanked by thick vegetation on both sides. Its rooftop is overgrown with shrubs and trees. At first glance, I did not think highly of the row of warehouses. With a mix of wooden furniture and rock sculptures piled up and cluttered outside the building, it resembled more of a dumpster for bulky items by karung guni men, than a de facto history museum.  But the old-world charm of the vicinity caught my attention, as wild roosters roamed around in the shrubs and uncles unwound outside their warehouses. Sitting on stools around a foldable table on the road, they chatted away in Chinese dialects and drank Kopi O together, paying no heed to the hustle and bustle of city life.  For a brief moment, I thought the kampung spirit had made a comeback. Not as a national myth, of course, but more like an organic sense of community fostered among the owners.  Looking at their interactions, I could see that they have camaraderie, cracking jokes and gossiping with one another like old friends. But, more crucially, there is a culture of trust and neighbourliness. If one of the uncles had to leave their warehouse unattended to pee or make deliveries, he could always count on his neighbour to keep a lookout for him.   If I had to churn out a recipe for nostalgia, this has to be it: A group of middle-aged uncles collecting and displaying antiques in this laid-back and rustic setting, set in an elongated building built decades ago. The metal netting at the top of its facade reminds us of the past when people installed them for ventilation, instead of using fans or air-conditioners. In one of the warehouses which belongs to 55-year-old Alan Wong, there are many items from yesteryear which would bring a tear to the eye of someone who lived through the 1960s and 70s in Singapore.  They range from black-and-white television sets (which used to be a luxury) to smaller collectibles like bus tickets (which bus conductors used to punch holes on), coated with a layer of dust which makes those items look even more time-worn. The other three warehouses also have a similar collection of local antiques, with unique items such as a vintage jackpot machine and an old barber chair.   If you dig deep enough, you may even spot a blue restricted passport placed haphazardly among the shelves of Mr Wong’s warehouse, which tells us an almost-forgotten immigration policy from the past. There was actually a time when Singaporeans held two passports: the red passport we are familiar with for international travel and the blue one for trips to West Malaysia. The blue passport was used from 1967 to 1999.  I spoke to the friendly and bespectacled Mr Wong, who set up his warehouse here in March 2018. He also has a shop in Bukit Merah which sells similar goods.  Like the other uncles, Mr Wong is knowledgeable of his antiques. Appreciating antiques is an expertise, he says. He takes it upon himself to know the history behind the products displayed in his warehouse, sometimes learning from visitors themselves. For art pieces, he has to distinguish between the real masterpieces and the forged ones.  Speaking in Mandarin, he shares the tranquility of the area—with sounds coming only from the crowing of the roosters or chirping of crickets—is what makes the place enjoyable.  The countryside-like vibes is why Mr Wong chose to relocate his warehouse here, after shifting from various locations such as Depot Road and Toh Guan Centre. On the flipside, as the Turf City precinct is secluded, he has to contend with a lower footfall. On average, he receives fewer than 10 visitors on a weekday, while the number is only slightly higher on weekends.  But Mr Wong claims that over here, he pays a lower rent of about $3,200 per month, which isn’t surprising since the area is ulu. His warehouse of over 2,000 square feet would have cost him at least $5,000 per month at somewhere more populous, according to him.  It is pitch dark when night falls—there are no lamp-posts along this stretch of road. Perhaps this is why the uncles from adjacent warehouses call it a day by 5pm. Mr Wong, however, stays on till after sunset. He says he spends his mornings at his Bukit Merah store and opens his warehouse later, at noon, while other owners start their day here at 10am.  Although the darkness does not spook him, he recalls an incident during the Hungry Ghost Festival last year. As per tradition, he lit up red prayer candles along the road and prayed. But in the midst of doing so, nature called and he went to answer it in the nearby bushes. This was when Mr Wong saw a “lady” in a red dress who sat by the roadside near his car and disappeared after a while. He later learnt from a visitor that many years ago, a woman was raped and killed in a colonial black-and-white house nearby. Apparently, it’s a well-known tale among those working in the vicinity.  Personally, what I found more mysterious was that nobody seemed to have a clear idea of the history of this decrepit building. Multiple attempts to reach out to the relevant authorities did not yield any concrete answers. What I did have were anecdotal accounts from the uncles. One of them said the building used to be a stable and was built in the 1930s; another remarked that the building used to store horse feed and that the road in front of it was previously closed to vehicular traffic. It’s a shame that there isn’t an official history of this old building.  Given the lack of heritage interest in this building by the authorities, I wasn’t surprised when Mr Wong told me they might need to make way by June next year as the place is slated for redevelopment. Upon checking, I learnt that plans for the site are still being studied, so my fingers are crossed while its fate hangs by a thread.  I’m praying that Antique Row does not get relegated to the history books. For one, we will lose a place with an identity and rustic character of its own, which distinguishes itself from the cookie-cutter shopping malls we are so sick of. A tight-knit community will also be erased.   Moreover, ever since the Sungei Road Thieves Market was closed in 2017, we no longer have a large collective site for antique collectors to display their wares. The closest we have now are Antique Row and Fook Hai Building, which houses a few antique shops.   Perhaps in the eyes of the authorities, they have no qualms doing away with the vintage scene because little economic incentives can be reaped from there, as compared to redeveloping the area for residential or commercial purposes.  If the Urban Redevelopment Authority redevelops Antique Row and its surroundings according to its latest Master Plan, taller flats or condominiums can be built and the government coffers can rake in more money derived from stamp duties and property taxes—more than rent collected from antique warehouse owners of an old single-storey building. But not everything can be measured in dollars and cents. What does it bode about our collective history if we no longer have antique warehouses and shops, more so if the collectors decide to call it a day, in the event they are forced to vacate Antique Row?  From an educational perspective, I will feel sorry for our children and grandchildren if they do not have opportunities to be exposed to these vintage goods which used to be everyday items for us.  Sure, there are museums where children can learn a fair bit from. But museums only display items aligned with their curatorial agendas, rather than random knick-knacks. This does not do justice to those arbitrary items of yore, which also have a story to tell.  For example, a coin-operated public telephone displayed in Mr Wong’s warehouse may not be important enough to deserve a place in a glass casing at the history gallery of the National Museum. Ultimately, the museum’s focus is on Singapore’s pre-independence history and the public phone is a relic from the 1980s.  But it tells us a story of a time before mobile phones became common, when communication was less convenient and people on the streets had to physically search for a phone to contact someone. This was also why people used to carry 10-cent coins and pocket phone books when they were out, so they could make calls in public.  History is not just gleaned from textbooks, museums or state-sanctioned events like Singapore HeritageFest, because they do not paint a complete picture of the past. It is also through organic and ground-up experiences like visiting antique warehouses and shops which not only keeps the national memory alive, but also gives them a sense of cultural rootedness. I will be sad if one day, our children suffer from historical amnesia and are clueless about their community’s history and lived experiences of the past. Sometimes, it is in such unassuming places like Antique Row where you unearth unexpected vintage gems and learn a history lesson. For me, Antique Row is also a social space which reminds me of simpler times in the past, as I see how laid-back and easy-going the uncles are. This is also the reason why owners like Mr Wong chose to shift his warehouse here.  Know of a place with the charm of Antique Row? Tell us about it at community@ricemedia.co.

40,"Indians Not Allowed, Thank You.",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-racism-indian-national-singapore/,"Commentary, Culture, Current Affairs, People","All images by Zachary Tang. “Indians not allowed, thank you.” This was what an agent said to me back in April, when I was looking for a new home here in Singapore. Trouble is, this wasn’t even an isolated incident. Before long, I had to either start looking for houses owned by Indian families, or give a caveat to agents beforehand that I am, in fact, Indian. I felt bad, of course. But more than that, I felt pity for these people for having such mindsets even in this day and age. (Coincidentally, my Swedish housemate finally found a house for us which was apparently owned by an Indian man, and I indulged myself in the house shifting and tried to forget these racist experiences that I’ve accumulated over this two-and-a-half-year long stay in Singapore.) Racism—it’s not always in plain sight. But one can still sense it in the everyday.  In that look in the eyes of one person. Or a smile returned with hostility during a walk in the park. You sense it behind sugar-coated words, especially when you try to have an open discussion about it. Even if it’s not always put in words, you can sense it. All that said, if you ask me if I think Singapore is a racist country, my answer would still be a big no.  A friend of mine from India was having lunch with his Chinese girlfriend (from Hong Kong) at an Indian restaurant one day. Out of nowhere a middle-aged, Singaporean Chinese lady leaned over and said something to her in Mandarin, in a low tone. His girlfriend snapped in response that it was none of her business. A long silence followed. When my friend asked what the matter was, she told him that the lady informed her that “Indian men are not trustworthy, you know, so be careful.”  I mean, my friend is no Casanova or Picasso. He ain’t no John Wilkes or Peter the Great. He comes from India, but he ain’t no Maharaja Bhupinder Singh. He’s just a simple-looking, decent, brown middle-class student. I wonder if it was an Italian, Russian, Spanish, or any white guy in his place—would he have been greeted with such judgement? I find it funny because maybe my guy’s just got tough luck. The other day, we were running late for work and rushing down an escalator when his hand brushed the hand of a Chinese woman who looked to be in her late 50s. Which he apologised for, twice. This is what she shouted back. “Fuck off, you people do this intentionally, I will take you to the police!”, she yelled, trying to kick him. He mentioned that there were cameras around and he wouldn’t mind going to the police if she wanted. She lost her temper even more and started blabbering in Mandarin. Throughout this entire ordeal, what stood out most was that not it was not just us — even fellow Singaporeans around could sense that she was being unreasonable and nobody paid any attention to her.  From these incidents, one can see that it takes a whole nation to make for a multicultural, interracial, peaceful society. But it takes just a few frustrated, inhumane, and unreasonable people to make us look like a racist country. Singapore is a vibrant country to me and has those attributes that make me love it like my own country as well. Like India, it is colourful; it is home to people of multiple nationalities, faiths, and interests. It is full of nature, heritage, and art; it has a rich history in its struggle for freedom. I love the similar ways we improvise with food, where everything gets all mixed up and accepted until it’s difficult to identify their origins. Isn’t it all so beautiful? To flag a country like this as racist would be unfair. It would be unfair to all of my Chinese, Malay, Filipino, Australian, European, and Indian friends, who have always been there, who show love and support in difficult situations. It would be unfair to all of those sending postcards asking how I’m doing, or how my family’s doing back home in these disastrous times. Some have even asked me out or sent me homemade food just to tell me that I am not alone here. It just wouldn’t be fair. My Indian mates and I haven’t been home for a year and a half now, and what we hear in the news is enough to send us spiralling into depression.  Every other day brings some bad news—hearing friends and relatives dying because of COVID-19 keeps us on our toes. We fear: what if something happens to our families tomorrow? Would we even be able to go home to be with them? With all this in the backdrop, it makes the treatment of Indians here by those with crippled mindsets even more questionable and sad, like kicking us when we’re down. When the actions of these small groups of people come to national attention, sometimes it looks like they are winning against racial harmony. We shouldn’t let that happen in a country like Singapore.  My Chinese friends tell me about the kind of racist statements they hear from the people around them, and one of the silliest things I’ve come across is that “Indian houses smell like curry”. Well, yeah … I guess they would? Every household smells like something or other, but how is that cause for discrimination? I remember how I didn’t like the smell of Malay and Filipino food when I came to Singapore in 2019, but that only made me curious about it. After some time with my friends from these regions who invited me over and cooked for me and introduced me to their food, I started enjoying it. All I needed was to break my walls and accept the differences and the love that everyone brings with their own culture. The other stupid thing I hear is that “Indian houses are dirty.” Well, myths, myths, myths. A person’s way of living isn’t just decided by their nationality. There are so many factors, like their personalities or their financial situation. People look down on our construction workers’ quarters and call them dirty, just because they can’t afford the kind of maintenance that a regular Singaporean household can. What do you expect from someone with a monthly salary of around $450?  But still, mind you, there are houses of the same construction workers that are cleaner and way more organised than rich fellas out there who have no sense of living and couldn’t do a thing without maids in their houses, which are ten times bigger than a construction worker’s abode. But we just wouldn’t dare to go and pay a visit to the houses of people who have built our homes. It’s easier to call them names.  To break these taboos, we have to explore and experience on our own, and not be part of the crowd which blindly follows “traditions” and “beliefs”. Two years ago, when I first visited my previous rented apartment and met the owner, a sweet and humble Chinese lady, I noticed a line of doubt on her forehead. Later, I was also told by her Chinese agent how some Indian and Bangladeshi tenants had their leases terminated because they could not maintain hygiene standards.  They rented the house to me anyway. Two years later, as I was giving my keys back on the last day, my landlord laughed and told me I was her favourite tenant.  On my end, I feel we must stare back laughing instead of looking down, especially when passing by a stranger with that look in their eyes. We must pass an even brighter smile if it isn’t returned. The more people start sugar-coating their words, the more firm our voices should be when we talk about it.  All this with complete understanding that these people might be completely innocent, unaware of this virus called racism that they’re showing symptoms of, and what it might have done to their poor brains.  We need to identify them, talk to them, give them some love. That might just be the only hope for change.  Have something to say about this story? Write to us at community@ricemedia.co. Author © 2020 Rice Media. All rights reserved ",TRUE
41,This Polyamorous Commune in Singapore Aims to Help People Find Authenticity in Relationships,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-polyamorous-commune-singapore-aims-help-people-find-authenticity-relationships/,"Culture, People","Photography by Liang Jin Tey / RICE Media.  Gabe and Elle first met through a dating app. They watched Jumanji on their first date, and it just so happened that they had the same lifestyle philosophy about open relationships. For both of them, the scripted Singapore relationship is far from appealing: getting married by 25, BTO by 30, then having kids and a traditional family structure. To them, this arrangement prohibits connecting with and loving other human beings outside their relationship. They both feel that there are so many interesting people in this world, and it is possible to build deep intimacy with more than one person.  Gabe is a man of many interests and passions. While he holds a full-time job, he is also an avid practitioner of sensual massage therapy on the side, and works with both women and men. This is how he first got acquainted with the polyamorous lifestyle. Meanwhile Elle, a freelance designer, has pursued her own fair share of research, and exploration into this lifestyle, out of her own interest and curiosity. The two quickly connected over the same vision of how a relationship should be.  “We are both solo polyamorists who get along so well, and decide to cohabit together without marriage,” Elle said. “Our primary partners are ourselves, we are two complete individuals who choose to take care of each other. In this sense we get to date other people and have sex with other people outside of our relationship, but this does not diminish the strength in our relationship in any way. “If anything, this arrangement is a testament to how strong our bond is, because we choose to stay together out of our conscious will and love as a daily choice, not because we have to follow through till ‘death do us part’.”  Just last year, the couple decided to move in together in the middle of the pandemic to an HDB flat in the heartlands. But before you think that this was a typical move-in arrangement, here’s the caveat: they moved in together with another couple—Art and Dee—who practices a dominant-submissive relationship, making the household essentially a quadruple “polyamorous commune” of sort.  They’ve come to call the space “The 360 Experience.” It is not only a co-living space, but also a space to host “holistic” sexual education related events, collaborating with other polyamorous advocates and practitioners in their communities.  ‘360’ (degree) refers to an all-rounded education, true to their mission to cover every aspect of growth in self-discovery, sex, love, and intimacy. Elle explained: “A lot of sex education platform and courses in Singapore are usually limited to abstinence and negative consequences. People don’t find them relevant or informative at all. We are teaching through different means and sensorial experiences, using tools, props, and practical workshops. We are creative and versatile. We want to provide a multidisciplinary sex education that is inclusive, honest, complete, real and available for everyone.” The second couple in the household, Art and Dee also met through a dating app.  Dee, who works in the healthcare industry, came from a very traditional Muslim family. Before meeting Art, she was previously engaged in a toxic relationship where her fiancé would control her behaviour, refusing to let her be herself.  “It was a toxic relationship but I did not realise how bad it was. I was not myself, I was being shamed for having desires and inclination to do many things. When I finally met Art, it felt like a breath of fresh air. He did not judge me—he encouraged and supported all of my explorations, my needs, and my desires. I felt heard and nourished.”  Art, a bartender-turned-food delivery rider, came from two prior failed marriages, so he understands how a lot of couples in Singapore are trapped in toxic marriages or relationships where they are unable to grow or to be themselves.  “It is so easy to lose sight of who you are when you feel like you have to conform to a template dictated by society,” he says. “With every failure, I learnt more about myself and that led me to who I am today, someone with crystal-clear clarity on what I need and want from my romantic relationships. Effective, vulnerable, open communication and strong trust are foundational to create a lasting relationship.”  Through their explorations in the polyamory communities and alternative lifestyles, they met Gabe and Elle. The two couples hit it off immediately and became good friends. They’ve gone for staycation trips together, and enjoy each other’s company immensely. Then, in 2017, on a fateful night over drinks, they decided they would move in together in the coming future. They understood that they connected intellectually and emotionally, and share similar relationship values. They also wanted to educate others on how to have better relationships. Hence the idea of The 360 Experience was born.  Even though they live together, the two couples are not romantic and sexual with each other. Art and Dee share a very different polyamorous relationship model than Gabe and Elle. They are exclusive with each other and chose to get married, followed by signing an official dominant-and-submissive contract.  Elle and Gabe were respectively the best woman and the best man, acting as witnesses in the marriage and the signing of the contract. Elle cried buckets during the signing ceremony. “It was such an emotional, touching moment,” Elle recalled. But how exactly does the dominant-submissive contract work? It is basically an agreement to establish a communication style and share an exchange of power. Dee defers to Art for most decisions but still retains her autonomy to veto. The dominant, Art, agrees to be responsible for the well being of his submissive, Dee, and has her best interests in all aspects of her life at heart, including everyday routines and even her diet. In addition, Art dictates to Dee how he would like to be taken care of. An example of such instructions would be how exactly Art likes his morning coffee made. On the other hand, Dee shares with Art her goals in self-improvement and self-care, and Art guides her through their shared journeys.  “It is not legally binding though,” Art clarified. “We are always revising the terms of the contract for further improvement, and we can adapt them according to different life stages. I visited this curious HDB commune for this interview. As far as the layout went, it was a completely normal unit, but with a few little twists.  First came a rather spacious living room that is used to host workshops. On one side stood a big shelf displaying sex toys and relationship card games. On the other side was a headless mannequin body tied up with shibari ropes, next to a curious metal rig from which an aerial yoga hammock hung. A curtain at the corner led to the dining room.  In the dining room, there was a mood board populated with erotic photographs: from boudoir to bondage, from nyotaimori (the art of eating sushi from one’s body) to nuru massage (Japanese erotic body-to-body massage where participants are covered in odorless and colorless massage lotion)—the tastefully taken snaps showed an eclectic range of experimental sensual activities.  “These are just a few of the workshops and activities that we host in this space,” Gabe told me. He pointed to a blackboard mounted on another wall in the dining room. “There on the blackboard is the list of our upcoming workshops. We do not plan too far ahead as we all have full time career and family commitments. We communicate through personal channels, sometimes social media, and host bespoke, tailored events only one at a time. Our offerings are very intimate and catered for small groups.” I saw all kinds of events and workshops, from the more avant-garde practices such as bondage and nuru to more “vanilla” activities such as “mindful masturbation”, learning about “erogenous zones”, “communicating consent”, and even a “cocktail making masterclass.”  However what really caught my attention was the upper right corner of the blackboard, which spelled out the key values of the commune: connection, openness, communication, inclusive, love, safe space, discovery and awareness, and so on.  The foursome shares that life inside the commune is a lot of hard work. They come up with a proper schedule for each other to do house chores, cooking, and other logistical operations so that everything runs smoothly and harmoniously. They all live and work together inside the commune, on top of organising events for the public—hence life inside the commune can be very hectic if not properly managed.  “We work hard to create events and workshops that will be useful for the attendees. We have to prepare presentation slides, plan for event flows, and collaborate with the right people in the scene,” said Elle. “We have to make sure that we respect and appreciate each other’s needs and schedule in the commune, and give each other space. We take turns using the living room and we decide on all the events and workshops by consensus.”  They are also very open and accepting of each other’s sexual expressions and desires, regularly inviting friends of their communities to join in or host events. Unlike other groups of roommates who might stigmatise and judge each others’ sexual activities, this is one big way in which they do things differently.  Another thing that they emphasize in the commune is a radically honest, compassionate communication format to discuss everything. They have regular house meetings to check in with each other on any problem that needs to be addressed. Instead of treating each other passive aggressively and letting dissatisfaction fester into resentment, they choose to always have open discussions.  “We call out on each other … lovingly of course,” Gabe added with a chuckle. “Of course we encounter problems like any other group of people living together. Maybe one of us forgets to clear the dishes, maybe one bails on cleaning the house, or hogs the bathroom too long … But we will voice out all these concerns in a neutral, rational, calm, and loving manner. We pride ourselves for striving to have the best communication possible with each other.”  They also frequently schedule group dates and celebrate every milestone in their joint relationships. Group hugs, cuddles, and massages are common in the household.  People outside the polyamory lifestyle might associate all this with debauchery, hedonism, and recklessness, but according to them, polyamory relationships can offer a more structured flexibility and diverse life experiences as compared to traditional relationships. This lifestyle requires a commitment to honesty, ethics and mindfulness to maintain.  The last room in the unit was the “play room”. At first glance, it seemed like a normal bedroom with a queen-sized bed. However, a curtain on one side of the room opened to a big wardrobe filled with all sorts of sex toys, tools, ropes and costumes. Toys and paraphernalia can be cost-prohibitive in Singapore and many find themselves unable to have a firsthand experience at retail outlets or online. The 360 Experience presents an opportunity for singles and couples to explore different things that they may like.  I was genuinely impressed by what I learned from the two couples that day. It sounded to me that spaces like The 360 Experience need to be more common and accessible. We all sorely need access to better education regarding love, sex and intimacy. We want answers, opinions and insights to discuss things that we repress or are deemed taboo, and a non-judgmental safe space to discuss and explore.  It is always a constant challenge for the four of them to keep the space financially sustainable, as they are not marketing or scaling their events for large profits. They consider the commune a non-profit; a passion project. Moving forward, they hope that their network and community members can grow organically and contribute to the longevity of their passion, purpose, and mission.  They are envisioning a fully fledged co-living and educational space in the future, equipped with an F&B space that is open to the public. They hope they can eventually run this space full time.  “Fingers crossed that we will be able to spread our philosophy and help many couples in Singapore become more authentic with themselves and each other,” Dee concluded with a hopeful smile.  The 360 Experience is available on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram at @th360exp.

42,"We Took A 12 KM Walk To The Industrial Heartlands Of Tuas, Because Phase 2(HA)",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-travel-a-12-km-walk-to-tuas-phase-2ha/,"Culture, Life, Travel","All photography by the author for RICE Media. A month ago, before Singapore went into ‘heightened alert’, I hit upon the idea of walking to Tuas on foot, following the 2009 heritage trail from Pioneer MRT to Tuas Link station. The journey is 12-kilometres long and takes roughly two and a half hours. If I set out in the afternoon, I’d reach my destination just in time to catch the ‘best sunset in Singapore’ at Raffles Marina. Why was I doing this? Well, with gyms being shut down, and massive queues forming in nature, I felt like I was slowly suffocating here in Singapore. The second reason for walking to Tuas was morbid curiosity. As an outsider, a lot of what I thought I knew about Singapore have turned out to be half- truths. There’s a gap between the clean-cut image that Singapore projects to the world and the often harsh realities that are hidden within its borders. With tensions rising in this pandemic, more locals are starting to notice this rift as well. To this end, I wanted to head west to see Singapore’s industrial heartlands for myself. I wanted to follow the paths and viaducts of the ‘real’ economy that most Singaporeans choose to ignore, on their way to their air-conditioned offices in the CBD. In short, I wanted to test the firmness of Singapore’s foundations with my own two feet. I. The Heat  It is unconscionably hot in early May. Not just your garden-variety tropical heat, but the kind of heat that really saps  willpower and raises tempers. It’s the kind of hot that makes you want to question everything.   In the ensuing days, I make several half-hearted attempts to begin my walk to Tuas, only to be turned back, first by the suffocating humidity, then by a sudden thunderstorm, which, turned the air into even more of a sauna instead of cooling things down. This is the type of climate that can really draw out the crazies: Beow Tan. The Pasir Ris Man. Bruce Lee and the Karate Kid. In Ang Mo Kio, cats are being found with slash wounds on their bodies.  But even as I condemn these violent acts, I’d be lying to say that I don’t recognise the anger.  A five-minute walk to my neighbourhood kopitiam is enough to leave me short-tempered and drenched in sweat. Despite being an early advocate of facemasks, I feel an urge to declare myself sovereign and join the anti-mask movement.  Eventually, I start to let my guard down and wear my mask beneath my nose.  In this climate of uncertainty, it’s a small and feeble attempt to take back control.  “This is the kind of weather that makes me want to hurt somebody,” I tell my wife.  II. The Road  I finally set out towards Tuas on a Wednesday—just two days before Phase 2 (HA).  To maximize my shade, the plan is to follow the MRT viaduct from Pioneer station all the way to the Johor Strait, before rounding the corner to Tuas Link and Raffles Marina.  Beyond the residential HDBs of Pioneer, the road widens, as do the number of trucks barreling towards the expressway. The noise of traffic is deafening, making it hard for me to find my bearings. Even behind my face mask, my lungs are filled with the smell of burnt rubber and car exhaust. It takes just fifteen minutes before I’m dripping with sweat.  Enroute, I make a quick pit-stop at a Chinese restaurant that’s frequented by the PRC community, just south of Pioneer Road. I’m there to inquire about a whole roasted goat on their menu. “Was this goat born and raised in Singapore?” I ask the restaurant owner’s wife.  She shakes her head. “No, the goat isn’t Singaporean. It had to be imported from Malaysia.”  Disappointed, I move on, all the while lamenting the fact that the Singaporean goat is slowly being replaced by foreigners.  By the time I reach Joo Koon station it’s almost the end of the work day. Outside the NTUC Fairprice hub, workers huddle outside the entrance smoking cigarettes. They all have different coloured uniforms on, some in blue, some in yellow, some in white, but all of them wear the same blank and exhausted looks on their faces.  Poor bastards. A storm is coming and they don’t even know it.  III. The Workers Turning off the main road, I get lost somewhere in a quiet industrial estate in Gul Circle, caught within a labyrinth of factories and migrant worker dormitories. At a deserted traffic light, an auntie behind the wheel of a Toyota honks at me. She puts up both hands, in the universal body language of ‘boy, what the hell do you think you’re doing?’ I’m beginning to ask myself the same question. What am I doing here? Because none of what I’m seeing makes sense to me. My sheltered scholarly ass has absolutely no frame of reference for the industrial parks and construction and engineering firms that I walk past. I watch blankly as containers get loaded and unloaded onto trucks, and stare at the bales of packaged goods stacked up towards the warehouse ceilings—without really understanding anything.  Everything feels alien. Detached.  I walk past the enclosures of factory workers. They’re all sitting behind chain-link fences, on makeshift benches and picnic tables. Some are on their phones, others are having dinner. This has been their life for the better part of the year, their movements heavily restricted, even as the rest of Singapore has moved from Circuit Breaker to Phase 2.  As some of them stare back at me with equally blank expressions, I realise I don’t know anything about these people. Their lives are so removed from mine that I can’t even imagine myself in their shoes.  On the main road, I see plenty of lorries transporting migrant workers in the rear decks like cattle. Some are smaller and can fit 8-10 men. Others are spacious enough to carry dozens. Last month, two workers died and over a dozen were hospitalised in two separate lorry accidents. Apparently, that’s just the cost of doing business here.   While a vocal minority of Singaporeans might make a fuss about seat belts and safety standards, others will say that these are ‘unfortunate incidents’ that can’t be helped. The drivers should’ve been more careful. A few weeks later, the construction firms will beg for more workers to replace them, and Singaporeans will wait impatiently for their BTOs to finish construction.   For all its reputation for order and efficiency, this is the practical side to Singapore that gives me  pause. It encourages zero-sum games, where your loss is my gain, and the price of human dignity must be ‘carefully balanced’ against a construction company’s profit-loss statement.  Perhaps we can rationalise this because most of these workers are foreigners. The ballasts that Singapore shed in a storm. And even as they build our homes and pave our roads, they exist outside the social contract that Singaporeans have signed up for.  But when I walk past the chain-linked fences towards Tuas and see the Chinese and Indian workers sitting behind them, I can’t tell who’s a local and who’s a foreigner. Who’s a PR and who’s a citizen.  Do these distinctions even matter when they’re all stuck in brutal, race-to-the-bottom jobs in the forgotten corners of this city?  IV. The Marina   By 7 PM, I manage to round Tuas Crescent. From here, it’s a straight shot all the way to Tuas Link station. Despite my best efforts to make good time, I know I’m not going to make the sunset at Raffles Marina. I can see the light dwindling in the distance; no matter how fast I walk, it’ll be too late. But that’s okay.  Sometimes life just works out that way.  At the westernmost edge of Pioneer Road, solitary migrant workers lounge under the MRT shade on blankets. I can’t tell whether they’re praying or resting. Only later do I realise that it was Eid al-Fitr that evening, the final day of Ramadan. The workers had been sitting there watching the sunset, far from family and home.  I reach Raffles Marina and scan my TraceTogether token at security. My face is hot and sweaty and I barely manage to clear the temperature check.  Feet blistering, I limp past a Mercedes Benz as it’s pulling out of the parking lot. I poke my head in for a moment into the grand lobby of the Raffles Marina Club. In my sweat-drenched state, the air-conditioning is almost too overpowering. So I retreat via a side path towards the pier. At the pier, a French man playfully slaps the ass of his partner as they walk towards the Marina Bistro, their swimsuits glistening in the dusk. There’s a lightness to the air that stands in harsh contrast to the industrial scenes I just witnessed.  Growing up around the rich in an international school, I’ve noticed that there’s a specific kind of distance  the rich can create between the world and themselves. It’s a distance that can only be achieved with money.  Sooner or later, you start to believe that your problems are the only ones that matter. The only ones that exist. A cocoon of comfort numbs your senses and dulls your capacity to feel anything. Everything comes too easy. You know all the rules and just go through the motions.  Sometimes, this is the way I feel about Singaporeans.  Whose song was it anyway? The ‘Singapore’ vs. ‘Indian’ variant. Never have I seen so much being made of so very little.  When you zoom out even further beyond this city’s borders, and consider the hospital beds and ICU units being overrun and families not able to say their last goodbyes to their loved ones, it can make some of the outbursts I hear from Singaporeans sound spoiled and coddled.  I reach the end of my walk at Raffles Lighthouse with its selfie-taking locals, and I take a seat by the water’s edge to catch my breath. Malaysia lies over the bridge in the darkness. Over 6,000 cases per day. The half-finished condo developments in the distance are as dark as the jungle that surrounds them.  Everything looks all but abandoned.  V. The East-West Line  From Raffles Marina, I slowly trudge back to Tuas Link station, and board a train back towards the CBD.  Both Asian and Western cultures have this romantic idea of the mythical, unexplored West, whether it’s the Monkey King in search of enlightenment, or cowboys and Indians in America’s westward expansion.  But what if there is no epiphany?  What if, by attempting to replace my pandemic fatigue with a physical one, I got no closer to true empathy or understanding? What if, in the end, there are some things that I won’t ever be sure of and can never fully control?  At Tuas Crescent station, a group of migrant workers board the train and sit down in the seats next to me. We are all squeezed together, shoulder to shoulder. Too close for comfort. I get up from my seat and move towards the door. While I’d like to think that it’s not racism that makes me do this, I honestly can’t say for sure. I doubt Singaporeans can either.  Covid and job losses have created a pressure cooker, where all plans have been disrupted and all lines have blurred. And we’re suffocating, just looking for someone to blame.  On the East-West Line, the train doors open. The night settles in.  I look up from the latest Covid numbers only to find myself right back where I started.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co.

43,"Who Decides Where Home Is? After 17 Years, A Long Time Immigrant Reflects on Leaving Singapore",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-after-17-years-a-long-time-immigrant-reflects-on-leaving-singapore/,"Culture, People","Photography by Thaddeus J Loh.  As a child, Maria “Masha” Isaeva was plagued with skin rashes. They were so bad her skin would become flakey, red, and itchy to the point that she couldn’t sleep. Her doctors told her she couldn’t eat anything but potatoes—anything else would cause an allergic reaction. By the time she was 12, she was so underweight that her apartment elevator wouldn’t detect her presence when she was alone in the lift, making her unable to travel in it.  Desperate for a resolution, her mother booked them a flight from Vladivostok, their hometown, to Singapore, where Masha’s Japanese stepfather was residing (she refers to him as her Otousan, which means father).  Soon, with the help of Singaporean doctors and the tropical climate, her body changed. The red rashes on her skin started fading away, and she was allowed to eat an assortment of food for the first time—like strawberries, chocolate, and anything containing milk. She would rarely ever get flare-ups again—until recently. Red patches have reappeared on her skin. The cause? The stress of moving from Singapore in a matter of days. After 17 years, Masha’s visa is still tied to her employment. And when most of the foreigners in her company were trimmed, she decided to leave—following the exodus of almost 200,000 other foreigners who left in 2020 alone.  10 days To Go (From Masha’s Diary) I have made a list in a day of who I can meet for the last time in my last 10 days in Singapore. It’s funny having to squeeze years of memories with people into hourly interactions. 21 May 2021 Living in Pasir Ris, Masha was assigned to Loyang Primary School from MOE, where she attended before moving on to Greenview Secondary. Integration in school was not easy at first—between the language barrier and looking obviously foreign, she was often excluded. While she soon managed to make close friendships, it was her teachers who never warmed up to her. Soon after joining, Masha tried to join the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) as a CCA. She joined because she “likes discipline,” and because it was a good opportunity to learn Malay. But when it was time for all the enrolled students to collect their uniforms, Masha’s was the only one not there. Instead of picking up the attire, she was taken into a room where she was interrogated. “They asked me, a 12-year-old, what my intentions were with joining NPCC,” she recalled. “They asked me if I intended to send my uniform abroad, and they asked me to promise not to export it.” The conversation ended with an agreement that her uniform would be ordered in, but by National Day, it was still nowhere to be seen. “Just march without a uniform,” they told her. Unsettled, Masha dropped out.  “I told them I wasn’t going to go forth with marching on the day itself as the only person without the uniform, it’s embarrassing.” Over her 17 years here, the system has reminded Masha time and time again that she is a foreigner. Often, when flying back from abroad when travelling, she would get questioned by authorities. “You’re too young to be working here alone, we need to check your documents,” officers would tell her. Similar to Masha, I have heard from many Russian women that they are often questioned about being escorts or prostitutes in airports across the globe.  Now again she is reminded of her standing, as she waits for the result of her 10th PR application—the previous nine of which were rejected. 9 Days   Time has a very powerful way of filtering out chaos The noise of people you thought saw you are now silent The people whose intentions had been a grey area have a fixed colour palette now. This day will become a blur too, and moving will allow me to see things from a broader perspective, from a lens of a person who is not weighed down by a giant adolescent diaper. Those who do not become a blur, will be immortalised Are there more reasons to leave than to stay now?   22 May 2021 The last time I saw Masha before this interview was over a year ago. She told me how when we last met, I asked her a question that has remained etched in her mind ever since.  What keeps you here? When we met again, she knew the answer, one she had thought about continuously. It’s the relationships with people.  “My first love happened here. My first graduation and job too,” she said. “I watched my boyfriend go through NS while I got my diploma. I went to the funerals of my friend’s mothers. My own mother’s church friends became my second family when she left.” “Over time, my friends have become my everything here. When I’m sick, they are the ones who send porridge to my house and bring me groceries.” While heartwarming to hear, all of that is not recognised on paper. But while her documents say she is an immigrant, it takes barely more than 10 minutes with her to realise she is far from one. Her accent sways from intense Singlish to generic English. If you talk to her about her career as an Art Director, she can easily go on about the plans she had for Singapore’s creative community. These were so consolidated she even applied for PR via a National Arts Council scheme that rewards talents who intend to make long-term contributions to the local scene—but this attempt also failed.  6 Days   What am I feeling now? The word for this sits between the pages of a foreign vocabulary I am yet to discover. Like when you visit a new place for the first time, and you experience loss, disorientation and floatiness for the first couple of days Places I used to frequent as a student, the parks where we would have family BBQs or the traffic lights I would cross for daily business lunches  have become unfamiliar. It’s very uncanny.  I feel like my mind has already detached itself from this town while my body has not. My mind is floating somewhere, I will find out soon when I land.   25 May So where are you from? I asked Masha. “I’m a citizen of the world!” she laughs with a grin on her face. “Say that.” The second time I asked, she said she only knows that Singapore is home. “I feel the most stable here. I feel like I belong but literally, I don’t. I thought about that over Hari Raya. My childhood friends invite me to their homes every year. I’ve seen their siblings grow up and their parents grow old, but unlike them, I don’t know if i’ll be there next year.” While these memories float around vividly in Masha’s mind, they only exist there. There’s no tangible proof of them being there—and she knows it. “I’m not investing in and buying property, and I’m not in cancer research or finance,” she said. “And I really like that the government is putting locals first. Every country should do that.” But why is Masha not a local? She will never know—PR application rejections don’t come with reasoning.  Singapore has a relatively high number of foreigners living in the country, but what kind of immigrants are preferred remains unknown. On one hand, there are immigrants like Masha who are essentially locals—their relationships and lifestyle are built side by side with their Singaporean peers.  Then there are immigrants who come in with job expertise or financial prowess—your researchers, finance moguls, and shipbrokers, among many others. Naturally, the government may prefer these individuals for the knowledge and experience they bring with them.  But the same week that Masha leaves, Bloomberg announces that Singapore is the new preferred destination for the region’s ultra-rich and their families. This contrast begs one question: what will the future of integration between foreigners and locals look like? What happens when deeply rooted foreigners are forced out, but schemes like the Global Investors Program give the ultra-rich a fast track to gaining Permanent Residency (PR)? It is only understandable that the government would want to attract investment and talent to the country, but to what extent can these immigrants integrate into society? Last year, a survey found that more than 6 in 10 Singaporeans felt that foreigners were not doing enough to integrate. But as the Bloomberg article highlights, the newly settled rich are currently scrambling for luxury property, sports cars, and golf club memberships—is this where bonds with everyday Singaporeans are fostered? They would need to go far beyond their comfort zones if they intend to integrate into Singapore society.  For Masha, someone who has been through the same system as the average Singaporean kid, these headlines could be a source of resentment. But Masha says she is leaving with a free heart. “I’m not angry or sad, I’m just at a state where I’m trying to draw conclusions. After having been through so much here, there’s so much emotional baggage to sort through.” 5 days The most interesting part of my journey will start when I leave Singapore People will want to know where I come from, about my childhood, and why I’m not living there anymore after 17 years When you’re done chewing your gum, do you spit it out? 26 May 2021 Recently I interviewed Jane, a Singaporean woman who left her insurance career, car, condo, and marriage to live a digital nomad life in Europe. One of the biggest realisations she had was that all her old dreams and aspirations were in fact not hers, but those absorbed from the society around her.  When she came to visit Singapore after a year, the joy of seeing her old family and friends was trumped by sadness, a sense of feeling out of place.  “I love Singapore, and I love my country, but if I can’t feel at home there, then where can I feel at home? I felt sad because I knew I would no longer be able to fit in,” Jane said.  When I asked Masha what the scariest part of leaving was, she said something similar. It wasn’t leaving behind people or memories, as these can always be revisited. The scariest part was leaving behind a mindset, a way of living life she may soon outgrow. You can come back to people, but you can’t revisit a life you have evolved from. “I know once I’m out of this bubble my life will change 360,” she stipulated. “After seeing more of what life has to offer, I may not want to return, and I’m afraid of that feeling.” “That part is scary because that means I’ll have to put this huge chunk of my life—17 years—behind for good.” And how will Masha explain those years to new people she will meet? How do you explain to someone that you are Russian, but you feel more Singaporean, even though you can’t legally call yourself that, or live there? Until this day, her sense of identity has been heavily tied to being in Singapore physically. But once she steps foot on that plane, 17 years of life will have only existed in her memories and of those around her. How does one reconcile that? 2 Days “Why today so tired?” said Aunty Winnie from Cheers, who probably knows more about my everyday than the person next to me at work Aunty Winnie works at West Coast Plaza Cheers. When she found out I was leaving, she said “can give me something from Russia one? Souvenir?”  I told her I don’t have anything from Russia as I grew up here, but I will try to think of something “Never mind just pass me something before you leave”  I didn’t manage to catch her as she was off shift, so I passed her a letter and handmade bracelet through a colleague “Hey i know you r leaving Singapore this week, i’m so exhausted, can I just send courier to pass me back the powerbank?” A text from my ex-colleague and friend who’s known me for 5 years. He was like a brother to me   28 May 2021 How have you been impacted by the pandemic? Tell us at community@ricemedia.co.

44,One Millennial Smashes Stereotypes In Her Quest to Save Disappearing Chinese Traditions,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-one-millennial-smashes-stereotypes-quest-save-disappearing-chinese-traditions/,"Culture, Events","Photography by Thaddeus Loh / RICE Media.  “Wow.” My jaw dropped open as I let my inquisitive eyes wander around … As I moved slowly through the space, I could not help but let my fingers touch the furniture as a sense of warmth swept through my body … I caught sight of my own reflection in the mirror. The opposite facing mirrors formed an infinitely smaller me in every reflection, as if revealing how minute one is in the universe. The black-and-white portraits hung on the walls smiled upon me, as if reassuring that no matter how small or misunderstood one was, one has a role to play and contribute.” Everyone has a defining moment in their life and, for heritage researcher Lynn Wong, this was one of those. Her short story—aptly entitled My Second Home—recounts the first time she visited a clan association at the age of 15. “I was there to learn kung fu and lion dance,” says Lynn, a fan of Wong Fei-hung and traditional martial arts since young. “But it opened my eyes to a whole new world.” The trip, you see, had been nothing short of an epiphany: “Before that, I was only able to learn about history through social studies and TV shows. Entering the clan however felt like entering a time capsule undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of modern Singapore.” The thunderstruck teenager began spending more and more time at the clan. In her story, she recalls a strained late-night encounter with her mother after one such incident: ““一个女生为什么要练到这么晚才回家?” (“Why does a girl have to train till so late?”) “I heard my mum’s disapproving voice as I unlocked the house door. I looked up at the wall clock while avoiding my mum’s intense gaze. It was already past midnight. “Because I’m not Cinderella,” I joked in an attempt to ease the tension. She was certainly not pleased with my reply … Growing up in a traditional Chinese family, coming home late was considered unacceptable for a girl, especially when the reason was training in martial arts late into the night at a clan association—a place stereotypically male-dominated and some say associated with secret societies.” Lynn had fallen in love without realising it. But unlike other childhood infatuations that are fickle and fleeting, this one would lead her to exciting new discoveries. Fast forward 17 years later to a typical weekday morning at the Kwong Wai Siew Lee Clan Association. All was quiet, except for the clicking of a camera shutter. Now 32-years-old, Lynn—who’s lost none of her youthful chutzpah—is busy capturing the clan’s sombre exterior with her camera. It is one of the handful of clans in the vibrant enclave of Ann Siang Road that have survived the onslaught of time. Clad in a cheongsam, Lynn is modern-day heroine, armed with more than just a clunky DSLR. She also possesses a psychology and business degree from NUS, several trophies in traditional Chinese martial arts, and a life mission. Only five years ago and with her parent’s full support, Lynn gave up her PhD at INSEAD to be a full-time champion of Chinese culture and heritage. She now holds a leadership position in five clan associations—including Kong Chow Wui Koon—and is in a race against time to document Singapore’s remaining clans before they disappear forever. For the uninitiated, clans once served as “embassies” for newly arrived immigrants from China, offering networking and commercial opportunities as well as lifelong friendships to those who have travelled far from home. Now stripped off of their original purpose, many clans are struggling to remain relevant. Lynn, however, believes they are more important than ever. “These clans existed to serve our forefathers,” she said. “They’ve touched lives and they’ve helped in nation building. I believe it’s our responsibility to preserve them, because they remind us of the struggle it took to get to where we are today.” Not many Singaporeans share her sentimentality. Of the 500 or more clans that were established in the country, only about 200 have remained, according to Lynn. “People often ask why is there a need to preserve so many clans. Why can’t there be an umbrella clan instead?” she says. “That’s because we’ll be losing a lot of diversity … China is so big, and each of these places have their own produce, festivals and language. Canton alone has at least 16 distinct districts.” These days, Lynn is all about damage control (“I thought I could revive some of these clans but I now realise how naive I was.”). She goes traipsing around the city salvaging mementos—badges, old photographs, even ancestral veneration scriptures—of soon-to-be shuttered clans. Recalling these incidents makes her grimace: “When I was at one of the clans, I spotted some old manuscripts in a trash bag. It turns out they were account ledgers from the Qing Dynasty! But the worst part was that the people who threw them away had no idea how precious they were.” “This is just the tip of the iceberg. So much is being lost every day,” she says, sighing. Of course, there are also intangible items like clan recipes and festivals that need to be recorded. Lynn whips out a photo album filled with fast-disappearing specialties like the Guo Zeng Zong, a type of pillow-shaped glutinous rice dumpling from the Song Dynasty, and the Mandarin Peel Duck, a duck-based dish featuring a golden broth, made from boiling the peel of mandarin oranges aged for 30 years. “It’s from Xinhui and was a tribute item for the empress dowager,” she says, referring to the latter. “The mandarin peel from there can be as valuable as gold depending on how many years it is aged. Unfortunately, the man who has helped me recreate the dish has passed away.” Lynn has compiled these recipes for Ho Yeah!, a Cantonese and Hakka food and culture festival she organised back in 2018. One of her biggest endeavours yet, it’s a subtle and clever approach to attracting the public’s attention, since food is a common denominator for Singaporeans. The next Ho Yeah! Festival—along with other heritage-related events and exhibitions she organized—was supposed to happen last year, but that was before a virus tore through the earth, leaving a trail of wrecked plans in its wake. It is now mid-afternoon but the Lee clan has received few visitors apart from the steady trickle of customers visiting the TCM clinic that’s discreetly set up in the back of the building. Many clans now survive by renting out available space, and this 147-year-old association is no different—apart from the TCM clinic, it also collects rental fees from an interior design firm occupying its upper floors. The clan’s main hallway—which is redolent of 1960s Singapore, with its mosaic floor, antique furnishings and Chinese lanterns—now doubles up as a waiting area for the clinic’s patients. Its walls are mostly adorned with framed monochrome portraits of men and women—portraits that Lynn helped to painstakingly restore—and the occasional Chinese poetry scroll. Among these, a photo of the late Lee Dai Soh hangs, his bespectacled face looking placidly upon those who may or may not recognise him as the legendary Cantonese storyteller at Rediffusion. Lynn is the only source of energy in this place—she’s now speaking with gusto whilst fiddling with her camera, oblivious to the inquisitive stares of the elderly patients. “Even though things have been done a certain way for so long, I think many clans now realise they need to change with the times in order to stay afloat,” she says. Sitting across from Lynn is one by-product of these changes. Madam Lee Swee Har, however, seems to be unruffled by the fact that she’s made clan history by becoming the association’s first chairperson three years ago. Things were very different when the 79-year-old was first introduced to the clan by her father at the age of 14. “The clan leaders were always male before this, but it wasn’t something I ever pondered over,” says the highly accomplished singer and chef in her native Cantonese. “There were more than a thousand of us, and we were all like brothers and sisters. We usually played music and sang when we got together, and also occasionally performed for the radio.” Lynn, on the other hand, isn’t impervious to this breakthrough: “Clans were once patriarchal, but I think there’s a trend towards equality. When I first joined the lion dance troupe in a clan, there was only one other female. It was even taboo for females to touch a lion’s head if it was new.” Today, membership numbers at the Lee Clan have plummeted to just above a hundred—its one and only youth member is in his 40s. It used to be that one needed to have the surname Lee and hail from one of three districts in China (Guangzhou, Huizhou or Zhaoqing) to be able to register, but since the clan’s very survival hinges on fresh blood, regulations have relaxed over the years. While Lynn herself isn’t a member, she is helping Madam Lee with a few events in conjunction with the Singapore Heritage Festival (most of these events are now cancelled due to the heightened COVID-19 restrictions). The pair first met back in 2017 while Madam Lee was giving a talk at the clan. “Lynn has done a lot for us,” says Madam Lee. “I think it’s really admirable to be doing what she’s doing in a capitalistic world. She’s not motivated by money. We need more people like her.” Beaming at the compliments, Lynn remarks: “It’s not that younger Singaporeans don’t care, it’s because they aren’t aware of all the things they could lose once these places are gone. I think we can all start by asking our family and relatives questions about our own ancestors – their name and where they come from before settling in Singapore. That way, it’s easier to find the clan you belong to. Lynn’s own story has come full circle recently, after she discovered the identity of her own great-grandfather in a clan register. “I never knew what he looked like until the day I saw his picture. I always thought I was a third generation Singaporean Chinese, but it turns out we’ve been here for longer.” Join Lynn Wong in a virtual talk entitled ‘My Journey as a Millennial Growing Up in Clan Associations’ on May 29, 10am.

45,"Ten Windows, Ten Perspectives on Phase 2",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-ten-windows-ten-perspectives-on-phase-2/,"Culture, Life","All images contributed by interviewees, with direction from RICE’s photo department. Responses have been edited for length and clarity. Over the last week, my colleague Zachary and I reached out to ten people all around Singapore, from all walks of life. We asked them to share a view from a window they spend a lot of time looking out of, and what’s been on their mind since Phase 2 (HA) kicked in. Had their routines changed? How would they describe their mood at this time?  Now that we’ve mostly moved our lives indoors, how do they feel when they look outside? The responses we got were thoughtful, conflicted, immediately relatable. Some talked about their anxieties; others shared what they’d been doing to pass the time. Often, they were as much about looking inward, or wondering what lies ahead, as looking out. (Many, too, alluded to the difference between looking and really seeing—being present, “standing still and learning to be astonished.”) Put together, we hope they bring a shared experience into view, and—in some small way—soothe your ache for the world outside by glimpsing it through someone else’s eyes. It’s amazing how quickly children learn things. One of the first ‘big’ words my son learnt was “coronavirus” (sadly enough). Unfortunately, they’ve also quickly learnt that this same coronavirus has a tangible impact on their daily lives.  Before Covid, we led quite active lives as a family with young children. We’d go swimming, visit the park, go for picnics and plane-spotting. Now they’re mostly cooped up at home, but they’ve been surprisingly sanguine about it, choosing instead to make even more of a mess in the house than usual. They’re quite happy to spend their time rearranging their bookshelves and taking apart their toys.  They’ve even learnt to say, “We need to stay at home, because of the coronavirus!” My husband and I, as parents, are the ones who feel as though their development is somehow being stalled and their enjoyment limited. Maybe we’re overthinking things, but when we had our children, we didn’t foresee that we’d be spending so much time at home with them, instead of being out and about. Before Covid, I was already wondering how I would guide my children in a world that was becoming unfamiliar to an old fogey like me. Covid will transform that world even further. Will we as parents be able to provide the necessary guidance? Will we be able to keep up? Such thoughts keep me up at night, sometimes. — Raaha is a freelance writer and editor who used to work in education. She took this photo a while back at her parents’ home in Bukit Batok. While it’s no longer her usual view, “I spent most of my youth growing up in that house. And my children spend a lot of time there as well, so it’s a view they are growing up with too.” This is my view on the way to work, usually in a Grab or some other form of ride-share as I don’t have my own car. Ironically, I enjoy these rides the most when the roads are empty, but that usually means the COVID situation is getting more severe. While I’ve gotten used to things like mask-wearing, the increased social restrictions are pretty frustrating. Most of my social circle is made up of other doctors working in different healthcare institutions, and because we’re discouraged from intermingling too much (to avoid a potential spread of the virus across hospitals), I haven’t seen a lot of my closest friends in person for months. It’s also very frustrating hearing about the cases of discrimination against healthcare workers, some of which have happened directly to my friends. I understand that the public is probably wary that we might be carriers, given the high-risk nature of our work, but it’s still disheartening to be ostracised when all we are trying to do is to get to work and deal with this ever-evolving series of events. Claps for support don’t mean anything when your actions suggest otherwise. — Shi Hui* is a doctor in a public tertiary hospital. Although she misses the fitness classes she used to go to to relax, she’s grateful for Netflix and her cat. Circuit breaker last year and this year are quite different. This year we [migrant workers] can still work, so it’s better in a sense. But because things were slowly going back to normal, I thought I could go home to visit my family. In January or February, I told them I’d come home in April. Then in April cases started to appear again, so I said change to August. Now it might be end of year, who knows. I need to make sure I can come back to Singapore as I’m the sole breadwinner, so if I get stuck in Bangladesh, my whole family will be in trouble. But it’s been hard to get them to understand. I’ve been busy studying for a diploma and taking courses for work. A few weeks ago, I bought Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons For The 21st Century from Kinokuniya. I’ve only just started, and it’ll take me a while to read it, so maybe Phase 2 will be over by the time I’ve finished. — Fazley Elahi Rubel is a migrant worker and advocate from Bangladesh. This is the view from outside his room, with his worksite in the background (he lives on site). I haven’t thought much about being stuck in quarantine, because I’ve just tried to get on with it. I’ve kept to a routine, and it’s kept me afloat.  In the mornings, I wake up, have breakfast, make the bed, shower, and get dressed. I never stay in a robe or pyjamas; I don’t even get back in bed till after work. But I try to spend as much time away from my screen as I can, so after work ends, I’ll stay on the balcony and listen to a podcast while looking at the view. Right now, it’s this one my friend’s friend made called Sentimental Garbage.  The balcony is the best thing about this room, because I’m one of those people that really loves sunshine and fresh air. I was so lucky to get it because I had this dread on the plane that I was gonna get the worst hotel, like, without a window even. When I got here, I was so happy, I was practically jumping up and down.  — Javid recently flew back from the UK to visit his family. When we spoke, he was on Day 19 of his 21-day quarantine. He had originally expected to spend 14 days in the hotel, but found out on Day 3 that it was going to be extended. Compared to a couple months ago, I’m definitely more worn out and resigned. It’s partially because a good part of my artistic practice involves performance-making. These last few months, it felt like live performances were slowly becoming possible again, so the sudden curbs hurt. They’re also a keen reminder that the timeline is not as linear as it has felt so far in Singapore, meaning the possibility of delay, cycles, repetition, going back and forth. It’s getting increasingly painful to contain my desire to move and perform. Some days, I struggle to write anything that feels meaningful. There is also an exhaustion that has endured though, somewhat independently of the changes in Singapore. Palestine, Myanmar, and India have all been on my mind lately. It stems from the helplessness of seeing not just the pandemic but also waves of political violence sweep up so many parts of the world. This exhaustion feels very palpable amongst my peers, a shared and growing grief. I tend to look out of my bedroom window throughout the day, but especially first thing in the morning, at sunset, and whenever it rains, which I love. I live on a fairly high floor, though, so I mostly look at the sky. I like the simplicity of this perspective. It helps me focus on things like how the clouds shift, especially when most of the time, I’m just busy learning how to live.  — Kia Yee writes poetry, reads books, and makes performances. Lately, she has also been playing Stardew Valley and spending time on Quanmin, a karaoke app. The hair salon I work in has coloured film sheets over the window and balcony doors, so it changes with the sun. During the day it’s green. At nighttime, it’s more pink. After work ends, around 9:00 PM, I sometimes come out here and have a smoke to relax. You can see the Pinnacle at Duxton and the Outram Park area from here.  It’s not so bad compared to last year, when we couldn’t open the salon. That was quite terrible. But I hope I can see my family soon. It was my mum’s 60th birthday last month and I had to miss that. We’re quite close because my parents divorced when I was 15. I did a video call with my family and my sister helped me buy a present for my mum, but I still have to pay her back for that.  — Tomoya, a hairdresser, is from Kanagawa, Japan. He moved to Singapore about four years ago. This is my bedroom window, which I tend to look out of throughout the day. The view makes me feel calm and happy. The block opposite my place is this beautiful teal and turquoise ombre, a bit like kueh salat. I also check that my plants are getting enough sunlight. I keep them in the corner near the window, and looking after them gives me a chance to unwind from how busy I usually am.  I’m quite grateful for this semi-lockdown because it forces me to take a break. I love my job, and I’m lucky that it both pays me decently and is stable enough that I don’t have to worry about losing it any time soon. And at least I still get to see a few friends for any emotional support I might need during this month. — Leticia is a teacher in an international school working with children with learning differences. She also runs a small craft business on the side, enjoys rock-climbing and long boarding, and collects tropical plants. My routine hasn’t changed much since Phase 2. I still wake up at 5:45 AM, wash up, catch the train from my flat in Punggol. The food court’s in Ubi so it takes about an hour to reach. I get there around 7:00 AM and help prepare the food. Lunch is usually the busy hour, but it’s more empty now. I leave around 3 or 4:00pm, and when I get back I spend time with my two-year-old.  The difference is that things are much more stressful. Since Phase 2 started, sales have been around 50% of normal days, but I’m still paying full rental and salaries for now. Delivery platforms aren’t helping much because most of our customers are walk-in. Plus we just moved into this flat a year ago, so there’s the loan. My son. Our helper’s pay. This is the main thing on my mind at the moment. — Yiping, an F&B entrepreneur, runs three stalls selling cai fan, Korean and Japanese food, and bubble tea in a food court in Ubi.  Before the circuit breaker last year, I didn’t realize there was a yellow flame tree outside my window. I thought the flowers were a trick of light from the golden hour. The window is in my bedroom and next to my desk, which I tried to avoid; I couldn’t bring myself to write there. Instead, I spread a yoga mat on the floor, and did sun salutations and read novels with my feet propped up on my chair. When I could no longer avoid my desk, I shut the curtains to cull the daydreams.  On the last day of CB, my brain was blocked. Lockdown had muted my ability to create spontaneously. In frustration, I flung open the curtains and noticed the yellow flame tree in full bloom. Sprouts of ochre showered the canopy, as if they had always been there, urgent and wonderful. I got some words on the page that day. In Phase 2 (HA), I’ve chained myself to this desk by the window again. The tree is in a period of transition: the bark is brittle and the boughs are bare, but up top, there is a smattering of flowers hanging on for better days. The yellow flame is battered but hopeful; I am the same. Now, I keep the curtains open. — Zachary H is a writer with RICE. Lately, he has moved his languishing to parks. My routine hasn’t had any big changes in Phase 2. I’m still going for my morning walks. I usually wake up at 5 and catch the first train at 5:47, then go to places like MBS or the green corridor. Lately, I’ve been going to the Kallang Riverside area, because I really enjoy the morning peace. Most people around me are running or exercising, but if you see the auntie snapping away with her phone camera, that’s me. Walking is very healing. I love to look at beautiful things and when I walk, I don’t have to worry so much. I just focus on enjoying the beautiful things around me. I take photos of everything— buildings, sculptures, nature, insects, the sky. Most of the time, I like to look up, because even if you’re in the same spot, the colours and clouds will change. If I take a picture from my window every day, it looks different each time. I never seem to get bored. After I come back from my walks, I make lunch and go over my photos, which is like getting to enjoy the route all over again. Maybe I’ll watch TV or play games on my phone, cook dinner, and then the day is gone. I don’t know where the time gets to. Time passes faster now that I’m older. When you’re looking forward to something, time passes fast, when you’re waiting for a bus and you’re in a hurry. You want it to come faster. But when you’re on the bus and want to enjoy it, you want time to slow down.  — Bee Cheng, a retiree, started off documenting her photos on a private Instagram account, but made it public at her son’s urging. She has enjoyed photography for a long time, and jokes that digital cameras are the best invention ever.  What are you looking at or thinking about in Phase 2 (HA)? Tell us at community@ricemedia.co.

46,Here’s What a Bonsai Master Taught Us About Pandemic Fatigue,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-heres-bonsai-master-taught-us-pandemic-fatigue/,"Culture, Life","This article accompanies our video interview with Mr Boh Twang Keng, Bonsai Master in celebration of Vesak Day. All images by Feline Lim unless otherwise stated.  Boh’s Bonsai is a home-cum-nursery tucked away in Lengkok Mariam. Mr Boh, Singapore’s premiere bonsai master, tends to his creations with a devotion that is rooted in Buddhist traditions. His fingers are long and nimble, his gaze is patient and discerning. “In a few years, you will be beautiful,” he says to a fledgling bonsai; with brittle bark and sparse leaves, it looks fragile and fussy to me. But Mr Boh is in no hurry to write off this bonsai’s struggle. “A single bonsai, seen from the perspectives of different people, can evoke a completely different response.” My assessment of this bonsai as fussy differs from Mr Boh, who views its growing pains as the source of all goodness. “Buddhism has many complex teachings, which require stringent studying to nurture a good heart.”  At Boh’s Bonsai, life is fragile. Without Mr Boh’s attentive care, the finicky bonsai’s will quickly perish. Often, they perish anyway, even under his watchful eye. His measured nurturing is sometimes futile, but that doesn’t stop Mr Boh from refining his craft or taking the time. His grounded approach to the art of bonsai reflects a central tenet of Buddhism, and a lesson for us at this point in the pandemic: the practice of heedfulness, also known as appamada in sanskrit.  The Spirit of Vesak Day  Yesterday, Buddhist’s celebrated the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha. For those who aren’t familiar with the meaning of Vesak Day, here’s a brief explanation: In Singapore, the celebrations begin on the second full moon in May. Vesak Day is a reminder of the universal law that all compounded things must disintegrate.  There are a few rituals which embody this universal law: deliverance of heavenly offerings like joss sticks and fresh flowers, singing hymns, eating vegetarian food, and making special efforts to bring happiness to the unfortunate. On Vesak Day, acting mindfully and with intention is paramount.  Venerable Muhinda, a Malaysian Buddhist monk explained the intentionality of the rituals on Vesak Day as such: “When we train our minds to observe the functioning of mental and physical processes we realise the true nature of our lives. We see how it is subject to change and unsatisfactoriness.”   In Phase 2 (HA), Can We Benefit From Heedfulness?  As I mentioned earlier, the art of bonsai and Mr Boh’s patience with the craft is one example of the practice of heedfulness. It’s the art of paying attention, which is the antidote to complacency. Because life is fleeting, heedfulness implores one to imbue each interaction with meaning and substance, to be vigilant of the possibility in every moment.  The observation of one’s own mind is a powerful tool that transcends religion—you don’t have to become a buddhist to pay attention. If you have meditated, then you know what heedfulness feels like. Now that we’re stuck at home with idling minds, perhaps we can harness some heedfulness to muddle through.  Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu is an American Buddhist monk, most known for his translations of religious texts. If sitting down to meditate feels overwhelming to you in this moment, he reassures us that heedfulness can be practiced even in the moments where we might not think to be mindful at all.  “We tend to kill the little bits of time. For example, waiting in the doctor’s office, sitting at a red light, or taking a break from work. There’s a lot that can be done in those little bits of time. Too often we think of the practice as what we do when our eyes are closed. But practice is practice everywhere. You’ve got the same mind, the same qualities of mind, that you want to develop, simply in different circumstances.”  The Power of Discernment  In Buddhist teachings, intoxication is used as a metaphor to describe the trappings of the mind. According to this metaphor, desire, cravings, and anxiety are forms of intoxication which lead to suffering. Discernment is the heedful, grounding force which frees one from suffering and fuels the enlightened mind.  How can we put this into practice? In the moments at home when we’re feeling damn sian, perhaps we can bring some awareness to the detours that the mind takes in frustration and boredom. In mindfulness exercises, to calm racing thoughts, you acknowledge them first, then give permission for them to leave.  It’s impossible to have racing thoughts or feelings of boredom at Boh’s Bonsai. Mr Boh is self assured and calm. Having spent years refining his finicky craft, he has realised something that we can all benefit from even while we’re stuck at home: “I have the chance to live a quieter, slower life.”  Watch the video here.  Do you subscribe to a slow life, or the practice of heedfulness?

47,"Pandemic Reporting Fatigue, As Told To Us By A Mainstream Media Journalist",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-pandemic-reporting-fatigue-mainstream-journalist/,"Culture, People","All images RICE file photos. Earlier this month, my colleague Sophie wrote an article about being sian during this long-haul pandemic. It was a colloquial way to say that we are sick and fed up with the virus. The New York Times has given a more fanciful touch to this emotion: languishing.  I get it. We follow the news, track the daily cases, learn about Covidiots flouting safe distancing measures, and get demoralised that the nightmare doesn’t seem to be ending. This is the news cycle we have been used to for more than a year, and we are exhausted. But what about the folks behind the bylines of news reports you read? Most of us have the luxury of ignoring Covid-related news if we want to, but for journalists covering the pandemic, they don’t get to choose. It is their bread and butter. After more than a year since the pandemic started, Covid-reporting fatigue has become a real problem.  The thing about journalism is that we often do not write about the difficulties of the craft. We take challenges in our stride and guard them as secrets, rather than putting ourselves in the spotlight. Our job is to tell the stories of others. To be fair, healthcare workers who are fighting the virus get it worse than us. But journalists are fighting another kind of fire, and it can be draining too.  In light of Covid-reporting fatigue, the following account is written from the perspective of a journalist, and is based on actual events that were shared with us.  The journalist is from the mainstream media, which covers the bulk of Covid-related news. The story has been condensed and compiled from a longer interview, with edits for length and clarity. While we recognise that this is only one individual’s point of view, and may not reflect the situation in its entirety, or the views, experiences, and practices of other mainstream media outlets, I believe this account provides a valuable look into the fatigue experienced by those who bring us constant news of the pandemic.  I have lost count of the number of stories I have written about the darn virus. Maybe a few hundred, since the pandemic started last January.  At the start, my colleagues and I thought this whole affair would blow over in a few weeks or months—similar to SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] in 2003 which started in March that year and everything was done and dusted by July.  This is why when it came to the daily compilation of statistics, it used to be just one of us handling it. These days, since the pandemic will be a long-drawn fight, we rotate among ourselves so it is less tiring.  Actually, reporting the statistics isn’t too bad. Stats are just stats and I report as it is. It is tougher to analyse and present facts about the virus in the simplest way possible because this is something that even top scientists are still struggling to grapple with.  I tend to doubt myself when reporting on Covid-related news. It is difficult to process what the experts say and churn a story out quickly. Moreover, as a mainstream media reporter, I face huge pressure to deliver the news accurately, since readers are taking whatever I report on as the gospel truth. Very often, I feel unprepared and have a sense of impostor syndrome.  And because I report on Covid-19 all the time, relatives and friends see me as a pandemic prophet, as if I know what is going to happen next.  “Will there be a lockdown?” “When will Sinovac [a Covid-19 vaccine developed by China] going to be approved?” The truth is: I don’t know! As if things are not bad enough, the Covid-19 situation is evolving rapidly. I have to be on alert and constantly monitor developments, which means I am thinking about work all the time.  I can never switch off from work, as long as the pandemic rages on. My line of work—to chase and report on news—is already intense enough but at least there used to be lull periods when nothing big happened around Singapore. With the pandemic, it has been a sprint all the way. For most of you, the pandemic is stressful enough, especially when you read about tighter restrictions or a lockdown. Just reading the news is enough to distract you and sap your morale. People wouldn’t even want to think about work. Instead, they would think about taking care of themselves and their loved ones first.  But for a journalist like me, news like this means I have to work extra hard to cover the stories. When the nation is reeling and recovering, I am forced to continue running. It is tough to beat this whole Covid-19 reporting fatigue. These days, I try to avoid responding to work messages on my days off. However, I always feel guilty, thinking that I’m not working hard enough.  
I’m sick of reporting on Covid-19 too. But it can’t be helped. Just because we don’t read or report on it doesn’t mean the pandemic is not happening.
 I even tried to wriggle out of Covid-19 reporting by requesting for opportunities to cover other stories. But I understand that covering the pandemic is part of my job. Moreover, everyone in the newsroom is already stretched. If I don’t do it, who will? Covering the virus has gotten to me: besides being more short-tempered and angsty, there were also times when I had anxiety and depressive episodes. My mental health certainly took a toll.  To destress, I exercise daily and spend time with my loved ones and friends. I also avoid reading the news unless absolutely necessary.  I know you are sick of reading those pandemic-related news reports. I’m sick of reporting on Covid-19 too. But it can’t be helped. Just because we don’t read or report on it doesn’t mean the pandemic is not happening.  As journalists, we are responsible for reporting on events that are happening. Although we might be tired of news relating to Covid-19, we still have the responsibility to report on key developments. People will still want to know; a drop in the amount of information we put out will be worrying.  I feel that people out there need to understand why we cannot answer every query readers have or report on every single Covid-related issue. We are just really, really overwhelmed. Like everyone else, I’m also struggling through this pandemic. Just because we’re always reporting on the challenges others face doesn’t mean we don’t have challenges of our own. In this time of crisis, let’s be kind to one another. Perhaps you can think twice the next time before you send out that nasty comment online or email to the reporters. There is always someone behind that byline.  Tell us what you thought of this story at community@ricemedia.co. And if you haven’t already, follow RICE on Instagram, Spotify, Facebook, and Telegram.
